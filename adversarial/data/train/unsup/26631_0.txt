Check-in process was simple like any other hotel. During the Arizona summer, you definitely need an AC that will make the room cold as the Antarctic but their AC units don't seem to function that way. The lobby wasn't even cold and really didn't leave a good first impression. We had to change our room in order to get a working AC. At the second room, the TV volume wasn't high enough and the AC barely cooled the room. There are bugs and cockroaches on the hallways that are trying to crawl in to your room. Water went out during our 3rd night of stay for over 6 hours, again not leaving a good impression. The rooms look very old and outdated. There's no outlets next to the bed. This hotel is definitely NOT up to Wyndham status and does not deserve that franchise tag. I do not recommend anyone to stay here and spend 20-30 more to stay somewhere else.
