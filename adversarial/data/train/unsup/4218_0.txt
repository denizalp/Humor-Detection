I have not to been to a clinic that I absolutely love such as this one in such a long time. From the front office receptionist , to the patient liaison , the ultrasound technician, the check out receptionist , and of course the Doctor. Everyone was super funny , nice , professional , caring and informative. Well Done!!!! It's rare anymore!
