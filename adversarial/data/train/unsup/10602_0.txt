Our experience with Sundance Helicopters was all in all ok! It was a great way to see the Grand Canyon, however there could defiantly be some changes made. Like anywhere in Vegas they offer you a VIP experience and rarely deliver. \n\nOur tour was a package with limo, helicopter, lunch and a glass of champagne. We were picked up by a limousine that was jammed full with other customers, the limo driver said no more than two words to us. \n\nWe were then ushered into a waiting room and sat and waited for over an hour for our flight. The flight was a full helicopter of 6 people, not what we had envisioned. The lunch was on a picnic table where all 6 of us sat and ate together. I was hoping to have lunch on a nice table with my partner and I. The champagne is included as a selling point! But it is barley worth mentioning as it was served in a plastic picnic cup and was barley half full as it was shared with the other 2 couples on the flight.  They give you half an hour to eat and see the canyon which was very rushed.\n\nThe pilot was great and the flight itself was a once in a lifetime experience but it is too obvious they are cutting costs by ramming as many people in at a time that they can. \n\nTo top it off our limousine driver dropped us off at the wrong hotel, we were so disorientated and confused and even after asking if it was the right place, he said yes. By the time we had realised we were at the Venetian and not Caesars palace it was already too late he was gone.
