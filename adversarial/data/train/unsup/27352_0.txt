We live in the Steel Creek area and was super excited when we saw that Rise was opening so nearby. However, since they have opened this location we have gone 4 times but I am not sure I'll go back again. Only once(the very first time we went) have we left the store with what we actually ordered so it is super disappointing each time. \n\nThe first time we went was shortly after they opened and they were out of almost everything. We were a little disappointed but understood the demand was high so tried in several other occasions. \n\nSince then we've been given incorrect sandwiches, sandwiches missing components or with the wrong items. We even ordered a box of donuts and were given another customers order!  We didn't notice until getting home, which I'm sure was not only disappointing for us but the other customer. \n\nI will say that from what we have tried the food is alright and I really enjoy the apple fritter (if you can get one). They seem to sell out of donuts fast. \n\nIf you can get what you want the food is alright, but I would make sure to check your order before you leave!
