I heard very good things about this sushi place but unfortunately after trying it myself, I wasn't a fan :( \n\nA couple friends and I tried their All You Can Eat Sushi. \n\nPositive\n- The restaurant location is in a nice area in Las Vegas\n- The chocolate ice cream was from Thrifty and it was very yummy. \n- Johnny Roll - delicious \n\nNegative (reason for my 1 star)\n- Seating was not great, we sat on these hard boxes. Very difficulty getting in and getting out. \n- Services was not great, service kept forgetting our order & we had to reminder her a couple of times. \n- Make sure you child does not read the sushi menu, they have some non kid friendly names on them. Example: Crazy Ass, Sexy Time, Tree Some Special, I love my Ass, Burning your Ass & Taste like my X girlfriend. \n- I do not recommend the following \n*Baked Salmon Roll - very dry & no flavor \n*Udon soup - smells & tasted too fishy \n*Tree Some Special - way too much cream cheese\n*W07 - Not a fan of the ginger sauce \n*Sun Devil - over deep fried \n*Baked Mussel - Not good a all \n\nI did hear they have 2 locations so maybe I'll try the other location one day.
