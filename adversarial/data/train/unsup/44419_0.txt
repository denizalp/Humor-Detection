I got to try N9NE out on someone else's dime.  The place is sheek, upscale, but not too pretentious.  Service was awesome as we had one server concentrating on drinks, a server focused on food, and a busser in charge of clearing the settings.\n\nWe were provided a pre-fix menu, which included an apettizer of popcorn shrimp, a salad, a selection of a handful of entrees and dessert.  The starter and dessert courses were fine... nothing outstanding. \n\nFor my entree, I chose the kobe burger.  I don't think I'd ever pay $30 bucks for a burger but again, someone else was footing the bill.  It was one of the best burgers I've consumed.  The kobe beef was paired with maytag cheese, and thick cut smoked applewood bacon.  This burger was bold... melt in your mouth good.  \n\nOne oddity was their preparation of the Old Fashioned that I was drinking.  The orange wasn't muddled as typically prepared.  Instead, the full slice of orange was stuck horizontally in the middle of the glass making consuming the cocktail precarious.  Not a deal-breaker, but it was the first time I've experienced this.\n\nAnyway, I enjoyed my meal here.  Service was awesome, and I got to eat one of the best burgers I've ever tried.
