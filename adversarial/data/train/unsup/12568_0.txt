I went to Hobe because I wanted a flank steak that was larger than the usual pound and a half specimens found in the grocery store, and although I know how to do it myself, I wanted to save myself the work and have it butterflied by the butcher. One of the men behind the counter didn't know the meaning of the term - I should have taken the hint then. But somebody in the back said that he would do it. Since it was given to me all wrapped up, I couldn't see how the butcher had butchered that piece of beef.  One third had been cut almost all the way through and was hanging by a tendon. The other two thirds hadn't been cut at all. I was forced to do that part of the process, plus find a way to patch up the severed piece. This was an expensive pain-in-the-flank.
