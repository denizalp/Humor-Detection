Omakase is expensive.  However, it is a nice treat to yourself once in a while, or at least once in a lifetime.\n\nI had omakase over 10 times when I traveled in Japan.  I even tried two of the Michelin 2-star omakase restaurants in Tokyo two years ago.  Shoushin is the first omakase restaurant I tried in Toronto.  I did have a very good experience and it was especially enjoyable with my foodie partner, Jennifer K. ^^\n\nIt was absolutely a five stars experience to the service, food, interior decoration and atmosphere.\n\nTo their service, I would say it is even better than what I received in the Michelin 2-star restaurants I tried in Tokyo.   Shoushin offers excellent and high-class friendly service from greeting you at entrance, coat check, pulling your chair to be seated to even pulling your chair when you are standing up to your way to washroom.  The serving staff, the chef including the owner\/head chef of Shoushin explained clearly to us of all the food we were served.  \n\nWe picked the less expensive set to start with, but all sushi and fishes were so fresh that we were treasuring every single bite.   Even the two appetizers and soup to start with were done amazingly good.  They were quite a sense of taste enjoyment.  The desserts were not impressive but they were not bad at all.\n\nI will definitely go again for a special occasion.\n\nRemember to make reservation ahead of time and request to sit at sushi bar for more enjoyment!
