Called ahead 12:00 gave me a time for 2:45.  3:00 They called to come down.  4:30 I'm still waiting.  That was the quick service?.  It wasn't even busy.  Mistyped medical forms.  The antibiotic has a listed complication.  Oh yeah, we'll have to retype the prescriptions.  Wait more. The staff spent more time on insurance billing codes than patient needs. A sharps  box (used needles) on the floor. Nurse tells kids stick hands in \"all the time\".  Don't let your kids stick hands in.?  What is the box doing on the DAMN floor?\n\nI wouldn't even take my dog to this place.  Stay away.
