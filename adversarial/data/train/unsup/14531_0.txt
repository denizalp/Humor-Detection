I arrived around 11:30 on a weekday in my little Scion clown mobile and dropped it at the Express Service bay. As instructed, I proceeded to the very high class customer waiting area.\n\nFor my first course, I nibbled on a bag of popcorn. I made such a mess on the floor I cleaned it up myself. The popcorn was toothsome, warm and just like popcorn oughta be .And full of much-needed fiber, of course.\n\nSecond course was a tough choice between goldfish and dry Cheerios. Thinkin it may be too juvenile to eat dry Cheerios with my hands, I went for the goldfish. Not sure if these were wild or farm-raised, but they sure were tasty.\n\nI needed something to wash things down, so I proceeded to the self-serve fridge which was full of fresh water and sodas.  A vintage 7oz. Ginger Ale turned out to be just the right companion for my food choices.\n\nTime to refresh the palate. Amongst the fruit choices, I went with the apples, fresh and crisp and seductive as they looked. Just the ticket to prepare me for \"cookies a trois,\" one oatmeal, one chocolate chip, and one shooga. Needed some coffee as accompaniment, and sure enough there's a Latte machine.\n\nLast sip of that Latte, I hear my name called. The car is ready in 1\/2 hour. No charge. And I am outta there. How often do you leave a dealer service area without paying a cent? And with a free four-course lunch. Doesn't get much better than that, my friends.
