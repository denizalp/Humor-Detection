As a customer of Barnes & Noble, this place isn't so bad. As a student at UNLV, I have to take back that statement. Whoever decided to design this place to be put in BFE all the way hidden behind the student union is a moron. Most college campuses, their bookstores are front and center and you can't even get to the student union without going through it. Not so with good ol' UNLV. The main problem that this causes is that events that need to stay within the grounds of the bookstore (mark. cosmetics girls, I'm talkin' about you!) get virtually no traffic and have to scream outside of the doors to get anyone to even come near it. This bookstore is a graveyard with the exceptions of the beginning and end of the semester. Otherwise it is a place rarely trodden that no one thinks about unless they actually need something. \n\nAs far as school books, this place still has decent pricing. It's no Amazon, but it still doesn't gouge you senseless like the retarded cousin of college bookstores, Rebelbooks. And with Beat The Bookstore's new sell-back policy that takes THIRTY DAYS to print a freakin' check, I might be tempted to buy at Barnes & Noble more often, especially since they have taken the hassle out of buying schoolbooks by allowing students to order them online and pick them up at their convenience. At the very least, this place always has a coupon for 20% off gift items (who DOESN'T need an OY VEY mug?!) in the UNLV coupon books and is fun to browse through when you have nothing else to do. But as most businesses will tell you, it is all about location, location, location.
