If you like insanely fresh cookies then this is the place for you. Can't get any better than the factory!\n\nThis place sells defective cookies (don't worry, they still taste the same, just broken or problems with the wrappers) at an insanely large discount. I mean 2 dollars for 5 lbs of dad's cookies. They also sell ritz and oreos and pretty much whatever else they make at the time. \n\nIf you love cookies and a good deal, this is your new home.
