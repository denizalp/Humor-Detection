Made an appointment for an oil change and inspection at 7:30.  I was told it would take an hour and 15 mins which is way too long but whatever.   After 2.5 hours my car was finally ready and there was no apology offered until I asked why it took so long.  They blamed it on other people showing up late for their appointments rather than offering a sincere apology or valid excuse.  I then had to search the lot to find my car.  It was not where they told me it would be.  Not a fan of my VW Passat and really not a fan of their service department.
