Today's just our second time at Smitty's. I got a $10 coupon which I got on our first time at the East Hills location. We wanted to dine at Smitty's East Hills but it was out pf way to where we plan to head after so we ended up in Airdrie. \n\nMy apologies if my review would seem like a comparison to East Hills. I just cant help it. It was Sunday and it was raining. I understand it could get very busy. But there was no greeter when we came in. Customers were beginning to pile up by the entrance. Server came and managed the crown well. I just didn't get her name but she was nice and very apologetic. \n\nWe enjoyed the buffet over at East Hills so we thought to do it again this time in Airdrie. Again wrong decision. The buffet entrees was so few it's not really worth the price. Bacon would always run out and it would take forever for it to get replenished. It almost fees like we're being forced to have sausages instead. \n\nThe service wasn't really good too except for the lady who helped us initially at the front. We were seated by another server who, after giving us our drinks, never came back to ask if we needed something else like say \"cuttleries\" and\/or \"table napkins\"? We were only given those until we asked another server who just brought in forks and knives without the napkins and placed them at the table just like that. \n\nService wasn't good (except for only one person)...food wasn't good...so what can I say? Im not coming back to this location. And I will not recommend it to others as well.
