It's one of the best burger places in Phoenix, and overall perhaps the most eclectic fast food place I've ever seen. \n\nI've had a decent salad here. I've had great hummus and pita here. If I so desired, I'm pretty sure I could get a breakfast burrito, gyro, hot dog, variety of other sandwiches, or a *pizza* here as well. I swear up and down that establishments housing gargantuan menus can't be good, and so far I am being proven wrong. \n\nBut you wanna hear about the burgers right? \n\nThey're pretty gosh darn good. I like the buns and I like the beef. I'm a fan of the Cowboy Burger, with its plentiful bacon and fried onions. The fries are perfect as well, with the seasoned, crunchy exterior and a soft, fluffy interior. The price of the combo is really competing against some premium chains--and winning. Fans of establishments like Five Guys should like this more. \n\nEvery day, during my lunch break, I'll be fighting the urge to step into Burger Rush and chowing down. Give it a try so I may live vicariously through you.
