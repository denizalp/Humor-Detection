I'm not about to have a bitch fit here and write a book about all the pros and cons like some of the reviews on here, however I will say the place was just fine!! And you do get what you pay for which is a pretty decent-yet cheap place. I don't know why some of the people on here complain when they know exactly what they are paying for, you want 5 star quality for a low budget price? Get real!!! If you want luxury then the start counting your pennies if not, this is the way to go and quit your whining!
