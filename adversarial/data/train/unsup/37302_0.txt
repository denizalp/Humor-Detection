Authentic Taiwanese food in Pittsburgh!! Ordered a sampling of each category on the menu..( but two of the pork soup dumplings) and everything was relish. The soup dumplings were perfect. Thin dough covering a highly seasoned \" meatball\" of Asian goodness. The spicy wontons were not over the top spicy but just the right amount of heat+ flavor. Noodles perfect texture with sauces that weren't that heavy sweet stuff you get at Chinese restaurants. Im from Nj so Ive eaten Taiwanese in NYC.. And id say this place  can compete.
