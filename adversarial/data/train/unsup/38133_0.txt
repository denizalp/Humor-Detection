The setting is very quaint in an attractive old building in Pittsburgh's North Side's West Allegheny neighborhood that has apparently served as a restaurant of some sort since 1938. The neighborhood is quiet and there's plenty of street parking available. The inside is charming and cute. The small cafe-like setting boasts high ceilings and interesting art on the walls. Service is cheerful and friendly, and place settings are properly reset for each course. The moderate size menu is quirky (in a good way) with Eastern Europe meeting Asia. The fact that all of the food is made from scratch with fresh ingredients (some even grown by the owners, apparently) shows in the quality of the dishes. The artisan cheeses (complete with delicious candied walnuts and lavish crackers, which were a nice substitute for bread), Siberian dumplings filled with beef and lamb, lime Caesar salad, Sumatran chicken curry (very unique with Peruvian potatoes and pickled blueberries), Lamb Croquettes (with a Grecian potato salad and a tasty hot pepper relish), and Russian honey cake were all rock star dishes to remember. The salmon bisque, which wasn't flavorful enough for my tastes, didn't reach the same level. It's BYOB and prices are very reasonable!
