Big pimpin' - until the $5,000 bill arrives!\n-------------------\nYou have to hand it to the Wynn empire.  He has figured out a way to print money, aside from the casino, the buffet, the hotel rooms.\n\nWhy would anybody want to pay extra to sit by a pool, drink $12 Dos Equis, and pay $2000 and up for a day bed?\nBecause there is a lot of talent, that's why.  A LOT of talent, if you catch my drift.\n\nOur hostess was perfectly bronzed and toned, and she would frequently check on us and make mixed drinks for us.  Of course, this was for our buddy's bachelor party, so if he wants to go to a dayclub, eat and drink on a day bed, and check out the talent, then so be it.  \n\nIt was basically like spring break, with talent dancing in the \"dancer's\" pole \/ rain shower islands, and Redfoo from LMFAO rockin the crowds. \n\nI will say, we all had a pretty good time (some of our party had too good of a time and had to be snuck out before they were escorted out by the bouncers).  That is, until we had to settle the bill.  So the way it works is, once you get the daybed, they're gonna charge you the $2000 anyway, and you order any combination of food and drinks.  The problem is, they don't tell you when you hit your $2000, and unless the cardholder cuts off your group and requires prior authorization, the bill can keep running if anybody in your group keeps asking for additional food \/ liquor items.  Hence the $5000 tab.  \n\nAll in all, it was fun, but don't forget what I told you (the cardholder has got to demand prior authorization for additional items once the $2000 limit is reached), otherwise no happy ending for you.\n\nNow go out and party hard!
