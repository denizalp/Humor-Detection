I just can't say enough awesome things about Urban Herbs--but that doesn't mean I'm not going to try! \n\nFirst--fantastic spice blends. I'm definitely a gal who loves well-seasoned food. In fact, nothing leaves my kitchen without some sort of sprinkling. But when it comes to unique blends, Urban Herbs is where it's at. I've tried their cajun seasoning, which I pretty much use on everything now. Holy Jesus, this stuff is fantastic. You wouldn't think cajun seasoning would be this versatile, but check yo-self because this stuff is even good on popcorn. I've also tried both their rib rub and BBQ rub and both are to-die-for. In fact, I was considering using the BBQ rub as an \"everything\" seasoning, as well! The rib rub smelled almost like there was a little curry in it as well, so good. \n\nSecondly, they have a fantastic selection of grains that 1) won't cost you an arm and a leg and 2) aren't just different rices. I say this because I'm sick of going to the grocery store only to find that a small box of quinoa is about $8 and other than that I can pick from wild, brown and white rices. But at UH, you can find multiple types of quinoa, rices, grains, amaranth, barley and... well, shiz you haven't even heard of! Also, I haven't jumped into their dried mushroom collection, but I've heard amazing things. \n\nThird, the service is always super-helpful with lots of advice, plus they're like mega-cheap. And get this: NO minimum credit card charge!!! That pesky rule is typically what keeps me from shopping at certain stands, but Urban Herbs does it right. Great (and unique!) products at a very reasonable price.
