Had a great experience today with Century Link customer loyalty professional Gabriela who was at the 20 E. Thomas location here in Phoenix. She assisted me BIG TIME getting me a price for 40MG internet for a year that I could afford. She was gracious, conversational and just plain fun. \nI have been with Century Link, Qwest and Southwestern Bell for 23 years. My family (RIP) started with them in 1976. I have always found that they will work things out for me. \nKeep up the terrific service!!
