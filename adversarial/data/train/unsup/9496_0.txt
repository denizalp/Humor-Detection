Wow, wow, wow! Consider my mind blown! This place has turned itself completely around thanks to the new owner and location! It's seriously AMAZING now! It's super spacious with a plethora of workout equipment, and not just standard equipment either. They have things for crossfit enthusiasts and even a room designated for classes that you can program to your liking. I am really impressed and looking forward to renewing my membership here.
