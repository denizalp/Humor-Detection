I went to Classique to patronize a local business.  I usually go to Portage, Valpo, Shereville, Hobart, Etc for my massages.  I must say that the masseuse was magnificent.   She was friendly and  engaging.  I will be buying a membership package.  The aesthetics of the plaza she is in is not appealing at all.  But once you step into her establishment, you forget  about the outside world.  Go get a hot stone massage by Latasha and slip into ecstasy.
