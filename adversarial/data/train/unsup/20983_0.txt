At the Whole Foods at Town Square the restaurant\/brewery is called the LV Bar.  The menu is seasonal like at Sprockets on Green Valley  so it changes from time to time.\n\nOur server was really nice and was helpful in drink selection and saving money.\n\nEverything is awesome here, you really can't go wrong.  All the food is made fresh to order.  It's a great place with a daily happy hour.  You can order food & drink here or grab something from inside the store and bring it in.  This is a good place to check out.
