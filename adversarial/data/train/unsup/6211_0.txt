SUCH a gorgeous hotel! It's off-Strip, so pricing is a little more wallet-friendly than the same quality elsewhere. Parking is beneath the hotel itself, no charge. Multiple restaurants on site including a Starbucks breakfast joint, a small casual cafe, Envy Steakhouse, and a  bar with live jazz on weekends.\n\nStaff is friendly and the decor is just my style: dark, luxe, orchids everywhere, nice linens. Good views out most of the windows, too. Heard it was recently remodeled, but this was the first time I'd been.\n\nRoom rates start around $100-$110, so it's not the best \"deal\" but I've paid more for less quality elsewhere. Conveniently located by the convention center and walking distance to other good food options.
