My parents swear that this place is a drug front. Their reasoning - nobody is ever shopping here, at all, whatsoever. I told them that it's a national company, but they still give it a suspicious eye every time they drive past (which is frequent, seeing as they live in the area.)\n\nIn general, every single thing here is laughably overpriced, and of so-so construction. Many of their pieces are on trend, which unfortunately means that they'll be out of style in the blink of an eye. \n\nWhile I've been to many a West Elm, I don't understand the appeal. For the price of luxury branded cookware (ex: Staub) you can get... West Elm's Z-list  branded kitchenware. Eh... I don't understand why a person wouldn't just get the name branded stuff. when the quality is better.\n\nAlthough I'm not a fan of most of the items they sell, I am a fan of their flatware- but only if you get it in the clearance bin, piece by piece. I don't know what West Elm's deal is with their $40-50 a place setting, but come on, it's definitely not worth it if you're paying full price. \n\nEvery time I've been in here, I've felt that the sales team is a bit pretentious and snooty. It's a tad laughable seeing that this is basically a furniture and linens store. Nothing to look down your nose about.
