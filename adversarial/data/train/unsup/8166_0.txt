I was craving something Filipino while staying in Phoenix for an orientation conference and peeped this place out on Yelp.  As far as location goes it's right next to the Walgreens and an Asian supermarket.  There is a decent amount of parking in front of the restaurant.  They pretty much have all of the essentials as far as Filipino food and dessert goes.  I came here on a weekday night and it wasn't so busy and anything like that.  Since they are called the Halo Halo Kitchen, I might as well get a Halo Halo so I did.  It wasn't so bad.  It's homemade so it was good.  However, I felt that is was just ok compared to other Halo Halos.  Kinda ironic to have a mediocre Halo Halo and you are called the Halo Halo Kitchen?  It was almost 6 bucks.  Anyways, the restaurant is decent sized.  They have Filipino food selections and even other Filipino delicacies for sale like polvoron, Magnolia ice cream, and many more.  They have a decent amount of table and seating areas.  They have a TV which plays TFC and related shows.  The staff and customer service is ok. They were kind enough to let me stay to finish my Halo Halo inside the restaurant instead of suffering through it in the Phoenix heat.  Anyways, if you are in the Phoenix area and are craving Filipino overall, this is one of those few places.
