From arrival to departure a great experience. My name and vehicle spot on the board, all I had to do was get in the vehicle and go. Drop off just as simple as I arrived in airport return, left keys in the car and before the tram arrived at the airport have a e-mail receipt from Hertz. Had a great car and no issues whatsoever. I'll use them again and again.
