I want TIABI.  I want To Inspire and Be Inspired, but first coffee.  \n\nTIABI has become one of my favorite spots to satisfy my caffeine cravings.  My drink of choice is their Espresso Frankenstein (4 shots of espresso & agave blended with ice).  I will usually Frankenstein my Frankenstein by adding some of my own MCT, protein powder, and some heavy whip cream (only if my fat intake is too low).  This drink is enough to give TIABI the stars that I say they deserve.  First of all, the beans they use is local and comes from Colorado River Coffee Roasters.  If you're not familiar with CRCR, then look them up. CRCR can be found in other coffee shops around Vegas like Grouchy John's.  TIABI's Americano alone is good. Having it in their Frankenstein Espresso is the best.  There really is no reason for me to try any of the other drinks since I'm sold on their espresso.  \n\nTIABI also serves waffles in a bunch of fun ways.  They got waffles with fruit, bacon waffles, red velvet waffles, Vegan waffles, a churro waffle, waffle sandwiches, and a waffle named Viva Las Elvis (banana & PEANUT BUTTER). I've tried their Waffledilla (chicken & cheese wafflewich) and the Break-The-Fast (bacon, egg, & cheese wafflewich).  The proteins inside really hit the spot. I'm more of a pancake guy, but still liked both wafflewiches.  Besides, waffles are just pancakes with Abs anyway. \n\nAs for service, I think it's the best.  I have never had a bad visit and it's always nice when you're greeted by name.  TIABI is very small and there's usually only one person working.  If you're getting a little more than just a drink, then you should also expect a little bit of a wait.  Waffles can't cook themselves, right?  Overall, I'm more than just a fan.  I love the coffee here and after just one sip, I'm ready to inspire. \n\nTIP #1:  Hours 8:00 AM to 3:00 PM.  Closed on Monday.  I would be here a lot more if they were open earlier. \n\nTIP #2:  Get the Espresso Frankenstein\n\n2017 Yelp Review #69
