Reading a couple of these 1 star reviews makes me laugh. Keith and Dave have athletes all over the world come to them and this place for rehabilitation on their bodies. I could be one of their best customers since I have had 7 surgeries and spent a lot of time (years) with them. Not only are they the best best, but such a fun group of people and an amazing facility! With out them I would be a mess and in pain everyday for the rest of my life. Ask yourself this.....why they have athletes all over the world visit them, baseball players from Japan, MLB, NFL, Olympians, and much more......that's because they are the best and their walls covered with athletes pictures signed by the players thanking them for everything they have done. Most of all for getting them back on the field and doing the jobs they love. That's says it all. Bottom Line they are the best!!
