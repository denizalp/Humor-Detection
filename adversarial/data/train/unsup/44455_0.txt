I wish I could say a few negative things so I could keep the rest of you away from my new- found delicious, authentic, chinese place.  But that would be mean.  \nHere's what I ordered.\nChicken fried rice:  not the usual brown color; it was white but had lots of flavor.  Enough chicken, some peas and carrots.  I would have loved bean sprouts and green onion in it but that was not the case.  Next time I will ask for bean sprouts.\n\nStir fry with pork stomachs with peppers (he, he, he):  Awesome dish. Very flavorful.  My grandmother made something similar so I came in with expectations and was not disappointed.  \n\nLamb with Cumin:  Very spicy excellent dish.  Now I am NOT a lamb eater but this dish made it delish.  I would order it again.  \n\nChicken with Mushroom in a POT.  Large, large portion with a large, large price.  12.98 for this dish but it could easily feed 3 or 4.  Potatoes with mushroom and lots of chicken.  However TOO SALTY.  We brought it home so I can make white rice without any salt to balance out the salt in this dish.  When you pay that much for a chinese dish you have to try to save it.  \nWe arrived about 5:45PM and it was half full. By the time we left, the place was packed.  Maybe that's why I had to hold my empty water glass up in the air and swing it back and forth to get somebody's attention.  It took a while.  They serve you food and then they go away so this is not a service oriented place.  This is a \"we serve great food\" place so don't get offended if they don't come by to ask how your food is.  \nBTW, lots of ethnic diners which told me right away that I was in for a treat. \nI would definitely eat here again despite the long trip to get here.
