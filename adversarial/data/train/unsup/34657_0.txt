I am very pleased with the service and integrity of this auto repair shop. I had my front brakes and rear struts replaced and a transmission flush done on my Civic. I left very happy knowing that I was truly taken care of and was quoted a very affordable price by very friendly and professional staff. \n\nAnother thing that happened- I took my car to another shop for a basic oil change. They called me letting me know that my car was finished and ready to be picked up. They also told me that 5 different fluids were dangerously low and that my engine was going to catch on fire. I decided to take my car into SSC Auto Repair to get a second opinion and after their technician looked at it, told me that everything was perfectly fine. \n\nI absolutely trust SSC with my vehicle and will not be taking it to any other place. \n\nThank you guys for all of your honesty, because that is so rare to find these days!
