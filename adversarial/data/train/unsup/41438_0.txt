Second hot dog for me in 2 days. Pretty good since the last hot dog was about a year ago. \n\nBuldogi's was a great treat especially following the disappoint of the previous day at Chicago Tasty Dogs. Budogi's was a hit on almost every mark. Very friendly and welcoming. Many Dog's and menu choices available and inventive. Place was spotless and in great condition. Price was high for a dog but they don't skimp and one dog was a generous portion. \n\nThanks Buldogi, I'll be back. \n\nOh, they also have vegetarian options which is rare. But they should be commended for. Vegetarian usually get screwed at places like this, but not here.
