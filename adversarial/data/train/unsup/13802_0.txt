From the moment I approached the theatre entrance up until the conclusion\/end, I enjoyed every minute of the experience of this show.\n\nFirstly, all of the ushers\/workers\/staff are dressed in what I would call \"traditional\" clothing from the music period of the Beatles heyday in England.  An English touch is also present with a large scale replica of the Union Jack on the ceiling as well.  On your way to the theatre, guests will pass the LOVE store as well as a color changing wall with a composition\/pattern depicting the \"fab four\".\n\nThe theatre itself is a spectacle as well as a technical accomplishment that befits the typical Cirque show in Vegas.  Its 360 degree stage allows the audience to view the show from different perspectives depending on their seats.  \n\nAs far as the the show itself, it's definitely an achievement and triumph in showcasing the music and period of the Beatles with all of the acts, costumes, and enjoyment that Cirque Du Soleil is renowned for.  The costumes are colorful and dramatic, the cast is full of happiness and energy, and the music may just tempt you start clapping along or dance in your seat perhaps =)  \n\nAlthough all of the acts\/performers in LOVE are up to the standards Cirque shows are known for, one of my favorite parts of the show involves some \"audience participation.\"  I won't give anything away except to say that if you're seated in the front rows\/section, your \"participation\" will be needed at some point.  It was quite fun to say the least and was one of the more surprising and fun aspects of the show!!\n\nBottom Line:  I would definitely recommend this show to people who are either fans of the Beatles or Cirque Du Soleil, or who are fans of both.  Enjoy!
