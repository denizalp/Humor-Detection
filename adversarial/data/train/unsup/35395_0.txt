The hotel and property are very beautiful. The customer service is wonderful. \n\nWe had a club level reservation. The 1st night we in a room right next to the elevator, which was bad because I could hear it all night. I am a light sleeper and can't use ear plugs. Maybe if you sleep deaper, it will be ok for you. They gladly moved us to a suite for the other 2 night. Great view of the football stadium and surrounding areas. \n\nThe bed could be a little softer. Hubby wasn't happy but I was fine.\n\nOur biggest negitive is the shower head. In both rooms, it sprays all over. Not good for someone who doesn't wash her hair every day. \n\nAnother plus, the pool was amazing. Warmest pool I have ever used. Jumped right in, in November. Loved it. So relaxing. Hot pool was good too, will not say hot tub because we couldn't find the button for the jets.
