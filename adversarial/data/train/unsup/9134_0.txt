So, I didn't check Yelp prior to hiring this guy... But my experience was generally ok. George was on time and professional, despite being a bit odd (possibly socially awkward?). The dog door is well installed, from what I can tell. I certainly looks good from both sides. The dogs love it, and so do I. Based on cost\/timeliness\/quality of installation: 5 stars. \n\nThe reason for the 2 star review then? George met a man in my driveway, someone he presumably did not know before meeting him in said driveway, and then *brought him inside my home without my permission.* \n\nLet me repeat: George, someone I did not know aside from a couple of phone conversations, brought a second man, also a stranger to me, into my home without my permission. Not. Okay. (OMG, WTF! Not ok!!)\n\nIf it matters (it does not), I was, at the time, alone in a mostly empty house (doing some cleaning and prep work prior to moving in) with my 2 year old son. I was\/am 9 months pregnant. Turns out, this new gentleman was a door to door security system salesman... And likely a scam artist casing my home. I felt incredibly violated and, quite frankly, terrified and angry. I am generally an independent woman, but it will be a long time before I allow a maintenance\/installer\/etc into my home when I am alone. I consider the whole experience a wakeup call for personal safety- so for that, I thank George. Sort of.
