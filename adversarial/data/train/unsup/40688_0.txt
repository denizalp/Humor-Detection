An awesome \"small\" movie theatre in the heart of downtown. \n\nWe came here to check out the film \"Maggie\", it was originally supposed to be released during TIFF last year. \n\nThe service was great, personable and friendly. The theatre was small and intimate, but clean. \n\nGreat experience, will return again for other independent movies.
