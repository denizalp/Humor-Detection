Steak 'n Shake is my favorite restaurant of-all-time since my first discovery in 1969 in Daytona Beach Florida. Most locations maintain a first class customer experience. The grill and kitchen are in plain view. It pains me to say this one on SR 91 SOM Center is sub-par. I have given it several opportunities to improve. They are apologetic. I won't blame the wait staff. Something to do with management.\n\nI make the drive out to the Steak 'n Shake near Heisley Rd in Mentor. Much better.
