Shhhhhh....  Don't tell anyone else about this place.  i don't ever want to have to wait in line or share this absolutely wonderful place!\n\nSome call this modern Japanese, some call this fusion.  I call this the best of Japanese Cuisine and closer to authentic than I can imagine.\n\nFirst of all, a disclaimer.  If you like big honking rolls of sushi with names like Dragon Roll, Rainbow roll, Tiger Roll and all these type of concoctions, then this will not be your real destination.  Why?  Because Soho to me is traditional Japanese because.....\n\n\na. Genmaicha - So far, most places I go to, when I ask for genmaicha, they either do not have it, or it comes in a tea bag.  Blah!  this place has the real deal, tasty and they refilling your cup.\n\nb.  Texture and Taste - Why do I say tradition, because the art of Japanese style to be is simply, form, function and when it comes to food, it is all about texture and taste.  Everything I tried, was subtle, delicate, perfect combination of texture and taste.\n\nc.  rolls - They did have some limited tools.\n\nd.  Nigiri Sushi - Went with the standard measurable sushis for me.  Tobiko, Amaebi, maguro with sliced jalapeño and lemon.  All three of these are contenders for the best of class. \n\ne.  Chef - the chef came out to stop and talk to us a bit.  I was totally impressed by this.  He is so caring about the food and his desire for excellence. We were able to try some of his signature dishes that he comped us.  Uni , Hamachi in Yuzu Soy, Kuramoto Oysters.  All three of these were beyond my wildest expectations.  The uni was served fresh and without the sushi.  It does not get better than that.  the Hamachi in Yuzu Soy was absolutely a dream.  thinly sliced yellow tail, with a fried jalapeño and micro cilantro.  If you ever had steamed fish cantonese style, this Hamachi dish itself will bring back memories.\n\nf.  And More on food.... We tried\n\n- Short Ribs, okay not traditional, but really awesome.\n- Amaebi - The shrimp were just perfect, and the fried heads were out of the world.\n- Marinated Cod - So tender\n- Edamama - Just right\n- Soho Tostados - what an invention!\n- Gyoza - Not bad at all, loved the sauce.\n\ng.  Service = Absolutely committed and first class.\n\nGK says, my new favorite place to go.
