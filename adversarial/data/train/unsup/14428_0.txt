Grand Electric offers delicious authentic Spanish cuisine to starving hipsters in Parkdale.  This joint is bumping! The space itself is cozy, dimly light and has few tables.  The food is delightful and reasonably priced.  The menu offers a variety of classic Spanish dishes.  We started with the guac and followed with individual tacos-beef cheek, fish, chicken, and cheese.  I had the tripe soup and it was amazing!!!! I have been in twice and they have been playing excellent hip hop both times which was refreshing.  Grand Electric is in very high demand these days. I popped in on a Friday night at 6:30pm to put my name down on the list (they do not take reservations) and the hostess informed me it would be a three and a half hour wait to get a table for 2! Puta madre!  If you intend to dine here be prepared to wait!  Or go in and put your name on the list and head over to the cadi lounge for a drink and they will call you when your table is available.  If you are the patient type then Grand Electric is the joint for you. If you are starving, better try somewhere else.  If you are privy enough to dine here than rejoice because it is fantastic!
