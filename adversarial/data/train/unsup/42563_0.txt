I love this place! The open air dining is a nice treat on a Saturday afternoon. The food is reasonably priced, great portion sizes and delicious! \nWe ordered wings, smoked turkey sandwich, Mac and cheese, potato salad and fried green tomatoes. Everything was amazing, I especially enjoyed the wings and will come back JUST to eat those. Their dipping sauce is bomb and all the BBQ sauces had excellent flavor! So happy to have found this gem in Matthews.
