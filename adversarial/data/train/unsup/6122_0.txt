This company is the best. If you need your house painted call them.  They gave me a fair bid, was not the cheapest , but provided the best value.  After the bidding process Joe Bucko (their foreman ) was at my house ensuring the project was completed to my expectations. They communicated often throughout the process and ensured I was happy with the job. They even called me months after the project was complete to make sure I was still satisfied.  I have been living I. The valley for a long time and have never received this kind of service .  If you're on the fence about hiring a painter go with them , they are by far the best .
