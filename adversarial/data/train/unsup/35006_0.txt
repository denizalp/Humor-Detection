I have been coming here for a few years now.\nI really like Dr Spotts. She does her best to put me at ease and ensure me that I am doing just fine. A few years back I got a lump in my chest due to falling really hard. I thought I had cancer possibly. But I later found out from Dr Spotts that it was trauma. \n\nI go I get my yearly check up and I trust her professional opinion, she has been doing this longer than I have been alive and I respect her and am grateful to her for being such a wonderful doctor. I can't say i trust every doctor I meet but I do this woman. \n\nShe is very knowledgeable and I am glad she is my doctor! Thank you!
