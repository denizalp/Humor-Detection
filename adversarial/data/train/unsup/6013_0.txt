I didn't want to stray on my Birthday away from Sushi Mon however my mom did not have the same experience I did at Sushi Mon so I found this place by Greenland market. The Yellowtail was so delish it melted in my mouth. The older lady who was not my waitress was awesome. The younger one was nice but unyielding. The food was great the only thing I found not to my liking was their salad and miso soup. However the sushi, nigiri was delish. I plan to go again really soon! Okay so I went back and took my bff there for her birthday! She loved it too and she is almost as picky as me. I tried the 911 roll which I usually do not eat rolls it was great and the Spider roll was super yummy!
