You have to eat here!! The food is out of this world. The pizza is fantastic, the pasta dishes are outstanding. When they say that this is the best pizza in Las Vegas, believe them. It is THAT good. Biaggio is right there to make sure everything is okay with the food. He really cares about his guests. I tell everyone that when I pass away I want to be buried with a Biaggio's pizza in my casket.
