Stopped in for a burger and some patio time on one of those super warm March days!! Alas, Woody's actually doesn't open up their patio till April, said there was some sort of legal issue? Whatever!! All the tables and chairs were locked up to one side. It was really lame, my friend and I had to make do with one broken bench and one wobbly table, in the shady, unsunny side of the patio. Booo! It was such a disappointment. \n\nLuckily, the burgers were really good. My burger was stuffed with gorgonzola, and perfectly cooked. Great bun too! I don't like a lot of stuff on my burger, but Woody's does have an amazing array of toppings available. They offer \"50\/50 fries\", half sweet potato and half regular, and the portion size is just right. Service was a little slow, but not terrible. Will visit again once the patio is really open! :) \n\nOne final note: Seriously amazing people watching here. Fantastic entertainment!!
