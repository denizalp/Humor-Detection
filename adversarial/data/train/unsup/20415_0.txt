American Express came through and got us six tickets together in the orchestra to see O just after Valentine's Day. We were in Vegas for a conference and the girls wanted to go to see the big O they had been hearing about.\n\nThey called and tried to get tickets a couple of weeks before ... but they could not get six tickets together.\n\nThank you American Express for making the impossible happen. We were very pleased with our seats and the entire experience.\n\nEven though I had seen the show a few times over the years, I really enjoyed it again. It was fun to see it with people who had never gone before. There were lots of ooohs and ahhhhs.\n\nI like O a lot but it is almost exactly as I have seen during my previous visits. I think it would be nice if they made a few changes from time to time so it is always fresh and awe-inspiring. \n\nThe Cirque Du Soleil shows in Vegas are worth seeing. It is an event to add to your to do list while in Vegas, just get tickets before you leave home, or you just might miss the show.
