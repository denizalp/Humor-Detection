I got a gift card for this place for a mani and pedi. It was easy to book the appointment and when I showed up early, they were able to accommodate me right away. \n\nSadly I asked if I could soak in the chair for a bit before starting my appointment (which is why I came early) but I was either misunderstood or denied. Either way, it didn't happen. \n\nFor my manicure, I opted for a regular polish and the girl didn't have any fans on her desk which means she layered 4 coats of polish in a matter of 10 minutes. Sitting at the lamp for 20 minutes and my nails are still not dry! \n\nThe place is also dirty. While the pictures look upscale, up close, there is an inch of dust on everything. Any other salon I've gone to never had this problem. Not to mention whatever dusty thing hangs in the doorway to the back bathroom - gross. \n\nAll in all, I wouldn't recommend this place unless you just need a quick fix and are not interested in the experience of a nail spa.
