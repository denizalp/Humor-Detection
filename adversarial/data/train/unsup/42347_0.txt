I have eaten lunch at Morris a couple of different times.  I love the layout of the restaurant.  It is in a narrow space, but they did a nice job with the decorating and the Asian rusticness of the space (if that is even a thing).  \nI am not a connoisseur of Ramen, so my review should be taken with that in mind.  I have tried two different ramen dishes:  Morris and Miso.  In both cases, I loved the presentation and the broth was very satisfying.  However, there were a couple of complaints that I have.  With the Morris Ramen, they serve it with a hard boiled egg.  I think it is a specialty egg, but I have been told by others that \"real\" ramen should be served with a soft boiled or poached egg so the yolk runs into the broth.  The yolk was hard and, having hoped for the soft boiled yolk, I was a little disappointed.\n\nWith the Miso, they had two stars on the menu next to the name.  I took that to mean the spiciness (and that may have been my fault for assuming the star system is similar to what I would have in a Thai restaurant) and it was not spicy.  Again, I thought the broth was tasty but what really disappointed me was the noodles.  They seemed stiff and reminded me of the packages of ramen noodles that we all had in college.  For that price, I would have wanted to taste something that felt homemade and fresh and it did not feel that way to me.\n\nI am not sure I would return as there are other good lunch options around that part of the square that I have enjoyed more.
