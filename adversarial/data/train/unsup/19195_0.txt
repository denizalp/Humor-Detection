\"IRRASHAIMASE!!!\"\n\nThe roar of welcome from the servers and chefs as soon as you walk in past those thick wooden doors is deafening, adding to the din of chatter and laughter from patrons seated on long wooden benches jovially hoisting pitchers of Sapporo. Now, I love me a good 'ole Asian-style beer bar, whether it be a Japanese izakaya or a Taiwanese pejiu wu, and Guu definitely fits the bill. If you're not in the mood to party, however, there's a small patio outside where you can actually hear yourself think and place an order without shouting into your server's face. \n\nIt's no wonder people are so happy here, the \"tapas-style\" dishes are DELICIOUS. We tried the melt-in-your-mouth gindara (grilled black cod), gyu (beef) tongue, savory scallop and king oyster mushrooms, and the little deep fried oyster balls of heaven known as takoyaki. The only dish we could have done without would be the average \"pick three\" oden - we chose the ikaten, hanpen, and shikuwa.  As for the drinks, the cocktails I tried were well-mixed and proportioned... I can't wait to come back and try their chu-high (vodka and Japanese soda) concoctions! Come with a smaller group on busy weekend nights, as it will help you get seated faster - otherwise, be prepared to wait quite awhile! \n\nDomo arigato gozaimashita, Guu.... 'till we meet again!
