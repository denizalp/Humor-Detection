YES! \n\nThis is the kind of place Pittsburgh needs more of! Loved the fact that if you arn't really looking for it you won't be able to find it. \n\nWalking in they have a very small front room, and apparently a back room that I didn't go to. We were greeted and sat at the bar. Overwhelmed by the drink menu, I asked the bartender for some help. He asked what I liked, and suggested the Rhus Juice. Oh my word, was it delicious! And I say that on the presumption that there were a few things in the ingredients list that I normally don't drink: cream and egg white. Both ingredients in most cocktails taste pretty poorly, BUT Acacia managed to make them simply divine! \n\nSadly we only stayed for one drink since they didn't serve food, but I will definitely be back!
