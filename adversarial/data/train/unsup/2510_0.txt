Welcome to Shill-ville AZ, population at least 2. Within our borders, service lacks any cordiality. Humidity and temperature within the walls are sweaty hog blistering in the month of January. Food takes a little too long for it to be called \"Express\" and takes even longer to eat it. Why? Because the cuts of meat are akin to those of urban legends more along the lines of Snopes. The only flavorings are eclectically listed on my palate as soy sauce and sugar. When asked for some Sriracha sauce the owner gives thee a look as if asked for pickled human placenta. Let this be a dire message to anyone looking for a true review... would you eat at a place that tries to imitate Yoshinoya?
