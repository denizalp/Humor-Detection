It was a nice experience but I wouldn't recommend this place for a foot massage. My hubby and I both got the $26 dollar 60 minute foot massage. Out here in Las Vegas especially in Chinatown, foot massages are very affordable and competitive. I have experienced much better foot massages for $20 than this. Basically they rubbed your feet and calves with lotion for an hour. They put in the absolute minimal effort. They didn't have any business while we were there other than us. In the front of the shop is a nail salon which had one customer. If they had offered a different foot massage like a deep tissue then I would have gotten that knowing that the lesser choice wouldn't have been as enjoyable or effective. This place claims to use reflexology but they do not. After we were finished with our massage they asked us if we wanted water which my husband immediately responded in agreeance and they brought out these tiny little paper cups big enough for a swallow of water and stood and watched us drink it! It was absolutely laughable! They were nice though they didn't speak much and the environment for the massages was nice and intimate. Very clean and relaxing with wonderful wide reclinable chairs. I wasn't terrible but not somewhere I would go back to nor recommend to anyone.
