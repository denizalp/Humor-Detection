Stay away.  Was there for lunch the other day.  Food took a really long time to come out and when it did, it was not worth the wait.  Both of our salads were really not good.  My dressing was just oil.  When I pointed it out to the waiter, he just said, \"yea, I think it might be broken.  Plaid my bill, and as I was leaving I was watching the kitchen.  One if the cooks took a metal spoon, dipped it into a pot, held it for another cook to taste, then tasted it himself, wiped it off with a rag and stirred the pot with it.  That's right, two of the used the spoon to taste it and kept using it.  Clearly this was acceptable.  Told the manager and he was shocked, but I pointed out all 5 people in the kitchen had seen this happen and no one said anything.  I bet it happens all the time.  No thanks, too many choices in Phoenix.
