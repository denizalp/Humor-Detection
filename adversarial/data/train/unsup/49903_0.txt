From the outside, La Baron looks like a high end outdoor store. I've passed by this store hundreds of times and it never occurred to me to check it out. Well as they say, never judge a book by its cover, because this store is pretty awesome, and best of all it's reasonably priced!!\n\nI came in here looking for a pair of hiking boots. Having searched extensively online, it was more of a hail mary look than anything.  Well surprisingly there were a half decent clearance section and I was able to get a pair of high top Columbia hiking boots for $40! They have a good selection of camping, fishing, hunting and backpacking wear, as well as outdoor clothing (i.e. jackets). \n\nI'm going to have to go back to look for a windbreaker\/waterproof jacket, and other little essentials.  Definitely worth a visit. They have other locations in addition to the Markham one. Check out their website.
