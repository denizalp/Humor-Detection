Absolutely loved it there! We unfortunately had to pull my kids out due to my infants medical problems. My son attended from age 9mo to.almost 2. He learned so much. All the staff are very professional, dressed appropriately and love the kids. There was never a day my children didnt want to.be there. My son never wanted to leave!!! Its a bit pricey but worth it for the academics.
