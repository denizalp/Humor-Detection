Food truck this time and still Good Tacos.  The food truck was nearby and decided to give it a try.  Tacos were $4, so a little more expensive.  Had the Carnitas with mexican slaw, pico de gallo, cilantro and lime and the Carne Molida, a spicy beef with sauteed bell peppers, jalpenas, farmers cheese, cilantro and lime.  Both were good.  There were a variety of hot sauces available including a Sirachi Bacon that was very interesting and had some heat.
