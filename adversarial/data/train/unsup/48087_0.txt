This salon is your generic pop up salon with nothing special to entice you to spend the money. I went because I was referred by somebody based off their ratings. There was no music, no TV, and the girls that work there were screaming across the salon to each other in a different language even though some of them had clients. It was almost as if they were out to dinner having full on conversations. The woman who did my nails was hard to understand, and she did my nails so terribly that it looks like I could've purchased them from the local drugstore and glued them on. I wanted regular polish so I could change it after Valentine's Day, but had to leave with my nails wet because they have no drying station for regular polish. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
