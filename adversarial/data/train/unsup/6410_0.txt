Yeah, my flight from Sacramento to Houston was delayed by 1.5 hours.   No shit.   And what do they use for a plane to take us all the way across Texas?   A Canadian Bombardier.   Like an extended VW (classic) bug with wings.   Sheesh.   No wonder the price was so low.  \n\nBut it was fun.  \n\nWe got there late and alive.
