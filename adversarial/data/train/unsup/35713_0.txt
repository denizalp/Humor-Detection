My guy and I have been to Il Bosco twice now and it is quickly becoming one of our favorite pizza places.\n\nBoth times we got the meatball appetizer, a salad and a pizza. \n\nThe meatballs are delish - not spicy but very flavorful and the sauce is great for dipping the bread that they give you.\n\nWe've had the traditional Caesar and the kale spinach salad. Between the two we definitely preferred the kale spinach. The Caesar has a thinner dressing on it that isn't bad, it's just not the creamy Caesar I was hoping for. I believe the same dressing is on the kale spinach salad and it fits better with the thicker kale. Plus the kale spinach has pancetta on it - can't go wrong there.\n\nThe pizza is definitely the standout here. The crust is done perfectly - not charred and not soggy in the middle. The sauce has a nice flavor and the toppings are placed in just the right amount.\n\nThe owner has been there both times and is very warm and welcoming. On our second visit his son was our waiter and was very pleasant as well. The service is fast and the atmosphere friendly. \n\nWe will definitely be returning. How else would we become Il Bosco regulars?
