Delicious saag paneer roti served here! Creamy, spicy, spinachy goodness with bits of potato and cheese inside. Yummy.\n\nBut a word of warning: do not start eating your roti right away as it is still too hot. I made the grave mistake to not wait for my food to cool down and burned the roof of my mouth. It took days to heal. Painful. \n\nMother India is a great place to come to when you're craving a roti on Sunday because they're open.
