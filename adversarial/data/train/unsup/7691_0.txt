You're familiar with this pizza if you've patronized any of the typical mall food court pizza um choices.  The staff here is friendly and responsive enough but that doesn't get the place a higher score.  Bland flavor to be had if you decide this is where you must satisfy those pizzeria cravings.  \n\nUltra convenient based on location alone because it's right on the gambling floor and close to the parking garage so you'll pass it coming and going.\n\nIf you really have to have pizza, pasta or bread sticks right now, a stop here will tide you over but your taste buds might ask you to treat them better next time. \n\nCarb up!
