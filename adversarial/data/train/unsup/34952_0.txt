The staff is very friendly.  The space is small and is not the place to go to when your in a rush.  I would highly recommend the fajitas.  They are seasoned very well and by far the tastiest I have had.   The red salsa is good has a little tang to it.  I will not got to another place for fajitas.  I would recommend trying them.
