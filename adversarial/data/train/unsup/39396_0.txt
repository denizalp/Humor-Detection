Well this will be my last visit here.  I came a couple of years ago for pedicures and once I'd find a nail tech I liked, she left.  Lots of turnover.  But with recent Groupons for a pedicure and a facial, I decided I'd try it again.  Last week I had my pedicure and sure enough, new techs. She did an ok job (my big toe had bubbles on it).  However, even though it was 3:30 on a weekday afternoon, when I checked out and asked for change for a $20 to tip her, she said there was no change (she did open the cash drawer and there were only $20's).  None of the other girls in the spa\/salon had change either.  She came back and said she had a $10.  So reluctantly I tipped her $10 although I only intended on giving her $7.  Maybe not much difference, but the purpose of buying a Groupon is to SAVE MONEY!!!\n\nI went back this morning for my facial.  My aesthetician was nice enough.  However, I felt her movements were a little \"rough\".  It didn't hurt by any means, I'm just used to a gentler touch when getting facials.  Also, the overhead lights were bright and on the entire time except when she put a mask on my face and I could hear lots of noisy footsteps above.  After applying the mask, she worked on my hands.  While doing that, her cell phone rang (a loud funky ringtone)!  Although she said \"excuse me\" twice, she didn't attempt to turn it off.  While my mask did its thing and she had my hands moisturized and tucked under the covers, she left the room and returned twice.  The door was not a quiet one so of course I heard it clearly!  Then it was the end of my facial and she wiped off my face and hands.  Although my face felt good, it was not a relaxing experience!\n\nSo now to a new place . . .
