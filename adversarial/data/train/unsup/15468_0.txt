This Mediterranean restaurant has great food. I especially love their homemade soups!\n\nThe downside:\n\nThere is no table service (i.e., no wait staff). You order and pay with the cashier, take a number, and wait for your food to be brought to you by a food runner. You also help yourself to the beverages at the beverage station. Some people may not mind that there isn't table service. For me, it just feels a little like I should be in a fast food restaurant.\n\nThe cost is not proportionate for the size of the food order. Quality is not an issue. The food tastes great. I had a small bowl of homemade Pumpkin Mushroom soup for $6.00. The soup was fantastic - all 5-6 spoonfuls of it! He had a small Pomegranate Chicken Spinach Salad for $10.50 that is served on a small 7\" plate. The salad was a very good, high priced appetizer. I had the Lamb Roast Cabernet, which was heavenly for $13.00. He had the Lamb Souvlaki, which is a grilled lamb skewer for $12.00. It does not come with enough lamb to be worthy of the price. Entree's come with a miniature greek salad, rice, hummus & pita bread.\n\nThe ultimate self-serve fountain station costs $3.00 per person. The ambiance is nice - no complaints there.
