Cute Shop?  Check.\nTaste Great?  Check\nMoist Decedent Red Velvet Cake?  Priceless.\n\nThis girl loves A Bakeshop.  This place is simply adorable and aesthetically perfect.  I would love to have a girl tea party in this gorgeous bake shop.  \n\nI was fortunate enough to receive this cake as a gift from a friend who lives out of state.  Good deal, this bake shop allowed him to place the order of the phone and I picked it up when it was ready.  I am not a desserts person.  I've never been one to eat cake and cookies.  I put my fat-calories in salty foods like chips, hot wings, and French fries.  So, when it comes to cake, I usually eat the icing off the cake and then I toss the cake away.  I had a very different experience with this cake.  I tried to a full proper bite of this chocolate cake with a layer of strawberries in the middle and I was surprised to find it extremely moist.  I should have known that a cake that heavy would be packed with delicious moistness.  Ok, they have the moist factor down.  The cake itself tasted extremely delicious.  It didn't have that weird boxed chocolate taste.  It tasted very chocolate-y, without being over-bearing with the flavor.  \n\nThe best part of the cake, the icing, was a buttercream that was light and non-greasy and absolutely delicious.  It wasn't overly sweet, simply \"Just Right\".\n\nI also picked up a Red Velvet Cupcake... the still fell short of that taste I look for in a RVC.  Thus, 4 stars (I reserve the 5 star bakery reviews for the bakeries with the best RVCs).  This cake was extremely moist, with the absolute right approach to the taste.  The texture was perfect. The small morsels of chocolate were surprising and a nice touch.  The cream cheese frosting was perfectly done.  Although the taste was good, it lacked the taste I grew up with.  I need to try it again.  This could be a 5 star bakery.  I need a repeat.  :-)  I still think TCC has the best RVC in Phoenix.  \n\nReturn Factor: 90%
