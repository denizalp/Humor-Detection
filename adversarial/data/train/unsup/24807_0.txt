Damn straight! Hands down the BEST buffet I've hit in Las Vegas. Housed right in the incredibly swanky Cosmopolitan Hotel and Resort (note to self: stay there next year) the food matches the vibe... all for a pretty fantastic price (only $22 for lunch).\n\nFirst off, the food is pretty spot on! I had blackened Cod and rice (perfectly flakey), bacon (good bacon not Costco pre cooked bacon), salad, mac and cheese, smoked salmon, sausage, Kalbi (yes Kalbi... my love for K-BBQ was fulfilled), and of course some fantastic dessert... gelato, macrons, pecan tart, chocolate covered strawberries, and apple cobbler. A bit much? Then again it is Vegas, I can always come back to my diet when I come home. The food was presented tapas style, small plates and mini pots. Overall it's got some serious character. This was a fantastic buffet and well worth the price of admission. \n\nThe place is cute, the decor is nice and feels kinda swanky... sans the swanky price.\n\nI would go back again... and hey, next time I come round Vegas side, the Cosmo is where I'll stay...\n\n5 best-Vegas-buffet-by-far stars out of 5
