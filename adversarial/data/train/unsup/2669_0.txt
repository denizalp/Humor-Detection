Risking my life for a run-of-the-mill haircut....\n\nFirst of all, for those of you going to this great clips from Squirrel Hill: good luck.  Write a will.  Kiss your children goodbye, since making a left turn across Brown's Hill Road is about as safe as playing on the interstate with steak knives.\n\nGoing to this Great Clips is a little like playing haircut roulette: you never know what you're going to get.  I've been twice now, and once I got a pretty decent cut, and once, well, I kind of looked bald.\n\nThis last trip was actually pretty bad.  I went at about 10:00 and they had a line of five people, with two stylists.  They said it would be about 20 minutes.  It was actually about an hour.  And the sad thing is several people came in after me, and at one time, the line was seven people long, and they always said it would be 20 minutes.  20 minutes seems to be the standard answer, so take it with a grain of salt.\n\nWhile I was there, I did see one nice thing: they fix bad haircuts for free.  An old lady came in unhappy with her cut, and they got her in right then.  (No waiting in line for re-do's, apparently.)  The stylist was very sweet with her and fixed it for free.  I kind of wish I had known they fix bad haircuts, but then again, there's not much you can do when your hair's so short it looks bald.  Eh.  It grows out, right?
