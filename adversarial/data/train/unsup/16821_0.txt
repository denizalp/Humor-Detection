When I saw that Butters had opened, I instinctively pictured pancakes topped with lots of butter.   In actuality, Butters is a lot like Butterfield's (apparently owned by the same people), with a great selection of egg dishes and skillets.  However, the decor at Butters is sleek and modern, instead of the carpety, flowery, old people-y look of Butterfield's.  There's also a nice patio.  On the flip side, the staff wasn't quite as friendly.  They were competent, just not overly friendly.  Like Butterfield's, Butters is quite busy on weekends.  We waited about 30 minutes.  The Village Roastery in the same plaza is a great place to enjoy some coffee while waiting for a table at Butters.
