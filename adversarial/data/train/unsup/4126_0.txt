Peeeeewwww!!! (as my thumb and forefinger are instinctively squeezing both nostrils together) I'm not sure what smell that was that hit me in the face while walking through the front door, but whatever it was, I hope it doesn't stick to my clothes. Some type of mix between urine and reptile???!!! Regardless, I stayed long enough to realize their prices we're just as inflated as the other guys, so I wont be back. Even the clearance stuff by the front door wasn't priced low enough to make me want to endure the \"WHAT THE FUNK\" smell any longer. Too bad. I did happen to notice they had several cats up for adoption. Those were reasonably priced, but I've already rescued 3 and bringing another adult cat into my insane asylum would only create even more mayhem.
