I'm embarrassed to say that I had never embraced beautiful High Park until this past July. It just seemed so big, daunting and a little too far west for my tastes. Well shame on me, because the travel is worth it for this world-class patch of grass, fun and tomfoolery. \n\nIf you don't know this beast it's easy to get lost. Dog paths, paddle boats, zoos and giant uninterrupted green spaces. Perfect for drinking old grape juice with friends, but make sure one of you knows the park... otherwise it will take you years (and tears) to find each other. No amount of Google map pin drops or texted tree photos will help you.
