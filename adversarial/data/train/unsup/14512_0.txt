It's expensive to go to school here, but I love it. \nThe campus is small compared to other large colleges.\nParking SUCKS. You have to go really early like before 10 or it's packed.\nThe math teachers pretty much suck...\nI had really good english professors.\nRatemyprofessor.com is pretty on point for their teachers.\nI don't hate it, but there are so many things that can be improved.\nI mean, where's all our money going to anyway?...\nOh I know, those random little ipad screens in front of the study rooms that just say the room number and have no purpose whatsoever.
