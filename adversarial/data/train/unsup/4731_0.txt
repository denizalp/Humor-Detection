If you are looking for an agent who is knowledgeable, genuinely helpful, & prompt in all aspects of purchasing property - Allison is your girl! \n\nWe recently purchased a home in Henderson as we were relocating from California - since neither of us knew anything of the Las Vegas\/Henderson area, it was important to us to have someone we could be candid with in asking questions about the various areas and help us determine where we would best fit in this desert. She's been extremely helpful even after we purchased the property with the various services we've needed to obtain! \n\nIt doesn't get much better than working with an enjoyable person whose work makes them happy. \n\nWe even came home to a welcome package from her. I can't say enough good things about her.
