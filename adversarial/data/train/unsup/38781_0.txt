I like everything that I have ordered so far.  My new place for Chinese food.  My kids are Orange Chicken freaks so we had that.  I think it had a good balance between sweet and spicy.  Maybe more spicy but I think they ask you if you want it spicy.  We also got the Emperor's Chicken.  That will now be another staple in my household.  Definitely give this place a try.  It's clean and very roomy but cozy. Can't wait to try more dishes.
