This place is terrible!\nI heard they made an incredible pizza. I've lived between Beantown and NY most my life, so I've had my fair share of good pies.\nI waited well over an hour to receive what could best be described as a Digiorno frozen pizza. \nI actually think it was a digiorno frozen pizza. It was about the same size, same texture, same flavor, same everything. It was not good or filling to say the least.\nThen there was the antipasto salad that cost almost $9. It was simply a handful of lettuce topped with what appeared to be a lukewarm, hand-shredded, Kraft single piece of cheese, and a piece of sandwich ham shredded placed on a small sheet of saran wrap placed in a small pizza box. I thought maybe this was all to go with their \"apocalyptic\" vibe. But then thought, can't be. I paid close to $30 for this crap. Will definitely never return and I would not suggest this dump to anybody. Oh, also, the bartender chic was not very polite, prompt, or proficient and as I was leaving she practically had her hand out looking for a tip. No, I did not tip.
