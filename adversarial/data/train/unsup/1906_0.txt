CityNorth in North Phoenix is the latest mixed use development to blend the idea of - Live, Work, Play.  Kierland Commons and the Scottsdale Waterfront were the two big players in this market, until now.  CityNorth is bringing the idea together slowly and Blue Martini will fit right into the mix.\n\nBe forewarned - there is a dress code!  I walked through the velvet ropes for the pre-opening shindig on Thursday evening, but there were a few men that didn't make the cut!  They had on T-shirts!\n\nThe patio is situated well and it has it's own bar that flows nicely.  The drinks were small though, ordered a Tanqueray & Tonic and it came in a 6 oz. glass packed with ice.  Not a lush, but I appreciate a mixed drink served appropriately for $8.\n\nThe band was decent, wasn't really paying attention to them.  Their setup is behind a bar and they have 4-5 members in the group.  There is a small dance area nearby also.  \n\nI realize that Phoenix and Scottsdale cater to crowds and it is nice to retreat from them, BUT ...   There were 2 areas for VIP's, with the ropes , guy in a dark suit looking important and cocktail servers.  It was odd for me to see a VIP area in a restaurant\/lounge\/bar, that's all I'm saying.  The women that cocktail here are hired for their assets, its quite apparent what the mandatory requirements are for this place. Yes, they have to fill out the corset - completely!\n\nI would give it another chance and actually have dinner here.  That's the DL for now...
