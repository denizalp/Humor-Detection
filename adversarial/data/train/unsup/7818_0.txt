Ted Turner is in the bison farming business and what a good way to, in part, further profiting by opening your restaurant chain that serves, you guessed it,  bison.  I wish that at least for this location they focused more on timely food service.   Seriously,  we were sat at 630p per our reservation but didn't get the meals till 830p.  Disappointing.   Plus we were celebrating my wifes birthday and hoping for a great time with family and friends, and  it just compounded the frustration I felt.  But, we still had a great time with our friends to whom I owe the 5 stars versus Teds. \nThe ambiance of this location is great (5\/5) and being a new store it was contemporary in design and the seating was laid out nicely.  Albeit the interior was smaller than I imagined it would be.  And the entrance does seem to be oddly located as noted in another review. \nOur server did an overall good job (4\/5) and apologetic when advising us the kitchen was just backed up, although the restaurant didn't seem that crazy from a volume perspective.\nThe food was good (4\/5) but many felt it wasn't quite worth the wait or wasn't to the quality that the restaurant claimed to offer.\nBut no felt it was a three star though.  I think the poor kitchen service time impacted the tastebuds for some. Our server did offer some free chips which was nice though. And he did a good job in bringing out the birthday cake cut and ready to serve with a single candle.\nMy wife was overall happy and given we were there 3 hours that's all I can ask for.
