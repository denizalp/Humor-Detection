When we arrived to Vegas, I decided to check out Groupon deals and sure enough this place popped up. \n\nWhen looking at the menu on Groupon it showed 2 vegan breakfast wrap options. When we arrived to place our order they only had one. Oh well...we decided to go with the Tofu Soyrizo Spinach wrap. We still had money left over and was going to get the Tortilla soup but it was considered a lunch item and not part of the groupon deal. \n\nWe asked the cashier what else on the breakfast menu is vegan? He said the oatmeal, parfait and our wrap. We just had oatmeal that morning so we weren't in the mood. We double checked with him if the parfait is vegan because it said \"yogurt\" on the menu. He said yes, so we assumed it was a soy or coconut base...Oh HELL NO!! We later found out after taking several bites, me running to the restroom all night and calling them back that it had dairy. Not a happy girl. \n\nThis point I would give them a hater review but the wrap was actually good. Maybe it was a training error on the managers part. \n\nI would recommend the Tofu Soyrizo wrap. It was very flavorful. Right amount of \"sauce\", preventing it from being dry. The added side  of tofu fries compliments the wrap. \n\nVegan-avoid the parfait and Everyone else-definitely order the parfait. Although we were \"snaked\" the granola and the large amount of yogurt and fruit can make this a fulfilling meal.
