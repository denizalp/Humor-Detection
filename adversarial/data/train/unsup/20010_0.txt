I truly honestly like Kusina Ni Lorraine.  The workers are friendly and very quick service.  \n\nI've been here a couple of times to pick up food while heading out to a friends home around the area.  I've had the following dishes: \nPancit\nSisig\nCascaron (I know tagalog is different) \nChicken Skin\nand some other dishes that I don't know what it's called.  \n\nOverall, a nice place to get your point point on and pick up some small Filipino\/Asian items.
