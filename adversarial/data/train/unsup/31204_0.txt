Came here for a drink and dinner when I had a layover because all the other restaurants were busy and had a wait (which made sense in hindsight). Asked the waitress and seated myself. Waited for 15 minutes hoping to catch her attention but she was just way too distracted with her phone. I noticed a couple of other customers near me who were experiencing the same and growing impatient. I truly do not understand the point of the devices they have on the table if it doesn't get service. I walked out after waiting and went to another restaurant.
