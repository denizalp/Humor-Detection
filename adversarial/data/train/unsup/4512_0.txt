This was one place I wanted to try before I left Las Vegas.  I went here for breakfast and was disappointed.  I was only the second customer in the restaurant and ordered a basic breakfast of eggs, potatoes, bacon, and toast.  The problem began when my breakfast was placed on my table.  I ordered my eggs over medium.  They were not only incompletely cooked, but were completely runny\/snotty\/disgusting eggs.  This place touts their breakfast but can't cook eggs properly.  I won't be back.  It just wasn't very good.
