Awesome place! I enjoy coming here to get my Korean ingredients when I'm feeling some soondubu or bulgogi. The vegetables are always fresh just like the meat and they also have a wide array of snacks, seasonings and cooked food ready to go. Whenever I come here, I always get the fish cakes and potstickers plus a new small container of kimchi:o) \n\nI forgot to mention that they also sell complete sets of Korean plates, pots, rice cookers and other stuff you use in your kitchen. It's the place to load up on portable gas cans for your gas burners. On your way out, try the multiple restaurants they have outside and the customer service is always good.
