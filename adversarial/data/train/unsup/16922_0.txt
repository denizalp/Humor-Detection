Little known fact, there are very few things I love more than breakfast. So for obvious reasons it was on the top of my very long list bookmarks. A word to the wise, come early and come hungry! There will be a wait but it's worth it. Better than the cracked egg, the egg & I, egg works...basically anyplace with the word egg in it. Lol! (IMO anyway) :p \n\nFriendly staff and lots of Hawaiian inspired dishes. I just love the aloha vibe here which makes sense since Vegas is the 9th island. Zippy's chili (If you've been to HI before then you already know what I'm taking about), portuguese sausage with garlic rice, macadamia pancakes, spam & eggs, adobo fried rice omelette, and the list goes on. It's easy to see why baby stacks stands out from the pack. So Ono! \n\nAnother notable mention are the red velvet pancakes. But my all time favorite are the bananas foster pancakes. OMG!!! Ahhh-mazing!
