I like their cheesesteaks.  They were decent and tasted good.  The cheesesteaks were good enough for me to go back and try again.  I also enjoyed their Italian Sub.  It was authentic enough to the ones I remember growing up on in New Jersey.  One thing I won't order again are the garlic fries.  I don't know what it was that they put on it.  Was it like a garlic mayo?  Definitely not like Gordon Bierch's garlic fries.  They still reign supreme.
