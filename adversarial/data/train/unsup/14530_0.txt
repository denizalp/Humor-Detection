Growing up in Hawaii, my boyfriend & I loved visiting the Dole Plantation with our families. As locals though, you never really visit tourist locations unless you had visitors (Just like us Las Vegas locals who rarely go to the Strip). When we moved here, we always had random Dole Whip cravings, especially on those extremely hot Las Vegas summer days. We would always talk about how much we regret not getting enough Dole Whips as kids & we should have cherished the opportunity back then. We only satisfied it once here on the mainland during a trip to Disneyland & we were in Dole Whip heaven! \n\nI think my boyfriend & I almost cried tears of joy upon finding out about Pineapple Park LV because we are Dole Whip fanatics & with its huge success & fan base, I'm glad it is here to stay. They have the friendliest owners & such delicious choices on the menu to try. \n\nI think I should end this quite dramatic review for Pineapple Park & look at the photos since I have a random craving right now. :) In conclusion, GO VISIT PINEAPPLE PARK. Alooooha!
