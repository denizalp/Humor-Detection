A friend of mine recently had a contract and spent a few months in Montreal. She mentioned this magical, delicious, highly addictive little bakery on Fairmont and I thought...mmmm...where? What's it called? I had never heard of it! For various reasons I was never able to make it there until...today.\n\nOh mon dieu!! She recommended the classic croissant. Said it was the best she'd had in the city. And she's a foodie so...today when I went in I ordered a few things to sample: croissant, chocolatine, danish (sadly they were out! next time...), \"brioche a tete\" (chouette! their signature creation) and for kicks a gluten free chocolate brownie. I ordered an espresso (most reasonable price in the neighborhood, fair trade, and DELICIOUS...so flavourful no sugar necessary!) and sat down with \"the croissant.\" ($1.50\/ea)\n\nYes, it was crispy and buttery and divine on the outside and the interior denser but very, very good. The chocolatine was also delicious but I imagine it's best fresh out of the oven when the chocolate is warm. The brioche -  I'm not normally a fan although savoury ones I enjoy from time to time - was simple but tasty and terribly cute to look at. Not sweet, not savoury...somewhere in between. I kept thinking it would be yummy with some creme fraiche and smoked trout\/capers and a roquette salad (my stomach is grumbling as I'm typing this!). The only thing that was only \"good\" was the gluten free brownie. It was a little on the dry side and could have used more chocolate. But I imagine since they are traditional bakers from France they are only beginning to experiment with gluten free recipes. \n\nOh my...I just checked their facebook and they also sell \"délicieuses confitures maison.\" \nFramboises - bleuets\/eau de roses - canneberges\/oranges  ($5.25-7.00\/ea)\nAinsi que notre fameuse tartinade de caramel au beurre salé ($5.75) \n\nThere were also savouries on the menu - meat pies, quiche, pizzas - and other classic sweets like chocolate fondant, Paris brest etc. Highly recommend this cozy little bakery and look forward to my next visit!
