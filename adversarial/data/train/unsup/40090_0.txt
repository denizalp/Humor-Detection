I didn't want to have to be the first review since mine won't be great, but it has to be done. I've gone here a BUNCH of times.. The staff is ok (not super friendly but not rude either) but the biggest issue is that I have never once, seriously, received a good drink from here. I only get an iced coffee sweetened with breve, SIMPLE! It is ALWAYS extremely strong, barely any half and half, and almost no sweetener. I go to a bunch of locations so I know how it should taste. Some of the time My boss would pick up my drink so I couldn't even have them remake it since I'm not there when it's made. It's a bummer because this particular location is right by my work. I now stop at a different location which is a little more of a hassle. Hopefully they can get it together soon.
