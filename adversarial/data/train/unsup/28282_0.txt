The best day to come to Venetian is during weekdays...less crowded and you get to spend more time walking without bumping anyone as you walk.\n\nI love the Phantom of the Opera and been here 2x within the span of 5 yrs.  We like window shopping at the Canal. \n\nBut overall, it does get tiring after sometime...if you've been here more than 5x in your lifetime, you will yearn for a different things to do\/see.
