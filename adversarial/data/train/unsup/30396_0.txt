Very good service. Friendly staff.\n\nI got the Thai and vanilla twist in a cup. The Thai ice cream didn't have as much flavour as kekou gelato. I had a sample of the hojicha ice cream and found that to be delicious. Will be back to try their Asian flavours!\n\nLimited seating. \n\nSome of their menu limits are made to order so it will take around 15 minutes. I got my soft serve right away.\n\nAccepts credit card.
