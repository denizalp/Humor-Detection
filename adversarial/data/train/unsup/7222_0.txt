This place is a dream world for those who love M&M's or like to collect M&M items. This place is near the MGM Grand and Coca Cola Store (can't miss that big bottle on the Vegas Strip). \n\nI was amazed at how many items they have in here. This place has four floors and I saw a number of people walking the strip with M&M shopping bags. My curiosity was piqued so I had to take a look. I have coworkers who would love this store since they like to collect M&M's items. Great place to get chocolate wasted!
