Definitely number three on my list of hotels in Vegas -- Wynn and TheHotel at Mandalay Bay are both better.\n\nWynn offers unrivaled views from all of their rooms.  Venetian offered us a view of the roof of their casino as well as their parking garage -- it inspired us to keep our drapes closed the entire time.  I'm also not a fan of the single-room suite -- that's not a suite -- just a large room.\n\nBest things about the Venetian are the location and the shopping, but you don't have to stay there to experience either of those things.\n\nWynn rivals it on all levels -- no question that's where I'll stay the next time I'm in Vegas.
