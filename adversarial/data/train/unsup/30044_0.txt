I am puzzled, beyond puzzled at the 4-5 star reviews.  My son and I along with a friend and her girls headed up to Odysea Mirror Maze after my friend purchased a Groupon.  I knew of Butterfly Wonderland but not the maze so we thought we would give it a try.  The Groupon was good for 4 but we had 5 people total so I purchased one extra ticket.  The ticket was $10 plus tax for an \"all day pass\".  This was just for the maze and not for the laser maze which would be extra.  We enter the maze and there are lights flashing, thunder, then you walk over a bridge and behind some black curtains you enter a maze.  We went through the maze in about 5 minutes (just a series of mirrors and lights flashing, monkey noises, etc.).  We came out the exit door back into the lobby and we were shocked.  That was it??  $10 tickets for a few minutes in a maze?  I am not sure who would spend all day here to walk into the maze over and over again.  No fun at all.  Our kids were confused as well and done after they went twice.  \n\nSummary: Don't bother!  We felt very ripped off.  I could see this maze being part of the whole Butterfly Wonderland as a ticket package or couple dollar add-on but as a separate attraction with that ticket price?  No way, sorry.  We will not be back.
