I have been here on 2 separate occasions. The first was to have a dining experience and to be honest I was not impressed at all. We had a reservation and ended up waiting an additional 30 minutes for our table. That drives me crazy and is usually a bad sign.\n\nIt took a while to get our wine and place our order. I really don't feel that it was that busy. Here is a list of the items ordered:\n\nApps: Calamari Chorizo, Polenta, Arugula, Hand-cut Wagyu Tartare* Crostini\n\nSalad: Italian Buffalo Mozzarella Hazelnuts, Warm Fris√©e* Farm Egg, Smoked Bacon\n\nEntrees: 8 oz. New York Strip, Japan, 24 hour Shortrib Cipollini Onion\n\nSides: Braised Kale Bacon, White Beans, Bordelaise, Potato Gratin Roasted Garlic Cream\n\nDesserts: Peanut Butter Mousse and Clemence Pie\n\nIt took a wile to get our food and the food was just okay. Nothing stood out at me as amazing. I was expecting a lot more from this place. \n\nMy second visit was just for drinks. I was happy to just get to the bar. I ordered the Key Lime Martini and Cucumber Gin Martini. Both were really good and I would definitely return back for drinks, food probably not.
