this is the first time i have ever decided to try out the actual authentic korean BBQ grilling experience instead of the canadian-nized all-you-can grill buffets and ohhh boy was it the best choice of my life! this place is not all you can eat so you only have a choice from eating one type of meat or the other but oh my gooodness, the meat here was sooo tender and juicy with sooooo much flavour to them! i swear to you this place serves up the best Galbi (beef short ribs) i have ever eaten and i'm sooo upset i didn't know about it soooner!! the Galbi here is ACTUAL MEAT, not the blubber stick of fat you'd find at other restaurants! \nthe special grilling dish costs about $40 between 2 people (so basically $20 each) and it is sooo worth it as the portions are sooo huge along with all those side dishes they give you (more than 5! which can be refilled whenever you want) with also a hot stone tofu soup on the side. this place will give you a run for your money! serving on the menu says only for 2 people but can definetly serve up to 4! there was so much stuff left over to eat but in the end i wasn't able to finish it. :( so if you're ever craving for real korean meat, come here! this place uses the terms QUALITY AND QUAINTITY. yum!
