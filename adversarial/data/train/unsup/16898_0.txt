I'm so disappointed. I've heard about this place since I was a kid. So when my boyfriend wanted to go somewhere nice for our anniversary, I said we should go. He called and made a reservation 6 weeks in advance, asking for a table with a view of the water since it was our anniversary. They said they would make a note of it. Fast forward to when we get there. They seat us at this table in the middle of the room far from any window. We ask to move since we requested a view. Were told they could not accommodate it. So we sat down disappointed but hopeful. The only acknowledgment of our anniversary was a paper menu with \"happy anniversary\" written on it. And as if the lack of view wasn't enough to ruin the romance, we were seated surrounded by other booths adjacent to ours where we could easily hear our neighbors. And the decor left a LOT to be desired. I felt like I was eating dinner on a bad cruise ship. Didn't help that over 50% of the people there were 70 or older. You just couldn't have asked for a less romantic atmosphere.\n\nWe were hoping the food would at least wow us to make up for the atmosphere. It didn't. It wasn't terrible; but it was nothing to get excited about. I also asked for Parmesan cheese for my seafood pasta dish, and waited about 15 minutes for it, at which point I had already eaten most of it just so my boyfriend and I could get out of there quick enough to see the sunset on the lake from Edgewater-- since we couldn't see it from our table-- which was the point.\n\nLet me save you from a night like ours-- there are SO many wonderful restaurants in Tremont, Ohio City, Downtown where they will make your romantic or celebratory evening special. Don't choose this place.
