Its difficult to review the service center without reviewing the car brand. We bought our Tesla back in 2013 when the company was still fairly new. Now, we have over 100k miles on the car and it still drives like the day we picked it up. The battery lost about 10% of capacity over the years but we never had to worry about not having enough juice.  Nowadays, there are lots of super chargers all over so its never an issue. \n\nThis service center have grown over the years. There are more staff to accommodate bigger market in Phoenix area. The service itself is top notch. They do everything from picking up the car and deliver to anywhere you ask them to. They also take care of the problem first time. In fact, they have diagnosed a problem over the airways. Updates to the software are downloaded to the car automatically so having it serviced is very few and far between. \n\nJust love everything about Tesla...the cars and the brand.
