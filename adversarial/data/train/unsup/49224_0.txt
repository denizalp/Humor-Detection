My grandmother just turned 90, and we took 22 total friends and family to brio to celebrate.  It was a great experience.  The service was exceptional, everyone's drink was full, everyone's food came out hot and at the same time.  They served a cake that we brought.  I think their chipotle chicken panini available for lunch is one of the best sandwiches around.  The bruschetta quattro appetizer is excellent as well.  I have had 4-5 meals at brio, and each one I leave feeling happy and that I got my money's worth.  Is it the best food ever created?  No.  Some people on these review sites expect two start michellin experiences for less than $20.    I would strongly recommend you consider brio for a meal or a family party, our experience was outstanding.
