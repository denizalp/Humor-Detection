The last time we visited Vegas it seemed like every casino added a gourmet burger type place to their restaurant collection. There is ABX American Burger in Excalibur, BLT Burger in Mirage and Gordon Ramsay BurGR in Planet Hollywood just to name a few. This time we decided to try Holsteins for their adult milkshakes. Also my husband had been here before so of course I had to try it after all his rants and raving.\n\nWe came in for dinner on a Friday evening around 5:30pm. It wasn't too busy so we were seated right away. After taking some time to decide I went with the Rising Sun Burger and Oreo Shake. The burger was one of the best I've had of it's kind. It wasn't as big as burger from Red Robin but remember its quality over quantity. The patty was fresh and juicy, cooked medium as requested. The Rising Son had Kobe Beef, Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Spicy Mayo, and Tempura Avocado  The fries were crisp, golden, hand cut thick fries. I liked that they stayed crispy and weren't oily.\n\nThe Oreo shake tasted good but didn't seem to stand out from anything else I had before. I didn't even feel any of the alcohol. Maybe it was because I was full from eating or needed a double shot since the alcohol was Bailey's Irish Cream.\n\nThe restaurant was clean and service outstanding. Burgers are a little pricey but your getting a way better quality burger than Red Robin and hey it's Vegas! If anything stop in and have a shake. The shake menu is pretty extensive and I haven't heard anything bad about any of them myself. The other two shakes ordered at our table that night were the Creme Brulee and Black Cow. My husband says S'mores is still his favorite.   Whether or not I'm staying the Cosmopolitan the next time I visit I'd eat here again.
