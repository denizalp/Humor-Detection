We came here because we live across the street and really wanted to have some yummy food close by. \nWe ordered crab puffs and spring rolls\/egg rolls (depending on your menu), crab puffs were a huge disappointment not enough crab meat or cream cheese.  The spring roll was ok tasting but it didn't have a lot inside of it.  \nThere is no children's menu, I find that not to be family friendly, we ordered garlic noodles minus the mushrooms and sliced BBQ pork for my kids.  When the garlic noodles and BBQ pork came out it looked and smelled delicious, and they were both tasty.  BUT halfway through eating the garlic noodles my daughter noticed a DEAD fly in the noodles, yuck!  So they took the noodles and remade them but I was disappointed that they still charged us for the noodles.  \nMy husband and I split the orange shrimp which had way too much breading and tiny shrimp inside.  They also skimped on the orange sauce which I would loved to have more of.  \nOverall disappointment...will not be back.
