Great Mexican joint in Old Town Scottsdale! Visited last night with my friend and we were pleasantly surprised. There was a 30 minute wait since we didn't have a reservation, but we decided to sit in the bar instead. At first the service was a little slow, but as dinner went on it was much better. \n\nWe both just ordered soda, so I cannot comment on the margaritas, but the bartender was cranking them out and they all looked delicious! Such a variety of tequila and drinks on their menu. \n\nWe started with the guacamole which was very fresh and topped with pomegranate seeds. It's the perfect combination! Their salsas were a little too watery, but good flavor. \n\nThere were so many things on the menu that we wanted to try, but decided on the Steak Burrito with refried beans and the Combo #5. The burrito was huge and covered with red enchilada sauce. The steak was cooked well and the beans were definitely homemade which is a huge plus for me. The Combo #5 was a Tinga taco, cheese enchilada, beans and rice. Everything was a hit!\n\nWill definitely return to try some of the tacos and the happy hour which is every day from 3-7pm!
