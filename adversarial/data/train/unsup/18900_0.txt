Tasty place! My coworkers picked this place out for lunch recently, and I'm always down to try (like always), a place where i'd never eaten. \n$8 gets you an 11\" pie with pre-selected ingredients, or choose-your-own-ingredients. Although the pre-selected veggie and meat pizzas sounded good, I went ahead and choose my own toppings just as my coworkers did. One gal even did half tomato sauce\/half pesto!\nIt's a fairly simple process- wait in line, tell one employee what sauce\/dough you want, another what cheese you want, etc etc... Just like Subway! \nIn a few minutes time wait while the pie cooks, be sure to grab a table. Those are in short supply during the lunch hour. The amount of toppings and sauce are perfect, and I love the thin crust! The crust would be even better if it was crispier\/more firm so the toppings would stay in place. Cannot wait to eat at this place in the future.
