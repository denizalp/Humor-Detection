In a word, eh. \n\nThe only consistent comment I've received is that the donuts are sweet, too sweet. \n\nPick one, any one, they basically all taste the same, overly sugary and rich. \n\nYou should be able to differentiate between a red velvet donut vs. a chocolate donut, but the only impression it leaves is a bloat in your stomach.\n\nSelections are not as outrageous as you'd think either. Basically the same style of donuts decorated a dozen different ways and toppings. \n\nAesthetically pleasing to the eye, but not necessarily memorable otherwise. \n\nAll donuts are priced the same, exception being the long John's. \n\nThey boast being open 25 hrs a day, 8 days a week on their essentially worthless website, with no other information other than existing chain fb links.
