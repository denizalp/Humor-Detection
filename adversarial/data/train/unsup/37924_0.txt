Very friendly, knowledgeable, and customer service-oriented for support in water quality systems service & sales.  Servisoft has always been good to us - accommodating and fair in all our purchases.  We have absolutely no doubt we're getting excellent reliability and that if we ever have problems that Mike and his team will be there to stand by the products and services they provide. \n\nServisoft is a humble organization nestled in the small town of Middlefield.  By the way they talk and act, you'd never know they install massive industrial, agricultural, and government water systems throughout the country.  But they're not too big to extend a handshake nor too busy to work out a good deal for the local resident with a little water softener system.\n\nEvery 1st Saturday of the month they have a salt sale which is extremely popular with residents.  They have it set up with pallets and employees in the parking lot so you pay while your car\/truck gets loaded.  No minimum purchase!\n\nServisoft also offers a wide range of softener and RO equipment, tanks, filters and parts, and jugs of both distilled & drinking water.\n\nIf you have any water quality issues at all, give Servisoft a call for honest and dependable solutions.
