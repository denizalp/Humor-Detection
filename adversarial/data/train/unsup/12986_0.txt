So I have been here Twice.\n\nBoth on first dates. [Maybe I should switch that up].\n\nEither way. Both times, this has been a good Date Place. Nice atmosphere. Friendly staff. Good selection of wine. A bit fancy, but not obscene. [obscenely nice...]\n\nWhat I don't like about this place. It's missing something from being just that next step nice. the staff are friendly, but not loving it there [ so it seems]. Their fondue is sad. The pot is delivered with a little tea light under it. WHAT IS A TEA LIGHT GOING TO HELP KEEP BOILING.\nSuch a fail.\n\nApparently their Mac and Cheese is supposed to be delicious, but I have never had a chance to try them [Thanks first dates girls who didn't part-take].\n\nAnywhoo. I have had their Muscles and Oysters and i don't know a good one from a bad one, so i will say they were okay.\n\nHit this place up for a date. A cheese plate. Their infamous Mac and Cheese which I have not had, or for some wine. Either way, not out of your way expense, and the atmosphere matches.
