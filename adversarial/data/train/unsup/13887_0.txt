Since moving to Las Vegas from Los Angeles, I have noted a SERIOUSLY DISTURBING lack of good, quality Mexican food in Las Vegas. \n\nLindo tries to bridge some of that gap and does hit the mark with a few aspects, but completely misses the bus with others.\n\nPositives:\n\nFood is okay. It's Mexican food. Not like abuela used to make, but it's good. I recommend their toro a la coca cola and their mole poblano. \n\nThe environment is awesome. It's loud, but fun! Come here for your birthday and they sing and play music for you and throw a shot of tequila down your throat. \n\nStaff is always friendly and attentive. If you need something, there is usually always someone there to assist you with your request.\n\nNegatives:\n\nThe wait. Expect to wait no less then 20 minutes if you're coming here for dinner. We've encountered waits in excess of an hour, at which point we go somewhere else.\n\nTheir rice. Would someone please explain their \"mexican rice\" to me? Copious amounts of peas and carrots in my mexican rice?! I didn't order Zatarains. I came here for Mexican food. Mexican rice I guess can have some veggies in it like that, but not like theirs.\n\nThe prices. I get paying good money for great food, but I have trouble justifying their prices with the quality that you're getting. Again, it's GOOD food. It just isn't worth what their charging. Especially being in the industry and having a general knowledge of what their actual cost is on a lot of their items. \n\n\n\nWould I come back here? Yes, I would. If I was in Los Angeles, I would say hell no because I would have other options for FANTASTIC Mexican food. But there aren't many options here in Vegas, so Lindo quenches my thirst for Mexican food when the need arises.\n\nWould I recommend this place to others? Yes, as long as they aren't from somewhere I know has great Mexican food.
