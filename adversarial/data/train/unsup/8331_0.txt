Noise upstairs I hear people walking back and forth constantly I pretty much think there's no walls, I made several complains and nothing is done to stop it!! top of that parking there is soo horrible!! I have to park like 4 buildings down for a parking. I wouldn't recommend living it's way overpriced especially when you can't  even park couple feet away from your door \nBiggest mistake ever to rent here I rather go rent at elevate or dream or matter in fact go to Elysian they are way better for everything!!! The view at horizon is a complete joke!!
