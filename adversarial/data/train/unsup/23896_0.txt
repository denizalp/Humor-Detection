Let me start by saying MAKE AN APPOINTMENT! \n\nI'm so glad I did because there were already a few people waiting when we come in for my son's first haircut at 10:30 in the morning. The space is open and clean and very kid friendly. There is a little table with a train track set to keep the little ones busy.\n\nI love that the chairs are Power Wheels that actually work; horn honks and wheels turn. There are also regular chairs for the older ones or if your little one wants to sit in your lap instead. They have TVs at every station. My son loves Moana, so that kept him occupied. The stylist (forgot her name) was very friendly and asked how we wanted our son's haircut. She was very patient and gentle when he would turn his head, as little ones do when they get distracted. Since this was his very first haircut, we received a certificate with his picture and a tiny piece of his hair. The cut turned out great and my little one looks so handsome. \n\nWhat's awesome is that they log what they did into their computer so when you return again, they already know how to cut it. $20 for baby's first haircut and certificate. $17 for regular haircuts. Not bad at all. \n\nI will definitely be back in the future to have my son's haircut again.
