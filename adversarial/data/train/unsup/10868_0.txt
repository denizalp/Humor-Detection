The name of this place pretty much sums up what the experience was like...\n\nI was driving home with some friends after a very good weekend in Vegas. We stopped for gas and I wanted to get something to drink for the 5 hour drive. I enter this mini mart (labeled \"Terrible's Video Poker\" lol) and the line is at least 20 people long. Okay, that's sort of understandable because everyone is driving home from Vegas.\n\nWhat wasn't understandable was how long it took the line to move and how many people were on duty while this long line was building up. There were FIVE people standing behind the counter. One was ringing up guests, one looked like she was training another, and two were just messing around. That's complete BS. 1) If it's busy, you can stop training someone and ring up a few customers. 2) If you aren't doing anything when you obviously should be doing something, then you are USELESS and you should be FIRED.\n\nOh yea, the floor was nasty. Someone should really clean that ish up.
