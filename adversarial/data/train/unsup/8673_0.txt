In the mood for some high-end ramen? If yes, then this is the place for you. My girlfriend and I like to consider ourselves ramen connoisseurs and thus we have high expectations when it comes to broth and noods. \nWe both ordered the chickpea ramen and added shiitake mushrooms to it. The mushrooms were OUT OF THIS WORLD. The noodles were fresh and encompassed the perfect amount of chew. The broth was light yet flavorful. However, beware chickpeas can make one rather gaseous...so make sure you're comfortable with your significant other if you choose to take them there. \nPro tip: ask to sit near the window. There is a beautiful view of the strip.
