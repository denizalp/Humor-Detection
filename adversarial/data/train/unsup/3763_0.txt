Went to last nights performance of The Diary of Anne Frank. If any of you remember reading this book in school, the play was such a stellar rendition!\n\nAs soon as you enter after getting your tickets. In the main room was an Exhibit. Featuring -The Secret Annex,  in which Anne documents her life in hiding from 1942 to 1944, during the German occupation of the Netherlands in World War II.\n\nBeautiful theater with balcony seating. Plush, soft red velvety seats. Comfortable for the 2 hours of pure entertainment.\n\nThere is a thrill in seeing live actors perform right there for you, instead of on camera & TV. Everything that is happening is real and in this case tells a story of a real historical happenings. I think that theaters provide a particular refreshing atmosphere. It's a fantastic experience.\n\nFYI- Audiotape and videotape recording is forbidden. Cell phones must be turned off or on silent during the show. Alcohol and non alcoholic drinks are allowed in the auditorium\/ no food.\n\nStanding Ovations was well deserved for these outstanding actors @ the end of the show.\nThoroughly enjoyed it.
