If you're a teenager and need a date night spot because you're not allowed into the bars yet and too poor to hit up a fancy restaurant with your new girlfriend yet, then you're probably at Bubblemania Cafe. Seriously, I felt like a chaperone in the sea of teens all hangin' out and drinking bubble tea-staff included.\n\nThe selection of bubble teas and drinks is impressive, though if you're in need of a drink without dairy, the selection diminishes a great deal. Bubble tea is available with pearls or lychee jelly. Flip the menu over and you've got your choice of appies to order as well. Apparently the Korean wings are the new thing to try. The girl at the till told us we absolutely had to come back on wing night to try them (wing night is Monday-Wednesday).\n\nMaybe those Korean wings will up this to a 4 star... or maybe not visiting it on a Saturday night... or both! Either way, I'll be headed back to try those wings.
