I don't feel many people are qualified to really review an airport. Unless you're like George Clooney in 'Up In the Air\" or something.\n\nPgh International really isn't bad. I mean.. it's an airport. It's going to be crowded at times, it's going to be slow at times.. get over it.\n\nThe place always feels clean and contrary to what others think, I feel this airport is pretty easy to get around.\n\nOnly real complaint is it's distance from the city, but that of course depends where you live.
