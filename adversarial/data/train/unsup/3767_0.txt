Jet, we finally meet! Its about damn time, and you were worth going to! After a botched plan to go here and then Lavo, a group of friends and I ended up staying here. \n\nThe only gripes I have with Jet was the \"shoot me now\" wait in line to get inside, and the extra sticky floors. Damn, can people not hold their drinks or what? Courtesy of this douchebag club promoter named Eddie, we got complimentary passes. I kinda tipped him too generously, and some of the passes he gave us for other clubs were not free admission unless you were a girl, despite the fact we had an even ratio. Actually, it ended up being 3 guys and 4 girls at Jet.\n\nAnyway, the club looked like any other upscale Vegas club, but the vibe here was crazy. The main room had people all over the place, and the music was mostly top 40 stuff mixed with some high energy\/house beats. During our time there, the group I went with did a fair amount of \"photo ninja-ing\", while we got some photos of us as well. I do like being a photo ninja so I apologize (sorta) if I ruined your photo haha. \n\nWe decided to check out the other room in the back past the bar, and that room was a lot more crackin' than the main room. although it was much smaller, people were dancing everywhere, while some waitresses were walking around with wet pussies. OK you pervs, I mean they were carrying around the wet pussy shot in trays, and you just had to tip them for giving you one. This isn't going well so I'll change topics.\n\nThe music in this room met my preferences. Mostly hip hop and r&b, especially stuff from the 90s. The DJ He must have watched Notorious before his gig because he played a lot of Diddy\/Mase\/Tupac\/Notorious B.I.G. He also incorporated some rock mashups, and I think he threw in some Journey, which got one of my friends really excited over it because she just loooooves Journey. \n\nThere were a lot of cougars here too on a Friday night, especially at the VIP tables. I guess Studio 54 wasn't the place to be that night. Hahaha snap. On top of that, some fat guy passed out in out of the VIP couches and got kicked out. I just realized we only stayed a couple hours, but a couple of the people who we rolled with stayed behind to dance off their buzz. \n\nMY advice to you is to show up super early and try to get hat complimentary pass. I really enjoyed it here, but I wish we were able to hit up Lavo. Stupid line at Jet. Cheerio.
