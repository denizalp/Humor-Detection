I had never ever sent back a boba drink until last Tuesday night 7\/10\/12.  The boba was as hard as a rock and even the mini ones were too.  Had no one complained that day?  Why were they still open?  I can't believe they were ok with serving this crap.  Their excuse was that they had boiled it that morning..umm..like every other boba joint.  Money back!  Obviously it can't always be like this but this is the first and last time there for me.  2 words: FRESH CUP
