THIS. PLACE. GOT. RENOVATED!\n\nWith the new renos, the bar area has been significantly enlarged and now seats approximately 12 people (versus 6 from before)!!! This has really transformed the space into an open kitchen concept and gives you better vantage points to watch chef Kaji live. The overall capacity likely remains the same. They've also replaced the boring dry wall with black stones and large inlaid murals of Japanese calligraphy. Gone is the ghetto-chic look of yore, but if you look carefully, their kitschy mustard colour table covers remain. My only knock on Kaji was always the drab interior, but with these new renos, can I give it 6 stars yet?!\n\nAnd yes, the food, as always was supreme - taste, texture, presentation and creativity. My well-traveled-and-dined cousins from abroad were mightily impressed and my dining partner - who's quite sensitive to that \"fishy\" smell - scarfed everything down. I can't wait to go back once my piggy bank's full again!
