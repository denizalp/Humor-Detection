Back in September 2011 (note the date), I brought in two of my classic Star Wars Luke Skywalkers (the 1980's line) into the store to see if they could restore the paint jobs on them.  In addition to being my favorite character from that line, these Luke figures were childhood toys from my parents (long since deceased), so the sentimental value was very high.  Also included was a Ghostbusters figure that I bought from the store when they opened.  They said they could repaint\/restore them in just a few weeks.\n\nWeeks pass.  They assure me that everything is fine, but they have a backlog, and it's taking a while.  So I wait.  Weeks turn into months.\n\n2012 comes about.  I go in, and it's always some excuse as to why they're not done.  More weeks\/months pass.  I asked for my figures back, but they \"Set them aside\", and will get them back to me.  More weeks and months pass.\n\n2013 comes about.  I think it's understandable at this point that I simply want my figures back.  I call and get ahold of one of the original employees.  After checking around, he tells me in an upset tone that my figures have been lost.  He apologizes profusely, and says he will set this right with me and find my figures.  A few days later, I find that he has been released\/fired from the business.\n\nFollowing up on the \"lost\" news after an already year-plus of these items being MIA, I raise Hell with the manager\/owner.  He tells me he will set it right, but still by and large more excuses.  A few weeks later, he eventually does produce two Luke Skywalkers.  The correct figures in terms of what was missing, but the paint jobs and \"play\" damage are different.  The \"Empire Strikes Back\" Luke now suddenly had brown hair instead of yellow, among new dings and scuffs on both.  Not because they were restored, but these were simply other figures, and not MY original figures that I brought in back in 2011.  \n\nInstead of saying that he lost them, or admitting that these are replacement figures, he has the audacity to try to pass off the new figures as if they were my original childhood toys.  Keep in mind there's no accounting for what happened to the Ghostbusters figure that was included with them.  Peter Venkman is long out of the scene at this point.\n\nAfter blatantly lying to my face and failing to convince me that these new beat up figures he had tried to pass off weren't mine, he promises that they'll look again to find my original figures (now admitting that they weren't).  \n\nTo put this into perspective: These toys had been in my possession for three decades.  That's 30 years.  I knew every ding and paint scuff, and how I had personally put them there.  I suppose there was some desperate hope that I had contracted a severe bout of insanity\/stupidity over the last two years that would render me unable to recognize my original property.  Not the case, and given the new\/changed scuffs, if that's their idea of \"restoring\" an item, that process needs to be reevaluated.\n\nI did hear from follow-up visits with other employees that the manager felt he had done enough by giving me two of the three replacement figures back, and he didn't feel like doing anything further.\n\nAs of January 2014, I've no idea if those toys were thrown away, sold to other customers, or are sitting in a box somewhere.  The whereabouts of these three figures remain unknown.\n\nI think it is a reasonably safe bet to guess that I will never do business with this location or the manager again.
