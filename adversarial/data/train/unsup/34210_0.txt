Uber, an absolute thumbs up.\nUsing the service on a pretty regular basis, the drivers have been prompt, polite and professional.\nThe cars are clean and mostly late models.\nThe fares are - more than fair.\nThe app works amazingly well.\nI recommend using Uber on Cleveland's west side over a cab every time. \nMy experience so far, rave reviews.
