Real Five Star Dining\n\n    Five stars are like VD's on Yelp, they spring up everywhere. Home Depot, Wendy's, everywhere but this restaurant is truly five stars.\n\n    I have eaten here twice, both times were some of my greatest dining experiences to date. The service is beyond reproach, as each waiter tends to a small section and majority of them are on the older side so they've been waiting tables since before you were born.\n\n    And it's the little things that make this place great. They decant your wine before your food arrives so it aerates well. Everything is prepared table side, salad tossed, Creme bruleed, it is quite a sight.\n\n    Then there is the Wine list, it's longer than my...well, it's long. They pride themselves on having one of the most vast and stocked wine cellars in the city.\n\n   The food, like the service, is beyond reproach. My first raw oyster experience occurred here, they were divine. Plump oysters, shucked perfectly, with all appropriate accoutrement and a liqueur that tasted like the Atlantic...ocean, not city.\n\n    They age their beef, so the connective tissue becomes butter, seasoned with a great Montreal steak spice, the decadence is ridonkulous. Then there is the 16oz Prime Rib en Jus, this is the best piece of meat I have ever had, without question. Side with a Monte Carlo potato, some Quebec asperges and washed down with and '03 St. Supery and you'll be texting St. Peter that you're all good to go.\n\nHis number is 55G-ATES by the way...we're tight.\n\nwakawaka
