Alright, as a level 10 caffeine addict, I have tried coffee shops all across town and of them all, Dutch Brothers easily has the best espresso.  It's never burnt (ahem, Starbucks I'm looking at you) and it comes with a brilliant rush that I float on for quite a while.  It's absolutely refreshing during the summer too.\nOf the few Dutch Brothers I've been to, this is the only one that always seem to get my drink right, no matter how it's worded (don't worry, that other location will get a review too).  \n\nHowever, I'd like to mention that as a socially-awkward person, I avoid Dutch Brothers on many occasions because of the over-friendly staff.  I know it's part of their job and I've been informed that they are sent home if they aren't friendly enough, but not everyone is into talking about what they're doing during the upcoming weekend on a Monday morning.\n\nI see a lot of people enjoy this and I'm glad their friendliness is effective, but I'm not a fan.  If you've ever been forced to revive the dead carcass of a conversation, you know the stench and decide it's better just to plug your nose and keep going.  However, this location generally seems to pick up that I'm awkward and leave me be, and because of that I prefer buying my delicious beverage here when I decide I can handle the onslaught of ten people synched together through a caffeine rush.
