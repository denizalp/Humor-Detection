Excellent macaroons!\n\nConfession: I love great macaroons like a baby loves milk. The almond crust exterior, soft interior, sweet paste filling in tempting flavors.  Uber yum.\n\nMacaron Cafe is now in my top three -- following a place in DC, another in San Fran, and now their booth at Fashion Square.\n\nGreat assortment of flavors from Cassis, to Honey Lavender, to Green Tea, to Nutella.  All taste great and induce squeals from our little girls. (I love them enough to share. A little.)\n\nThe two guys manning the booth shared they are based out of New York.  When I asked them why their prices for batches of more than 12 are *more* expensive than the smaller,they said it's because the larger orders come in a premium gift box.  Then one asked if I was an accountant.  He laughed and said I looked like one of those, too.  Ah, New Yorkers. :o)\n\nWil be back to buy a box or two as gifts...
