Oh, Pollack Cinemas!  I don't even know where to begin describing your charms.\n\nFor starters, there is your choice in movies.  Not content to rely on blockbusters like most cheap theatres, you provide one of the few venues in the valley where we can see good, independent films.  You've shown flicks that AMC and Harkins won't touch, unless you you're willing to drive to one of their boutique locations in Scottsdale or the Biltmore and pay $11,000 a ticket.  Were it not for you, I would've been forced to watch Transamerica on a small screen.\n\nThere, there is the robotic band that greets all visitors as soon as they set foot in your welcoming walls.  Some people would question this.  They would ask, \"Why would anyone ever install an animotronic band in the lobby of a cheap cinema?\"\n\nThank you, Mr. Pollack, for asking the more difficult question: \"Why the hell not?\"\n\nThe robots set the mood for the out-dated arcade games and the bare-bones concession stand, for the wax figurines that line the hallways and the frightening picture of Mr. Pollack and Dick Cheney.\n\nYes, Pollack Cinemas.  You set the bar incredibly low with your $3 price of admission (lower on Tuesdays!).  And then you proceed to blow it up with ten megatons of dynamite.\n\nThank you.
