Still craving their pancakes. It's been weeks. \n\nThe price is decent for a diner, maybe a little pricier, but I'm pretty sure I'd name my first born after this place. The service is quick and friendly and you get seated pretty fast so no worries! \n\nI tried their sandwiches and they were pretty killer, but the pancakes. The pancakes. I dream about the doughy, melt to the top of your mouth, sugary meal.  It is food deserving of the gods. \n\nThen again, I'm partial to breakfast.
