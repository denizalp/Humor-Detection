My son is relocating to the Tempe area for his job.  We had planned a trip to look at housing alternatives.  I had thought there would be some support from his employer's relocation team but that didn't materialize.  I was searching the web (and yelp) Friday afternoon (the day before we were to fly to AZ - so I was a little frantic).  I came across the reviews for Myriad, went to their website and sent a message.  Within minutes I got a call from Renae Klein and I couldn't be happier with how things progressed from there.\n\nShe got some preliminary info about what we thought we wanted to see and within an hour had set up a portal for my son to be able to review properties that met his criteria.  She was in touch with me on Friday night to respond personally to a few questions we had emailed her.  Shortly after we arrived on Saturday she met with us and was able to show us a few properties.  Knowing we were only there for a few days she was able to arrange showings at several other properties on Sunday.  \n\nShe was very professional and really helped my son narrow down his choices.  \nI was a little concerned, initially, because this was his first home purchase and he was looking at condos and townhouses and trying to keep it affordable.  My son gave her a range for price and we saw properties at both the high and low end (ultimately purchasing one at the lower end).  Rene knew wasn't going to make a lot of money on this transaction but given the service we received you would have thought we were looking at homes in the $250k+ price range.   \n\nMy son is in the midst of the purchasing process and is very happy with the follow-up (and coordination) being provided by Myriad.  Renae is still involved as is Kimmy Craigmile who is the closing manager.  \n\nTrying to purchase real estate from 1500+ miles away is definitely a learning experience but I would recommend Renae and Myriad to anyone .
