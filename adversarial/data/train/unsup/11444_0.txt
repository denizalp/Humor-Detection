Arghhhhhhh. I (mostly) try to stay away from red meat but this place is a definite \"TREAT YO'SELF\" spot when it comes to meat. \n\nBacon wrapped filet mignon. Lamb chops. Flank steak. Pork loin. (Minus 1 star for them not having PRIME RIB when I was there!!!!!) \nAnd all come to you table over and over and over again like a vicious delicious juicy cycle. \n\nThen there's the salad bar. OMG. I LOVE SALAD. SO MUCH. u don't even know! I was considering just the salad bar for dinner but, they told me they would have prime rib (lies!) as a meat choice. \n\nAnyways, back to the salad bar. CHEESE. Cheesy bread. Mash potatoes. SWEET BANANAS --- those bananas changed my life!!!!!!!!!!!!! \nI could, literally, eat just the sweet bananas with rice and salt. (How Filipino am I right!!?) lol
