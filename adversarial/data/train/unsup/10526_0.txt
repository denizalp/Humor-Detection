The Phoenix area really lacks a lot of good doughnut shops.  I was so pleased to see this place getting good reviews on Yelp, so I decided to drive out to try it.  \n\nMy daughter and I came in with little expectation; However, she is a big fan of boba AND doughnuts so, she was excited.  \n\nAfter reading all the reviews about people getting a free doughnut, I was surprised when we weren't offered one.  Of course, I was ordering a half dozen doughnuts and chocolate milk.  Perhaps you only get a free doughnut if you DON'T order doughnuts?  I will keep that in mind next time when I order a bubble tea...  \n\nWe both decided to eat one of our doughnuts there in the shop.  They were fluffy, fresh and delicious.  It was all I could do to not eat another one... and I am not big on sweets.  \n\nBefore we left, a customer came in and ordered a bubble tea.  She got a free doughnut.  Jealous!  But, my theory held up.\n\nThe doughnuts even tasted pretty fresh the next morning... something that never happens with Dunkin Donuts.  Heck, I got DD last night and the doughnuts were stale as soon as I got home.  \n\nI will have to try this place again to see how it compares to Bosa.  Perhaps a side by side comparison is in order?  I know one child who wouldn't mind being the judge in that contest.
