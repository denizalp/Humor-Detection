I'm way late to the party, but what can I say that hasn't already been said? \n\n1. Delicious drink flavors that you are able to customize. I've tried the milk teas, the regular teas, and the slushes and I haven't been disappointed with anything. My favorites have been the Hokkaido milk tea, Thai milk tea and taro slush. \n2. Great flavor and texture of the boba. \n3. Friendly employees that are willing to remake your drink if it's not to your liking. \n4. They have a loyalty card, which can be a dangerous to your waistline (but totally worth it). \n5. Drinks are made quickly despite there always being a line. \n\nI think my only complaint is that this is a popular teenage hangout and I feel super old, but that's just me. This is def one of my fave boba spots in town!
