I have gone to this bakery a few times. I always seem to forget about it because it's tucked in the corner on 43rd ave and Thunderbird Rd.\n\nPricing can be a little high on certain things but the quality justifies it. $3 a muffin and $10.99 a pound for assorted cookies. We should have bought 2 pounds because the cookies went quick once we got home.We also received a free cupcake for checking in with Yelp. Our cupcake choices were between orange chocolate or sundae. We went with orange choclate and then decided to pick up a chocolate brownie for $4.\n\nThe bf accidentally dropped the orange cupcake before we could try it...... We contemplated a scenario very similar to a Friend's episode where they eat the cheesecake off the floor with no shame. We decide against eating floor cupcake and we will just have to head back for more cupcakes another day.\n\nWe decided to eat the brownie on the car ride home. Super thick, defitinely need a drink, a glass of milk would have been amazing!\n\nThey had a quite a few cakes in cold cases ranging from birthday cakes to wedding cakes. Beautiful speciality cakes.\n\nStaff is friendly and you can get in and out with your baked goodies pretty quick.
