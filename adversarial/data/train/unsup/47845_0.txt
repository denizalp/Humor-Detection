Horrendous.\nI tried booking an appointment online but their system only allowed for another doctor at the site, not Dr. Belota.\nI then emailed the doctor requesting an appointment (as directed by the site) and after 2 days of not hearing back from the doctor or anyone in her office, I called.\nI called a total of 6 times.\nThe first two times I was disconnected.\nThe third time I was actually connected to a real human and not an automated service.\nI asked for verification that my insurance was accepted and was told, \"Let me take your information down.\"\nYou would think that someone competent would be familiar with insurances accepted or not accepted, but at the very least I figured I would be given an answer shortly after she grabbed her pen and maybe a notepad.\nEight minutes later, I guess she didn't know which pens or notepads were accepted in the office either.\nI hung up and called back, three more times.\nNever got through to anyone again.\n\nOh yes, I'd like to add that if you call from a blocked number, you are instructed to call back after unblocking your number or to call from another number that is not restricted.\nSo my number showed up on caller ID, they could have called me back.\nI guess that's too much work.\n\nIn either event, I am glad that this happened and that I was compelled to write a review.\nI was able to read the other reviews, which I should have done in the first place and I would have never wasted an hour of my day.\n\nLesson learned:\nALWAYS YELP FIRST!!!
