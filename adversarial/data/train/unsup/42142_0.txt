Why is this place not 5 stars?! It's so good! we got one of each fish taco, the 88 and the Citrus, both so delicious! Preferred the 88, my husband liked the citrus. Service was very helpful, the decor is so different, I loved it! I felt like I was in California or on a beach somewhere! And the food was very flavorful.  Even my daughter who never eats ate her meal.
