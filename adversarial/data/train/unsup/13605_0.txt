Time for a review update....this place is ghetto.  It has gone downhill over the past few years.  With options like Town Square, the 2 outlet malls, and the casino malls....why come here?  The stores are terrible and there are a ton of gang member looking people walking around the mall....didn't feel safe.\n\nReturn Factor - 5%
