\"Perfecting\" is not an overstatement.  Amanda is an artist: a meticulous, patient, and devoted artist whose canvas is YOU.  I had a gel manicure, pedicure, and eyebrow waxing, and was amazed by the results.  Truly.  I've had the same spa services elsewhere, but Amanda's work far surpassed my expectations and prior experiences.  You will be her only customer during your time there, and will be treated like her most important, ever.  \n\nThis studio is the perfect balance between elegance, fun, and comfort.  I've never been to a more beautiful spa, and also never felt as totally relaxed and \"at home\" in one!  Amanda has created a gorgeous space where the customer feels perfectly pampered\n\nAnd then you get your final bill, which is not much higher than what you pay for the \"fast food\" spa at the mall.  Seriously.  This is the kind of spa experience a teacher does not expect to be able to afford on a regular basis; I am so glad I found Pearl!\n\nStop reading reviews and make an appointment here!  You aren't going to find better.
