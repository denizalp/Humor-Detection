Ok...this place.  Wow! Loved everything about our visit.  Paolo was our server and was absolutely on top of everything even though it was a busy Saturday night.  And then there was the food...absolutely amazing!  We started with the bruschetta because we had it before and it was delicious.  Then, we went with The Don again and this time it was full of flavor.  It very well could be one of the best pizzas I've ever had...if not THE best.  I honestly have been thinking of that pizza since I left and can't wait to return!
