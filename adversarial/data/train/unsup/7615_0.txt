Pulled up during lunch for a quick meal while out and about. \n\nIt wasn't terribly busy in the drive through. \n\nCustomer service was excellent. I was asked if I wanted hot sauce and it ended up in the bag along with napkins and my correct order. *gasp* \n\nI was through the drive thru in seriously less than a minute. \n\nMy burrito was good and had no issues.
