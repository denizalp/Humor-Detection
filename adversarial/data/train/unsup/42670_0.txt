HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!!! AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!\n\nI had some work done at Swing Shift Auto and I was helped by Keith. He was very arrogant and had little time for me. I just needed new brake discs and pads. I was overcharged, the repairs took TWO DAYS, and when I got home i noticed that the discs had NOT been replaced, only the pads!!!!\n\nTOTAL RIPOFFF!!! NEVER GO HERE, PLEASE!!!
