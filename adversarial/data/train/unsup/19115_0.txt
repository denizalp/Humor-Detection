This is one of the better pizza spots in Pittsburgh to order from.  Their menu is so extensive that I am fairly sure that any one person in the city would be able to find something that will put their hunger at bay.\n\nI opted once for their fries with cheese and bacon on them.  This falls under their appetizers portion of the menu, but honestly it could be a menu item all on its own.  It is a healthy portion (that may sound oxymoronic) of fries.  You get to pick the cheese you want those fries to be smothered in and then crumbled bacon tops that off.  I almost always opt for the cheese sauce, that way I am guaranteed that the cheese makes its way to the bottom of the fries as well.  When I first ordered this item, I made the mistake of ordering another item on the menu and I should have just stuck with the fries.  They are more than enough.\n\nI have had an array of items from the menu, but the fries are what stuck with me.  This may end up being my go to place when I can't decide what I want to snack on.\n\nStaff are polite when you order, if you get delivery they are quite speedy.  One thing to know for delivery: $1 delivery fee.
