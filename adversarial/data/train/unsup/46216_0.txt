The community is wonderful and is very well maintained.   We have had numerous issues with the landscape and hardscape that we paid premium dollars for through Shea with no resolve.  Other neighbors experience regular issues with their irrigation systems and\/or overall quality issues with their home.  Not sure Shea is really committed to their mission statement of exceeding customer expectations.  Customer service reps are not very customer service focused and will tell you things that are not true in the hope that you will believe them.
