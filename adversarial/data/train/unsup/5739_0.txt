I've been coming here twice a week for lunch the past few weeks. The food is awesome and affordable. It's way better than going to a fast food chain. \n\nI rotate between these:\n\nLoco Moco mini $5.50\nHula Pack w\/BBQ chicken $4.50\nShoyu Chicken mini $4.95\n\nAll the employees are nice. I call in my order so I don't have to wait. I don't even need to tell them my name anymore!
