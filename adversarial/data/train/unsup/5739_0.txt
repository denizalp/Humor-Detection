I cannot believe this venue is allowing it's customers to stand in the Arizona heat literally passing out instead of letting them in to get a break from the heat! You tell me you're handing out waters....more like selling them for 3 bucks a pop! Complete bs. I am so disappointed.  Mad even.  My money allows you to stay open...customer first!  And if anything happens to my kid while she's there my review now will be sweet compared to what I do!
