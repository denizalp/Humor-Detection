Went for breakfast today since the Henry is just down the street.  It is in a great location and the atmosphere is nice and service was good.  I came here hoping to find a good breakfast spot but was very disappointed. I ordered the spicy sausage scramble and what I received was different from the menu description.  The menu says that the scramble comes with Zucchini, spinach and onions.  Mine came with these but they also added snap peas, asparagus and corn.  I don't really like snap peas and the corn took away from the flavor of the dish.  I would not have order it had I known that they weren't going to follow the menu.   \n\nI asked the waitress about it and she said they don't put all of their ingredients on the menu.  I find that hard to believe since corn, snap peas and asparagus are listed on the other dishes. \n\nLooks like I will have to keep looking for a new breakfast spot.  Hope Matt's big breakfast opens soon.
