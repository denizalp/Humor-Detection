Was good when they first opened, now they don't seem to care and have gone skimpy with the toppings. I had to ask for extra cheese 3 times. The young black girl that made my pizza had a lousy attitude. She obviously did not want to be there and showed it. Won't be returning. Thier pizza isn't that great anyway..
