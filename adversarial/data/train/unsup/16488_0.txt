I had a good time hanging out at this brewery one weekday afternoon. The atmosphere was chill and drew in locals and tourists. I sat at the bar, which meant I got to enjoy hearing the bartenders talk to other patrons and each other.\n\nAnd the beer! The Morning Joe is a unique Kolch with a true essence of coffee. A must try. I also got to try the Uncle Judd, which was nicely balanced and hearty. I didn't care for the El Heffe, but it was unique.\n\nI hear there's a Groupon, so you might want to check that out.\n\nDefinitely a noteworthy spot if you're serious about beer.
