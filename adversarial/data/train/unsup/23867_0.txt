Someone check this store for a Carbon Monoxide leak. Every staff member I came across shuffled around like they had all sipped a Roofie Colada. I was asking one of the ladies a question, and she never once bothered to turn around so that I wouldn't interrupt her busy schedule of staring in to space. \n\nThen it came time to pay for our purchase. No one was at the till, but after a couple of minutes a staff member came by and paged another staff member to ring us up. Then another. Then another. Then finally it looked like she was going to actually ring us up, when another one padded toward the till. Elapsed time? 10 minutes. There were only 2 other customers in the store aside from us.\n\nOne staff member to help us find a pair of shoes. She disappeared after finding the shoes.\n\nAnother to find the correct size. This was the one that gave her back to me the entire time.\n\nOne to page another staff member to ring us up.\n\nOne to finally put our purchase through.\n\n+1 star for the cute clothing, but someone needs to zap these ladies with some injectable epsresso, stat.
