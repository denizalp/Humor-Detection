In the past I've gone to many optometrists medical offices thinking I would get great service and glasses, but turns out they don't call you when glasses are ready or prescription is not correct! Target by far has exceeded my expectations. The doctor on site is the best I've experienced! He explains things clearly is the most knowledgable Optometrists I've met. My glasses came in 3 DAYS!!! I was so excited since I've waited up to a month. With no phone call. \nI highly recommend Target Optical!
