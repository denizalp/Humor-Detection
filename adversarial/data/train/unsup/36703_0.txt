My dog was a beautiful mess, overflowing with flavor. Portions are small,  but so is the price, especially if you plan for a tremendous amount of toppings. The $5 dog with unlimited toppings is a sweet deal with a brew. Actual hot dog size and quality is short of ideal, but flavor compensation is easy to manage. Tavern setting is more geared toward groups than solo bites,  with a homely and friendly vibe.
