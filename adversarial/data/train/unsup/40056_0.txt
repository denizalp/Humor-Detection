By far one of the most amazing traditional middle eastern restaurant I've been to in years !! Amazing food, great and friendly staff. The laffa shawarma, chicken thigh and lamb chop skewers are a must to try!! And so is everything else! The Napoleon home made desert that is made by the owner who specializes in baking is just a taste of heaven. Never had anything like it before! Plus the prices are great and the portions are huuuuge, definitely worth it! If u are not trying it u are missing out!!!
