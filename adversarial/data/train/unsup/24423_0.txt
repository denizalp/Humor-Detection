Went there for a Christmas party last minute because the last place told us they really didnot want us.\nThe buffet is similar the the institutional  cafeterias at federal government . A bunch of cheap crap to fill you up.A lot of canned puddings, fruits,garbanzo beans, baked beans and of course the frozen ice cream machine.\nI ordered the Kansas City Steak $17.95 and my spouse had Fried Shrimp. My steal had a bone on one side and a fat\/ grisile on the other making the actual eatable part hard to get to.It was from an animal I' m sure who apparently froze to death and then had a ride on a band saw.My wife's frozen fried shrimp was just ok. We were with the family about a party of 14.My sister ordered the stuffed steak and what the hell?It was the thinnest meat stuffed with bread stuffing.  Pretty poor!\nI remember the food being better 10 years ago, but now I' m supprised they do any business at all serving crap like that.
