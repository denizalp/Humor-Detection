This place is the worse Mexican food \"Restaurant\" that I have ever been too!!! I had the gorditas - the lettuce was disgusting it taste like dirty sink water... the food didn't have salt, all of it literally taste like sink water!!! The salsas were tasteless. It was just a horrible meal all around! I don't know about the positive yelp reviews they must of gone on a good day!!
