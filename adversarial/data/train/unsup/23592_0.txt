Dilworth Tasting Room's grand opening on 1\/11 was a huge success, and I can't wait to take the Lady back for date night. \nParking will be a little bit of an issue, but you're likely to find street parking if you circle around enough side streets. The space itself is beautiful and open, with modern lighting and plenty of seats for lounging around. I met up with another yelper over a bottle of white wine that they chilled for us and we sat at the bar. We had multiple people coming to check in on us, and with the exception of getting the check (no fault to assign here, it was their first day!), things were absolutely provided in a timely manner. For a quick bite, we ordered the Espana (there was no tilde over the n, give 'em grief and pronounce it incorrectly ;) ) which was basically like an adult pizza sandwich over a small salad. Flavors were on point, but a tiny bit greasy. Oh well, #pizzalyfe.\n\nWith a huge selection of bottles of wine to choose from, as well as an impressive beer selection with everything from Bud Light to La Fin Du Monde as well as other internationals, Dilworth Tasting Room is absolutely a place where I'll return to try more things. It's nice to have a lounge type place move into brewery heavy south end, and I totally look forward to seeing DTR thrive!
