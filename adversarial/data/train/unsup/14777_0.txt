Overrated. Guys, don't wear tanks to this buffet cause they won't let you in they'll make you buy a $12 shirt unless you are staying at the wynn and can go to your room to change. Food was not that great and service was even worse.  The lady that was supposed to serve us got our drinks once and never came back to check for refills we had to get other waiters to get us more drinks.  We wanted to try this buffet going off the ratings and reviews on here and also spent more at this buffet than any other but were very disappointed with it. Studio B at M Resort and Wicked Spoon at Cosmo way way way better food and service.
