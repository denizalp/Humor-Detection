Yeah I was thinking no way these guys are that good with this many reviews but they are.  I went to another Dentist I won't name that said at 33 years old and pretty good dental history that I was going to need $10,000 in work done because I had too many fillings and I would need crown.  I knew this team who had taken over my old dentist operation was crooked.  \n\nDon, his wife, and mother run McAdams.  They are professional, very friendly, and only tell you what you need know not what they want to sell you.  I was thoroughly impressed and so happy that I couldn't wait to tell my wife and her mother how awesome this place is.  \n\nDon and his team are just really good people and you will get hat vibe when you first visit.  I highly recommend them to anyone, especially my own family.
