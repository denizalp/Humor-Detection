Our bachelor party group unsuccessfully tried to get a table at Hash House A Go Go inside the LINQ because it turns out there was a two hour wait on a random Tuesday morning. After some tinkering on the Yelp app, we found this other location 6 miles away. Desperate for inexpensive yummy breakfast at 1130am, we decided to take an Uber to grub.\n\nAfter blasting some Celine Dion and Opera music in our Uber vehicle, we finally found ourselves at our destination. There were no casinos, no high-rises and tourists in sight. There was a vape shop and a Pet shop next to Hash House. I said to myself \"so this is what Vegas looks like 6 miles away from the strip?\". We were so off the beaten path that you couldn't see a single Vegas strip hotel from where we were standing.\n\nverdict:\nBetween the humongous pancakes, chicken & waffles and #1 egg scramble, our meal was absolutely delicious. Never have I had fried chicken so sweet and battered up so well. The other breakfast plates were big portioned and tasted great. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive to our table. Is this off-strip Hash House A Go Go worth an Uber trip? I would happily do so again in a heartbeat.
