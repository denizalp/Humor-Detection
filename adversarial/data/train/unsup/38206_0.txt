Found this place by chance. They were just starting to open for the day. We ordered the fried plantains. Awesome!!! Their chicken is super good. \nTheir green sauce though ... What is in that awesomeness?!? We wanted to douse everything with it.\nI can't understand though how so many people could keep walking by & not want to try this place. The service was good; they were attentive. The food came out quickly. Loved the food. Prices were decent. \nTotally would come back every time I'm in Pittsburgh!!!
