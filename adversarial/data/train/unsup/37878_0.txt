As an Indian I can appreciate true Indian restaurants and this one was definitely one of those ! Great opportunity for both north and South Indian dishes to be enjoyed, ask the servers to guide you thru the South Indian dishes as they're a tad bit more spicy! Great service, everything is very reasonably priced. I wished we had this restaurant closer to where we live in Indiana ! \nHint: if you see a decent Indian crowd in their restaurants chances are it's pretty darn good food!
