The Hearth is Chef Lynn Crawford's brainchild located conveniently at Terminal 1 of Pearson Airport. \nOf all the restaurants at Pearson, this is probably your best bet for decent food, good view and relaxed ambience. If your layover is long, the restaurant is worth it. The restaurant serves canonical Italian food, without a lot of surprises. The wine selection is fair, but not extremely expansive. \n\nFor appetizers, I ordered a dish of sizzling lemon garlic shrimp with hearth flatbread. The quality was decent, but portion was extremely meagre given that the bill came to almost $20 for just an appetizer. \n\nThe servers were a little passive aggressive. I did not stay in the restaurant for more than an hour and even though it was half empty, I felt pressured to either order more or pay the cheque. \n\nAll in all, a satisfactory meal given that all the restaurants in the airport are sub-par. However, if this was in downtown Toronto I would probably not return.
