Unexpected freshness from a \"food court\" stand... albeit it was at the farmers market. The sushi here was quite delicious! My fellow yelper and I decided to try this out because a mutual friend of ours recommended it. The rolls were crafted thinking of complimentary flavours. \n\nWe ordered the special platter (quite gluttonous for 2 people), which was adorned with 6 rolls: passion sunrise, rodeo rider, tropic rush, zesty avalanche, meteor rain, and 9-1-1. One of my favourites was the meteor rain as it was spicy and was topped with torched seared salmon, being filled with crabmeat and salmon. Runner up was the rodeo rider filled with tuna and salmon, but the highlight was the spicy sauce and GARLIC CHIPS! Such great dimension of flavour in this one. Third place was 9-1-1 as the heat this one packed was spot on. Tuna and crunchy wonton bits topped with salmon, fire sauce, tobiko, and cayenne pepper really brings all the flavour and texture to the bite.\n\nDefinitely worth the visit, but bring more people so you can both try more rolls and not feel like you're going to burst at the end.
