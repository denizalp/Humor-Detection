I can't believe how unprofessional this dump is. I called to schedule a same day appointment. The employee said, \"I'll have to see if I can call somebody to come in to massage you.\" EXCUSE ME??????? You don't have massage therapists on duty during regular business hours at 4:00 in the afternoon?????????????????\nWell, they NEVER CALLED ME BACK.  Totally unprofessional. I'm glad I gave my money to another company.  Do yourself a favor and stay away from this crooked company. I can understand if they cooked the get a massage therapist to give me a massage at 4:00 in the afternoon (I'm lying. No I can't)-----at least the company can be respectful enough to call me back like they said they would. What a HORRIBLE COMPANY.
