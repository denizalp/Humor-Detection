Fantastic little family run restaurant with unique soups served with great bread. If you like a little variety, go for a soup and sandwich combo, they're pretty well all great. Personally I prefer the Duluth location to the one on St-Viateur, but they're both good.\n\nI'd recommend a soup or sandwich, but its changing all the time; be adventurous and try something new!
