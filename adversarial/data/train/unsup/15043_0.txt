I wanted to like Apache Burger. Not just because I'm a Linux fan. I really did. I heard many good things. But maybe built up expectations exceeded reality. Apache is a kind of low rent Harvey's although I think a burger, fries, and cola will run you more than a similar combo at Harvey's. If you're not getting enough grease in your diet, Apache Burger will max out your RDA. That's not a bad thing. At least in my book. I'm all about the grease. All 'n' all, I'm sure long time locals have a lot of fond memories of Apache Burger but nothing matched the hype. Bottom line: a great cheap quick burger alternative to the chains, probably a blessing if it's in your backyard, but don't travel in from Milton to partake of the magic of Apache Burger.
