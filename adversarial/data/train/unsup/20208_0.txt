We had a late night meal here after going to pick up a drunk from Nascar. \n\nThe Staff was more then excellent, man did those young guys have the customer service skill down. They asked all the right questions the register while ordering, offered to refill drinks for an elderly couple, cleaned and wiped tables for people. I was impressed. \n\nThe food was standard 5 guys, which is one reason to continue to go here. Quality and consistency. \n\nWhile I think 5 guys is an average burger I gave the extra stars for the staff here.
