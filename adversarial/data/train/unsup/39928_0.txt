I've been here twice and either time hasn't left a lasting impression so I'm not sure I'll be back. Today I got the Arizona fry bread and it's ok. It comes with sour cream but I asked for no sour cream and instead if they have guacamole. They do not. So I asked if I could have extra salsa instead. They said t comes with one 1oz container and extra would be \n.25. I decided to pay extra for it since I guess I wouldn't get it in sub of the sour cream. I took the order to go so when I got home my three 1oz containers of salsa were not even filled halfway AND there was sour cream on my fry bread.
