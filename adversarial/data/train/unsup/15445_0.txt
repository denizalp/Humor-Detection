In a city like Las Vegas where there's 24\/7 cafes in almost all the strip hotels, Terrace Pointe Cafe tops the list of superior cafes with the Bellagio being the second and the Henry at the Cosmopolitan being the third. Still expect to pay $$$ for food and drinks but in return, you're receiving the Wynn 5 Star experience. From the moment you're arrived you're acknowledged right away. The decor and music give this cafe a relaxing atmosphere. It almost takes away the feeling when you have lost lots in the casino and just want to get away.\n\nService was spot on! I ordered the steak and eggs and orange juice. Let's just say the price of orange juice is enough to buy a 2 pack - 2 gallon of orange juice at Costco. It's that pricey here. The steak and eggs was just ok, my server would constantly check to see how everything was going. It's nice to see they have a restroom in their cafe without me walking out towards the casino. Once in a while it feels good get experience eating at the Terrace Pointe Cafe. Steve Wynn really outdid himself this time.
