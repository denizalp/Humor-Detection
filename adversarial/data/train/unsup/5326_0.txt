I drove up from Chandler to this place to buy broken plates for mosaics and it really wasn't worth field trip.   It felt like Black Friday with the crazy people except the crazy people are going nuts over other people's garbage.  There really wasn't anything there that was worth buying everything was broken, defective, stained.  They want   99 cents a pound for the clothes and 59 cents for the other items.  If you buy the non clothes they end up being more expensive than if you just bought them at a goodwill on 50% off Saturday so I don't think it's worth it.  I picked up a plate that was labeled 99 cents, on the 50 percent off sale days it would be $0.50 here however the plate was $1.30 because of its weight which really doesn't make any sense.  Wasn't sure what to rate it because I talked to one of the guys that works there and he says it's always crazy that they feel they need to get out of the away cuz people will just push them so I don't know that's not for me it's probably not for a lot of people but for some  specific type of people they might have fun here.\n\nP.S. If you are going to venture out bring some workman's gloves because there are a LOT of broken glass items and other jagged objects in the bins that will cut you if you are not careful.
