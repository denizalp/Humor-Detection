Love this place. Food is amazing.\n\nI always end up getting the 'Maiko' dinner which includes:\n\nDashi miso soup\nMa√Øko salad\nSushi or sashimi\nTempura shrimps\nSirloin steak teriyaki\nSteamed rice\nDessert\nJapanese Green Tea\n\nCan't wait to go back.\n\nGranted their menu is a little on the pricey side but so worth it.
