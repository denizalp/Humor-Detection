I forgot to update! \n\nWe have had our new garage door for over a month now and are sooooo happy with it that our neighbors are going to order 3! for their new dual garage\/tiki pool house\/guesthouse addition.\n\nJohn is a great guy. I can't say enough about his patience in dealing with me :) I'm an impatient gal when special order\/special size items come into my life.\nI check more than normal and John was very nice to me about my consistent texts to him getting our order update.\n\nThese doors need a 1 1\/4 HP garage motor opener. Whether it's a Chamberlain or LiftMaster (made in the same factory) you are going to spend the money for ability to properly lift the weight of a glass garage door.\n\nHome Depot CAN order you a custom Clopay like these......but ouch here was HD quote::::\n$400 for motor plus install and \n$9800 for bronze\/dual insulated\/glass\/frosted\n\nTo sum it up......just call John and tell him I sent you.\nHis cell number is  (702) 704-3870 for a free quote.
