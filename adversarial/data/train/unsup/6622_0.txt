Viva El Taco Express comes in for the win! I was ecstatic to see a new Mexican restaurant pop up near my house. \n\nFirst impressions, the restaurant is very clean! The countertops are glistening and decor is vibrant yet sleek. \n\nThe first time I came here, I got the tostada de ceviche and was blown away by the flavor and portion. For under $5 it's huge! The ceviche is sandwiched between 2 tostadas. Each bite gives you that crunch from the tostada, freshness of the shrimp, nice acidity from the lime, and light creaminess from the sliced avocados. Heaven in my mouth! \n\nMy most recent trip, I ordered the 3 rolled up tacos with guacamole and cheese. I wasn't expecting a taquito to be so delicious. If you've ever had an elote, the flavor is uniquely similar to that. They slab on delicious guacamole, shredded cheese, and I think cotija cheese on top. I added some pickled onions and salsa from the salsa bar and it really elevated the whole thing. The pickled onions are one of my favorite condiments at the salsa bar. It's tangy and spicy, and best of all - free! \n\nThe salsa is also amazing on its own. They recently added the medium roasted salsa during my last visit. I can honestly say they are all worth trying. I can't pick a favorite, so I end up rotating between the 3 salsas after each bite of my taquito topped with pickled onion.\n\nThey also offer agua frescas.  They've included pineapple, jamaica (hibsicus), horchata, and Pepino Limon (cucumber\/lemon). I tried the pepino limon and it was quite refreshing. It didn't taste like cucumber lemon to me though, it tastes like it had a hint of honeydew. Either way, it was good for these hot Vegas days that are soon upon us. \n\nThis place is so good, I came for lunch and shared some rolled tacos with my mom as a light snack. After grocery shopping, we came home and talked about how good the rolled tacos were, we went back and got 2 more order of it!
