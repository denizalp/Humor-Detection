Well this would be a good place to come and see a show if the management wasn't more concerned with showing how important they are by saving tables for D level celebrities and their friends than making sure their regular clientele are able to stay and enjoy the show. \n\nThey have NO handicap seating, and if you try and sit at one of their \"special reserved\" tables you are give a bunch of crap just for being a guy with a bad back just trying to sit and down to enjoy a show. \n\nI won't be back anytime soon and if you have mobility issues, save yourself the headache and stay away.
