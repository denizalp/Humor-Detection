I have recently moved to Waxhaw, and this was my first time going to Broome Barber Shop. I plan to live here a long time, so I was hoping to establish a loyal relationship with some of the local business and this barber shop is the closest one to me. When I came in I was the only customer waiting, with the exception of one man in the barber's chair. There was one staff member working at that time. I immediately noticed a funny smell and flies in the air, but that wasn't the biggest issue here. 5 minutes after I got there another customer walked in and sat down. When the customer in the chair was finished, the barber seated the customer who came in after me. I figured this must have been one of those few barber shops that had appointments, so I did not say anything. After waiting for that individual to get a cut as well, I learned that I had indeed been skipped and was very upset. If one barber cannot keep track of 1-2 customers, than it's time to start issuing numbers to walk-ins or initiate a sign-in log, as this should NEVER happen! Very poor customer service, and needless to say I cannot recommend this shop and I will not be returning.
