A friend had her bday dinner at the restaurant.  A few of us go there early and luckily, it was before the rush at 7 pm. Although we took long time for dinner, they didn't rush us.  We waited for the rest of the friends to arrive before we ordered our food.  To my surprise, our orders arrived so quickly. \n\nWe ordered a variety of stuff including beef ribs, UFO fried rice, and the grilled beef \/ chicken to name a few.  I ordered the hazelnut beef which the waiter warned that some may find the smell to be overpowering.  But when I had the first bite, I liked it with a hint of hazelnut.  It was not strong at all.  \n\nMy friends also enjoyed their dishes as well. The only thing that need to do better is give us the bill faster.  We were waiting for at least 15 minutes for the bill while there was a long line up front. Also, we were a party of 6 and they merged  table of 2 with their regular BBQ tables.  Since the tables were side by side, they lined it up on the side where the utensil drawer was located. We had to split the tables to gain access to the utensils.
