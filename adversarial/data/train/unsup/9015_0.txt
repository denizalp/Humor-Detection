Ok- get it over with. Be the 52nd person to make fun of me for eating at Nobhill restaurant when I'm from San Francisco.  Are you done now?\n\nMoving on.\n\nHubby and my family and I ate at Nobhill during Las Vegas Restaurant Week. We got to sample a special menu for $50.00 per person with an optional $25.00 wine pairing.\n\nWe got the fondue appetizer, chicken tetrazini with truffle mac and cheese, and a desert sampler. The fondue and the chicken were a bit too salty for my taste but the bread served before our meal was A-FREAKING-mazing! Our desert sampler included a peach creme brulee and a gourmet Almond Joy type candy bar. In the end, if that was the last time I'd ever be able to eat desert, it would be worth it.\n\nYou can go back to making fun of me now.
