Dear Epic, \n  YOu have rapidly gone from my favorite thrift store in the whole world to one of the worst thrift stores in Vegas. I hear it's because of a young suit that you put in office who decided to remove more than half of the items at the store. Part of the greatness about epic thrift was the fact that I could go and treasure hunt for hours on end. The store just looks pitiful and sad. I went from spending 4 hours in here to spending just about 20 minutes. I am so disappointed. I tried the one on Decatur only to find the same sad, sorry results.\n\nBring back the variety!  So long Epic....hello PATHETIC\n\n#onlyatEpic.
