The 51st and Olive location is actually closer to my house, but I make it a point to go to this one instead. The store is really clean and the employees that I have encountered are very friendly. I enjoy the fact that they have self checkouts, because I'm really particular about how my groceries get bagged, and I hate having to make small talk with strangers. \n\nMy only gripe is those damn displays in the aisles. I've not only nearly knocked some of them over (which is probably my fault) whenever you encounter one of those people who are fully engrossed in the epic decision of what kind of pasta sauce to get that like to just leave their cart in the middle of the aisle, with these random displays all over you lose like three feet of aisle space and there's no way to get around this person and you have to stand there going EXCUSE ME for like five minutes until you bring them back to planet earth. And filling them with glass jars? Come on, guys. You're just waiting for it.
