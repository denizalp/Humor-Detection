Still my #1 Favorite Hotel.\n\nExceptional service from the Concierge who recommended and reserved  a restaurant for my family and I during a busy Thursday evening!\n\nComfortable room with real ducks swimming around in a little pond outside. Very peaceful.\n\nLoved, LOVED, LoVe-the outdoor hot tub and heated pool outside-opens at 6:30am so you can watch the sun come up and be surrounded by pine trees and snow!  They provide robes and towels!\n\nThere is a Bar and Restaurant called \"Le Kube\" and one called \"Le Bisco\" which have the same menus-but Le Bisco is more formal and also serves breakfast.  The food is outstanding French Bistro and Pub Fare!\n\nLe Bisco Restaurant\nhttps:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/le-bisco-montréal\n\nLe Kube Resto-Bar\nhttps:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/le-kube-resto-bar-montréal
