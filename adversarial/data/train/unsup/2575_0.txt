I haven't been here in a really long time, but my OG Ryan B came to meet me for lunch and we decided to try Memphis Championship. I have never been a big fan of this place or even BBQ in general. The service was really spotty today. It took quite some time for someone to come take our drink order and then another long wait to place our order. Our server was friendly but another server had to keep checking on us since she noticed that we were waiting long periods of time without being waited on.\n\nI decided on The King lunch and my lunch date ordered the BBQ burger. She kept forgetting what he wanted and came back twice to check with him. At that point, just write it down if you can't remember. \n\nFinally our food came out after nearly 30 minutes and by that time I was in a rush to get back to work. I asked for the check immediately when our food came out. We rushed through our food and I was happily back at work in time, but the slow service almost did me in, so I might have to steer clear from them when I'm in a rush. Otherwise, the food was good and I enjoyed the cream corn and their BBQ sauce quite a bit. The prices are really great for lunch too.
