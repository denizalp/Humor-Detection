Call me old... but im far from a prude. I hate this town of white trash and lost identity douche bags. Poor drivers, no decent food even in sea of celebrity chef names all up the strip. Suggest you avoid the strip where bro-hams, camel toe, ho skirts, and cankles run rampant. Unless you're into that kind of thing.
