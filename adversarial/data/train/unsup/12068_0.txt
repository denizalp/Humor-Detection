Took my girl to Six last night, yo there was no line at all and all these bitches walked in front of us in line, I was like \"What up?\" to the bouncer he was all \"bitches get in first\" i was like \"yo baby i have a lady with me, damn\" he was like \"five bucks\" I was like \"yo baby look over there is that Beyonce\" then I slid by his chump ass without payin the money.  \n\nMusic was tight from Dirty South to East coast rap, then DJ got all double wide whack and started playing Guns and Roses, sorry man the bowling alley is down the road.  \n\nNight was alright, lady was happy we went home and hit skins :)
