I do not live in Pittsburgh, but I do visit very often. I was heading out of town on vacation, and ran out of time to get my eyebrows done at home. I visited Brow Art 23 in the South Hills Village Mall, and I was disappointed. She did a great job and did extant what I wanted! The threading lasted about 2 weeks before I started seeing a little new growth. It's about 3 1\/2 weeks or so and they still look great!
