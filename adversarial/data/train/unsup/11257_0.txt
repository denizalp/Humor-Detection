This was one of the first places I enjoyed when I moved to Las Vegas and it consistently delivers. I try not to eat here too much for health reasons, but it's one of those places you can  spend a cheat day on. Their 2nd location in Chinatown closed, it was very dead in there, but luckily this location is going strong. I gravitate towards their banh mi hot dog and their euro special house fries, while my husband will try a whole bunch of things there, and especially loves their chili. We've come rather later some nights when they've already turned off the stove, but the workers are always kind and offer to turn them back on. I feel like the owner (or maybe he's the manager) has always done something out of his way when we are here to make us feel welcome. Their great customer service and reliable food options will keep us loyal to this Vegas institution.
