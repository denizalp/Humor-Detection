Keep hearing about this place as the best BBQ in Vegas...I can agree however it is by far not the best BBQ i've had.\n\nI ordered the three meat combo and got:\n\nHot Links - Pretty Good and nice flavor\n\nRib Tips - Pretty good and even better if left in the sauce overnight...\n\nBriskit - A little dry but decent flavor...Their sauce is muy fuego...the spicy isn't spicy but its so damn good. I'm a fan of not putting condiments or adding extra shit to food that has been prepared for you because I believe it should be good the way it is. However this sauce with that little dry briskit made it good.\n\nMac & Cheese - You can't fuck up mac & cheese and if you do you need to stop cooking...so yes of course this was good and you can tell they used real cheese instead of that powdered or liquid form.\n\nGreen Beans - Ehhh yah it reminded me of them frozen green beans maybe cause its soaked in some broth but yah I should have gotten their greens...\n\nCornbread - who doesnt love cornbread and bbq...\n\nHonestly I eat a fuckin lot and I couldn't finish the 3-meat combo (pause)...they give you so much good food for your buck that it is worth it. Plus the way all the hard work, passion and dedication is resonated in the food how can you not love this shit. Good Merican BBQ at it's finest.
