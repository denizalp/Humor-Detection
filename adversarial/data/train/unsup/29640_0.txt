Came here on a Wednesday night to sample their wagon wheels. The store was empty when I arrived and there were 2 employees. Nonetheless, it took about 20 minutes to fill my order as they make the wheels fresh from batter. It's a lengthy process because the 2 halves of the wheels are made individually, and are actually quite thick.\n\nI ordered one of each flavour they had on the board. From most to least favourite: cheese, sesame, oreo, red bean, vanilla custard. Overall, the taste was OK. Definitely eat the cakes fresh as they got pretty hard \/ stale the next day.
