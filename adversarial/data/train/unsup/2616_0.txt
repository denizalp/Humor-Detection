A faux \"beach\"? Only in Vegas.\n\nMet with friends here on the way to dinner - a friend had to sign us in. Unsure if there was cover, or if you had to be staying at Mandalay to gain admittance.\n\nHad fun lounging on beach chairs, cooking in the sunny weather. It wasn't crowded at the time - late afternoon - yet there was still plenty of eye candy. Oh yes.\n\nBar drinks were pricey, but that fact shouldn't surprise anyone. Just knock back a shot or two to get a healthy buzz if you need one.
