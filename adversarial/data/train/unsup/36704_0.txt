I asked trusted auto people for a body shop recommendation and Select was advised.\nI took my 12 year old Subaru Outback Limited to them and they returned to me a perfectly looking \"brand new\" Outback.  Front bumper, driver side fender and total\nbody renewal are flawless.  Their attention to detail, thoroughness, and timeliness is so appreciated.  I was told upfront they were extremely busy (no wonder) and if I could\nwait they'll take care of me.  Mr. Bud true to his word got me in a week or so later and my car was finished a day and half earlier than expected.  I am so pleased and appreciative of their expertise and conscientiousness.  Select did a superior job for me.  I will recommend them to all family and friends, and now also to Yelp!
