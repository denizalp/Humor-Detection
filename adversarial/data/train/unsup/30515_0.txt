Food tasted fine, service was good.  Lindos doesn't have a fancy bone it's body even my coffee cup was scratched but I liked it. \n\nI got the breakfast sampler for $7.99 :two eggs , home fries, pancakes and french toast, and bacon.  The french toast was very good fluffy and sweet.  I would have really liked if they cooked the homefries with green pepper and onions but they were tender and I ate them all.  You can have both french toast and pancakes but I opted for french toast only. \n\nI learned that Lindos does a breakfast buffet on Sundays from 8pm-1pm.\n\nThere was a Steeler pride omelet on the menu too. \n\nI also saw a special  for 10 wing dings and fries for $6.50.  \n\nGreat place for cheap eats.   This would be a great place to fill up before a Steeler game.
