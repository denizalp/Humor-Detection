I'm breaking my usual 'two visit\" rule for Tortilla Fish but there's a good reason; It was just THAT good!!\n\nI met up with the girl for lunch on my day off, kind of leery about what I was getting into because I'm not really a fan of fish tacos. But I gotta give the local guys a shot and I'm glad I did.\n\nOrdered the shrimp tacos, added beer battered fries for the table and snagged the free drink check-in offer. Didn't have to wait long for our tacos and was pleasantly surprised to find that they don't pre-build the tacos for you. After they cook up your fish and put it in a fresh corn tortilla, you get to put the rest of it together using the nearby bar. This is a HUGE plus for me because far too often I've had fish tacos elsewhere that were drenched with some nasty mayo based cream sauce that I can't stomach. Here though, I was able to load my shrimps up with shredded cabbage, pico de gallo, some bomb salsa, and cilantro. WORD OF WARNING: They are not exaggerating about their heat levels. When they say hot, they mean hot. I went with the hottest salsa and got a good burn going, despite how used to spicy food I am. So choose with caution. One of the staff members was kind enough to give a couple of recommendations on what to put on the tacos as well which I'm glad I listened to them because I would have missed out on the cilantro sauce.\n\nThe end result? Freakin' excellent! Very fresh fish and fantastic toppings. Found out after I'd inhaled my first taco that all the sauces are made in house daily which explains why it tastes freakin amazing and fresh. The beer battered fries were also great. I recommend sharing them though because you get quite a bit.\n\nOverall, a great dining experience and great customer service. My only gripe is that they close a bit earlier than other taco restaurants which makes it difficult for me to eat there for dinner given my work hours. Otherwise I'm glad I gave them a try. Will definitely need to come here again sometime soon.
