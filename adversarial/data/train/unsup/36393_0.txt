Love getting a coffee and bagel here in the morning. Toasted just right, with some butter, brings out the flavor in my favorite cinnamon raisin bagel.\n\nI am not usually a deli guy, but I tried the pastrami sandwich, it was so good, too much for just one person. Juicy and tender pastrami, the rye bread was just the right thickness, the whole sandwich worked well.\n\nReady to try out the Canter's on the Strip.
