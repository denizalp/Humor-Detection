We escaped The Mad Hatter on \"Have I Gone Mad?\" mode!  This was one of our favorite rooms in all of Phoenix.  There were lots of physical challenges (pushing buttons, performing tasks) and very few simple find-a-lock-find-the-key type of situations.  I felt like we were in a movie set the entire time; the rooms are very bright, colorful, and well-designed.  You can really get into the theme of the room, and our game master kept the mood going with themed clues.\n\nOur team had four of us, and we escaped comfortably with time to spare without using too many hints.  I think experienced Escapers can do this room with four people; it might be tricky but still possible for a group of four novices.  I like keeping groups small since you get to be involved in almost every aspect of the rooms.\n\nApparently Eludesions is opening some new rooms here soon!  Can't wait to come back and do the rest of their rooms.
