I can't help but wonder how Johnny's Uptown stays in business.\n\nMafia money?  I think so.  This place is cool.  They have great live jazz music and it's a unique place to go for dinner, drinks and dancing. \n\nBut to me, it's a little mafioso because I've never been when it's busy.  In fact, the times I've gone, I've been just about the only one in the place.  Yet, they keep on keepin' on. \n\nMakes you wonder.  Also makes me wonder if I'm gonna be sleepin' with the fishes after writing this review.  But Johnny, if you're reading this, I love your bar\/restaurant.  I do. I really do. All I'm saying is that it doesn't get that busy.\n\nKeep in mind, I haven't been in a few months, so maybe things have livened up a bit.  I have been to their Sunday brunch too- that gets pretty busy and the food was really good. So if you're looking for something a little different to do, check out Johnny's Uptown you filthy animal.
