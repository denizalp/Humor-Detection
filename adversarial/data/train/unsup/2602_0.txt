Ive been going to see Dr. Ulitchney since 2003. We used to live within walking distance of this office. We have now moved way south and I still drive all the way on every appointment. We have 4 animals that go there and don't mind the distance. The staff is the same staff which to me, says a lot because turnaround would reflect the bad enviornment but apparently inside it's a great place to work at as well. \nNot only is Dr. Ulitchney very caring and sincerely cares about animals, he is SUPER HOT ! He's married and his wife is gorgeous so I respect that as I myself am married. But that doens't mean I can't appreciate a good looking Dr. when I see one right? \n\nSeriously, great hospital, reasonable prices for vaccines and routine checkups. There's always appointments available within a reasonable time frame. They handle my emergencies as their emergencies !\n\nThe best vetinary clinic in town!
