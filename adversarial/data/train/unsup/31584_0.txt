A chipotle wanna-be:\n\nI walked in with the understanding that this was a \"Thai version of chipotle\". And that it was! The decor, the feel, and the layout of the ordering is definitely feels related to our favourite fast food Mexican place.\n\nBut the food was sorely disappointing. I got the lemongrass chicken, the beans, and the yam, all of which they said were their specialties. Mostly, they blandly tasted of low quality soy sauce, sugar, and way too much lemon grass. Maybe a little lime. I imagined they modelled after chipotle so much that they literally took chipotle's chefs, put them in a kitchen, and said: \"okay now make some Thai food\". Chicken was tender, but overly so to the point that I wondered if I was chewing meat or fat. Underwhelmed totally.\n\nOverall, not good. Would not return. Salad king is right across the street for Thai. Or if you're looking for chipotle-esque, the real deal is just a few stores down. Don't settle for this.
