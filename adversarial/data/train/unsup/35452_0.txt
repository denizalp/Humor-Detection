Tried for the 1st time some things were good others so so. I will for sure try some other items on the menu and update rating. Got the sizzling steak, sauce was good meat overcooked and blah some pieces were tuff to chew. BBQ Pork fried rice ok nothing special. Got the pu pu platter. Chicken fingers some were very good and couple pieces they didn't cut the chicken right and was tuff to chew. Beef on the stick, very tuff to chew. Eggrolls were good. Chicken wings very good for anyone from Boston that loves that kind of Chinese food very comparable. Shrimp nothing special. One of the other big things is they have \"duck sauce\" sweet and sour comparable to Boston Chinese food which was a nice surprise. Will for sure try more items. But from other reviews I do agree seems to be the Chinese food place on the west side.\n\nUpdate: 9\/4 got a variety of things again crab Rangoon good wings great again pot stickers good, egg foo young so so, orange chicken great. Only real knock is I would say stay away from beef dishes we got beef and broccoli and again the beef is very chewy. Not very good at all.
