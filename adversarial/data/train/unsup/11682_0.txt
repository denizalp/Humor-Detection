I could very easily walk into Whole Foods, leave with an empty wallet and be completely fine with it. Seriously, Whole Foods has it all...even local! Yes local! I'm all for shopping local this year and yes, Whole Foods isn't technically local, but they get five stars in my book for selling local products such as Honey Moon Sweets, Sweet Republic and I even saw a local vendor there selling his hummus that I always see at Farmer's Markets. Kudos to Whole Foods for keeping it in the AZ family.\n\nBesides that, the other reviews have really said it all. This grocery store is the mother of all grocery stores. It's perfect for picking up an individual meal, perfect for selecting a bottle of wine, perfect for sitting down at their wine\/beer bar for a cocktail while you shop and perfect for finding the freshest and finest products out there. I can't visit Whole Foods without filling up my cart with delicious goodies and I kind of feel like I've gone on an adventure every time I walk inside. I would be a regular (my wallet cries at the thought of this) if only there was one closer to where I live or work. Sadly though, they seem to be avoiding the Old Town\/Arcadia area for a Whole Foods (hint hint?!) \n\nI will end this review with a summary of the individual meal options they provide: made-to-order sandwiches, wood oven pizzas, Chinese food, an extensive (and I mean extensive) salad bar including hummus, cous cous & pasta, hot sandwiches, pre-made cold sandwiches, a sushi bar and much, much more!
