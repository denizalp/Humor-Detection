Ok I used to go here all the time until I found out it had been shut down recently for a cockroach INFESTATION. \n\nI have always been sceptical as to the cleanliness of this store, I tend to shy away from stores whose seafood section has a permanently wet floor and a stench that fills an entire area of the store. Often would shrug it off due to convince and cheap prices. \n\nNow I'm not so sure it's worth the risk. I don't think I want an extra crunch in my dim sum. \n\nI would say there is another, much cleaner option when it comes to Asian stores in the Mississauga area (names being left out for ethical reasons). I recommend trying the alternatives. Namely one that was purchased by a reputable grocery giant. I'll leave the researching up to you. \n\nHappy shopping folks!
