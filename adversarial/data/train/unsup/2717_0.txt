The Luxor is what I like to call ghetto Vegas. Rooms aren't that cheap although they can be pretty cheap during the week. The rooms especially in the pyramid are super dated with old squeaky air conditioners, dark danky carpets and furniture, and uncomfortable pillows. We have a saying that friends don't let friends stay at the Luxor. It's so true! It's uncomfortable and depressing.
