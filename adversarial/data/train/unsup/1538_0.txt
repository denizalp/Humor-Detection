On the first warm day in Montreal since September of 2008 I slipped my lily white feet (ok, deathly pale - who am I kidding) into flip flops for the first time and visited this little nail salon on Duluth.\nThey are busy so an appointment is recommended. \nUpon entering, you're greeted by two huge fish tanks full of rufa fish. By dipping your feet into one of these tanks for 15 minutes before your pedicure, you essentially lose a good deal of dead skin. That's right, they eat it right off of you. I didn't try it this time but I'm curious and saw one brave soul squirm for the first 5 minutes of the procedure then she settled in with a magazine.\n\nMy pedicure ($35) included a workout for my feet. Be prepared for a tough (lots of punching and slapping) foot and lower leg massage and a massaging chair. In and out in a half hour, it was worth the price and I'd go back.
