I had my first bad experience at Jjanga but at the Fort Apache location, and I thought I wasn't coming back. Well yesterday, a close friend of mine took me out to the Decatur location and I decided on the Ã  la carte menu. \nI was surprised because this location was fairly busy and the menu was extensive. The server was very nice and overall, I had a good experience. \n\nI came back today with my sister for all you can eat,  and we ordered 8 plates of sushi. I say if you have not eaten at all, you can finish those 8 plates in -6 minutes. No joke. They're just unique but definitely worth it.\nOur whole order came out super fast despite all the other demanding customers going wild on this fine New Years Eve. \nI'm glad I did give them another chance because their ayce is amazinggg.
