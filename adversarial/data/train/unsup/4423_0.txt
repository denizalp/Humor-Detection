Pink is my favorite color.\nPink taco is so far my favorite Mexican style place. \n\n\n\nPink Taco is in the Hard Rock. Ok. Getting my head out of the gutter now...\n\nTaco platter: Really good. Quality meat. \nSalsa: I'm a lightweight and like Gringo salsa, not too spicy, not HOT. \n\nBurrito was excellent. Good sauce. Full of meat. Cheesy goodness. \n\nMy husband loved the fajitas at PT.\nI thought they were pretty good too. Lots of veggies not spicy and the chicken was  moist and not over grilled.\n\nService was good.\n\nOne star minus for over priced margaritas. I know its Vegas though. ...\n\nIn conclusion a good place with good food. Not sure I like pink  food coloring though.
