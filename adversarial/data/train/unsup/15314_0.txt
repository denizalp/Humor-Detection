The patisseries here are as fresh as it gets. From french desserts to persian treats, there is a large variety of biscuits, cakes, tarts, mousses and even homemade ice cream! (only offered in the summer)\n\nI'm a huge fan of their chocolate walnut cake which has a generous layer of ganash on top, absolutely rich and divine. The pistachio cake is a hit with the persians as I'm told. The cakes here are on the pricy side, but you can truly see the quality of ingredients used.\n\nNegin, the owner, is a sweet lady who makes everyone feel welcome. I've been coming here for years and she never disappoints. Most her cakes contain nuts and lactose, but you can request a nut-free, lactose-free and gluten-free cake! There is a small seating area, but most patrons take to go.
