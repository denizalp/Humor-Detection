Sushi Samba a great stop for some really good sushi, among other dishes. For my father's birthday we ended up here, spending with tip about $280.00. It was well worth it. From sashimi plates to their truffle shavings on ribeye, everything was delicious and beautifully presented. The seating was comfortable, atmosphere trendy for a 78 year old's birthday, but he was more interested in the food than anything.\n\nI'd definitely come back here again for all the food, especially their wagyu gyoza and lobster roll.
