Stopped in today for their grand opening. It was crazy busy. They were handing out goodie bags, and giving away gift certificates. We didn't even try to buy anything because the checkout lines were way to long. They have a coffee bar offering local coffee from Akrons own Artisan coffee co. They also have two in house kitchens one called Taqueria. They offer build your own tacos, burritos, bowls and pizza's. The nice thing is you can order and pay at their tablet station. The other is Fire Leaf, they have fresh sushi, japanese cuisine, pan Asian stir fry and bubble tea. Along with that they also have a self serve antipasto salad and hot food bar and a organic soda fountain. People were going crazy for the grab n go pizza slices, we couldn't even get a slice, but it looked really good. Will have to try it next time.They did a great job in their produce department, they separated it with a wall so you don't have to freeze or get wet while trying to shop for something else. They also have a large selection of fresh groceries, produce, bulk nuts and so much more. We will return once the craziness dies down.
