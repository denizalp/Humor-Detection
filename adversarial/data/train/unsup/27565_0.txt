I really like the pizza houses pizza it has been one of my favorites since I was a little girl and lived on church street in Ambridge down from Old Economy.  I normally get my slices with extra cheese and pepperoni, although I think I might just start getting it without extra cheese, there's so much cheese on there and it's unmelted sometimes so it can be a little much.  You can order a half sheet or a full sheet unbaked too along with the toppings.  Prices are reasonable.
