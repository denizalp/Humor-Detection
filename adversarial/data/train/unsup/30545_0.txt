Went for the first time to evergreen nails! Great experience I have had in a long time. I absolutely love my nails I went short and natural after having long stilettos and coffin nails for a very long time I wanted a change! And I came in told him what I wanted and he did just that no less of my expectation. I usually don't pay to get a pedi because I feel I don't get what I pay for! But i had such a great job done to my toes! My nails are super cute. At other places my nails lift and it's the worst not only do the look ugly but the hurt as left bend along with my natural nail. Every female out there totally recommend this place! Place is clean, nice, neat, pleasant! Color selection \n\nA must try place
