Placed an order this evening on the website for a 5:10 pm pickup. Got there at 5:10 pm and gave girl my name twice to which she states that she doesn't have my order in her system. I proceed to show her my confirmation email and she tells me that they are having a lot of problems with there system and that I would need to step over to the main cashier and re order my food . I walk out of the restaurant and go home. Why would I place an order with this Pei Wei again online and take the risk of it not being there?They are very unlikely to see me as a customer again.
