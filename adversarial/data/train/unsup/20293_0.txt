Who goes to a desert to order seafood???\n\nWell, lesson learned. Oysters and calamari were the smallest ive ever had. Food was expensive. Service was severely lacking. We sat at the bar and got ignored. Anytime we needed anything it was like we were asking for the greatest inconvenience. \n\nNot worth the walk or the money.
