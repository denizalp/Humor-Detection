I've been here way more times than I can count, yet I have still not written a review about it. Located on Las Vegas Blvd. and Warm Springs Rd, this outlet is on the south end of town, hence the name. It's an indoor outlet with a few stores outside. Although the facade has been completely redone, the inside is in desperate need of a makeover. It's dark and drab and just plain tired looking. There are 2 food courts and a bunch of stand alone spots to get a snack, like Auntie Anne's pretzels and Cinnabon. There are restaurants that share the same plaza as the outlet, like Outback Steakhouse and Chipotle, if the food court isn't to your liking. Parking is much easier here compared to the North outlet. And the stores here are more of your everyday stores, while the North outlet has higher end brands. This your basic outlet that provides your basic shopping needs. Nothing fancy. \n\nP.S. Check in and get a free coupon book at guest services located at the food court on the Nike side of the outlet. There are a few good deals in there.
