I miss little markets\/restaurants\/wine bar\/coffee shop patisserie in one spot.  One of the things I miss the most about living in New York but alas I found the French Market, so cute I only wish I lived within walking distance.  I came for lunch and had the Croque Monsieur for those who don't know like France's version of a grilled ham and cheese.  Very hearty and rich I had to take half home, what I loved was thick slices of actual ham like you would get at a deli, unlike the sliced processed sandwich style meat you usually get some places.  My friend only got the pommes frites with Parmesan and garlic served  with spicy aioli (great) staff was friendly and helpful since I had never been there before.  I looked at the breakfast menu and the prices are great I spend more at Starbucks on the way to work for a microwaved breakfast sandwich and coffee.  I am definitely coming back for breakfast\/coffee and desserts.  Great assortment of French cheeses\/wine for sale and thinking of shocking my friends at my get together with goose liver pate, more for me I'll just tell them it's a meat dip.
