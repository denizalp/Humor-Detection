A cute little ice cream shop with asian inspired flavored. They offer a handful of gelato flavors, but focus mainly on their homemade ice cream creations. I sampled the lychee ice cream and it was superb! They also have some random board games for patrons to enjoy and our party enjoyed toppling the different jenga pieces. Overall, a fun local spot to hang with friends.
