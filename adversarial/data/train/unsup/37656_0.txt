We've hear great things about Fat Ox, so thought with out of town guests it would be a good time to try it. The pretentiousness was overwhelming. The hostesses were not welcoming or simply kind! Which is not the way to treat anyone. We asked if there was an open table in the bar and all 3 of the ladies at the hostess stand Pointed to a corner table. It must have been too far for them to show us the table. It took an uncomfortably long time just to get water. The waitress finally showed up and her demeanor was not pleasant, a smile would have gone a long way. We were planning on eating but it was obvious that we were not welcome. We did order a round of wine which was good. To bad that the service was not at a higher standard. The area has far too many choices of eating establishment to waste money on restaurants that aren't trying to make patrons welcome. Being kind, welcoming, & friendly cost nothing, but your business!
