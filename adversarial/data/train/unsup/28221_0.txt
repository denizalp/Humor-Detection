I've been to BPS many times. Typically I am dragged here by my husband so he can ogle boats and other outdoor accessories. Yesterday we went because he wanted to look at boats. We went directly to the area and began checking them out. Not once did an employee appear to help us. In fact, there were no employees in sight the entire time we searched over the boats. My husband actually really wanted to inquire about a small, plastic fishing boat so we had to search around for an employee.\n\nWe found two men working by where the really expensive reels are located for fishing and we stood in front of their counter, obviously needing help. One of the men was talking with another customer, but the other (younger one) was doing nothing. I even made eye contact with him and he just stood there instead of helping us. So we walked elsewhere. When we came around a corner I saw FOUR, yes, FOUR BPS employees just standing around in a circle talking. I went over to them and said, \"Excuse me\" and finally one of them asked if he could help us. GEE, THANKS? Yes, I would like some help.\n\nOne of the older gentleman then pawned off one of the younger men to help us. \"For the next 12 minutes, since it's almost time to go home!\". \n\nI guess BPS values the need of their employees to stand around and do nothing for a half an hour before quitting time, than they do actually helping customers. \n\nWhile the store itself is massive and impressive, the items are WAY overpriced. You could get a majority of this stuff at smaller sportsman stores or online even for way cheaper. And, the customer service sucks.
