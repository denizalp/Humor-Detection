The tacos were good and cheap but on the night I went there was a 6 piece mariachi band complete with trumpets blasting away in the dining room.  Being it's a high ceiling the entire restaurant was echoing with these high pitched blasting trumpets; reminded me of high school band practice where everyone is warming up, that kid behind you decides to blast full force from his trumpet in the back of your head and you go \"AHH!\"\n\nAnyway thank god for the outdoor patio.  After I sat down I realized I forgot to grab hot sauce but didn't dare to go back inside.
