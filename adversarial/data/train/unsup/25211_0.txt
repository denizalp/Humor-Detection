We found this place on a whim while looking for another restaurant nearby and it is delicious.  Friendly staff was helpful with our questions .. we tried the poke bowl, noodle soup and JianBing .. my favorite was the poke bowl.. they have several options to choose from... I got the quinoa with Hawaiian tuna & calamari - soooo friggin good! My 2 yr old daughter drank the noodle broth with a straw after demolishing the noodles .. think it's safe to say she enjoyed it! We just got the regular JianBing and my husband and I agreed that we could have done without it but was worth a try. We'll be back for our freeby for the review soon ;)
