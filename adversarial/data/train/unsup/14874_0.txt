I've really enjoyed Lee's sandwiches in the past, but the food from here was okay. BBQ pork sandwich was a 2-star. The bread wasn't how I remember the Lee's baguettes. Maybe it was the texture, it didn't have the crunch on the outside followed by soft bread in the inside. \n\nEgg rolls were not too shabby. 3 stars. \nI'll stick to the hot food items and skip the sandwiches here next time.
