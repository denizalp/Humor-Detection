Well, eh, I'm not a fan of clubs, I prefer to get intoxicated at bars where there isn't a line or VIP scene. This club in particular, is cool...if you're an 18-21 year old girl that loves attention from douche bags that have more product in their hair than you probably do. On the plus, its a large club and the only time you will find me there is for Ghost Ball - F-ing fantastic party for Halloween and everyone should experience it.
