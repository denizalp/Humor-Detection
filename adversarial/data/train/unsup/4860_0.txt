The Sheraton Mesa Hotel at Wrigleyville West was the last stop on our road trip to Texas.  After a long drive from Las Cruces, NM, we arrived at 5PM on a Friday.   There were a couple of people ahead of me in line.  When it was finally my turn to check in, the front desk clerk told me that my room was not ready yet.  \"Not ready\" was not an acceptable answer to my wife who overheard our conversation.  She reminded the front desk clerk that we were Marriott\/SPG Gold, and that we needed to be upgraded to a nicer room.  30 seconds later, after not finding any rooms on the computer, the front desk clerk found something for us.  He didn't tell us that he upgraded us, though, he did give us access to the concierge lounge.  \n\nWe were given a room with a great view of the lake.  Our room had 2 queen beds, exactly as we requested.  The beds were adequate and gave me a good nights sleep.  They had USB ports for charging our electronics.  \n\nThe Lounge was okay.  They had a nice supply of sodas, chips, granola bars in the evening.  They served hors' d'oeuvres in the evening, but, it didn't look too good the night we were there.  The espresso\/hot chocolate machine was nice.  We were able to enjoy a cup of coffee after dinner.  Breakfast was better than the evening hors' d'oeuvres as they had scrambled eggs, sausages, bacon, muffins, oatmeal, fresh fruit and cereal.  \n\nWere we given an upgraded room?  Neither my wife or I could figure it out if we were upgraded or not.  This could've been a great stay as the property looked nice.  But, once the front desk clerk gave us a little bit of his attitude, I was forced to hear about it from my wife the rest of the stay.  Because I was forced to listen to my wife vent and complain about the front desk clerk, I can only give them 3 stars.
