A delicious  lunch.\n\nI came her with my friend and we were seated quickly by the nice lady T.\n\n\nEverything on the menu looked so good I had a hard time deciding.  The waiter gave us a couple of samples of meat. \nJust perfectly seasoned!\n\nI ordered a chicken bowl and my friend had tacos. They have several salsas; mango onions, mango and regular salsa.\nMy chicken bowl was very good and full of meat. They do not skimp on meat.\nOverall a good experience.
