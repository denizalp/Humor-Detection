Yesterday was the second time I went here. I didn't realize this was the restaurant I went for my neighbors confirmation.\n-It is clean\n-Yes, i agree the curry is too thin...not the best when i'm dipping my naan in\n-Wide variety..i ate most of the vegetarian dishes, since I don't eat meat\n-They make fresh naan, but it's not fluffy..crispy though\n-Service is very friendly\n\nOverall, I've been to way better buffets. This is nothing special. Trust me.
