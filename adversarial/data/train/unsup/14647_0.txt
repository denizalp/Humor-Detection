Bus Driver, you are so nice! and you tried to be funny!\nEven though the shuttle was late, I was happy about the trip.\nWe took a small van to somewhere and then switched to a double deck bus! This is the first time for me to ride on a double deck! And they provide breakfast too :) (and lunch!)\nWe basically slept, ate, walked, slept more, walked....repeatedly
