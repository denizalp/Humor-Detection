Extremely disappointed in the package I purchased for Janae birthday party . 575.00 wasted !! The room was poorly decorated , no balloons and the overall experience was not a pleasurable one . The hostess was great tho !! She gets 5 stars !! As for the attractions and things those were great !! Just the package and what it came with , I'd advise you to just bring your own items and cake . It will save you hundreds!!
