Las Vegas is not my city of choice for vacation.  It is expensive, hot, and smokey.  Three things I do not like and try to avoid.  If given the choice between vacation in Las Vegas and no vacation, I would most likely choose no vacation and just take those vacation days as an opportunity to do some laundry.  Thrilling, I know. \n\nOn to New York, New York.  If forced to take a vacation to Las Vegas, I could stay here and never leave and feel completely okay about that.  \n\nI have stayed here twice.  The rooms are standard hotel rooms but just steps away are some really cool time consuming activities. Okay, these things are technically a lot of steps away since Vegas hotels are built all maze-y and confusing to keep people stuck inside to spend more money.\n\nCoyote Ugly is fun in a \"I saw the movie and can totally do that\" sort of way.  I love any place that actually encourages my friends and I to dance on their bar.  \n\nThe dueling piano bar is great if you are there will a smaller group and want to laugh your booty off.  Get there early if you want to find a seat and be ready to spend a large portion of your evening there. \n\nThey have a roller coaster on top. I don't like roller coasters but I have heard from friends that it is an adventure. \n\nRegardless of which activity you decide to partake in, I highly recommend enjoying drinks in your hotel room beforehand...except maybe the roller coaster.
