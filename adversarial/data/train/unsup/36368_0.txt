Let me start off by saying that I'm not the biggest fan of sushi but I decided to give it another try. We went to the amazing Sushi Samba and it was to die for. The sushi alone had beautiful presentation and was a wonderful burst of flavor. It even had options for people who don't eat fish. The food was is a mix of Japanese, Peruvian and Brazilian cultures. Absolutely delighted with my Sushi Samba experience.
