An amazing food experience at prices justified by your taste buds, who will go \"WEEE!!!! WEEEE!!! WEEE!!!!!\" \n\nLucien was such a great find. We walked by in our wanderings as tourists, yelped it later and saw a sort of mixed bag of reviews. \n\nMany of the poorer reviews for Lucien had to do with two things: price and size. \n\n\"The portions were small and it was expensive!\" \n\nYou know where portions are plenty and prices are nominal? Burger King. You can get a triple stack for $3! Amazing! \n\nLucien is not Burger King. Reviews judging the restaurant based food all came out quite positive, and I have another one to add to the list. \n\nThe server was very nice, helpful, explained to me what \"fiddleheads\" are. He helped steer me towards the Bison entree and it was amazing. We also got the octopus starter and the pork belly. They were both really good. The veal ribeye was the other entree at the table, which was also good, but owner of said ribeye was a wee bit jealous of my bison. \n\nThe brownie for dessert was not my favorite after the whole meal was done, but luckily they brought out the cheesecake by accident and let us keep both. The cheesecake was much better than the brownie but a delight to be able to try them both! \n\n2 apps + 2 entrees + 1 bottle wine ($58) + 1 dessert + 2 cappuccino = $195\n\nSo put that in your bison pipe and smoke it. We loved every bite!
