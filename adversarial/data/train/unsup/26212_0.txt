Dr. Scraff is wonderful. I have been seeing him on and off since i was 12 due to medical reasons. He has always been wonderful and made me feel comfortable. I have seen 4 other gynos due to moving and none of them were as good at what they do as he is. However i do prefer his Rainbow office to the Sahara office.
