I'm so tired of these tacky locations. \n\nWhen I asked for water or charge me $1 for a real cup. I am so tired of being nickel and dimed. I talked to the manager Sofia. She mostly patronized and made excuses. and she could have cared less as I explained to her give them the pickle principle of basic customer service. \n\nTo top it off I said very clearly I wanted the nuggets and fried made fresh. They were not and I had to have them remake them. They were tired of me and it showed. That should never happen. \n\nComplete fail. On the upside there was a play area so the kids were happy in the end.
