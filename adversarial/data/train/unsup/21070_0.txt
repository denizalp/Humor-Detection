Great menu. The food here is very fresh, many options for practically any dietary wants and needs including gluten free, dairy free, vegetarian and vegan. \nI had a bowl with spinach base, water chestnuts, bean sprouts, mushrooms, zucchini, shrimp and peanut sauce. Omg! DELISH \nThere are so many choices here from salads to hot bowls to wraps. They offer many many veggies to choose from and many proteins and sauces. \nThe owner and staff were very willing to accommodate as well as inviting and friendly. \nIt's nice to have a place where I can get healthy food for a great value. I can't wait to try another combination of ingredients. \nThe atmosphere is somewhat basic, nothing too decorative but clean. I'd say if you're looking for ambiance this may not be the right choice, however, if you're looking for flavor and good food......they have it!
