I love it.  Point blank.  I came for my birthday on a 3 night comp... my room was gorgeous, the bathroom was fit for a queen, and the service was excellent.  Only one incident came up with room service taking over an hour, but to make up for it they took care of the bill.  The pool is to die for.  I wish I was still laying out having pitchers of mojitas delivered to me by bronze godesses... :(  so sad.  I miss you Caesars!
