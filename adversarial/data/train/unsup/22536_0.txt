This is not a review for Comcast cable service which is being saved for another review. This is a review for their walk up service center where you can pay your cable bill, replace a bad cable box, remote control or change service. Great people work here, helpful and knowledgable. Best times are between 10am and 2pm, Saturday is usually very busy. Save a stamp if you're in the area and stop in and pay in person.
