Nothing to write home about. One of the true test of going to this type of restaurants is to have the baked pork chop rice\/spaghetti. Came here for afternoon tea and ordered exactly that and was disappointed that it was just like any other. First of all, it was not even baked. Not even for one minute to crisp the top of the sauce. The pork was alright, but no taste if it wasn't for the sauce. Spaghetti was alright, but made the dish watery as previously stated in other reviews. The cup of milk tea tasted well enough, but was small compared to other restaurants like this. I would not come here unless I was already in the neighborhood.
