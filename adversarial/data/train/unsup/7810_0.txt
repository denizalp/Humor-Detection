Used to love coming in here, employees USED to be really cool and knowledgeable. Since they hired that snotty blonde girl, I can't stand going in there. She's completely unprofessional and should really be more discreet when she blatantly trash talks any other female that walks in the store. It's completely obvious when she is clearly heard from across the store making a comment to a coworker and then they all look over. Now the guys there are rude and the girl has some complex about being the only female working in a gun store. She's trash. You can tell by her attitude and the horrid paint job on her gun she carries. This place is garbage. Everyone in there thinks they're hot shit because they work at a gun store. Unfortunate. Last time we went in we were looking for a revolver and the dude helping us straight said \"oh I don't know anything about any revolver.\" What are the requirements to get hired at this place?!?! They're all disgusting people. And to top it off, this review hasn't based off of one experience like this, it's based off of THREE. All the same. Down to the fact that the snotty blonde makes a comment the second I walked in the door. And it's not just myself, it's any female in the store. She's god awful. And I find it really hard to believe she knows a damn thing about any firearm besides the one she carries with that hideous tiger print on it. That alone should make you turn and run out. Oh and their selection is garbage too. Unless you need a t shirt.
