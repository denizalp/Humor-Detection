Best of Charlotte please! I just came back from the dullest, blandest, most tasteless Mexican dinner ever!! I only gave it 2 stars because of the waiter, the food wasn't worth even that. \n\nI knew that I was in for a bad time when I saw so many happy old \"gringos\" leaving the place. That was  a sure sign that the food is closer to Howard Johnson than to Mexico. Sad but true, sorry. Authentic? The place is just like the set for an old Zorro TV movie and it's all downhill from there.\n\nFor starters the salsa was so watery that I finished the bowl before I even noticed. I never order nachos before but since they were loaded and topped with Jalapenos I went for it. Pickled jalapenos that is - as hot as kosher pickles. The waiter was embarrassed and rushed some sauteed jalapenos over to us. Still mild but at least they were real.\n\n I ordered a combo, I always do on a first visit  in Mexican restaurants. All three items, Taco, Enchilada and Chile relleno were stuffed with the same totally tasteless ground beef. No spices of any sort, the stuffing reminded me of a can of Spam. \n\nHonestly, anywhere closer to the border this place would have been laughed out of town. Martin Mull might approve but unless one was raised on sliced Wonder bread and mayo I'd pass.
