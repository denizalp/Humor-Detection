The food wasn't bad and the service was great. My problem lies with the owner who seated us and the way he spoke to the waitress cleaning the table so we could sit down. I don't know if she wasn't moving fast enough for him or what but he barked at her and she said \"almost done\" and then he commenced to chewing her out and said \"keep your mouth shut and clean the table\". I almost turned around and left but we wanted breakfast.\n\nThis is no way to speak to your employees and I was waiting for John Quinones to come out and ask \"what would you do?\".
