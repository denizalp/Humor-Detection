Is there anything more disturbing that a spiral of lamb spinning on an open-air vertical rotisserie? \n\nI realize this is the typical way to cook \"Yee-roh\" meat, but it still erks the hell out of me. At Best Gryro's, there's two spits of meat spinning in all of it's glory just behind the counter. What if someone sneezes? What if there's Swine Flu in the air? Surely this can't be sanitary, can it? \n\nAh hell, everyone else orders 'em, so they can't be that bad for you, right? For lunch I threw aside my inhibitions and ordered the Regular Philly Gyro, which consisted of shaved \"meat\" (a lamb\/beef combo?), peppers & onions with a cucumber yogurt sauce served open faced on a grilled pita. The portions were HUGE! There was no feasible way for any normal human to eat this in a sandwich form. (Note to self: the \"junior\" portion would be plenty next time). \n\nThe gyro was decent, but not the \"best\" as the self titled local chain proclaims. It's also worth noting, the store-front in this Northfield location is a renovated Arthur Treachers, so you can imagine the decor is very bland looking.\n\nOverall, the atmosphere and food of Best Gyro's is about as appealing as the ever spinning mystery meat , which isn't saying much.
