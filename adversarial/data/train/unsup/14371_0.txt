Just signed up for a year.  Chris the owner welcomed me immediately as I step in.  Very clean, organized, top-of-the-line equipment.  I would recommend this place just on my experience from my first visit.\n\nThere are also supplements at cost, nice clean bathrooms with showers and lockers, nice staff.\n\nThank you Chris for the awesome welcome and membership.
