Wow... i don't think I've ever been in a more narrow place.. ever! \n\nbut it was just perfect in ever way!!! \n\nThey have tables along one side and a bar with tall stools along the other side... you can watch them make your food.... \nits like the food network... but live and you can smell it :) \n\nmy coworker and i sat right in front of the oven... every time they would open the oven i would only get hungrier!! :) we could see all the fresh and yummy ingredients!! \n\ni had the Reuben (Pastrami, corned beef, homemade sauerkraut and Swiss with a side of 1000 island dressing) \n\nWOW... it was amazing... for their sauerkraut they use red cabbage... it was more sweet than bitter... and the crust of the pasty was flaky and buttery... so delicious!! and i honestly forgot how much i love corned beef! over all it was very rich... but great to share.... \n\nMy Coworker had the Italian.. (pepperoni, salami, ham, mozzarella, basil, tomatoes and marinara sauce) it looked great... he loved it... you could see the fresh basil and tomatoes... it smelled divine \n\nwe didn't speak for a full 20 minutes... just barley loud enough mmmmmmmms and o-m-g this is amazing... said quietly to ourselves.... \n\nall of the employees were so outgoing and laid back at the same time... just really cool guys... i loved the atmosphere and the attitudes that filled this place... \n\ni cannot wait to come back!
