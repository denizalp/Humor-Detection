Took my car there for their B3 service on my car as I was under the impression that service had do be done by the dealer while under warranty. Fortunately I found out later that I don't have to use the dealer.\n\nHere is why...\n\nFirstly, their service price for the B3 service is around $700 after tax. While there are some parts changes, the majority of the work on this service is fluid changes & diagnostics & can be done by many other mechanics for under $200.\n\nMy biggest issue with them was they billed me for something I did not order: An Interior Air Quality Service which costs $59.95 + tax! Fortunately I managed to talk to the service manager and he agreed that there was nothing mentioned on the bill of service beforehand about this work being performed but I now have to go out of my way and make a return trip to the dealership to get a refund.\n\nThis really seems like a case of a service advisor taking advantage of a customer and trying to tack on unnecessary service in hopes of a higher commission. This is not something I expect from Mercedes-Benz dealer and one of the reasons why I go to the dealer in the first place. In fact, they would have gotten away with this had I not taken a very close look at my bill and for this reason (regardless of a refund) I will never take my car back to them for service.\n\nDon't get ripped off, shop around if you need routine service or any work done on your car.\n\nBeyond this I can mention there are some positive things. They have an excellent shuttle service and free coffee and snacks while you wait. Unfortunately I don't think these outweigh sneaky service advisors.
