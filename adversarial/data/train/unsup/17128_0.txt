Why are all these reviews so damn negative?? I'm confounded. Most people seem to have complaints that involve their children. I don't have any kids so I wouldn't be able to comment on that aspect. I've been going to this Absolute Dental in the Albertson's shopping center for about 4 years, and I've never had cause to be upset. I've always left Absolute Dental in a chipper mood, or at least as happy as I can possibly be leaving the dentist. ;) \n\nI love my hygienists! They love to talk and let me know about their families, and they're just really nice people. I usually have a different dentist every time I visit but on my last appointment, this dentist was particularly memorable. She was a younger gal with a great sense of humor. I hope to see her again!\n\nAt checkout, the front desk ladies give you a card with your next appointment date and time on it. The day before your appointment, they give you a call to remind you to come in. These are very helpful for forgetful people like me!
