I know, I keep doing updates for a place I said that I'm not crazy about, but as I keep saying, if I band I must see is playing at such a venue, I'll tolerate the surroundings. \n\nFair is fair; I'm adding one star to my previous review for the washroom attendant. I like having one there and don't mind throwing him a buck or two. It's a nice touch no matter what anyone says, and in this economy, if it helps someone pay their bills, so be it.  \n\nPerhaps they're trying to compete with Diesel. If so, my man needs the digital name tag. \n\nAnother star is due for the crack security team for tossing out two suspicious looking goomba\/yinzer\/caucasian-hip-hop-co-opter types who snuck in and were being obnoxious. \n\nOne does not throw hip-hop chops at a metal show. That is intolerable even if you bought a ticket. \n\nBut I gotta take one off for to the little blonde attention whore who kept jumping up and down in front of us and frantically hugging (tackling?) her friends while making sure she bumped into other attendees. She clearly had no interest in the bands aside from feeling the need to mock them and insisted on doing this stupid dance in which she shook as if she was on a Coney Island ride--again, right in front of us. She really wanted us to notice her for some reason. I guess heroin does that to people. Thankfully she left halfway through 3 Inches Of Blood's set. Her date is why I really wish guys would stop wearing hiphugger\/skinny\/girlie jeans. Not even my girlfriend wants to see male ass cleavage. Jesus. \n\nEh, I'll give 'em one back since parking was only 10 bucks tonight, which left us enough cash to get a quickie Vietnamese dinner across the street without missing the two headlining acts. \n\nAm I too kind a reviewer? \n\nP.S. Turns out  I got some more kindness in my back pocket for Altar. I REALLY appreciate how they allow you to come in and out after you present your tickets at the door as long as you let them wristband you. It's highly convenient if you arrive early and want to find some pre-gig nourishment since Altar serves no snacks inside.\n\nP.P.S. A large, green, inflatable ball kept bouncing around the crowd during Dethlehem's set. At first I thought it was a beach ball, then perhaps a faux boulder. After the set, I finally got a gander at it --it was a giant 20-sided gaming die. \"Ahhh,\" I said to myself once I caught a good glimpse of it. \n\nConsider the swords 'n axes lyrical grist of the night's bands. \n\nAhhh. You get it too. \n\nI was into D&D for a spell as a kid. Lay off.
