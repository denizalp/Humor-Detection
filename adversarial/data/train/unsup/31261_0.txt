Let me start out by saying I do love this place and we come here often. However I must bring up the fly problem happening in the inside dining area. Horrible. My husband killed no less than 25 sitting at our table with a menu while at dinner tonight. What does the kitchen look like? We did tell the server, he said good job you get a medal the next time you come in. We handed our menu back saying put it in the dishwasher for sanitation. You need to address this issue.
