Oh my goodness, the food!! The amount and quality of food is like no buffet I've ever been to before. It was almost overwhelming (in a completely good way). Everything we tried was delicious, I wish I had more space in my stomach to have tried more. We went in a weekday morning, and the price we thought was excellent ($20\/person). Wait staff was a little unprofessional when we were being seated, but really didn't bother us too much as it was a buffet. Wish I had known about the buffet sooner, would have eaten here every morning.
