Good pizza.  Some amazing pizza-steak hoagies. Good in-service, too. They used to deliver and now, for whatever reason, they do not. It's kinda hard to believe in this day and age and in \"America's Hometown\" that a place that makes pizza this well no longer delivers. Man, we used to be able to count on Pepperoncini's for a decent delivery pizza, but nooooo.  They don't deliver anymore. That truly sucks. Makes me not want to go there anymore because of that. I may be the only person that thinks like this though. I am sure EVERYONE else that used to order pizza from Pepperoncini's will now really appreciate that they no longer deliver to the local community.  Folks in a 3 mile radius will now pack the Pepperoncini's parking lot (it's huge) and rush in for a pizza after getting home from work. Makes good business sense that they stopped delivering. It may just be the right call for an increase in business.  Wait, maybe people didn't like that they could order a decent pizza and have it delivered! They probably are more focused now on the valet parking for customers calling in for pizza pickup. Good thing there is exceptional public transport to and from the place, too. Anyhow, they still have good pizza.
