Our hot water heater had passed it's age! It was approximately 20-25 years old.  I live in a historic district where the homes are old. Called Brother's Plumbing to get an estimate on Solar. Mark C. their technician arrived promptly and discussed that my home was too small and was very honest with me when explaining that we would not recoup our dollars back. So we upgraded the water heater and he had it done within hours, even though he had to do some re-piping! The experience was good and they did the job and came in right at the bid price! You may call other companies but Brother's did something that I have yet to see with others. They gave me good service, all the discounts that  apply along with warranty on the work and they were competitive. I will recommend them to anyone who needs Plumbing or work within their scope!
