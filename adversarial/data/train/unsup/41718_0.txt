Wish I could give zero stars, OnTrac is terrible. Have used them for Amazon (unwillingly) deliveries and in the last 3 of 3 orders, within a two week span, every single one of them has been at least a day late. \n\nTracking is worthless, doesn't tell you anything, and the calling the customer service line is an exercise in futility. If you have the patience to wait for at least 30 minutes to get someone on the phone, you'll be graced with an uncaring, unmotivated employee whose only party-line answer is that it's all Amazon's fault for delivering the package late to them. Funny how only OnTrac has this problem, not any other shipping service (FedEx, UPS, USPS, et al.) that Amazon uses. \n\nNothing but excuses and poor delivery service, even poorer customer service. I will never willingly do business with these clowns and have complained to Amazon's executive office about having to have my orders shipped with them. How do you screw up 3 out of 3 times, regardless of what vendor my goods are coming from, Amazon or third party? Unreal. \n\nStay away from these fools and save yourself the headache.
