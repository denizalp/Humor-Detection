This is one of those reviews you feel like you HAVE to write because the experience was so AMAZING that you just need everyone to know about it! First off, Lana is one of the nicest people I think I ever met. She really makes you and your big day feel important, and you can tell that creating the perfect dress for your big day, it almost as important to her as it is to you!  I took my mom, sister, and Gma with me and we all left feeling so confident that when I picked up my dress, it would be perfect and I trusted Lana immediately. \n\nSure enough when I came to pick my dress, it was even more perfect than it was when I dropped it off (didn't know that was possible). I need to point out that I am so picky and I left there beyond happy! I can't say enough Thank yous! I am moving out of the scottsdale areas, but I without a doubt plan to make the drive for any future alterations!\n\n*Once I get married, I will post before and after photos for reference
