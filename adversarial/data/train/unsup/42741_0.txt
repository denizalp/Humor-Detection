This place has been a fantastic addition to Chambana. It's perfect for date nights, bachelorette parties, random get togethers, or even company team-building events. \n\nI brought my wife here for our third anniversary and we had a blast. We brought our own wine (you can bring appetizers too if you want) and ended up with two beautiful renditions of a wonderful painting. The instructor is super friendly and very talented. It's on the second floor of the building and was a little hard to find at first, but there was a guy waiting downstairs directing people up to the second floor. Much appreciated!
