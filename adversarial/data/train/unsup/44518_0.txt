The food is spicy first of all!  Normal for Los Dos.  The service is (slow) not very good.  The place isn't as clean as I expect from a good restaurant.  The food is good, the green chili pork at $15 tastes great, but is over priced.  All the food here is priced high in my opinion.  Mexican lunch menu at that price doesn't make sense.  \n\nAfter all that:  I really like the receipts they serve (after all they are Los Dos).   I like the spice, so if you like the heat and don't mind the price, I'd say try it for yourself.
