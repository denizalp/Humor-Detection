3rd and most used stop of the pub crawl \n\nThey were Dead and giving out 2-4-1 drinks, and free shots. No cover and were able to get us all in one place. \n\nThe drinks were good, could have been strong, can't remember, and the music was loud. The lower bar was small and slow. I recommend buying multiple at a time. The bouncers were kind enough to escort some douche out for us after creeping a little too much.
