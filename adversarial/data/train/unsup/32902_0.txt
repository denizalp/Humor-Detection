Such a cool hang out spot! Don't let the exterior deceive you - it definitely gives off a totally different vibe. Inside you will find a large indoor\/outdoor space (also a bar and small restaurant) with a ton of games that will keep you busy for a casual night out.\n\nIndoor: 2 pool tables, tables & couches to lounge around, giant darts, some arcade games, a large open area (I'm guessing for dancing on busy nights?), food, and a bar.\n\nOutdoor: giant jenga, giant operation (this wasn't working when I dropped by), large cornhole, tetherball, four square, giant beer pong\/trash pong, a stage, and seating.\n\nI was here on a monday night. Gold Spike wasn't crowded but all the games were still occupied. I'm not sure how this place is on a busy night but I definitely recommend dropping by if you're in town looking for something to do with a group of friends, especially if it's a random weekday with not much going on!
