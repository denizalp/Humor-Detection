It is almost mandatory to sit on a patio if it's a beautiful day, luckily Kildares has a nice patio that is south facing and sunny.\n. \nWe arrived around 4ish and were able to get some prime real estate for the evening. Our server was awesome and very attentive to our needs. \n\nWe ordered some wings (29 cents on Tues) trio of grilled cheese sliders and a mixed green salad with blackened salmon.... All the food was super tasty, and even though my salmon was not blackened - it was still pretty good. (They also removed the salmon from our bill - how nice!)\n\nThey have some good drink selections and since this particular pub is close to my place I will be going back again to try more of their tasty menu items...\n.
