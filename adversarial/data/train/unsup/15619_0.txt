I was in the area and decided too go to this Giant Eagle this time.\nIt is one of the bigger supermarkets int he area.\nThey had most of what I needed and was in and out pretty quickly.\nThe prices are ok and the customer service is fast and friendly.\nIf there is crowded there could be a wait at the registers.\nI would go back to this Giant Eagle again.
