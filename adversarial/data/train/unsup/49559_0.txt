If you want a great deal, fly this airline!!!!\n\nBut don't plan on getting any customer service.  Don't try changing anything on your itinerary  on their website, because it won't work, trust me.  And when you try to get them on the phone, good luck.  You will either be on hold for hours, or you will get an automated message telling you they are too busy to take your call, and please call later.... \"good-bye!\"
