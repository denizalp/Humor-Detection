I absolutely love Four Peaks! They have my favorite beer (Peach Ale) and an amazing Chicken Salad Pita and Outstanding pasta salad. I love the busy but upbeat feel here and go all the time with friends. I am dreaming of the Peach Ale right now.. \n\nIf visiting AZ this place is AMAZING and has something to offer for even the pickist of eaters. Enjoy!
