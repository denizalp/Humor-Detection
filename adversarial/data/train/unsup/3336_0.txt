Ordered a \"smash cake\" for my daughter turning one years old thru there cake to order specialist her name was Tillie and that was a MISTAKE ! \n\nI take a seat and start to explain my idea. First I got no hello no smile nothing. This lady had no personality, she couldn't even crack a smile. \n\nShe starts to show me pictures she pulls up from google on her computer. I state numerous times I want the cake to have \"whip frosting\" then she proceeds to tell me she doesn't think they have whip frosting. What ?!?! Shouldn't you know, I thought this was a bakery and you are the cake specialist right ? Ridiculous \n\nSo she goes to the back, ten minutes comes back ok we can do it for you. I let her know the cake needs to be all one color which is pink. She fills out the paperwork and reads it back to me. Ok so the cake will be red and pink and have butter cream lol ridiculous and again I repeat myself. \n\nOk Tillie one more time. Smash cake, all pink and all whip frosting. I ask do you want me to pay now ? She states to me ah you can I guess if you want too lol ok lady I'll pay now.\n\nWe pick up the cake bring it home and what do you know buttercream frosting, guess I won't be ordering and more cakes !
