I stayed at this hotel. All I can say is WOW. The place needs a remodel, an upgrade. Looks like I stepped into the 1980's when I went into my room. (Better then Circus Circus which makes you feel like you walked into the 1960's, I had to look down and make sure I didn't have bell bottoms on) ANYWAYS, these hotels are HUGE so it takes time to go back and forth to your room when you leave. Our view from the room was the top of another buildings Air Conditioning units. The cool thing about the Monte Carlo is the statue of all the womens bootys outside. THATS IT. Wait, one more thing, it was close to Dennys, McDonalds, and 711. Okay, now that's it.
