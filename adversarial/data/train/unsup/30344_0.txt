I went here with a group of scooterists for a Scooter Rally (Jaguars!) breakfast\/brunch.  I'm from Edmonton so I don't get a chance to go to this place often but we have had our breakfast\/brunch here twice now.\n\nIt is a really cool spot.  We were seated outside at the back so I can't comment on the what it is like eating inside.  There was a band playing so it could probably get loud I guess.  Outside was great, we could still chat normally and still hear the music.\n\nI had the pulled pork sandwich with the garlic fries.  They do warn about the garlic on the fries on the menu so be warned!  I love garlic and love those fries --- SO much garlic!  Awesome stuff.  Want again.\n\nWe did have poor service out back.  They may not have been fully prepared for our big group (40 people), but we did book it with them so if they weren't prepared it is their own fault.\n\nIf I lived in Calgary this would probably be one of my go-to spots.  Very unique atmosphere and good food at a reasonable price.
