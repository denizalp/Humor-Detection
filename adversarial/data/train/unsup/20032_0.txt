I am apparently a fan of the cheese factor when it comes to themed hotels\/casinos in Vegas. Paris. Venetian. New York-New York. \n\nThe decor here is just adorable. I've never been to NY, but whatever, I love it. \n\nWe stayed across the street at the MGM, so we ended up spending quite a bit of time here since it's so close by, and I was having a love affair with the decor. I love all the little streets full of quick service food locations. The casino floor is pretty extensive. They have a Coyote Ugly Bar too, if you're into that sort of thing. \n\nThey have a bar upstairs near Coyote Ugly though that serves good, strong drinks for a good price too. It's good for people watching. \n\nThe decor here is awesome though. They definitely put a lot of time and effort into it. It's a fairly family friendly hotel too. Especially with the Roller Coaster. \n\nThe Cirque du Soleil show here, Zumanity is awesome too. It's adult themed though, it's like a cross between Cirque du Soleil and Burlesque\/Cabaret. We loved it!
