This restaurant is probably one of the more fancy Indian restaurants I've been too. Portions here are a bit bigger than most Indian restaurants which is awesome. I had the salad on the side, pickles, pakora, dal makhani, and gobi parantha. I definitely recommend the dal makhani. It's very creamy, flavourful and filling. The gobi parantha is nice to try too. It's a bit crispier than naan, but it was a nice change. The pickles are very salty and spicy, so a little goes a long way. It's a nice seasoning to add with the meal.
