Holy crap. I already love this place. Now your going to go ahead and add an AYCE menu...forget about it.  I definitely got my $26 worth and then some.  I ate my weight in garlic yellow tale and uni.  Pink lady roll (spicy tuna roll topped with ahi and garlic ponzu) was pretty damn good.  Any night spent with Jonny and Charlie from crazy sushi is a good one. Add AYCE to it and I'm on cloud 9.  Keep up the good work guys.
