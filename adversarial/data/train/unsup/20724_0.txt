Finally got to check out the \"new kid on the block\" since this place is walking distance from my place in SouthEnd.  There was a HUGE hole to fill with the Common Market (opening back up soon, but still further out!).  I'm glad Pop the Top is a welcome addition.  If you really think about it, it actually goes really well with their neighbors in the same complex.   Do some Ultra Running, then grab some beer and pizza to refuel.  (wiping the hands motion... done).\n\nSo normally I would walk here, but I was coming from an appointment so I picked up my buddy... I think there is retail parking underneath the apartments, but I decided to park across the street in the Design Center parking lot.  Easy enough.  \n\nThe place still had the \"new construction\" smell but we came into a door that put us smack into some shelving filled with beer... after snaking around, the was a bar... probably 6-8 seats and the barkeep.  The menu is completely digitized on tvs.  I think there were 20 or so beers on tap.  The other \"scary\" thing I saw after I was done drinking and closing out my tab is that at the bottom of the tv menu they have an Untappd feed....  If you use the app to keep track of the beers you have tried, you will appear there if you check into the place.  I was on the tv twice!  It was a little scary, and a little shaming at the same time...\n\nDidn't quite catch the name of the bartender, but he was quick to offer recommendations and was very knowledgeable.\n\nWe decided to drink outside... there were about 4-5 tables and an ourdoor couch, which was nice.  The inside (aside from the bar) there were about 3 tables and a comfy couch and a couple of high back chairs.  Really cool space to meet folks, do some work, relax, and chill.  Snacks were available... I also saw that cider and wine were available too.  A little something for everyone!
