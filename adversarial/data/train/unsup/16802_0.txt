Was excited to come here but ended up disappointed after having dinner\/drinks. The place itself is really cool with a great vibe and awesome set up. It's like an old house turned into a restaurant. The drinks were fine and the service was good, it was really just the food that was dissatisfying. We had the branzino fish entree (big enough for 2) fried cauliflower and the chicory salad. The sauce on the branzino fish was over load and was actually not a huge platter for 2 to share. The salad was soggy and tasteless. Definitely not worth $11.\n\nSince we weren't feeling anything but didn't want to complain we asked for bread. Our waitress said she could \"sell us bread and butter for $5\" which was surprising. $30 entrees and they can't give you free bread?? Overall I would recommend coming here for drinks but not food.
