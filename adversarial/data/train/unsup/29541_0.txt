I've been here a couple times with my husband, and we really enjoyed it. It has an excellent location right off of East Blvd in Dilworth. The hot dogs are very good, and the menu has a lot of toppings to choose from. For my taste, these are the best hot dogs in Charlotte. We both had the Chili Cheese Coney and the dog itself has a lot more flavor than the typical dog. They grill it right there and the chili and cheese are very well balanced. The onion rings are terrific. I only wish they had healthy side options like a salad or a cup of fruit.
