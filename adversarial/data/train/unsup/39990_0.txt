As the owner of multiple properties, residential and commercial,  in AZ (and other states),  I sincerely thank Jimmy Gordon and Circle G Roofing for their thorough and timely work on an urgent project we recently completed in Scottsdale.  Circle G Roofing is a top-notch contractor that delivers excellent workmanship, timely communication and highly capable crews.  Their pricing was great, too. They exceeded my expectations and won our loyalty for all our AZ projects, now being my \"go to\" roofing contractor.  Thank you Circle G, and especially Jimmy!
