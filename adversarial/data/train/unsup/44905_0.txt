This buffet has improved greatly since the last time I ate here about a year ago.  Fresh fruit!  Very sweet tasty and tender pineapple and watermelon.  Mmmmm!  Excellent waiter - very professional, helpful but not annoying.  The coffee tasted good!  I had tender fried fish, pizza, eggs, bagels and lox and more and liked everything!
