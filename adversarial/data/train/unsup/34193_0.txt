Call them first  The service was first rate and the price was very fair. They will be my plumber for the rest of my life. The technician was extremely knowledgeable and helpful and a joy to work with. I repeat, call them first and you will will save your self time and money and get a first rate job   I was taken advantage of by Ben Franklin on a water heater job. They took my expensive solar water heater and also the roof top collector. They lied to me I found out later. Never ever ever ever ever ever use Ben Franklin plumbers.  I am very happy with this plumber.
