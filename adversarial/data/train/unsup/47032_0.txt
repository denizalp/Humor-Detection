Had an issue with dinner 2 weeks ago.  Owner (mike) invited us back for a second chance.  My wife and i were blown away!  The maple pork chops were sooo tender and delicious and the prime rib sandwhich was as tender and juicy as u could ask for.  Wr also had the peach sangria which really added a nice kick to our meals.  I would definitely reccomend this place and will for sure come back.
