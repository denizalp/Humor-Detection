My mom and I went to this dealership recently. I've done lots of research on many brands of vehicles, but Volvo was the one I thought was perfect for us. We worked with Kim, who was incredibly helpful and friendly. He helped us out greatly by finding a really awesome car! I'm only 14, but I plan to drive at 16. Volvo Of Tempe is the best! They are very understanding and they don't rush you like other dealers. I would definitely recommend Volvo Of Tempe! Thanks Kim!
