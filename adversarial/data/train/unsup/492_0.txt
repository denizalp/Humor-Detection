I really felt like I had gotten Punk'd by all the wonderful yelp reviewers. One thing I learned from my Arizona trip is that you guys are deprived of really good food and because you don't have any you mistake horrible food for something praiseworthy. It doesn't even matter what I ordered, all my friends and I got something different and each person's dish was not appetizing. If you are an out of towner, I would skip this spot.. it's more for the local's taste buds.
