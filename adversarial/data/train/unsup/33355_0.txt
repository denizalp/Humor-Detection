I am so glad I found Vegan Invasion! Recently my family and I have began to transition to vegetarian\/vegan and had no idea where to start. While doing some research I came across this company and its exactly what we were looking for! With meal prep AND delivery it has made this transition so smooth for us! Dominque is so helpful in explaining everything and her weekly menus are so detailed and yummy! I love supporting local businesses as well as a nice family!
