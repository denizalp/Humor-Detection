It's a pretty good Community College.  I only took 2 classes here, while still in high school, but the teacher's were friendly and understanding.  I've had a lot of friends that have gone there too.  The cost is pretty cheap and a good way to get some of the basic college credits out of the way.  It's a pretty spread out campus, which can be the only bad thing.  Also, during peak hours parking can be a challenge.
