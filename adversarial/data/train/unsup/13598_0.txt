This place is absolutely amazing. I highly recommend this place. I had a 90 minute massage and the masseuse I had worked magic on me. I had just finished playing my 3rd round of golf in 3 days and my back was a mess. She took her time and completely worked at my aching muscles. This place is highly recommended for anyone who has a bad back. I totally feel like a new man. The cost was $100 for 90 minutes. I was so happy with my results I tipped her $65 dollars. Totally worth evert penny.
