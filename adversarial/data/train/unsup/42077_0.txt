This location has gone through a complete overhaul. It looks fantastic in here now! I feel so comfortable shopping here. So clean, neat, organized and high class. A far cry from what it used to look like. The produce section looks amazing now with the laminate flooring and reorganization. The new signs and fresh coat of paint throughout the store, inside and out, make it look like an entirely different store. It's absolutely beautiful and a pleasure to shop now. I will be back more often.\n\nNow for the bad news. I guess they had to pay for the upgrade somehow. Certain items here are WAY OVERPRICED now!! Wow!!! Vegetarian frozen food is jacked up way high, and so were other items. Ridiculous! But their sale items cannot be beat. Can't wait until enough suckers buy these newly overpriced items to offset the cost of the overhaul so that they can return to their normal, decent prices.
