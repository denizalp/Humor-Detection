How in God's name have I lived in Richmond Hill my entire life and never ventured into Joe's for anything more than a shawarma sandwich? I included them in the hamburger issue of the weekly Yelp several weeks back because the lore of their famous burgers has stood the test of time in R.Hill for years and everyone who eats at Joe's agrees they've got it going on in burger land. \n\nDespite this impressive yelpo-mercial for their burgers that wasn't what I chose to dine on last night..I mean the 2, 4 and 8oz patties sound amazing BUT if I'm going to Joe's I'm going to have the Joe's famous burger that Edwin A sold me on in his earlier review. To accomplish that fear poppa is gonna need his Full appetite firing on all cylinders, not just a 9:30PM \"I'm hungry and need to eat something that's not too filling.\" \n\nKris you wimp - get in there and stop procrastinating...\n\nOk ok self...I promise next time I've got an hankering for a greasy Burb-ger I'm hitting Joe's. But for last night's purposes I ordered the steak sandwich on a bun. WOW. Floored me! In minutes they were able to produce a perfectly cooked medium rare angus steak (made fresh to order) which they garnished with my choice of toppings (BBQ sauce, onions, pickles, and homemade coleslaw).\n\nKiller! That's all I have to say...will update once I've had a burger.
