Excellent service. Wes could not have been nicer. Several months ago I stopped in with one of my cars without an appointment. Even though they were busy they worked on my car for nearly an hour attempting to determine the problem. They concluded it was a warranty issue and I should take it to the dealer. No charge! Who does that? They said they didn't fix anything so there was no charge. A few days ago when I had a problem with my other car there was no question where to take it. I've told several friends of the first experience and encouraged them to try these folks when they need service. I love smart business people. Thanks guys.
