I was so hoping to give a great review of this place but alas, no dice.\n\nYes the noodles and Mongolian beef pancakes were very good. Saddened to say that's about it.\n\nI'm trying to figure out the hype...we walked into the place and it is small - like 8 tables small and bar to watch chefs make noodles is about 8 seats. If you wish to go, do not go during lunch or dinner rush. You will wait a very long time if the place is full.\n\nFirst thing I noticed was the humidity... Steamy and hot. Poor ventilation and the sun beats down even with the shades on the door which is the only window.\n\nWe were told by waitress to sit down and she grabbed two menus and threw them on the table and took off. Few minutes later she took our order. The good news was it was fast!!! Arrived like in seven minutes...\n\nAs we sat shoveling the noodles and beef  pancakes in our mouths I noticed most folks were sweating profusely like us- well, at least it wasn't just us.\n\nThe veggies were fresh, the noodles were perfect and highlight was the beef pancakes - those were heavenly!\n\nThe meat ruined everything. My Hubby's braised pork was pure fat. No real meat! (Flavor was great though... Damn shame!) My ground pork was surely frozen or dehydrated and then cooked in attempt to bring it back to life. Sad.\n\nNo kids menu, sweatshop vibe and our waitress never came back until we begged for check.\n\nBummer!
