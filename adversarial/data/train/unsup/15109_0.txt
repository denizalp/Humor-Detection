if you're traveling solo, don't even bother. If you're choosing to share rooms with strangers which I did, you just might be kept awake by others socializing... my experiences at this place were varied, but that wasn't the only problem. Shared bathroom \/ shower, sharing rooms with STRANGERS, mild odor in the room.... hostels aren't for me. So I won't be staying in one ever again. This is not to say you wouldn't like staying at a hostel, maybe even this one. \n\ndespite the very low price and free breakfast ( less than $20 \/ night), I'll warn you that you do get what you pay for.
