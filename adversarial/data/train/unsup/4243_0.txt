SCAM ALERT!! Now, I'm kind of disappointed that my first Yelp of 2010 has to be a negative one, but whatever, this place really pissed me off. According to the fine folks at Merriam-Webster, organic is defined as \"developing in a manner analogous to the natural growth and evolution characteristic of living organisms; arising as a natural outgrowth\"\n\nSo that's their play. They will overcharge the shit out of you under the guise of being organic, and good for the environment, and blah blah blah. \n\nHowever, upon my first and penultimate experience with this place, I learned that this was not the case. I brought in 5 dresses and 1 shirt to be dry cleaned before a trip abroad over Christmas. As I came to pick them up, they had 4 of my dresses and my shirt completed, and it cost over $70!!!! These were not ornate, delicate, vintage, lacey dresses by any stretch of the word. Cute? Absolutely! But delicate to the point of over $15 per dress? I don't think so.\n\nIf you've been paying attention you'll realize that one of my dresses was not returned to me. That's because they damaged it. Somehow, they caused to deep purple top color to bleed all over the grey bottom half of my dress. And this is what they said to me: \"Don't worry, this happens ALL THE TIME. It's a super easy fix! We just throw a bunch of CHEMICALS on it to remove the bled dye.\"\n\nHmmm, throw a bunch of \"chemicals\" on my dress to fix your errors after I am paying top dollar to have my belongings \"organically cleaned??\" Me thinks something is not adding up as it should...\n\nAnd this is the best part, after they damaged and treated my lycra\/polyester dress (not fancy material in the slightest,) when I came to pick it up, they had the gaul to charge me $12 for it.\n\nFool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.
