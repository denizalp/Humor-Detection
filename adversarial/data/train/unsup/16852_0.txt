Congrats on their uber successful grand opening last night. Even after a long day of wrapping and moving furniture, I still wanted to stop by the latest local brewery to grace our corner of the desert.\n\nThe reason can be summed up in one word: sours\n\nI had never heard of this place prior to seeing some activity on Facebook. But as soon as I saw that they were going to have two sours available, I clicked IN posthaste.\n\nWe had no trouble finding the place. Helping us out was a good size line outside and a big bright sign signaling their arrival on the Henderson scene.\n\nBefore long, we entered and found a table. As per my usual MO, I ordered a sampler platter+1 ie all seven of their offerings. Unsurprisingly, my favorites were the two sours. I give the nod to the Sourpuss over the 9th Island Pineapple Sour, but both were enjoyable.\n\nThe staff handled the sizable opening night crowd well and exhibited the friendliness that I've come to expect from the craft beer universe.\n\nI will most definitely return.
