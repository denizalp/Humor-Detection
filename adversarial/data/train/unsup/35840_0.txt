This place is a parents oasis. Great set up. Just wish the parent lounge area was bigger and had more seating for weekends. Also more cubby holes. Also felt as though the art and crafts are should be in one of those seperate side rooms, so crayons aren't on the floor everywhere. Staff was amazingly pleasant. Playground was safe, and cushioned.  I would take the nail area out and add more massage chairs parents rend to hogg them. Should be wipes near by to wipe down chairs doe sanitary purposes. All and all a great place for kids to be themselves!
