Came here for the NYE prix fixe.  Good food and good company made the night very memorable.  We started with the oyster amuse bouche which was lovely and delicate.  I had the squab as the starter and although I was so tempted to pick that little sucker up and eat it with my hands, I thought better of it.  It was nicely roasted and very evenly seasoned.  And though it was kind of hard to eat, I think I managed to scrape all the meat off those tiny bones.  I had a taste of my friend's onion soup with was velvety and rich.  \nNext stop was the sturgeon - a serious misstep on my part.  The fish was cooked very well, but the sauce on the scallop dish blew the sturgeon out of the water....(pun intended).  \nEveryone else had the short-rib (a trend that I do enjoy but am rather tired of).  But I, being the soul-less foodie that I am went with the veal chop.  It was a nice bone-in, thick cut of baby cow.  I'm forgetting the accompaniments now, but it was a nicely seasoned piece of meat.\nThe dessert was the baked alaska which fell short of my favorite incarnation at the Oceanaire.  It had a nice charred merengue over huckleberry and a lemon poppyseed cake.  A little tart, but refreshing after the meat heavy meat.\nThe NYE price was a deal at this LV main-staple.  I can't wait to try the blue cheese souffle that I've been reading so much about.
