STOLEN WATCH\n\nMy wife's $400 Michael Kors watch was stolen out of her car here when she was getting it detailed. The car fully in their possession for a good 2 hours. The watch was in the glove compartment when it was dropped off and my wife noticed it missing on her way home from the wash. She did not stop anywhere else, no where else it could have been taken.\n\nThey have signs that say \" not responsible for stolen items\" but this does not eliminate their legal liability when they take possession of the car and keys. \n\nDo not give this place your business, the employees are not trustworthy and they do not have adequate surveillance over the vehicles and workers. \n\nUpdate: I have filed a complaint with the corporate office and have been told I will be contacted by their general manager. I will continue to update this review.
