YUM! \n\nI just \"discovered\" this place while heading towards \"home\" down Alta. \n\nI grabbed a carryout of Red Curry and Pad Ka Pharo. Those who know me know I can eat my weight in rice noodles so I'm not sure why I didn't choose two noodle selections. Oh well that's next time!\n\nI asked for medium spice and I personally think it was mild. Maybe they held back? \n\nThe Red Curry was flavorful and had tons of veggies thanks to the veggie option I chose. The spicy basil was good but I would like it even spicier :) the tofu was cut into the right size too. Very vegan and veggie friendly place. They even offer almond milk for their drinks.\n\nBoth my selections were from the Lunch menu and came with a sesame oil dressing salad and a fried ?spring roll? Both I personally don't care for so I will just order from the regular menu next time. But if you like those items, get the lunch option because it's a ton of food for the low price. \n\nI will be back!\n\nOh the sweet young lady at the counter said I could call my order in next time, but side note, it only took a few short minutes to get my carryout order and be on my way.
