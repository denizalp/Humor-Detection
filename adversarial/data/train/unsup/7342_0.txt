Reason For Visit\nService\n\n\"Lazy slack axxxx giving consumers the run around\"\n\nFirst off! The receptionist, Sandy is unprofessional. Sandy transfers you without informing you first and doesn't willingly give her  name. I wonder why! Lol\nAwesome customer service Sandy (in my sarcastic voice). \n\nMy car has been there twice. It turns off in the middle of traffic. They tell me they can't fix it because they can't duplicate the problem. I tell them to drive the car everyday for as least 20 min. so that it can do what it does to me. \n\nThey don't! Went to get some items out of my car. It took them 30 min. to find the key. Sure you're driving it! \n\nSharon Ader the rep. I was working with hung up on me. After I questioned the lame excuse she gave me in regards to ordering a part. \n\nAnyway, they had my car for 2 wks. Found nothing...Ive had it back for 2 days...drove up the street to the store. Off again! \n\nNevertheless, I DO NOT recommend them for any service. Lazy staff and unprofessional.\n\nQuick tip: For other 2010 Town and Country owners. I found out how to restart the car! Instead of waiting 45 min. for it to do it on its own. \n\nSLIGHTLY LIFT THE RED CABLE CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY! \n\nTurn the key and it restarts with no problem!\n\nNow to see how to fix the problem. \n\nHow do you manufacture a car and not know how to fix it?
