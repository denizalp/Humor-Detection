The Rat Pack - The Sinatra Booth - old Vegas charm so very much missed - and great food in a charming atmosphere, The Golden Steer has it all.  As they say don't judge a book by its cover well arriving at this non descript place from the 1950's on the corner of the strip a Sahara makes you long for Yesteryear when all of Las Vegas probably looked liked this.  Truly unremarkable as you drive up and enter then you are transported back to the days Frank, Sammy, Dean, and the boys swinging in for cocktails or sitting in one of the many red booths, or in our case our party of 12 is escorted to the back dining room where we have all the privacy in the world. \n\nWe sit and Joey our waiter begins the hey I'm not here to sell you anything extra I'm going to simply tell you what we are known for then let you make your own decision.  Those are words to live by unfortunately that's when Joey got rolling about the Shellfish platters, appetizers, etc and simply would NOT LET THE **** UP until I said listen we are all grown men, we know how to order a meal, please allow us to order whatever the hell we want in as many quantities as we want and shut the **** UP~! Again he interceded with the Have to have the Caesar salad mantra then you don't need 2 potatoes.. UGH if a guy wants to O.D. on starch allow him.  I almost replaced him but he finally got the point. \n\nThe Good: \nShrimp Cocktail, huge cold horseradish on side extra kick up tasty & Fresh 4 were enough for 2 persons $19.00\n\nEscargots de Bourgogne | 16 fresh with sauce just enough to accent them without being overpowered\n\nAlaskan King Crab Cocktail | 16 Hunks of crabmeat with same cocktail sauce that kicked up enough with butter made this a cant miss.\n\nCaesar Salad made table side $11.00 per person was good - not spectacular just good\n\nThe Great\nRib Eye Steak, Bone-in 22oz. | $54.00 4 of these were ordered to a man stated best steak they ever had.\n\nNew York Strip 16oz. | 50$  3 of these 2 absolutely perfect charred with temperature on the button flavor off the charts  1 was sent back overcooked then when returned it looked nuked then grilled quickly it as not consumed. \n\n3 Filet mignon Oscars with crabmeat were all outstanding - \n1 Market price $75.00 Australian lobster tail was simply OK a bit tough\n\nSides: \nAll excellent from the baked potatoes to the creamed spinach to the saut√©ed mushrooms, and twice baked potato they simply make each dish outstanding. \n\nThe Bad - the Steak being taken back and then returned unable to be consumed was a definite mark off.  Even had to tell them Take it off the bill at the end should have been done without asking.  Service was good after old Joey stopped selling me like a car salesman; it's not our 1st time dining out.  Private room for 12 of us was fantastic and rest of staff was A Plus. \nDefinitely on the repeat list when in Vegas!
