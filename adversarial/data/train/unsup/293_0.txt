I'm not a huge fan of theme parks in general, but it is nice having one close by. My sister, who has a four-year-old daughter, visited a few months ago, and we took my little niecelet to Carowinds. She enjoyed the Nickelodeon-themed rides, especially the Dora the Explorer train. (It's totally lame for grown-ups, but she had a good time. My sister and I rolled our eyes while she shouted, \"Estrellas!\" because Dora told her to find all the stars.)\n\nThe food was expensive and soggy, like amusement park is meant to be, and there are lots of places for kids to freak out because they want their parents to buy stuff...it was just what you'd expect for a theme park experience with a four-year-old in tow...kind of annoying, kind of cute, and certainly memorable.\n\nThe best part of the whole adventure for my sister and I was talking the niece into going on the log flume ride. She was nervous that it would go fast and that she might get wet, and we assured her that it would, indeed go fast and that she would, indeed get wet...but that we'd make sure she was safe in between the two of us. I sat in the front on our log, and my niece cuddled in between my sister and I. She liked the ride until we got the the freaky last hill with the steep, gut-wrenching drop. She got off crying and actually said, \"My mama scared the piss out of me!\" when she related the whole experience to her father on the phone. It was probably mean, but my sister and I laughed and laughed at her mortified little face. It was so funny, we couldn't even teach her not to curse. Good times with family fun. Hah!
