Friendly new ownership. Little disappointed it took close to 2.5 hours for a new set and a pedicure and I was the only person in. Price was a little high for my liking. 80 with tip for a full set and pedicure. Did a standard French tip acrylic set and French tip pedicure. My full set was uneven and grew out pretty gross. Sad as it was my go to close to the house. Have found a new place!
