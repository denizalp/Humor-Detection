I want to thank every Nurse, Doctor, social worker (phenomenal) and tech that assisted my mother that was rolled in from a nursing facility that nearly killed her! This medical team is above 5 STARS!!!!! What ever you may think about how bad a county hospital is, forget it! Everyone in this hospital was extremely nice, polite and there to help. If anything ever happens to me or my family, I will make it a point that we come to Maricopa Medical Center. THE BEST ER TEAM I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!!!!!!!\n\nThank you to all the dedicated professionals that helped my mother and is still with us!!!!!\n\nGP
