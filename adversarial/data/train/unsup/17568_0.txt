I stopped being a fan long ago. Long, ago.\n\nTheir new tagline -- propaganda, really -- is \"Fresher & Easyer.\" \n\nThey forgot the truth: Shittier. \n\nFresh & Easy, launched by the evil Tesco, somehow became demonstrably worse with its recent acquisition by someone that I would never bother looking up. I imagined that it was going to be WalMart that would take over for the essentially UK version of WalMart (Tesco) and be the parent company to destroy the chain. \n\nNope, there are plenty of disgusting corporations out there more than willing to completely change every good thing about a company.\n\nWeekly coupons = a relic of the past. \n\nContinued refusal of all manufacturer coupons continues as before though.\n\nThey have some USDA certified organic grocery items so I will not one-star them, although I should after making me go through the most unpleasant grocery shopping experience ever (Peanut butter recall; calling my integrity into question). Hopefully, whoever purchased this pitiful chain from Tesco fires the clown manager from this location. \n\nFresh & Easy. They have organic items -- but they may or may not be tainted to the point of causing death (P-butter) -- and, when you return their death-product, they will try to not furnish the credit as required by their own stupid \"voluntary\" recall. \n\nIt is a shame the U.S. Government is not competent enough to have a consumer protection agency that will shutter stores that behave like this. (They no longer carry certified organic peanut butter, by the way.) - E\n\nEdit dated 24 December 2013: \n**********************************\nPostscript. Apparently they do have USDA certified organic peanut butter again, after not carrying it for seemingly a year after their infamous recall. The significant other bought some and I love to live dangerously so I am bravely consuming it . Fool me once ....
