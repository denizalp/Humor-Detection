Absolutely love it! I am coming here officially. After a long day in clinic, I felt back pain and shoulder pain. One of the faculty members recommended I come here with her Tuesdays and Thursdays at 6:30pm. The class is about 90mins long. I brought my yoga mat, long towel, small face towel, and water. Each position felt soooo gooood. I could lie in each position foreverrrrr.  I especially enjoy it when time just flies! The class is about 90 mins, but felt like 30 mins. I'm a complete fan and will continue to come here! They have a special where its about $20 for unlimited two weeks. $50 per month and its about $10 per drop in session.
