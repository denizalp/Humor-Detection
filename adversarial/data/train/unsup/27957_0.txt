Decent food at best coffee was bland but if you want an 8$ mimosa served to you in a 105 degree room you're at the right spot. Asked the server said it's been an issue since it opened yet they haven't figured out summer in az gets hot. Skip for sure wait at butters or really anywhere else you'll thank me
