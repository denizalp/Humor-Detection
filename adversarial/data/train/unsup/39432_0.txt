I was at the hotel because of my husband's work. I spent some time at the pool and went for services. I can't tell you enough how much I loved the salon! I had my hair washed by Frank and it's not just a hair wash it's a scalp massage, and neck massage.  It's a beautiful room you don't even feel like you're in a salon.  Then came the haircut. I have curly hair and it is so hard to get a terrific cut. Sara Bryan cut my hair and who knew you needed to cut it dry and flat straight! Well it is perfect. Everyone was so nice I will definitely go back to that salon when I visit Vegas which I do often.
