I've raved about their delicious cookies before but then I tried their pastries: the Cream Puffs, New York Style Cheesecake, and I ordered a birthday cake for the 2nd time. This time I am truly disappointed. The pastries were awfully dry. I had the cream puffs before and they were good. However this time, my husband got it for me and two days later, they were hard as a rock! The New York Style Cheesecake tasted more on the whipped cream side. No cream cheese taste at all. Yes, they also have the Classic New York Style but the whipped cream overpowered everything. That is not cheesecake if it tasted like whipped cream. The birthday cake? It was a custom birthday cake for my 3 year old. I picked a butterfly and flower design with polka dots all over. There were two butterflies and one of them, the bottom wings looked uneven.  On top of that within 5 days, the cake was dry and hard. So with that being said, I'm going to take my love for cookies, cakes, and desserts somewhere else now..
