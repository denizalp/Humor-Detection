I've yet to find a Chinese restaurant that I like more than Sesame Inn. As others have said, the location is sort of weird (attached to a car dealership). But hey -- Adds to the character of the place. The interior is very nice and the staff is friendly.\n\nI almost always order the Amazing Chicken because... wait for it... it's AMAZING. It's all lean white meat chicken, breaded and magicked by some sorcerer. Then it's doused with a sweet sauce for extra amazingness. There is definitely more than enough for lunch the next day. The serving sizes are jumbo.\n\nThe sushi and maki rolls are really great too. The last time I ate here I ordered the sweet potato maki roll, which is a vegetarian roll made with fried sweet potato, avocado, and cream cheese. AND IT WAS SO GOOD. So so so so good. So. Good. \n\nThey also offer some Thai dishes. I've tried a couple and they are ok if you're in the mood for Thai, but I always go back to that Amazing Chicken. Yum!
