I went there one Sunday I was not impressed!! The senior Pastor said God told him to buy a\nmotorcycle!! Come on now that is ridiculous. Also it seemed like he was mostly just talking about his experiences I thought the point was to preach about the word of God. Also it seems\nlike money was brought up a lot. I guess that is why it is hard for me to find a church because all they do is preach about is prosperity$$. Also there was kids riding there skateboards around in the church. All I'm saying is I wouldn't go to church there.
