The line moves quick and the chicken is delicious, perfect, moist, magique. The hot sauce is important. The pieces of meat are quickly cleavered for you as they are taken off the grill when you order so watchout for little bits of bone.  Order in advance to skip the big line and walk right up to the counter on the left hand side. Natas are one of my favourite foods ever so I always grab some of those as well. The staff are funny and at least trilingual, the Portuguese patter keeps the place running and I love seeing the patient smile when the old folks come in.
