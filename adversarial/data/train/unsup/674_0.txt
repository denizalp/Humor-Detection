I don't know what to say .....(so confused) so my TV was working fine this morning as of this afternoon it has no picture but it has sound I called this guy to see if he could come out to look at my TV he told me to hold a flashlight to the TV and if I don't see a picture then the TV is bad and I need to get it replaced.....wtf????? Lol the phone call was a waste of my life I mean he was absolutely no help at all I mean completely worthless I don't even know what to say I don't want to give this guy 5 stars and I don't want to give them no stars because it was just really ridiculous what just happened...lol with that being said Can anyone suggest a good TV repair person my TV is not bad there's absolutely nothing wrong with it my gut is telling me that the lamp needs to be replaced and that's it this guy had kids crying in the background sound like he was washing dishes so obviously he didn't have time 2 tend to his business
