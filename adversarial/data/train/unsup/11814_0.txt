Were it not for Sambalatte and Panera I'd probably never visit Boca even though it is within walking distance of my house but be that as it may I really cannot ignore the convenience.  Truly yuppie in the worst of ways with the sort of stores selling machine-stitched overpriced women's clothes and things that no one really needs I can only hope that the new developments occuring at Summerlin Town Center will mitigate my needs to deal with the six traffic lights between here and home but until that time comes I'll begrudging continue to visit as necessary - an occurence far more frequent than I'd care to admit given my obvious addiction to the coffee bean.
