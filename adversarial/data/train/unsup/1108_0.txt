Cedarbrae Public Library has been serving the local community since November 1966.\n\nOf course there had been numerous expansions and renovations over the years... and Cedarbrae library I had to say it the best library I been to in the Toronto area. \n\nWhy 5 Star?! A library that good?!\n\n- Exterior architecturally pleasing to look at\n- Interior Modern and chic like a boutique hotel lobby\n- Tons of windows with natural sunlight\n- Airy and Spacious interior\n- Comfortable chairs to chill or to take a nap\n- Electric outlets!! Even have that incorporate into the coffee tables\n- Great collections of all ethnic books\n- Free WIFI\n\nEven a TV showing CP24 in the casual reading area!!\n\nI wish all libraries are like that..........................
