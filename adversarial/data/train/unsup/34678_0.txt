Okay, I've had my share of fried chicken. This place knows its chicken and knows it well. I don't know how they make their fried chicken but guys, this is one of the best fried chicken I've ever had. Not dry, not too oily, and not too $$$. It's tender and juicy, even for the breast piece. I practically licked the bones after each piece. It helps the drinks are also yummy and the staff are friendly and responsive. Thank you for a great dinner yardbird!
