While shopping at The Forum Shops at Caesars Palace we grew hungry and browsed around for decent eateries. Happened to stop at Spago and were surprised to see such affordable lunch options. $15 or so for a Short Rib Sandwich which came with fries, What?!! Wouldn't that cost $30 at their L.A. location?!! Portion size was so generous as well, and the sandwich felt more like a Philly Cheese Steak but better! The Short Rib was melt in your mouth good, and that house made steak sauce they served was like gourmet crack! Felt like a cross between sweet and tangy bbq sauce and A1. Definitely one of the better dining options in the area.
