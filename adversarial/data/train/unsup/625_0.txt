Only reason why we went here was because we walked the strip and realized it was best to eat before getting ready for the club but we didn't have time to wait in line anywhere else. So harrahs it was, food is ok here. Not much of a selection and for some reason just taste more dry compared to other buffets. Gave it 3 stars because the service was good there. Very attentive to our needs which was nice. The best thing here was probably their dessert bar, it looked good and clean!
