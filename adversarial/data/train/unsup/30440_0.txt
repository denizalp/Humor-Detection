So you enjoy authentic wood fired pizza and a small mom and pop shop? You like an authentic restaurant experience in the midst of the upscale Snotsdale eateries? The tables and chair are mismatched, the decor is in need of a  few repairs, the service is not even two stars but its Italian, it has soul, it has wine and it has pie.  The tiramisu put the icing on the experience, just right.  Give it a chance on date night, casual, imperfect and just what you need after a hundred Sam Fox restaurant concept evenings.
