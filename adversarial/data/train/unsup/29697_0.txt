No more Dennys, but the Station Casino group has modernized the old cafe.  \n\nThe food is still Station Casino stuff, but the interior upgrades gave it a like more pizzazz, and the number of flat screen throughout the cafe won't let you miss a beat if you're watching ESPN.\n\nStation has cutback on the wait help, but lucky for them, there a was great Cuban waitress who was serving eight different table, and was even busing them too.   I was very surprised because she was on top of of each customer, and none of the tables had no noticeable problems with her service.    Because of this waitress, I'm adding a star to this review.
