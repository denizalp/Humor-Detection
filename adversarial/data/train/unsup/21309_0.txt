This was our second time seeing this show. The last time was 2 and a half years ago. Its still a great show and would recommend seeing it if you never have before. But not a 2nd time because they really haven't changed much. I have been to many drag shows and they always change things up if its an ongoing show. But not this one. \nI loved Pink. She was so believable. They are all pretty good but we didnt see Pink the first time. \nOne more thing... I wish Celine would stop wearing Cher make up. Come on. You have time to change your make up a little bit between numbers.
