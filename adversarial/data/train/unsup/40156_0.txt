Salvatore's is not in our neighborhood but they were in the Madison City Tin, so we tried it.  I'm glad we did.  We built our own pie, which was the best we've had in Madison, but all the specialty pizzas we noticed around us (and here on Yelp) will keep us coming back to try something new.  Because it is a small restaurant, expect to wait but they are happy to text when your table is ready.
