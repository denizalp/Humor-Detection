I think I might've found my new favorite restaurant! Every dish I ordered was better than the last. While their tea selection was not as big as I would have assumed, they had my favorite tea, jasmine green so I was pleased. The first thing I ordered, which was also my favorite, was the teriyaki shishito peppers. Shishito peppers are one of my favorite things to eat, and the peppers at Sasa were perfectly, simply cooked. I would eat them every day. The other star of the meal was the mushroom udon noodle soup. The broth was wonderfully developed, and chili flakes gave it even more depth. We also ordered \"the rock,\" which is thin slices of marinated beef that you cook at the table. The marinade was so flavorful, and at $15 it was a dish we couldn't pass up. We also indulged in the fries and the pork belly skewers. To complete the meal, I had their homemade green tea ice cream, which was fantastic. All in all, I'll definitely be back soon. A must try!
