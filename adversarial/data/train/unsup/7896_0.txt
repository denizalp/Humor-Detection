I love that they have the ordering stations here so that you don't have to deal with a person. It has to be a major labor saver for McDonald's. Except today, I needed to use cash in order to break a $20. I think that because I walked in and went to the kiosk first, they didn't notice for a minute or three that I had returned to the register to place my order.\n\nThe condiments and soda station needed some tidying. The lid dispenser was stuck open and there were some straw wrappers. One unoccupied table still had some trash on it and another needed wiping down.\n\nThe rest of the restaurant was clean, including the parking lot.
