This review is long overdue but I just have to say that the customer service at this Hyundai dealership is some of the best I've ever experienced. I bought a used car here last year and after shopping around at different dealerships, I felt that they didn't pressure me and were very honest and straight forward. Even after buying the car, they checked in to see how it was doing and made my service very personalized. I've gotten the car serviced here a few times since then and each time they have been transparent in their prices and what services need to be done. Again no pressuring me into getting unneeded services. Just this morning I had to get a service and didn't have an appointment. I mentioned that I needed to be somewhere in the afternoon and even though they had a full schedule they fit me in. They finished fixing up my car in just a few hours! Super friendly people and I'm always confident I'm getting reliable information. They have definitely won me over as a customer.
