I hate malls! I wasn't a mallrat when I was a kid. I tend to avoid malls as much as possible Unfortunately, in a twist of fate, I was \"blessed\" with two girls who are about to hit mallrat stage. Oh bliss!\n\nAnd this visit was 100% their fault. We hit all the \"cool\" stores like P.S. by Aeropostale, The Children's Place, Build-A-Bear, The Rack Room... I'm feeling nauseous...\n\nMeh, it's a mall. Of all the malls in Charlotte this is the only one I'd ever really set foot in. It's very mall-like. It's not a narcissistic hellhole like Southpark, it's as generic as Northlake, it's not its own city like Concord Mills, it's not the arsehole of the world like Freedom (is that one still even there?). It's a mall.
