Dear Colonel: a love letter\n\nDear Colonel,\n\nYou are charming and moody, with skillful drink-slinging prowess and attentive barstaff. I vote myself least likely to be out on a Monday night, but you were the perfect companion for starting the week off right. Here, the bartender will never \"run out of mint\", and the mojitos flow plentiful. The cocktails are amazing, as are the most lounge-y of low benches and tables, the lighting, and the washrooms that are authentically dive bar yet spotlessly clean. Throw in a chatty old man NPC and it felt like the perfect local watering hole to share only with those you enjoy. \n\nSe√±or, could this be amor? It's not your eyes, it's the mojitos.
