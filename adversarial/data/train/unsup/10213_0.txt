2 1\/2 years ago I hired California Pools to resurface my pool, put in a new pool pump & filter, redo my concrete decking around my pool, and some landscaping.\n\nI had $25k in my budget to do all of this & was very clear how much I could afford. The designer came up with a gorgeous design & we couldn't believe his CAD work.... of course things were too good to be true. Rather than staying in our budget, he designed something that was $20k over our budget & then told us how we could do additional financing through CA Pools. I was a little irked at the attempted sales pitch, literally doubling the cost of our project. That was issue #1. \n\nNext, when they hauled the old rock out of our yard it was discovered we had WAY more rock than what anyone realized so the amount of rock we purchased was not enough. Simple solution would have been to buy a few more tons to fill in the hole in the yard. But they wouldn't let me do this. They said that the city of Tempe requires yards to hold drainage or go to the front street, but not the alley. In order to do this properly they would need to cost out grading my yard so it slopes towards the house and front gates, rebuild the block walls so there were holes in the bottom for draining, and then they could add more rock. What they failed to realize is that my yard prior was already self containing for draining because of the pit, adding more rock would continue to allow it to be self containing but would eliminate the gaping hole in my yard. When we pointed this out we were told we were wrong. \n\nIssue #3, verbally with my designer we discussed putting a pony wall around the pump system to help hide it. I was told that would be done. When my yard & pool was done & I had no pony wall I was told I should have read my contract to correct their mistake & if I wanted a pony wall it would be several hundred more dollars. \n\nNow to bring it to date..... \n\nIssue #4 my pebble tec is chipping\nIssue #5 my pump system leans to one side because they didn't level & pound out the dirt prior to pouring a concrete slab\nIssue #6 my deck is so hot during the summer that it requires shoes. When I contracted with the company I was told my pool deck would be significantly cooler than the existing one that was probably put in back in 1980 & that their product was far superior. \n\nWhen I contacted CA Pools about issues 4-6, I was met with combative attitude from someone who had not even visually seen my problem. I was promised a follow up call & didn't get one. At which point I contacted the owners of the company. One of them wrote me back and was very kind, offering to have someone come out and take a look. He also told me about the history of \"kool decking\" and how the old stuff had asbestos in it which is not used anymore. A guy by the name of Todd came to see me. Upon arrival he wanted to discuss my pool chemicals, which I was a bit confused about since he wasn't there for that purpose. He also mentioned something to the tune of, \"When we installed your pool...\" and I had to correct him that this wasn't a new pool, simply a resurfaced pool. I explained I've been taking care of my pool for 8 years and am in the process of getting it balanced & ready for summer. When I tried to redirect him back to my actual concerns he continued to talk about chemicals & started opening my pool pump, telling me how I needed to lube the O ring, etc., again I tell him I know, and I'm in the process of getting everything ready for summer. I ask again about my concerns & he tells me the leaning of the pump is not detrimental to the functionality of it, that the deck I have is what was in my contract, and that I'll get a call in September to schedule a chip repair. He also said there's really nothing better out there. Since then I've spoken to two contractors who say there are absolutely better products out there and a simple trip to any newly designed community pool would show me that I should be able to stand on my pool decking. \n\nTo top it all off, I don't know what Todd did when he started screwing with my pump but I know he changed some settings. After that nothing has been working correctly. I finally had to call another company I frequent and ask for help. The guy who came out confirmed that whatever was done was completely wrong & no wonder I had problems, even he had difficult resetting everything back to good. \n\nI guess you have to spend a lot more at CA Pools to be a customer that is valued. While my $25k may not have been a lot to them, it was to me & to receive such crappy service speaks volumes. \n\nCA POOLS - Please spare me any follow up comment you may provide. I've read your other comments to dissatisfied customers and found them to be rude. All you do is justify why someone had a bad experience & take zero responsibility.
