All the bartenders make my day! Courteous and attentive! The bar maybe crazy busy but they always bust their tails waiting on people and recognize your face and know regulars names and drinks. And the food is bomb! Tacos and beer... can't go wrong! After a hard night at work it is great to come in on Friday morning and see smiling faces! It's like an old cheers bar! Wins some cash on four card Keno too! Seeing Amanda behind the bar when I walk in is awesome! Her charismatic smile and cheery attitude towards me, my friends, and other patrons is so nice. It's never a rush or worry or a bother, everything just falls into place with her and chills. I love it! Easy to talk to and great listener. Every one there has their own special quirk that makes Wahoos what it is.
