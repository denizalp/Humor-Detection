You know, bowling alleys are pretty gnarly regardless of the location, but I was SHOCKED at how amazingly clean and, dare I say, classy this joint is (for a bowling alley, natch). Even the bathroom's were sparkly and lacked that tell-tale urine smell that I am seriously over-assaulted with (I think 5% of my reviews have some sort of urine association. It's on attack). \n\nI particularly enjoy watching a grown man say on his walkie-talkie \"Yeah, we have a ball problem that needs addressing, over.\"\n\nYes, yes we do have a ball problem.
