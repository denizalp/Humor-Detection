This review is for communication and an unauthorized estimate at my house with this company.  I never had a chance to try their services and never will based on my initial experience.  \n\nI requested a quote from Green ServPro for some of their services.  After playing phone tag during the morning they sent an email around noon saying that they would be stopping by to conduct a quote over the \"next couple days\". My response to their email was \"Please do not come by until you talk to me first.\" \n\nThirty minutes after I sent my email, I get a call from my completely surprised and not very happy wife saying someone is in the back yard.  I had her go find out who it was and it's this company.\n\nZero consideration for the homeowner.  I'm still trying to understand how filling out a request for an estimate automatically grants this company the right to come to my house, go through my gate, and enter my backyard without at least a courtesy call asking for permission or even to ask if we have dogs before they invaded our privacy.  They had both my email and phone number in order to contact me.\n\nWhen I called to complain about the situation, the response given was that we pay for those leads so we get them done as fast as possible.  While I respect that, I can't respect that this company was more concerned with the fact they paid for the lead than the homeowners consideration to be called first and, in general, their privacy.  If they can't follow those simple instructions I can't trust them to do the work either.
