At first the older lady who works here is kindaaaaa rude lol whatevs\n\nI ended up getting the cutest watersnake flats and booties along with 2 nail colors here the other night. \n\nThe Loubis I was wearing into the store have spikes on the border and some of them fell off so she was kind enough to walk in the back and see if there was any extra studs. \n\nI still prefer to buy Loubis at Neimans no matter what city I'm in... :)
