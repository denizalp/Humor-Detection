Being from Chicago, heading to a desert, I never thought I would get good seafood without being on the coast.  This place definitely was great!  I went a little nuts and for me and my friend and her daughter, we ordered everything that was fried.  yes everything, the guy at the register was like, this and this and this.... ? I was like yes please.  So he rang it up with shock on his face.  With our 10% off coupon it was only 54.39 and we had enough for lunch tomorrow, so breaking it down, including tax and adding in no discount, and the fact that we shared a bit of our food with some other people when we went home, and ordering no drinks cept the kids drink, it breaks down to about 10 dollars a person. My friend's daughter is a very picky eater and she ended up eating a bunch of the fish over the chicken finger.\n\nHere's the breakdown\nChicken Fingers- whole piece of chicken, a bit dense - a bit confused, it's not multiple, it's 1 big slab... comes with fries and kids drink\nUltimate Combo - Oyster, Clams, Fries, Chicken, cole slaw, and cod - yummy oyster!\nCatfish - so good the lil girl ate most of it herself\nHaddock - a denser fish, fishier than others\nMahi Mahi - nice solid piece, yum\nTilapia - typical fish, nice and flakey\nSalmon - 2 pieces (more expensive than other fish, great salmon taste)\nClamari - in sticks like mozerrella sticks, among my favorite!\nSoft Shell Crab - my favorite!  \nBread Bowl Clam Chowder - this thing is a meal in itself!\n\nThey were actually fairly fast on a Friday night when it was packed and we sat outside on a cold day near the heaters so it wasnt bad at all.  VERY nice wait staff!  They remembered everything they served!
