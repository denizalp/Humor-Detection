Very entertaining show! You have your moments where you think to yourself \"they aren't really going to do that, are they???\"\n\nBased on a recommendation, my friend and I decided to see Le Reve instead of \"O.\" (Still hoping to see \"O\" the next time I'm in Vegas). \n\nLe Reve has your typical acrobatic stunts but instead of performing on a dry stage full, stunts are performed in the\/with water. Plenty of synchronized swimming, which I am not much of a fan of, so I thought those parts of the performance lost my interest. The diving and flipping in the air from ridiculous heights made the show very entertaining and showed off each individuals acrobatic skills. The story is a bit confusing, and was almost like a 'Alice in Wonderland' type adventure. \n\nNext stop, \"O.\"\n\nBTW there are concession stands by the front lobby, but there isn't much to choose from. =T
