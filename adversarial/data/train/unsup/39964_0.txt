I have never had such awful customer service in a salon! If I could give a worse rating, I would. Jessica is apparently the owner, and for as long as she claims she has been in business, she does not know what she is doing! I came in with medium brown hair and golden highlights. I wanted her to cover the highlights and make it medium brown all over. I explained that my regular stylist adds a blue base to eliminate red tones and that I didn't want any ash added to my hair. When she was finished, my hair was green! Although it was not acceptable, it is an easy fix to remove the green. She did not know how to fix it. She added toner twice and then put a color stripper on my hair. It was still green and my hair was fried. Upon applying the last treatment, her man arrived telling her it was time to leave. She said go home and if you still see green, come back tomorrow. It was obviously still green! Then she tried to charge me $150! I hope no one trusts this woman! Shame on you Jessica!
