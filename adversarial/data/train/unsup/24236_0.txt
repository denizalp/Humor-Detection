Uh, yeah. If you don't love love love Barriques, you should probably find another city to live in because loving Barriques is what living in Madison is all about. \n\nWhy?\n\nBecause students. Your stack of books on Plato makes me feel great about being a yuppie who did once have but no longer has to have a stack of books about Plato.\n\nBecause free internet and yummy lattes. Snowman shaped foam decorations.\n\nBecause people watching - what leggings are in style? Oh galaxy? Okay.\n\nBecause wine of the month club. Okay, I'll take a short walk to my wine of the month and take you home tonight.\n\nBecause adorable baristas and baristos. \n\nBecause proximity to concert on the square.\n\nBecause reasons.\n\nLove it.
