Consistently delicious. Very fast and friendly service. Definitely our go-to place for comfort food. Great shaded outdoor seating too! We've been going here for years. My husband always get the Rio Bravo burrito and inhales the entire huge thing. I either get the fajitas or the chicken chimichangas (no red sauce, extra guacamole) which are both incredible but I've tried many other things and haven't been disappointed. Love their house & flavored margaritas too! My favorite is their salsa and their guac. THE BEST!!
