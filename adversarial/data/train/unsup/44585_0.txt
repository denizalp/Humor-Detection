I REALLY wanted to give 5 stars. Hotel staff is amazing, location is amazing, valet is amazing, and it's very clean. But the bed was hard as a rock with a sunken in spot in the middle, so I didn't really get much sleep :( I really want to book another stay when I'm back in November but can't see paying over 300 bucks!
