To find BBD, just head north on Valle Verde exit after leaving the 215 east. You will see it on the right side of the road just past Subway, but before CVS.\n\nBeen reading all the glowing reviews about this place and finally got to check it out recently.\n\nEhh, it was alright. Alright. I think some of you all just need to calm down a little bit, though.\n\n- Pho Dip Sandwich: Meat taste and portion was on point, but the pho broth was \"tremendous\" (say that in Donald Trumps voice). Very unique and tasty sandwich!\n- Chicken Salad Sandwich was delicious! Chicken itself tasted fantastic! My only complaint is that it is a very sloppy sandwich and things are constantly falling off, making it difficult to enjoy it as a sandwich. You end up constantly just picking pieces off of your plate and eating it. Still though, very very good.\n- I did NOT enjoy that Jones Cane Sugar Soda at all. Just tasted funky to me. On top of that, they charge somewhere in the neighborhood of $3.50 per drink! Yikes! They should have at least one of the major brands available for fountain drinks.\n- These 2 sandwiches and 2 sodas set us back $28 before tip. Wayyyy too much for what you get. The food was good, but not $28 good. Sorry, not sorry.\n- Service was good, though. The young lady working at the counter was very friendly and answered questions regarding menu items since it was our first visit.\n\nSo, to summarize..\n\n- food, good\n- drinks, bad\n- service, good\n- price\/value, no bueno\n\nI enjoyed the food quite a bit, but not likely to return at this price point. I can't give it a 2, just based on the fact that the food is just so yummy. So, for me, i will have to say...\n\n3 stars.\n\nA-OK.
