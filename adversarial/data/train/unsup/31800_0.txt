I just received an email from this salon and it reminded me of how disappointed I was with my service. Although this post is months after the service rendered, the experience is fresh in my mind. Like the other customers, I too was left waiting in an awkward, empty, unpaved parking lot for half an hour after my appointment time. \n\nThe person who I was scheduled to see that day resigned or got fired days prior to my visit in which I found out via email. That was the first sign. Then this woman didn't even apologize for how late she was. Instead she pulled up, took her time parking and gathering her things out of her car before greeting me. She seemed irritated by my presence. The hairdresser then goes on to explain how frustrated she was because she had to take a relative to the airport, instead of offering an apology for keeping a brand new client waiting. I was beyond annoyed. The finished product wasn't anywhere what I was expecting and I was even a bit embarrassed at how my hair turned out. The cherry on top was when she instructed me on how to leave a tip on her tablet after paying her which I almost didn't do. To sum it up, this was the most unprofessional hairstylist I've ever crossed paths with. Wouldn't recommend her or this salon to anyone for anything.
