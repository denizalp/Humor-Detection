After reading other reviews, I'm starting to think the mistakes made during the show were intentional... That, or the performers are just not that into it. The latter was the vibe I got. But then again, who am I to talk? I can't even do a cartwheel!\n\nI may have shot myself in the foot by having seen \"KA\" the night before I saw \"Zarkana.\" For some reason, I had anticipated \"Zarkana\" as being the better show because the advertisements all feature a gothy spider woman ( Yes, I bought the headpiece from the gift shop!) Sadly, the Spider woman was not even an integral part of the show!\n\nI am a person who is EASILY amused, and I had to keep myself from falling asleep during some parts of the show. There were some redeeming qualities of the show, when I wasn't scared at the fact the unbalanced acrobats would hurt themselves! Their technique wasn't clean at all, and I know this because I watch a lot of Dance Moms (I'm kidding.) If it weren't for the nets\/mats, some of the performers would have certainly been killed that night- and that HORRIFIES me!!!\n\nThere wasn't anything too fantastical about Zarkana, and I would be sorely upset if I had to pay full price for my ticket (which I didn't!) Again, I may be entirely biased because like I mentioned before, I had seen KA the night before, which I definitely recommend!\n\nThis show is on its way out, I think. I'm sorry, Zarkana, I really wanted to fall in love with you!!! Maybe my expectations were too high? I would suggest adding a storyline in order to keep Zarkana interesting to the viewers.
