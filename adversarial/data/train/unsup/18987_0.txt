As soon as we found this place, it was a MUST GO TO everyday in Las Vegas!\nThe Kouig Amann is our latest absolute favorite....To me, it's a cross between the palm leaf from St. Germain and a croissant....nice and flaky with a crispy sweet \"crust\"....and oooh so buttery.  If you've never had one, it's a must!  My daughter loves the TKO....I think it stands for Thomas Kellar Oreo..dark chocolate wafers with white chocolate ganache.  Love the chocolate and the chocolate almond croissants too.....coffee was good and the service, oh so friendly.  \nPS  if you're going for a Kouig Amann, I think you gotta get there before 10am....or they will be sold out!....I rushed there each morning and bought whatever they had..so, now that I'm writing this review, I hope I can still get some at 10am!
