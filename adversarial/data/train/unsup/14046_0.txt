I love poutines! Obsessed and to have a store dedicated to them, works for me:) \n\nThey place is not only great for carnivores but vegetarians too. The aroma of the place gets you even more hungry for your order haha. \n\nTons of diff styles of poutine, a good few for vegetarians too and they usually add any extra topping if you want. I ordered the Nacho one. It was so good! It had salsa, sour cream, guacamole, jalepenos and a mushroom based gravy. \n\nThe boxes come in 2 sizes, I believe the smaller one is $7\/8 and the larger one is $11-12. The smaller box is filling enough, unless your sharing or really starved, then opt for the larger box.
