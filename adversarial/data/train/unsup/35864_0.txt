This is incredible I just ordered crab puffs and big wac + thyme fries and scottsdale blonde. I cannot believe this is actually a vegan restaurant. There should be one of these in every major city. It is very chill, no blaring music, calm environment. I will be back again & have already recommended this to friends. Get off your device and come, I promise it's worth it.
