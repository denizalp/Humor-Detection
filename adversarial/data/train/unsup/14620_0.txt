The cutest little crepe shop just opened by my work! Aiming to bring the most authentic French crepes to Summerlin, the modern-rustic interior has major Pottery Barn vibes, with nautical blue and white Brittany flags everywhere- that's where owners Catherine and Jean-Jacques and their recipes hail from!\n\nOpen for breakfast, lunch, and weekend brunch and dinners, the menu has a good mix of buckwheat galettes (savory crepes), dessert crepes, and a few French classics thrown in for good measure (quiche, croques madame and monsieur, coffees, and baked goods). They have combos that course galettes, crepes, and beverages or desserts, and prices are fair.\n\nTried the swiss and cream mushroom galette on my first visit, at Catherine's recommendation, and really enjoyed it. Amount of filling was just right, the mushrooms were plentiful and tasty, and the small side salad was a nice accent. Looking forward to inviting in a group for a brunch event to try La Bretonne (Brie, onions, potato, sausage) and La West Coast (Swiss, salmon, cream leeks).
