My hubby took on the Mother's day special steak and mashed potatoes with grilled vegies and a choice of meatball soup or salad. I had the mother's day special salmon with spicy black bean sauce and white rice, also comes with a choice of soup or salad. The specials run for $18 bucks each. \nLove the 70's ambience! \nLove my waitress Misty! A very loquacious yet informative happy young lady who caters to your every need. \nYou've gained a loyal customer out of this family!
