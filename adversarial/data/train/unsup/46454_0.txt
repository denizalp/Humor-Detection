Alan was incredibly dedicated to helping us find our house. Initially we didn't even intend on buying a home, we just wanted to rent. But that didn't matter. Alan was still just as dedicated to helping us find a home that we were excited about. He was knowledgeable in all aspects of the process, and if there was something he was unsure of, he made sure to find the answers. Alan made himself available to us day and night. We would recommend him time and time again and have.
