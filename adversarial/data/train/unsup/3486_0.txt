Great NORTH Indian food, not to be confused with crappy South Indian food. This place has been through a couple of location changes since it first opened in Phoenix in 1985 at 44th St. and Camelback just down from Cork & Cleaver. Its current home in the Scottsdale Civic Center is easy to get to with lots of parking in the adjacent garage. The d√©cor is the nicest I have seen at any Indian place in town and the owners are usually there and make sure the food is consistent and good. They have a wide range of both meat and vegetable dishes and the \"Jewel Dinner\" at only $25 per head is a great way to go for both experts and novices. It includes a rack of grilled meats and fish as an appetizer, a sampling of four or five dishes and even dessert! Also, be sure to try the stuffed breads or \"naans\" they can be had with potatoes, lamb, chicken, etc, and are phenomenal.
