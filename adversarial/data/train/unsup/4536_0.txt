Well, I did it again.  I made the mistake of taking my husband with me to Tempe on his empty stomach.  After our errand, there was the elephant in the car.  His blood was boiling, he tried to deny it, but you could cut the tension with a knife.  He was hungry.  And although I'm not a huge fan of Thai food, Thai Elephant was right there.  \n\nThe restaurant was clean, staff was friendly, and the food was quick and tasty.  I tried the Elephant Garlic with chicken.  All the veggies were super fresh and still crisp, and the chicken had no suspicious looking or \"discard\" pieces in it, as Ryan C likes to say.\n\nAlthough I'm not a connoisseur of Thai food, it more than adequately met my criteria to make me a fan!
