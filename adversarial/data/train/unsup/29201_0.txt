I've been going to Elegant Nails for a few years and I love my nails every time I go! Lisa and Eric both do my nails and are personable and accommodating every trip there. They quickly greet every customer that walks through the door or calls on the phone. They always remember to ask about something in my personal life. I appreciate great quality service and genuine people, which is why I continue to go every two weeks to Elegant Nails!
