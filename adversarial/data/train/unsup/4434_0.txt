If you are looking for a true 5 star dining experience then this is your place. From the moment we pulled up until the valet brought our car back we received excellent service. We had a table upstairs by the windows. I felt a bit like a tourist taking my phone out and taking pictures of the view but I didn't want the beauty of it to go unnoticed. \nWe started dinner with a Charcuterie board. It was so tasty and amazing that we could have just had that and been pleased. The meats and cheeses went wonderfully together. The honey brought a touch of sweetness that was perfect. We loved the tiny round red peppers that brought the heat. \nFor my entree I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass. It came beautifully cooked and the presentation was spot on. The Sea Bass had a crispy side which was face up. It was golden brown. The fish was juicy and flaky.  It was a nice sized portion. It tested on mashed purple potatoes and green beans. I left no food behind. \nFor dessert we ordered carrot cake. It wasn't your typical carrot cake. It was an elevated dessert. The presentation was beautiful and it was a perfect ending to a perfect meal. \nOur check arrived with 2 small black bags. Each one had a truffle inside. I was incredibly full so I saved them for the next day. Oh my we're they tasty. The milk chocolate melted in your mouth. \nI love this restaurant and I can't wait to go back and take friends. FYI-they have a small party room. The night we were there a surprise party was being held in the room. It would be great for a small wedding or baby shower, graduation party, rehearsal dinner, or any small gathering.
