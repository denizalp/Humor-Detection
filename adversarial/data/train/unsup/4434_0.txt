First thought, very much like chipotle just with night end meats, flavors and super fresh vegetables. \n\nFire grilled chicken salad with the habanero salsa topped with guac, sour cream and house dressing! Delicious and fresh! Did I say it tastes fresh? It really did.\n\nGlad I finally checked out this place out!
