These guys are by far the best! \n\nFrom start to finish, they were spot on. From the first phone call, to Mike coming out to do an estimate... even the owner, Christopher, came out before the moving day to have some extra pallets dropped off for us - no charge!\n\nWe needed to have our commercial gym equipment moved, and after going through multiple other moving companies, we found Christopher. They were professional, clean, careful, and FAST...they packed up, moved, and unloaded the entire facility in 5 hours! They had all of the necessary equipment, and did not whine or lollygag at all. I know it may sound ridiculous, but it was great to see all of their employees wearing the same uniform shirt; they were also all very courteous. \n\nIf I could give them 10 stars, I would!\n\nThank you, Christopher Moving!!
