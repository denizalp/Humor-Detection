I recently booked a 50 min hydrafacial for myself as well as my boyfriend. This was his first facial and he loved it! The staff was amazing and gave us a tour around. Then we waited in the coed jacuzzi until it was time for our treatments. During the extraction part of his hydrafacial he actually fell asleep he was so relaxed. A day later and my skin looks better than ever. They even recommended products specifically picked for my skin. The sweet receptionist walked me through every product I was recommended and explained why it would help me and eventually sold me on multiple items. If you are recommended products you get 10% off! We are both very pleased overall with our visit and are hooked on hydrafacials for life! Thanks GVR spa!
