Burgers are juicey - however the price is a little on the higher side. Monday's they have a 2 for one burger (does not include side or drink though)...however even with that deal it was $17.  Extra toppings are more $$'s cheese, bacon - and even tzatziki sauce is extra (come on already with the extra's a bit much).\n\nNot really a busy place - but steady.\n\nPricepoint is a bit high - the burger is juice but a bit bland for my liking - so toppings are a must.  Pretty good burger though - homemade and not a cookie cut burger.  Bun is a white boy boring bun though and toppings are run of the mill and tzatsiki cost you if you want anything extra on the bun that is outside of the usual lettuce, tomato and uncooked raw onions etc.\n\nFries are quite good  - drinks are your boring sugar filled pop from a fountain.  Other people's pictures are a good reflection of the burger - the bun is bland - burger is juicey - good quality meat but a bit on the bland side tastewise.
