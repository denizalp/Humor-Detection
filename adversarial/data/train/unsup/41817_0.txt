The whole family really loves this place because it has that family feel (according to my 13 year old). You have the ability to have them set aside your order each week. They have a great selection of comic (new and old), graphic novels, toys, games, merchandise (especially Doctor Who) - and oh yeah - great coffee drinks and beverages. The main reason we started going in the first place is because every Tuesday night they have a special event called \"Doctor Who Nights\" where they show both old classic episodes and new episodes of Doctor Who. They also have plenty of other family-friendly events during the week and on weekends including yo-yo artists and other fun things.   There are also reserved evenings were they have game playing events.  We were even there once when Starbucks employees came in and ordered Chai tea and claimed it was better than the ones they served!
