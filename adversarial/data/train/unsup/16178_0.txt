Nice addition to the local restaurants.  The room is large and has black walls and ceiling with a long bar along the one wall.  It was busy.  The room is dark after sunset and many were using their phone flashlight to read the menu.  \nThe wine list is really nice.  Some interesting selections both by the bottle and glass.  If you need assistance, someone can help you select.   \nWe started with Grilled Whole Prawns with a beet root cocktail sauce.   The prawns were very good and the beet root sauce was oh so good.  For an entree I had the Smoked duck that was perfectly cooked.  The duck come with figs and haricots verts that were a great accompaniment.\nWhile service was pretty good, a little shaky at times.  Probably due to the recent opening and learning.  We were never offered any desert menu or desert option.
