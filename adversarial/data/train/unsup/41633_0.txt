A friend refered me to this little gem of a food emporium which recently opened in the very trendy neighbourhood of Yonge and Eglinton.  What a delight.  Tucked away just east of Yonge it is a hard to spot to find, but once you find it I doubt you will want to shop anywhere else.\n\nThe store is clean, bright and has one of the largest selections of organic and healthy choices for today's shopper.  All my favourite products were there as well as some items never seen before.  Items like gourmet pasta, prepared soups and a lovely selection of fine teas.  The only item I didn't see was kefir which staff assured me they would order.  Speaking of staff , employees and management are visible and helpful which is a real plus.  Prices are comparable or better to Carrot Common or Tutti Frutti in Kensington and the selection is far better.  \n\nBut the real surprise was the prepared food!  You can choose from a wide array of foods to take home like sheppards pie ( best I've ever tasted! ), lamb shank, and a wonderful home made  pizza that they make in their wood burning ovens.  Did I mention they have a capuccino maker so you can enjoy a coffee while you shop?  Perfect place to stop for some food on your way home from work. \n\nBut don't  shortchange yourself and only stop in for the dinner - this place is your one stop food place.  It's a farmers market,  a gourmet food store and bistro all in one!
