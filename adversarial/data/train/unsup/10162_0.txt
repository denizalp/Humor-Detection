It's been 2 months since my first visit and I've been back through the \"d'liteful\" drive-thru a handful of times since... love that.\n\nI'm also making good on my promise to report back on the wifi and inside since I checked that out also... five stars for the inside seating, wifi, and customer service as well!  \n\nEvery employee I've interacted with at DHOTG is super friendly and genuine.  They custom my order without complaint and get it right every time.  \n\nInside, there's plenty of comfortable seating and the place is clean!  Bathrooms are clean too.\n\nI have no complaints about this place, hence another five star update.  I'll definitely be keeping you in the rotation, D'lite.  See you again soon!
