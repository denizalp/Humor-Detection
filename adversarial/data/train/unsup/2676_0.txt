The sandbar in Chandler is a sad overpriced experience that will leave you wondering why you went there. Their food is absolutely horrible (I attempted to feed my leftovers to my dog and she wouldn't eat it... Okay she did eat it but when she threw it back up she refused to eat that), so is the service and on the weekend they charge a cover charge for God knows what reason? Horrible environment with annoying meathead clientele.
