5-Stars for the best Soul Food in the Valley!\n\nI'm from the Deep South (Mississippi), and I've been craving soul food for years, so when a group of friends suggested we eat at Lo Lo's yesterday, I couldn't say no!\n\nThe Lo Lo's in Scottsdale is a nice, open restaurant that was VERY crowded at 2PM on Saturday afternoon.  Every group had a wait of at least 20 minutes.  \n\nI had the special which included two pieces of fried chicken - a breast and a wing - a waffle with syrup and I ordered a side of cheese grits.\n\nFirst, the waffle.  No one at waffles with fried chicken in Mississippi.  I think this soul food extension is an invention of Chicago, though I may be wrong.  The waffle was tasty, but nothing spectacular.  It was aight.\n\nThe chicken, though, was by far the best damned fried chicken I've had since I ate at a family-owned Cajun fried chicken place in Gonzales, Louisiana 15 years ago.  It was THAT good.  Generous pieces.  Fried to perfection.\n\nThe grits: these were REAL grits.  Not instant.  The good stuff.  The kind that takes a good while to cook.  It was perfect.  Man, I haven't had honest good grits in more than 15 years.  We'll be going back to Lo Los just because of grits if nothing else (though I really want more chicken).\n\nEveryone's drinks came in gigantic glass mayonnaise jars.  Not too many of us needed refills.  A friend ordered fruit punch kool-aid (which they have ON TAP).  I could SMELL his kool aid from across the table.  He sad it was so strong, he probably went home with diabetes.  :D  They don't fool around with their kool-aid.\n\nService was fantastic.  Our waiter had an awesome shirt that said \"Scottsdale, but Hood forever\"  lol\n\nWe'll be going back as soon as we recover.  :D
