French inspiration, but dull American reality is what we discovered at La Madeleine Country French Cafe in Sky Harbor Airport. It's casual fast-food where the sides are a choice of potato chips or banana\/orange.\n\nOlivia got a pre-made Chicken Salade Croissant that totally succeeded at tasting premade. It was a generic supermarket-style croissant with flavorless chicken salad. She threw most of it in the trash.\n\nFor me, the Baked Croque Monsieur Sandwich with Smoked Ham and Swiss Cheese plus Garlic Cream Sauce on Wheatberry Bread sounded amazing. It wasn't. The soggy sandwich was a mix of bitterness and disappointment. I forced myself to finish it even though, in retrospect, I probably gotten a sandwich just as bad on the plane.\n\nI have no idea if La Madeleine Country French Cafe at the Phoenix Airport is the worst restaurant choice in the terminal, but it surely can't be the best.
