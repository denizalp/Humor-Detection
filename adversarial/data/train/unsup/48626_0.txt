Kinda feel like I got ripped off. Got my nails done here a week ago and they have either broke and I had to file them to make them look normal or the paint is chipping. I've had my nails done plenty of times at other nail salons and the paint has never chipped.. wonder if they use actual gel or regular nail polish to pretend its gels. Either way, they said their gel wont chop for 14 days. Was only going to give this place one star but the girl who did them seemed nice so I'll give them another star - but I'm not going back to get my nails done.
