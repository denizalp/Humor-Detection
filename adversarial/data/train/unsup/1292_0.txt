Worst excuse for a dealership. Places like this give all car dealerships a bad name. \n\nWhatever you do, do not give them your email address...the emails cannot be stopped. \n\nIf you do buy a car there, do not refer them to your friends expecting the promised \"bird dog fee\" you will never get  it. \n\nOverall advise coming from someone who has bought many cars in my lifetime (20-30) ...stay away.
