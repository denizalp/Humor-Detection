Well in the land of Buffet's this isn't the very best or the cheapest but they are in the top with me.  They get a lot of points with because they serve Pho (ok its not the best but it has fresh broth and noodles) and the overall quality of the food is very good plus the shear variety pleases me to no end :)\n\nPositives\nThe kitchens of each of the food types are open to view.\nDecor is lovely, modern and has a variety of decorations.\nTons of variety: Sandwich bar, Asian Noodle & Dim Sum, Japanese, Italian, Chinese, American, Mexican, BBQ, desert, Omelet Station, peel and eat shrimp, and so on.\n\nNegatives\nIts a buffet - as much as I love them they can be very impersonal.\n\nI have been here a couple times and I do enjoy it but like any Buffet they do have some inconsistencies with food quality - some items amazing and some, well, sucky.  They are a safe bet though and I will go again!
