Cirque du Soleil - Love at the Mirage is a great show for Beatles fans. It is a beautiful theater, well designed show, nice costumes, very fun and has a eighties feel. The show is more of Broadway musical feel to it and is memorable but not exciting.\n\nIt is worth seeing and not for everyone. The Mirage is a nice Casino but not a favorite.
