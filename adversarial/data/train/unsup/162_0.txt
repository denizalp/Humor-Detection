My quest to eat at all the Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh landed me next at Red Orchid. I was intrigued to read about the owner having opened a restaurant in her native Thailand only to have it wiped out by the tsunami. What brought her to Pittsburgh I have no idea but I'm super glad she's here!! Man, this was good! She's worked at Bangkok Balcony, Smiling Banana Leaf, and Nicky's Thai - all good resume material if you ask me!\n\nWhile not the easiest place to find, this little restaurant is very nice inside and gives a different vibe than many others with the cloth table settings, the cute pendant lighting, and the soothing feel it all generates. The menu is very thorough and has dozens of things I love. We started with the fresh tofu summer rolls which were very good. You could tell that all the ingredients were indeed fresh because the flavor profile was outstanding. Next came soup or salad - I had a salad with a homemade pineapple dressing (delightful!) and my wife had the rice soup - which isn't at all bland like you might think based on the name. It was very tasty!\n\nMy spicy pork basil ordered, surprise, Thai hot was indeed Thai hot!! YUM YUM YUM!!! And wow, the flavors were amazing! Just like I hoped they would be! The pork was tender and skillfully prepared and the veggies were so obviously fresh and super tasty. Man, I'd order that again in a heartbeat! My wife ordered the Lad Nah which had the stir fried wild rice noodles (DELIGHTFUL!) with an assortment of fresh vegetables and a delicious brown sauce. So good! My daughter's masaman curry was superb as well and just the right hint of sweetness from the coconut milk.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised at how good this was! Count me in as a fan and as someone who will be back again and again! And yep, I agree, this is more like a 4.5 star place. It's that good. Worth finding for sure!!
