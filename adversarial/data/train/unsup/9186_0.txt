Now that's more like it! In a past review I stated I was hopping to stop in with a bigger crowd next visit and that's what I got...a big crowd. An active big crowd. I'm not sure what game took place that weekend but the place was packed with hockey fans who were lots of fun to drink with.\n\nJust as our last visit me and my friends stopped in to spend a $50 drinking credit but unlike our last visit the place was packed and lively. The pianist kept the tunes coming while every one was dancing, singing, and more importantly drinking haha. Simply having a good time.\n\nIt was kind of hard to wrap up the drinks and leave since everyone we came in contact with was very talkative. This isn't a bad thing at all which resulted in us staying longer and purchasing more drinks outside of the $50 credit. \n\nHockey fans to the rescue! This was the complete opposite from my last visit to this place. The fun was owed to the crowd and I believe it's because the crowd that the pianist played none stop with small pauses here and there. I can tell this is definitely a hit or miss bar with this visit being a hit. Hopefully me and my friends will luck up on more nights like this.\n\nDrinks 2\/11\/2018
