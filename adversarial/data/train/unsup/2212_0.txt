This morning was a bit of a crazy one. I had a tonne of things to get done AND I had to make a stop in at a laboratory clinic to get some blood drawn. Everyone knows that getting blood work done is a REAL time commitment - a good 2-3 hours of 'hurry up and wait'. Great. \n\nRecently I wrote about my experience at another laboratory clinic, one where I foolishly walked in sans-appointment. Well she CAN be taught - this time I made an appointment. \n\nI was FLOORED when they called my name to the MINUTE of my appointment time. Say WHAT?!?!?! I sat down, and literally 40 seconds later, the laboratory assistant had 3 tubes of 'Sapna Juice'...oh god, get your mind out of the gutter. \n\nI couldn't have been more impressed with my experience here. \n\nSo what's the moral of the story??? NEVER walk in - always take the time to call ahead and book an appointment!
