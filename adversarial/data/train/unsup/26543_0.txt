Hooray for Canada having some decent rail transit between Canadian cities. I really enjoyed taking this transportation. The cabins were clean and the wifi worked well. The staff were very pleasant and the train was right on time. Boarding was very easy and the station had quite a few coffee shops around to grab a quick breakfast before boarding. Overall I was very impressed with the easy navigation and great service from Via Rail. I wish more of Canada had quick trains between large Canadian cities!
