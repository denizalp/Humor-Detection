if you're looking for salvadoran\/mexican food and snacks, this is THE place to go! they have a menu on the wall behind the register and also one on the table at the register as well. i call this place like a snack place because they have food that is what you would call \"snacks.\" for instance, my friend got the coco preparado (slices of fresh coconuts, tamarind sauce, jicama, chopped cucumbers and candied tamarind) and it is the size of a take-out box but it's not like a hearty meal, if that makes sense? it's enough to fill you up, but it's not the typical \"meal\" that we think of. \n\nthis place is nice and clean, with friendly customer service. i got the papusas and they were filled with gooey cheese exploding from them! pupusas remind me of a pancake stuffed with cheese and you eat it with pickled cabbage, jalapenos and carrots. DELICIOUS! plus side of this is that it is inexpensive too and on tuesdays, if you get a dozen of pupusas, they're $1.00 each!! all in all, i am coming back here next time i'm around the area!!!
