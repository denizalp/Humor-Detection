I only rated this place a two star because of our experience during our stay. The check in process went very smooth and everyone at the front desk on check in were friendly. The hotel room was clean as well. The issue was during our stay. The hotel pool closed earlier than when the Dj at the roof top was done. I think it would be great to have the dj and the pool stay open at the same time. \n\nHowever the big issue was in our hotel room air conditioning. We woke up in the morning sweaty and hot. We looked at the hotel a\/c control panel and it wasn't working. I called the front desk and advised that our room was hot and she said she was going to send someone right away. I told her that the a\/c control panel was not working at all. She said it might be the battery. 30 minutes go by and still no one came. I called back and spoke to the same person at the front desk and told her no one has come yet and she said \"oh ok can you tell me what was wrong in case they ask me when I call them?\" That was infuriating as she clearly forgot that we already spoke and was expecting someone to come. After that call, someone came to fix the a\/c which took about 15 minutes to fix and it was not the battery. For someone to forgot that we even spoke about an a\/c issue not working in 108degree weather in Phoenix is not acceptable.\n\nAlso we wanted to bring some waters to the pool that morning for drinking and was told we couldn't bring anything but that the kitchen will not open until 11am which is also ridiculous because when we got to the pool, there were several people with their own bottles of water and cans of beer. \n\nIf the a\/c didn't break and if the front desk person didn't forget that our room was hot, it wouldn't have been such an awful experience.
