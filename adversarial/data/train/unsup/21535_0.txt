We don't have Pei Wei in northern California so when I'm visiting AZ or SoCal I make it a goal to stop at a Pei Wei somewhere. Yes, I'm addicted to the kung pao chicken and I'm proud to admit it. I've been eating at Pei Wei for the past 10 years and have never deviated from my order. Crazy huh?\n\nHere's why it's a solid option. It's quick, flavorful and all the proteins are cooked in a wok with a ton of oil :) Flash frying in a pan, yessssss please! As I mentioned above, I only ever order the kung pao chicken and it's consistently great across all the locations. I've never just had an OK kung pao. It comes with a ton of white meat chicken, carrots, snow peas, brown rice and a great sauce. I would recommend ordering the extra vegtables too (mostly broccoli). \n\nI'm in AZ for the next few days and I gauruntee that I'll be getting some more kung pao before I bounce. Boom.
