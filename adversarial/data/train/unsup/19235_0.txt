After a long SUNday of spin class at 24 hour fitness, friends and I wanted to treat ourselves. Since we were on Spring Mountain, a friend suggested Cathay House.\n\nI was eager to try this place as I've heard about this place; mainly because it's a late night dimsum spot open late.....maybe 4am???\n\nOrdered the usual egg custard bun, noodles, duck, shrimp hargaw.\nIt was my 1st time there and I wasn't impressed. I was more so dissappointed. \nEspecially when I bit into my egg custard bun; and didn't get oooooozyyyy goooooey egg custard goodness coming out of there. =( HOW LAME!\nOf course, Imma compare this place to my fave spot (East Ocean DimSum) and it pales in comparison. \n\nIf it's uber late and I'm craving dimsum; I guess, I'll come here again. Whatevs.
