For our family vacation in vegas we decided that Circus Circus would be a fun place to stay for Sunday night for my daughter.  \n\nOn arrival this place was a madhouse. I expected that but what I didn't expect was that it would be so dated and dirty feeling.\n\nWhen we entered the room, my wife and I first thought there was no way we could stay here. It smelled like cleaning agents, but felt dirty. We had to do a check of the beds to make sure there weren't any bedbugs. \n\nThe tv is like 10 years old and the channels leave something to be desired.\n\nThe beds are old and uncomfortable. I write this as I lay in bed because I can't sleep. Even if the beds weren't uncomfortable, the old ac unit is loud and never seems to turn off for more than 5 minutes.\n\nOur room with a view has a great view... of a parking lot and another building.\n\nHad I not already paid for the room or if our stay was going to be longer I would have gone somewhere else.\n\nThe location of the toilet paper in the bathroom requires that you have the arms of an orangutan.\n\nWe won't be back.
