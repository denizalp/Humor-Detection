I walked in the other day because I was bored, depressed and a haircut always helps me feel better. I've never gone in here before just because it never stood out. Boy am I glad I went in ! I found a new place to get my hair cut, doesn't cost me  a 100 bucks and is only walking distance from my house ! Good Lord have mercy ! \n\nLila (if my memory serves me right) cut my hair and boy o boy did she do an outstanding job. She was very cordial, and the kinds but more importantly all the directions I ever gave her when she asked what I wanted was -\"Meh, just whatever, do something\" (Saying I had a bad day would be an understatement) I love my new cut and even those nit picky co workers and customers at my work like it ! Damn ! I know I am going back in a few weeks.
