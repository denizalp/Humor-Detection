Nice!  Really good tacos....made to order with all the toppings except the salsa.  The salsa comes in a squeeze bottle in mild, medium or hot.  Had the medium and it was standard medium; may try the hot next time.  Had the chorizo and carnitas Mexicano style.  These tacos are on par with Las Palmas and a couple of other taco stands in the area.  If you like real street tacos with fresh ingredients this is a good stop.\nThere are a couple of tables and and awning cover them so you can eat at the table as everyone walks by on the sidewalk or take it with you.
