The staff was nice when I went to sell my items, but since I thought it said uptown in its name, I thought they'd like the name brand men's shirts I had, but the store is geared more towards trendy young who like H&M....so my items were not bought but if I were younger there'd be stuff that I'd like.  it seemed organized and affordable but I think the stuff I had was more for mature men...
