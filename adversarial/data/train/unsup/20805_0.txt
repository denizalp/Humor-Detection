Poke \/ Salad Bars are poking up all over the US.  At least in the Western poke of the US.  For those unfamiliar with Poke, in simplest terms it is marinated raw fish, usually High Grade chunks of tuna, Sesame Oil, Ogo \/ Seaweed, Chili Pepper, and Hawaiian Sea Salt.  Some Poke connoisseurs like to add green onions, white onions, and sesame seeds to their home made poke.  Happy to say, Poke Bar starts out with fresh chunks of tuna and lets you build from that base with many options.\n\nAt PB, you have plenty of heathy options, starting with the size which ranges from two scoops (S) to four scoops (L) of protein (traditional Hawaiian, Spicy Tuna, Albacore, etc), rice or salad or a mix, sauce, toppings, and more toppings.  We liked that the crab salad is a topping and not a protein option as in some Poke Salad shops.\n\nWe went around 9pm, right at closing, and the two Poke Baristas (?), were pleasant even though we were probably delaying their close. Great service with no closing attitudes.  Oh yeah, they have Hawaiian Sun drinks with tropical flavors.  BTW a small is plenty of food....
