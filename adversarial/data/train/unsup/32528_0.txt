Last night was my last night spending time with my friends before I move away, and we met here because it was close to our work.  We sat at the bar to play Keno, I put $40 in and one of my friends was playing too.  My friend that didn't play ordered fries and mozzarella triangles.  Which there are only 5 mozzarella triangles on that plate and it's $9, but whatever bar food is always overpriced.  \n\nWhat really got me was the female bartender hardly did anything for us at all.  She acted like we weren't even there, took our glasses but didn't ask if we wanted more drinks.  I would look at her and wait for her to see me to ask her for another drink but she just walked away. There was an employee off the clock sitting at the bar and our bartender was just standing there talking to her, it looked like she didn't care about anyone.  Whoever the supervisor was walking around the bar didn't even seem to notice that this girls customer service blows. We were super nice to her although irritated, and in the end we were still charged for every single drink even though we were playing.  not one drink was comped, great last experience at a Vegas bar. NOT!
