yes i do believe in giving a place a second chance, so i went in to layers with my nephew to get him a cookie and i got one. after we finished our cookies i did get a dozen cookies to go, the dozen did cost around 21 bucks so not the cheapest cookies but hay they were good. i do have to say their pastries are good even though their customer service and lunch options bite. i was actually not going to write this review and was going to continue stopping in for pastries but after the rude comment the owner themselves left on my last review i was prompted to make it knows that i will NOT ever set foot in the place again. the fact that they cant take simple criticism and respond to it childish and rudely is very sad. \nthe fact is the place ain't worth a penny you drop at the place.
