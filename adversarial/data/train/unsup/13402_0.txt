This was my first opportunity to visit the new downtown location. It is located on Forbes Ave near Market Square right next to Revel + Roost. Most of the store is barren however, they carry a selection of the ice cream from the Shadyside main store. I was told they don't have them all but plan to get more in.\n\nThey also have the take out pints for sale in their freezer. There is a small area where you can sit at a booth facing the window or a wall. If you are familiar with Millie's then you'll remember they use the ceramic tasting spoons for samples. They are here as well. They also have a water jug in case you get thirsty.\n\nPrices are the same as the Shadyside store. You can get a waffle cone where they put a tiny marshmallow and a \"treat\" at the bottom. You are advised to let them know if you don't want this  in your cone. I find one baby scoop for $3.00 is generous for me. On this visit I had the white chocolate plum and believe me it was good to the very end! Millie's makes their own ice cream and is one of my favorite shops.\n\nYou can find Millie's ice cream in a lot of restaurants and specialty grocery stores all over the city. Pints are a bit pricey but worth every cent of it!
