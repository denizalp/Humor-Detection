Tried this place because it is the same restaurant as the other one in Chinatown (1082 Boulevard Saint-Laurent, Montreal, QC H2Z 1J5)\nIt was around 10pm and the waitress let us know that they only had 4 dumping choices left. \nWe ordered the pork,shrimp, and leek fried which adds 1.50$ to the price.\n\nFood was served really fast. The dumplings were decent, quality was the same as the other restaurant which is a really good sign. The service was quick and rushed (because they were closing at midnight and they wanted to close the kitchen early I guess.) \n\nI enjoyed my time here and think the dumplings are good enough given the price. I can't really vouch for the authenticity of the cuisine but I liked it and would go back.\n\nTip: Cash Only, there is an ATM and it adds 1.50$ to withdraw
