\"Thieves!!! I left some expensive sunglasses in the middle console of a vehicle I returned recently to the Sixt Phoenix airport location. Once I landed at my destination, I called and no one had seen them. I knew exactly where I left them. Totally slipped my mind to grabbed them and a Sixt employee stole them. Karma is a beast. Just wait and see.\n\nMy young son left his iPad before (with a more accredited rental car company) and they overnighted it to me-no problem. Not these thieves!!!!!!\n\nPlus, the customer service is bad. Long waits to rent and inattentive, lethargic employees who obviously hate there jobs. Never again Sixt.
