I never write reviews but this time I needed to give my opinion. First time ever at an In-N-Out burger, so excited to try it because I had heard so many good things! The queue wasn't too long, the server was awesome - so friendly and helpful. I waited patiently for what I hoped would be an awesome burger (and animal fries of course!). Got our food and  WOW TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT! I managed to eat less than half of my cheeseburger, hubby ate slightly more. And the animal fries - honestly the worst fries I have ever had in my life! Glad I tried it, but seriously wish I hadn't! Should went anywhere else
