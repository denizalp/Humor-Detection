Note: They are now CASH ONLY. An ATM can be found inside. \n\nMoms are always looking out for their sons, even when they're on the wrong side of 30, like myself. She's become obsessed with Livingsocial in her semi-retirement, thus finding me a deal on a platter of Vinnie's pretzel rods. \n\n\"Ya know, why don't you take some in for the guys?\" My mother is a helpful one. \n\nPeople bring South Side pretzels in to work often. Someone even brought some in earlier yesterday, but they were all eaten before I arrived. \n\nI'm not lying. At least 10 people came up to me and declared that they preferred Vinnie's over the South Side pretzels. It's not hard to see why. Personally I love them both, but a Vinnie's pretzel is more elegant, a pretzel for those who find the South Side variety to be a little too tough for 'em. Vinnie's are softer, they're baked to a very light shade of gold, there's little charring on the bottom, the inside is somewhat fluffy, and the outside is a little crispy. One of my co-workers even detected a buttery flavor.  \n\n\"Screw South Side. I'm goin' to Brookline for pretzels now!\" Those were the exact words of another co-worker. Hey, I gave him the address and the website. Let the pretzel war begin.\n\nP.S. They have an extensive menu including sandwiches, \"hot pockets,\" and desserts. Vinnie, the owner, is a very nice man to boot and loves to make his customers happy. Please support Vinnie's. Take a bunch of their pretzels to a party, and you'll be the man or woman of the hour. \n\nP.P.S. Death to Auntie Anne's!!!
