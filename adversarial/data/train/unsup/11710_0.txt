We've been in several times.  Always a fan.\n\nWe usually sit at the bar and have great service.  TV's there are a little wonky on the picture.  Not sure what's up with that. \n\nSteak is always phenomenal.  I usually get the petit filet which they \"cook\" blue, which is my fave.  Had the BBQ Corn which is tasty and the potatoes au gratin are delicious even though I don't really care for potatoes.  \n\nDrinks are always well made.\n\nNice to relax in the Ritz Carlton Lobby Lounge before or after the meal.
