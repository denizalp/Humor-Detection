A great dim sum place and still using the old carts instead Of ordering off the menu. It has the traditional menu items like hai gow and Siu mai as well as other old favourites. Being a tourist in town it was great but not that great as you can get the same value in Canada. I hope they have rice noodle dishes as it was kinda of a hit and miss. I will come again in the future.
