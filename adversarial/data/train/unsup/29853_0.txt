We have been coming here for a while. It is our favorite Thai place in the east valley. The curry dishes have good flavor and the decor is very cute. We also like the chicken satay, papaya salad, seafood salad and many other dishes. The coconut ice cream with fried bananas is presented beautifully. We have always had pleasant service and it is true that they can be slow. But I don't understand all comments about the owners wife being rude, she is always nice to us. It is nice to have a Mom and Pop restaurant to go to instead of all these big chain restaurants. This place is definitely worth a try!
