Proclaiming on its website, \"New York has Macy's, London has Harrods, Chicago has Marshall Fields, and Toronto has Honest Ed's. It is quite an attraction - honest,\" proclaims The Great Toronto Getaway, Buffalo, USA.\", I think it is setting the bar a little too high in comparison.  Saying that your version of Macy's or Harrods is a huge and dirty amalgam of knock off clothing and appliances that might be left over from the Stone Age, then I feel bad for you Toronto.  In the state, specifically New England we have a store that is comparable to Honest Ed's; it's called Ocean State Job Lot.  It's filled with shit you don't want and crap that doesn't work, all for pennies.\n\nThe only thing I bought here was a shot glass for my Mom's growing number of alcohol enablers.  I'm surprised that it actually made the plane ride home, since I was expecting to vacuum bits and pieces of cheap glass from my bag.  \n\nIt's kind of amusing to look at it from the outside, I thought for a second Joe and I were going to the circus, with the outlandish sign for Honest Ed's.  As if trying to rectify the situation for its customers, there are hundreds of pictures depicting Ed with famous people, but they were all probably thinking \"Who the hell is this man and WHY is he shaking my hand??!?!\"\n\nAdvertising itself as a must stop for tourists, it doesn't help the Canadians cause at all.  It's alright for a look see, but I wouldn't buy anything if I could help it...
