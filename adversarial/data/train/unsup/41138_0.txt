Used a groupon on a Saturday night. Their happy hour pricing is nearly as good a value. It was not crowded at 9pm. The place is not that big, so if you need service just man up and flag someone down. Hamachi sliders were given to me on the house even though I didn't order it. They were quite a powerful mix of soy sauce, ginger, and yellowtail that, like an alcoholic shot, serve to kick-start your palate. I had an ahi tuna salad, kaiser roll, 808 roll, & both ice cream selections and all were good. I remember the green bean or asparagus dish being too salty.\nThis place is definitely more suited to someone who typically does not have one \"regular\" choice or otherwise adheres to a regimen. Tapas are meant to be an adventure for your taste buds.
