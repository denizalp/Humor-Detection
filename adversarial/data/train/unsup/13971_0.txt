I had done quite of bit of research on both Yelp and The Knot before I decided to book Most-Important-Day-of-My-Life-Hair at Primp and Blow.  After giggling at the name like a 12-year-old, I picked the Town & Country location instead of Scottsdale Waterfront location (which is actually closer) based solely on reviews about the great customer service at Town & Country.  I know what you're thinking, \"Snooty ladies in Scottsdale?! NO WAY!\" I'm sure I could have just steeled my nerves, pulled on my big girl panties, and saved myself a bit of a drive, but this was gonna be MY day.  I'd rather not waste the energy going all Bride-zilla while the citizens of Tokyo flee for their lives.\n \nBooked a run-thru with Vanessa two-weeks before the Big Day.  She's a no-nonsense, tell you how it is, Dear Lord is that another Pinterest board, kind of gal...and I absolutely loved her!  I sheepishly showed her pictures of what I was hoping for (yes, on Pinterest...stop with the judgment) and I could immediately see the wheels turning.  She recommended clip-in extensions* and found a set that matched my own hair color perfectly.  I was amazed at how quickly she worked and when she handed me a mirror and spun me around, I was thrilled with what she had accomplished - a beautiful half-up\/half-down with height and curls.  I felt like a damn Disney Princess.  I had Vanessa UN-do my hair so there would be some surprises on the Big Day.  She did a lovely job on the make-up as well and when I got home that night, my betrothed smiled big and said, \"You look like you!\"  Pretty sure he was concerned I'd come home looking like a contestant from RuPaul's Drag Race (no T, no shade).\n \nTwo weeks later I brought my mom and two step-daughters for our official Big Day Hair Dids.  The 11-year-old's hair is a short bob, so I was concerned that she might walk out of their looking like a TV News Anchor, but Stephanie flat-ironed out the \"poofiness\" my girl hates and did a sweet waterfall braid around crown of her head.  Courtney took the 12-year-old's shoulder-length wavy mane, played up the curls and pulled twisted pieces from the sides around to the back.  Both Courtney and Stephanie did a great job with the girls' make-up.  They looked polished and sweet and NOT a day older than their real ages, which is exactly what I wanted.  I was so pleased with what Tiara was able to do with my mom's short hair and for her make-up.  Mom smiled and said, \"It's me...only better!\"  Vanessa somehow out-did her run-thru hair and I could not have been happier with the result.\n \nIf you've read this far, hang with me now for the break-down:\n-          The entire team at Primp & Blow were courteous and helpful.  It was a Saturday afternoon so of course is was very busy, but not chaotic. \n\n-          Ask for Vanessa, Courtney, Stephanie, and Tiara.\n\n-          The price for all of us (not including my extensions) was VERY reasonable and MUCH better than most of the places I had researched.\n\n-          They don't provide water-proof mascara, so I brought my own--didn't want Vanessa's hard work to go to waste when the inevitable happy tears would fall.\n\n-          I really need an excuse to go for a blow-out (out!  I said \"out!\" Get your mind out of the gutter)\n\n \n* Want some justification for dropping money on extensions?  Sure you do! \n1) A human person grew this hair out of their head for years and probably got paid good money for it = be a Job-Creator!\n2)  They are reusable and easy to care for (already popped those bad boys in for another event to wow my friends and colleagues).  \n3)  If someone asks, \"Is that your hair?\" you reply with, \"I paid for it, so yes, it is my hair.\"
