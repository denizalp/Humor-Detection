Yep. This place is it! The service was superb; friendly, attentive, and generous! Valentino began our exceptional experience with the chips, salsa, bean dip, and grilled chillies and onions. Of course, we had to order the fajitas, so my girlfriend ordered the chicken fajitas. I ordered the chicken chimi. The fajitas were a total full sense experience. I don't want to ruin it for you, so you will just have to try them. The chimi was LOADED with chicken. It was moist and flavor packed. Even though we were stuffed, and packed up our left overs for tomorrow, we got some flan. By far the best I have even had, hands down, no questions asked. Everything is made fresh daily from scratch and it shows. I would HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone in the Vegas area. The trip is well worth the time to leave the strip. I will be bringing my friends and family the next time I am in town. THANKS!!!
