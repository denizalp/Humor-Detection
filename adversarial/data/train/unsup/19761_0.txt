As the reviews run the gamut, I was prepared for anything.  It is Restaurant Week, so it was really busy, and the initial service did start off a little slow.  Our server, however, was apologetic and overall the service was above average.  \n\nI ordered beets & citrus, and it was delicious.  However, the portion size was fairly small.   Although I wanted scallops, I steered clear based on \"overcooked\" reviews.  For my entree, I had the raviolo-again, not a large portion, but very good.  The goat cheese and tomato filling melts in your mouth.  The outer edges of the raviolo were a little undercooked.  I like my pasta al dente but this was a little tougher.  Dessert was the lemon mascarpone cheesecake with honey and candied pistachios.  Although I didn't detect much of a lemon flavor, it was GOOOOD.  And the best part, served with a side of strawberry\/rhubarb compote topped with a scoop of gelato.  Score!  Like two desserts for the price of--well almost two desserts at $9.00.\n\nThe only thing that was not so enjoyable was the sound level.  It was as loud as a college bar, seriously.  I had to almost yell to carry on a conversation.  Poor planning in the design phase in my opinion.  The food was good enough that I will definitely return if I can find out when their slow times are.  The noise level was too much otherwise.
