When my world traveled seasoned date boasted of this superb restaurant he knew, I was intrigued. He wanted to take me to a corner of the world where the dishes were entirely authentic. That I would be wowed by the amazing food. Where the staff was incredibly accommodating and hailed from Peru. \n\nI smiled when I heard the name of the restaurant. It wasn't a secret! I'd had the great fortune of visiting before with some other Yelpers. Of course I was in! And I knew *exactly* what I wanted to order. This time I knew where the restaurant was (a nondescript shopping center) and we took advantage of the fine Phoenix weather to sit outside. The tables are smaller outside, more for 1-2 people, and worked wonderfully for quiet conversation. (A folk band ended up playing that night, and a large group had booked the majority of the restaurant. Powerpoint presentation and all!)\n\nI ordered in quick succession the Aji de Gallina (shredded chicken in a spicy cream sauce) and we shared the Papa Rellenas (stuffed potatoes). For a beverage I went with the Chicha Morada (made out of purple corn). There was no room for dessert. And there were bountiful amounts of food to box up. (Oof! Best leftovers *ever*!) These two dishes are amazing. I would order them again and again. And again. And right now. (Shhh!)\n\nThe chicken is spicy, but not so hot that you need to desperately gulp water down. It's rich in a way that's rewarding. Cheese, garlic, nuts and Peruvian chili peppers are blended with cream to fill that belly. Served with white rice. The stuffed mashed potatoes are large (more than an orange) and filled with ground beef and sweet raisins.\n\nA delightful treasure of a restaurant without any pretentious formalities. \n\nOh! Oh! Note: The restaurant is BYOB if you're interested. There is a $5 corkage fee per bottle.
