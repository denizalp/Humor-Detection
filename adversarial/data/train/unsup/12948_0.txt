It's always a treat for me to go to Schreiner's. It either means I'm planning to cook something fabulous, or that my serum sausage level has dropped dangerously low and needs to be replenished!\n\nI consider this my go-to place for Cajun recipe items now, ever since discovering their andouille sausage (which, in my opinion, is the closest to authentic that I have found in Phoenix). I only recently noticed that they also stock Cajun tasso, which is a cured pork product used for flavoring diishes (think pancetta... but not as fatty, and with a spicy Cajun twist). I must warn you though, this tasso is a bit fiery. I had to sample it at home before deciding to use it in a pasta alfredo-type dish and the cayenne was up-front and in my face! Yikes! Ahhh, I do like the burn though...\n\nI also consider this one of my sources for German meal ingredients. They have the authentic weisswursts I grew up on, and they sell cans of kraut and rotkohl if you don't want to make 'em from scratch.\n\nFor lunch, they feature a limited selection of their house-made sausages on a bun with chips and a drink for $5 as their daily \"Brown Bag Special\". This is a treat if you simply want to sample one of their offerings at a time. And their is a small lawn with a couple of outdoor dinettes behind the shop where you can eat.\n\nYou know you love to snitch a snack, or sneak a sausage. So git yer snausage-loving ass down to Schreiner's!
