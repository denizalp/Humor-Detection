Thank you Yelpers for leading me here! Marcia is great! Not only is she fun to talk to but she seriously knows how to sew. Plus her shop has the kinda place you just want to hang out. She did a great job changing the fit to one of my dresses and fixing the length of another. It's always fun to look back behind her work space and see what other projects she's working on too. She can do basic hemming and take on crazy projects that change the entire look of a piece you bring in. I will definitely be bringing her more dresses and tops to adjust!
