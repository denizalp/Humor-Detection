I had been to Futo But a a few time before for lunch. I decide I would try to take my wife who is gluten free due to celiac disease. Stephanie, our waitress, and Mike, the manager, could not have been more accommodating, helpful, and all around awesome to us. They both thoroughly explained what my wife could eat, what they could change, and provided some solid recommendations. We began with the Japanese fried chicken (which is gluten free as they use corn starch) as an app. My wife ordered Chizu which was accommodated for her with rice on the side instead of noodles. She loved it. I (not GF) had the fire and ice. We both loved every bite of our food. Our good friend had the Miso and he raved about it. In the past I've greatly enjoyed the Tonkotsu (the more \"traidiontal\" bowl) along with their pork and duck buns. I've yet to not enjoy something from here. The drink section is great and they are (I believe) the only place in the area with Genshu. I've been here before and had a great meal, but tonight was above and beyond thanks to Stephanie and Mike's amazing service and help. Thank you!
