Oh Lola, you are soo freaken adorable!!! :)\nI am in L-O-V-E with this coffee shop, so laid back and hip!! I love its comfy feeling and sudden relaxing effect it has over you as soon as you step in, it's clean, modern and beautifully decorated all over!!!  \nOh and yeah my Chai was oh so yummy along with a cherry scone! \nThe girl that helped us was super nice and knowledgeable of the drinks and baked goodies this coffee shop offers. I would gladly want to own a coffee shop similar to this one someday!!! :)
