A lot better than the nursing home kitchen that used to be in this spot.\n\nThe table popcorn would make Sacagawea proud.\n\nMy turkey sandwich had no idea as it sat upon my plate that it would soon become the best fucking turkey sandwich to ever grace my sweet filthy mouth.\n\nI will be back.\n\nThe water glasses are kindergarden-sized, which isn't a problem if your staff is well trained to keep them full. Our server was on top of it, but no water glass could be filled without an \"excuse me\", or \"I'm sorry...I just need to grab...there...thanks!\", or \"would you like more water?\" Just fill my goddamn glass until it's over fucking flowing and don't interrupt my lunch conversation. \n\nOf course I want more water! It's still pretty affordable, is it not? Be generous. \n\nAnd even if I didn't need additional water, I would sooner watch you silently pour water into my glass until the fucking floor was wet than engage in a pro\/con discussion about whether to refill my fucking cup. Just fill it up like Kevin McAllister's uncle told the flight attendant.
