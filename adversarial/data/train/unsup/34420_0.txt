If we saw all the negative reviews before going, we probably wouldn't have gone. We were in the area and stopped by Tuesday for lunch. The line was literally out the door. Because we were willing to dine at the bar we were seated right away otherwise the wait was 15-20 minutes. \n\nI ordered the lunch combo w\/ tomato bisque soap and a turkey, brie & cranberry sandwich w\/ sweet potato fries. The fries were limp and soggy. Gross, right? My hubby got the french onion soup and marseilles (sp) crepe stuffed with chicken, sun dried tomato and topped with some sort of mushroom gravy. My tomato soup was REALLY good. I only wish they had basil whipped in there. My sandwich was not bad, they put too much cranberry relish on it, I just scraped it off. My husband's dish had too much of an ingredient, couldn't put my finger on it, but again it wasn't bad. I didn't get a chance to taste all of the french onion soup because he ate all the cheese before I could get to it, The broth was fine.\n\nThe service was fine to me. Although, I thought it was strange when the waitress brought out his soup first then asked me if I wanted mine now or when my meal came. I want my soup when my dining companion has their soup. Weird.\n\nOverall, the experience was pleasant not worth waiting 15-20 minutes for a table.
