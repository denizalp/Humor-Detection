First time giving this place a try which we found on Zhaboom.com. Unfortunately the name of the place changed because it was bought by someone new so new owner\/new name. So I asked the server we found this on Zhaboom and I guess the name changed and she said it was changed for a long time - 3 months. Now in terms of business, 3 months is not a long time! On top of that she was giving us attitude and we just walked in. Any who we told we prefer the patio because shisha + patio after work is one of the best thing in my life ^_^ And she told us that she won't server us if we decide to go to the patio even though there we about 10 people or in the restaurant. On top of that she didn't let us pick our spot even though there were 6 available places to choose from. Overall I personally do not recommend this place to anyone. Please save yourself the trouble and do not even bother. We sat down for 3 seconds and let without notifying the server.
