Ive always had a really good experience with PH on flamingo , this time Amanda answered the phone and instead of rushing through she took time to ask me how I was doing , I know its small but it means a lot. I also know that the majority of the calls are delivery and you have to be quick, but it was a pleasant surprise. Thanks Amanda!
