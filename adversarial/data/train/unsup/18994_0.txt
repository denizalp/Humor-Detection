This club is definitely a fun time! Me and my girlfriend both don't drink or do drugs (we're 22 and 21) so we go to Vegas mostly to hang out, dance a bit, gamble, and eat out. \nI have been \"joking\" about going to one of these though for awhile and we were bored in the hotel room around 1AM and decided to bite the bullet and go. \n\nIt is just a 10-minute ride from any strip hotel. Price was around $70 for both of us to get in, and the club is really big. Unfortunately even it being a weekend there were only about 20 people there and about 3 other couples \"getting it on\".\n\nWe were a bit creeped out by all the single guys walking around so we went right to the \"couples room\" and we had fun right away! ;) \nIt was definitely a fun first-time experience. If you have been to clubs like this before, I can't really gauge it to what other clubs offer only say that I do wish it had more people in it, but I would definitely still go back. I know there's another club right next door so that probably splits up the traffic. I recommend this place though for sure if your looking for something alternative to do in LV! Safe and clean no doubt as well.
