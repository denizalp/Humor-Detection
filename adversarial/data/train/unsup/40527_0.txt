This was a great stay and a wonderful hotel experience in Vegas! \n\nOnce you enter your room it's about as comfortable as a hotel can be. Room service is fast and quality, the staff is punctual and friendly, and the casino is clean.\n\nThere may be more trendy spots, there may be more exciting locations, but pound for pound this is a total Win.
