I was so excited about this festival! I love chili peppers, downtown, and festivals...I thought this would be the perfect experience. It was a bust! There were supposed to be 20 food vendors, but there were only about 4; I'm assuming this had to do with the rain. It was so packed and very poorly organized. The lines were long and the two dishes that I tasted were not good at all. We ended up leaving with several paid food tickets and drink tokens; it wasn't worth sticking around, even though we had already paid for the food.
