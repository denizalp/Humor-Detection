I don't frequent fast food chains.  There are always so many other options.  Culver's is an exception.  Their fish sandwiches are incredibly good and the milkshakes and concretes are offensively delicious.  The young folks who work at every Culver's I've ever visited seem sincerely nice.  C'mon, where are your deadpan looks and surly attitudes?  Oh, these restaurants are always clean, too.  This is not normal.  Something is wrong here.\n\nIf I'm ever a passenger in your car, please ignore me when I scream and badger you to drive to any nearby Culver's.  I'm too old to be downing chocolate shakes every five minutes.
