What a cute place! If I lived in the Phoenix area, LGC (as Gabi K calls it) and I would be good friends. It seems to have so many personalities -- all of them fabulous. I only was able to enjoy a \"lunch-to-go\" here, and it didn't disappoint. I have the Chopped Pizza Salad and sushi along with some tasty iced tea. There seem to be some many items in the market cum deli com pizzaria cum wine spot, that I needed more time to explore them all. Biggest surprise? They have bottled their own maple syrup! \n\nNext time I must try those cupcakes. they looked YUM-MY!
