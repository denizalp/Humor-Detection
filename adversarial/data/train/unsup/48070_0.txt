The only thing good about this place was the queso. I didn't think it was possible to mess up fajitas - turns out it is. Margaritas are either all sour mix or water- extra tequila shot won't make the difference. Staff is overwhelmed and can't handle the traffic. Should have listened to previous reviews- will not be back.
