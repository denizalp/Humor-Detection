Came here for lunch during our Vegas vacation. This place has been featured on Travel Channel and Food Network. It's smack right at the entrance on Freemont St experience and the storefront features a giant size weight scale. It is definitely a tourist trap but also entertaining. Just the d√©cor of the restaurant is worth checking out.\n\nWe were greeted by a hostess dressed up as a kinky nurse. She then escorted us to a walk-in closet where we grabbed the mandatory hospital gowns. I encourage everybody to take a group pic wearing the gowns because its priceless :)  FYI, this is a cash only place but the hostess will give you heads up anyway before you sit down. The menu is straightforward. You simply choose your burger starting from a single, double, triple, quadruple all the way up to 8 patties, if you dare. If you don't finish your entire meal including sides, you get spanked in front of public. It may seem embarrassing but public humiliation is what this place is really known for. The burgers however, were just ordinary. Too dry for my taste and I think they were frozen. Nevertheless, it was a blast hanging out here. Besides the public spanking, they also have karaoke. Anyone can request a song and perform on stage wearing the hospital gown while the crowd cheers on. Its definitely quite a spectacle!\n\nBurgers start around $9 for a Single Bypass Burger and can go up to $24 for the Octuple. You can add bacon or other toppings for extra $$. Fries are also extra. They also have delicious real fatty milkshakes and liquor. Try one of the monster shots.
