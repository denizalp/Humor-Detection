This is by far one of the (if not the) best places to see the latest cinema flicks in the Phoenix metro area.  Our family loves this place and their are some pretty good restaurants in the immediate area so you can make it an eventful evening with your family.\n\nFriendly staff, the place is always clean and it still looks new.  They have the latest digital sound and video which makes the 3-D totally awesome to watch!  They have comfy seats with adjustable arms and plenty of leg room which is so relaxing to me. Their snack, pop corn and drinks are all \"good theater worthy\" and they have that special cup you can get for repeat customer to get a discounted soda.\n\nThis a great place to watch the latest flicks with friends and family.  What would make this a 5+ you ask? A nice glass of chardonnay or merlot before the movie :-)
