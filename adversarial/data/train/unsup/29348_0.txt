If you want something quick late at night, this is your only option at the Bellagio without leaving the property.  Unfortunately, they always seem to have a good line and are not super fast at preparing your food.  It's not a very easy grab and go.\n\nThat being said, the food is pretty good.  Get it to and take it back your room if you don't want to eat in the small dining room.  \n\nIf you don't want to wait, or want more options, take the tram to the Monte Carlo where they have a 24 hour food court with know fast food joints.  It might actually be quicker, have more options, and be less expensive.
