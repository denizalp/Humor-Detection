Stayed here over a weekend  for a wedding and although the place was full to the gills, I had no complaints. I had a 2 queen suite which could sleep 6 with the pull out couch if you needed it and it was beautiful. 2 large flat panel TVs in the room (one in the bed area, one by the couch) made it comfortable for my insomniac friend to watch TV in the couch\/desk area when I went to bed. The room had a mini fridge and a microwave in addition to the standard tiny coffee maker - we didn't use these things but they'd be nice for a longer stay. The bathroom was generously sized and was stocked with Bath&Body Works products. At check in we were supplied with complementary breakfast buffet passes. The breakfast was great for free, hash-browns, bacon ,sausage, (instant) scrambled eggs, fruit, yogurt, cereal and the standard mini muffins & bagels. Juice\/milk\/coffee were also provided. We didn't have time to use the pool or exercise facilities, but they were there and seemed nice.  With taxes I paid about $140\/night and I feel like I got my moneys worth. As a Madisonian I can tell you that this is definitely not in the heart of the city, but if you don't mind that, I recommend this hotel for your stay!
