El Chorro has been in the valley for decades. This is where the wealthy old tourists and snow birds dine for a good meal in a beautiful setting. \nThe patio is wonderful, very old west\/desert sky elegant. The drink menu is creative and original and changes frequently. \nWe ate here with a group of 9 and they were able to accommodate us easily. The watermelon gaspacho was interesting and flavorful and spicy. The steak was cooked near perfect for my taste and the au gratin potatoes were off the hook. \nThe wine list is expansive, many bottles in the $40+ range all the way up to several hundred dollars. \nThe service, while attentive, is very casual. Don't expect starched shirts and formalities. \nThe clientele as I stated is typically older, our table by far was the youngest in the restaurant with mostly 40 somethings and a few 30 somethings. Expect a lot of Tommy Bahama shirts and Rush Limbaugh conversations. \nWe dine here once a year or so due to the ambiance and good food. It is rather expensive so we like to keep it as a treat. \nYou can't really go wrong here for a nice meal.
