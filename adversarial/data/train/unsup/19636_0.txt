Are all the Japanese restaurants in US run by Korean? Didn't realize what was wrong about the menu until I heard the music they were playing (k-pop). Why would a Japanese restaurant sell bulgogi? Although the food was average and I would give three stars for that, dining is not all about the food and the experience matters a lot. I came to the restaurant hoping to get a feel of japan but I heard the songs from all my favorite Korean girls groups, Girls day, Tara, Hyuna etc. That was definitely not the experience that I was expecting. But to those of you who aren't able to tell the difference between Japanese and Korean, this place would be perfect to get some exotic experience.
