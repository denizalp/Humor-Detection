Okay so my wife told me not to go here and I didn't listen. The table was dirty. The food was below par. I'm pretty sure my glass wasn't washed either. Took forever to get a refill on bottomless fries and Mac and cheese. The bun on my burger was half stale and without flavor. If that's not enough the people next to us asked for the manager! Ugh why is It so hard to put out a good product. Now my stomach hurts really bad .
