Eh cuz, I like make da kine public service announcement first for all da buggahs stay writin' reviews for anykine Hawaiian place. No such thing as Kahlua pig. We no put da kine coffee liqueur and shit on da pig, bra. Also, no moa Kailua Pig either, bra. You buy pig or pork in Kailua and bring em' back to Honolulu and you goin' be takin' pig\/pork on da kine, Pali Highway. First thing goin' happen is yo' car goin' stall right on da highway, bra. Next da night marchers goin' carjack your car. Then Madam pele and da limu lady - two of da baddest tittas on da island goin' take you to Morgan's corner and bang yo' head on the 13 steps, bra. By da time they done with you, you goin' forget about evah callin' it Kailua pig. It's Kalua, bra. Ok bruddah. Enough of the public service announcements. Dis place stay in one mall next to one Barnes and Nobles. I went come here plenty times. One pake family stay run this place and they do one pretty good job of making island kine plate lunches. Fo' me L&L in North Phoenix is still da best but when I no like drive too far this stay second best. I usually get one of da combo meals, bra - that's the way to go. This blala gives dis place the big shaka sign. Bettah than pig. Bettah than poi. I no shit you. Best Hawaiian food this part of town, bra. One thing - da guy who take da order, bra, he never say nothing. I think he stay da kine - android from Kikaida. I no say nothing bumbai he turn into da kine - red mask and blue suit and chase me out of da store with one spear shouting \"git 'em! git 'em!\"
