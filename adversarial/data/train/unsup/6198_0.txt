The original Hussong's in Ensenada claims to have invented the margarita. Hussong's Las Vegas actually has a vegan menu. These two factors are what prompted us to give this place a try on a Sunday afternoon.\n\nWe weren't hungry enough for full meals, so we sat at the bar. We decided to share a Stacked Quesadilla. I wasn't driving home so I ordered a margarita.\n\nI don't know if they would recognize this quesadilla in Baja, but it was surprisingly tasty. If you've never tried Gardein Chick'n Strips, they taste remarkably similar to crispy fried chicken. I'm not sure what else was so flavorful (maybe the Pico de Gallo?) but we were both happy with the quesadilla and I would definitely order this again.\n\nI also don't know how the margarita would pass muster. I got the Original, which came in a pint glass instead of a margarita glass. Is this how they serve them in Ensenada? Not bad, but I've had better. They claimed to use Sauza Blue Reposado tequila and fresh squeezed lime juice. If true, I could have used more tequila. Maybe I'm spoiled by my own margaritas. It was pretty refreshing, though, and deceptively strong. Maybe I'll try a Cadillac or El Pepino next time.\n\nThanks, Hussong's, for serving Gardein products. Vegan Mexican food isn't easy to come by, and you do it right!\n\nSuggestion: serve some dishes with soyrizo!
