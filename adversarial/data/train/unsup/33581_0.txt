IMO the BEST sushi burrito spot in town. Super fresh sushi and the staff get it right! Love the Angry Tuna is my favorite: Ahi Tuna, Lettuce, Red Onion, Jalape√±o, Masago, Cucumber, Crispy Wonton Strips, Seaweed Salad, Avocado, Sesame Soy. I just change the sesame soy to spicy mayo and its PERFECT!!! This is my go to for lunch.
