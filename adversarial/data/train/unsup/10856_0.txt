I've taken several trips to Las Vegas since I turned 21. I finally found my way downtown on my last trip, with a skeptical husband in tow.\n\nI should've known something was up when our cab driver told us to get out of there before 1AM. Apparently, that's when the Experience ends, the hotels' security goes home, and it gets dangerous on the streets.\n\nWhen we got there, the light shows hadn't started yet. I didn't care. I wanted to run back to the Strip. There were lots and lots of seedy folks outside, many of whom were staring at all the passersby. Even though it was still light out, and I had a large male by my side, I felt myself tensing up and clutching my purse a little tighter. Did I mention that I'm an urban girl who's used to seedy areas, including downtown Reno? Yeah, this was not good.\n\nWe walked around the area, popped into the Golden Nugget (that in itself seemed kinda cool), stopped at Fremont for Dunkin Donuts (separate review), went back to the Nugget, grabbed a cab, and got the hell out. The light show wasn't worth waiting for.
