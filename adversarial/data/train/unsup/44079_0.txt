The pizza was good and priced well for a big slice. I had one issue with not knowing how long the pizza had been sitting out, but since many establishments do that, I figured it was okay. The problem was with the staff. While we were eating there, we noticed three employees and all were on their cell phones. One guy was talking on cell phone, while leaning over the pizza, probably spitting on the food while he was talking. It was enough to gross me out and not go back.
