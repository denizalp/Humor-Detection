I didn't know there was a Pink's in Vegas and so when I walked by, I just had to stop in. \n\nIt was packed in the outside seating area but the counter was free so there wasn't too bad of a wait and finding a table worked out pretty well too. \n\nI went with the Planet Hollywood Dog because the combo of bacon, nacho cheese and other grilled goodness was just too hard to pass up. \n\nWhen I got my food, there was no way to eat this thing with my hands, had to fork and knife-up for this one.\n\nWhile cutting through my first piece of deliciousness my knife melted at the steaming cheese and scorching hot polish dog. The knife was a mangled mess but fortunately my food was still intact...and what does my dumbass do?? I take a big ole bite of that crazy hot polish dog and burn the living bejesus out of my tongue!!! (all my fault too, but I just couldn't wait)\n\nAnyways... from what I was able to taste, the Planet Hollywood Dog was very flavorful and definitely filling. It was your typical gut-bomb type of food but do would you expect anything different??\n\nJust make sure to let it cool down a bit if it melts any of your utensils before taking a bite LOL.
