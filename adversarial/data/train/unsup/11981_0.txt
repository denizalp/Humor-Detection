Wow.\n\nI got to visit this buffet during one of my work related lunches, and I... I just didn't know.  I JUST DIDN'T KNOW!\n\nBuffets are a dime a dozen here in Vegas.  Some of great.  Delicious, in fact.  And some are like eating the dollar \"value\" aisle from the grocery store.  Bacchanal Buffet is incredible.  In fact, I'll go on record in saying that it's the best buffet that I've had here in Vegas.\n\nThe food choices are more diverse and plentiful.  They had some surprisingly exotic foods to sample here.  Not too many buffets here serve quail eggs, for one.  But the more standard beef, chicken, seafood fare was all excellently prepared, and stylishly done.\n\nThe buffet itself has a nice, modern, low-key vibe to it.  Everything is very clean and minimalistic in style, but it's very nice in presentation.  The staff was very accommodating, and quick to meet any need.\n\nAnd then the desserts.  Holy cow.  It's like strolling into the \"previews\" section of Willy Wonka's factory.  I'm not a huge dessert enthusiast per se, but everything is presented is such an eye tantalizing way that I had to sample a few of these exotic treats.  Being full, they proved to be my undoing, and I had to call \"Full\", but man, was it a wonderful, yet brief, journey.\n\nIs Bacchanal Buffet worth the hype?  Yes.  It's a bit pricey, but \"you get what you pay for\", and what you get can be greater than what you expected.\n\nWell worth a meal here.  It's delicious.
