Gave Karla a few chances thinking it would be better the next time. Very aggressive technique, rips the same piece of skin over and over again until it's red and raw instead of using tweezers. Lots of strays left each time. Unfortunate because she's very sweet and close to home. She was always fair with her pricing and I loved the tea tree oil\/cream\/hand sanitizer and privacy provided. I will not be returning. Brazillians are not supposed to be that painful!
