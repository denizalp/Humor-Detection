I've consistently used Southland for about 10 years, as they were located next to my office at Southport and were located on my walk to the shuttle parking lot on Horton Road. In the interest of full disclosure, I must admit I used them for convenience in that sense since I was walking right past. Previously I had used the registry at Southland Co-op. As another reviewer pointed out, very few registries get top marks for friendliness. I've also used the registry offices at North-Hill mall at least once, and most recently a dismal interaction at Shawnessy Licence & Registry, and so have some means of comparison. \n\nMostly, I think if you go in with your eyes open, and follow instructions, you are going to be ok. Southland requires you to take a number. I take a number. I have my license, registration, insurance with me. I don't make a lot of small talk or try to be funny. This is not part of the experience. To that end, I get my business accomplished relatively quickly and painlessly. The staff are not there to entertain me, but get me through a mundane process, and to that, they accomplish the task without dehumanizing me, which is all I require of them. I have actually been impressed by the efficiency with which they process the work once I'm up at the counter. For that reason, I recommend them. I like that I can pay via different methods (something other places don't necessarily permit), and I may be exaggerating the sterility of the interactions. I seem to recall a little banter, or being asked to redo a photo, etc.\n\nGood service, and probably the best of the several other registries I've tried.
