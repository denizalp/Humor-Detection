I ate at Bellagio Dinner Buffet during weekday w\/MyVegas BOGO dinner $38.92 with no lines at 5pm.  By 6pm, the buffet place got busy with people waiting in lines or kids running around while their parents have no care in the world.  I am glad we got a table close to the buffet station near the cheese area.  Our waiter was pleasant and very good on refills.  During dinner time, kobe steak, prime rib, roasted chicken, turkey, chorizo sausages, ham, crab legs, cray fish, Mexican tacos, fried rice, chow mein, bbq buns, mash potatoes, polenta, salad, soup, pizza, broccolini, etc.  I think there wasn't enough Italian food, Mexican food.  They need to add gelato or ice cream to the dessert area.  I do like their petite brownie and pecan tart was good.  Overall, my experience at Bellagio buffet is average.
