I always love going here. It's a candy store that has I think what is every Jelly Belly jelly bean individual flavor. I always get the Banana, Kiwi and Coconut. I find things like Sprees that I can't get in the States. They have older candy as well. Cost is pretty good but I end up spending $7 on two scoops of jelly beans... oh well, it's Easter time!
