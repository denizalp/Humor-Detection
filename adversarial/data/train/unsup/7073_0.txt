Shady company.. \n\nThoroughly go through every thing before you buy.. Just received an autographed football.. signature was so faded I'm scared to touch it, much less be proud of show it off.. Their return policy states only will help with \"grossly misrepresented\" merchandise..\n\nShipping charges and \"fees\" will cost you a ton.. I left a bad review on another site for an auction I won, then after three weeks was told that auction didn't exist.. was given a $25 credit just to change my review.. \n\nShady place.. Would look elsewhere before here..
