Don't come here.  Really.  Please don't.\n\nBecause the food is delicious and the atmosphere is homey and cozy and warm and if you come one time, you're just going to want to come back again and again and then I will have to wait even longer to eat my delicious chocolate croissant or my squash omelet.  \n\nOr at least have the decency to wait until I'm out of town.
