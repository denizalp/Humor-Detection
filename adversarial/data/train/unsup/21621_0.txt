Hey Girl. I know what you're thinking, but this place lives up to the hype and just wants to make you feel good. Plus this pie is a feminist.* \n\nI don't live east, and I rarely make it out that way, so it took me a while to bite into this thick beauty. My good pal Kent P brought me their famous Soppressata Marmalade, and though I'll prob go for something more salty and less sweet next time, I recognize a perfect pizza when I bite into one.\n\n*No idea if this pie or this establishment would identify as feminist, but most things I love this dearly are feminist, so I'm making an educated guess.
