Mac and Cheese is pretty fantastic. Ambiance is elegant. Interesting drink menu. Service was good. Price to value, not so good.\n\nThey asked me if I would like still or sparkeling water, just me, and no one else. I said still. They bring out a bottle of voss water and fill everyones glass. They were very eager to refill our glasses with each sip. The bill comes and we notice it's $81 more than we expected. Upon second look we noticed we had been charged for 9 bottles of voss water at $9.00 a bottle. This charge in addition to our $15 cocktails was a bit of a shocker. Expensive lesson learned.
