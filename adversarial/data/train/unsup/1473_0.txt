Late night dim sum - check\nPlastic table cloth - check\nAverage service - check\n\nI had a pretty good experience here.  Bright Pearl was closed, so we just walked across the street to this joint.  I'm a fan of any place serving dim sum late, so there's a win right there.  In a city with 5-6 different Chinatowns, It's pretty much your run-of-the-mill restaurant for chinese food.  \n\nWe got full on $20, it's pretty cheap. Not the most righteous food I've ever had, but I was glad for late night dim sum that wasn't terrible.  The siu mai, the buns, the dumplings, all solid offerings.\n\nStaff was friendly, but slow at times. \n\nPretty boring review.
