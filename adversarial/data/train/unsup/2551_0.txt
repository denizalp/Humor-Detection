A light inspired song\nsilken reverie\ninvite to sing a long\nfrom scented memory\n- Olivia L.\n\nA Thai restaurant with some Hawaiian options and a few Thai\/Hawaiian fusion options, Plumeria Thai Cafe is a little take out spot at Rainbow and Cheyenne with a few tables for those interested in eating there...but at its core it's a spot for take-out.\n\nThe special thing about Plumeria is that you can taste the love. There are nicer Thai spots around, there are more traditional Thai spots around, I would even suggest that there are better Thai spots for my Thai preferences, but there is certainly not a place where dishes are made with more love...and that beautiful fact keeps me coming back. I usually order the Red Peanut (Panang) Curry...either with chicken or veggies, but have enjoyed their Pad Ki Mao (Thai Drunkards Noodles) and Yellow Curry (Gaeng Luang) on numerous occasions.\n\nPlumeria makes it easy to order ahead by calling or going to their website. They even deliver in their area. If you to come in and order you can usually pass the time talking with Rodney. Rodney is from Hawaii and brings a genuine welcoming presence to the space. His wife is Thai, and may peak her head out of the kitchen with a beautiful smile if it's slow, but usually demonstrates her welcoming spirit with her wonderful cooking.\n\nIn the end, I'm a fan, but it is certainly worth checking out yourself to decide if it's a great option for you too.
