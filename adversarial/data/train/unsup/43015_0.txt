Laid out like any other one story Kohls...mens on one side and womens covering almost the rest of the entire store.  Well maybe a little space for housewares, shoes, and kids.\n\nLike Adam, I like Kohls for the tall men's items but I don't particularly care for this store's location.  Windsor Square is just such an odd shopping center.\n\nAnyway, another thing I didn't like today is being asked for for my email address at the checkout.  Probably more because of how it was asked.  There was no discussion on why they wanted my email address, I just got asked, \"What is your email address?\".   Is privacy of no concern to people these days?  I get enough email spam these days that I don't need to be on your list.  Sorry
