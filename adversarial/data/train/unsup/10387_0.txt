My family and I enjoyed ourselves at First Friday. We snagged free parking @ 6pm, and walked towards the festivities. We started at Roosevelt and Central and followed the crowd towards 7th.  There were lots of talented local artists with tents and\/or tables set up, selling their jewelry, crafts, and fine arts. \n\nThere were a handful of food trucks in the area where we were, including 2 fry bread trucks, and lots of cheese-themed trucks. As a vegan, there wasn't a lot for me (sad face) but I did enjoy a huge pile of curly fries from one of the trucks (whose name escapes me). \n\nThere were several street musicians and magicians (e.g. the dudes doing the hypnosis... No thanks! lol). We thoroughly enjoyed the band, Color 8, so much so that we stayed about an hour watching them. \n\nA special shout out and thank you to the Phoenix PD. They were out there in full force, enforcing traffic laws, making sure both pedestrians and motorist obeyed those laws, keeping everyone safe.
