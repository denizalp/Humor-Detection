I was working at a seminar that was held and the hotel and I needed a manicure BADLY. I stopped by with hardly any notice on a Sunday morning when I arrived at the hotel and the lady who did my nails was very sweet. It wasn't cheap, but hey I was at a hotel in Vegas. lol. It was 30 for the manicure and she did a pretty good job.\n\nIf you need one badly, I would recommend.
