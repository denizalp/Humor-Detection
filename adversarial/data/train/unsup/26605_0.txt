This is the go-to place to celebrate special events for my husband and I. We have dined here numerous times and each time exceeds our expectations a bit more! \n\nChef Alexander is very accomidating, I have a gluten allergy and he is willing to make changes to accomidate my allergy for any dish. I love that I can eat here and have no worries about will I be sick tomorrow?!  \n\nThe menu changes seasonally and there are always daily specials, which I highly reccommend. Several times we have dined at Zebra and the fish special is something that the Chef has caught himself on the coast. We have tried numerous appetizers but I always gravitate toward the mussels with kaffir lime, my husband loves the charcuterie plate. As far as entrees, we have had sea badd, shark, waygu beef, lamb, and scallops, all dishes have been cooked and seasoned to perfection. We never miss a chance to split a creme brulee, and Zebra's is fabulous. The souffle is excellent according to my husband, and don't miss the salted caramel ice cream if it is featured.\n\nThe wine list is extensive, the staff is very knowledgeable about pairings. Although I am yet to attend one, Zebra offers a wine tasting on Fridays and seems to be very popular as we have arrived near the end of the tastings.\n\nThe service is top notch and not over bearing. Zebra is truley a gem within the Queen City and should not be missed!
