This is a must go to and a must see on any Montrealer worthy of being called one, love the events whether in the summer or fall it's a great place to be and take pictures or draw or walk around or for a quiet time with friends or family! K loved going for the Asian inspired events! One was called mosaiculture or something! All this to say it was nice
