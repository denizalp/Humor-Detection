My favorite new Asian market!\n\nLocated right on Monona Drive, it shares the same strip as Rosie's Coffee Bar & Bakery.\n\nWhen you walk in, you'll notice straight away how bright and clean the aisles are. There are no putrid smells, unlike most Asian markets (hey, when you carry live crustaceans, that tends to happen, amiright? - it's a give and take).\n\nAll the shelves are nicely stocked, properly labeled. There are rows and rows of frozen  goods, neatly packaged produce, ethnic drinks (basil seed mango juice anyone?), spices, snacks, and there is a little deli cooler with freshly made spring rolls in rice paper, mochi, and bahn mi.\n\nOh and if you love Sriracha, they carry Sriracha flavored potato chips here! \n\nI also bought some authentic China (Made in China!) because they were $3.49 and super cute.\n\nSeriously, come check this place out! The proprietor is super nice and attentive. If you need something for your adventurous recipe or just have some time to kill, stop in and see what you'll find!
