Over our summer visit, we knew this was a destination. But it's ride, not the destination? Haaaaa...\n\nSpeaking of the ride, we rented a couple city bikes by the foot of the hill and started trecking up the hill to the optimal 'oo-ing and ahh-ing' spot. About 20 minutes in... we realized we didn't know how long it would take. I did know at that point that I had already sweated off what little makeup and dry shampoo I had on so I was in it to win it. ...it took about 42 minutes going slowly uphill. (Make sure you understand you'll pay a late fee on getting that city rental bike back down.) \n\nThe pathway was mostly shaded by arching trees and the view up top totally would make anyone feel glorious.
