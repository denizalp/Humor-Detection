My hubby really wanted to try the waffles so one blustery and gray Pittsburgh Saturday we decided to go and try. I have wanted to try WI for a while now and just didn't get there so now that they are so close, makes it very easy. I checked the no wait app and there was no wait. Onward we went. There was a line but there was a huge party waiting to be seated. It took a few minutes but it was not bad and once we got to the host stand we were immediately seated. I have to say, unfortunately our waitress was not good. She walked back and fourth a few times before bringing our coffee. Making excuses. Then she brought the wrong meal for my husband blaming the kitchen. Never asked my hubby if he needed a water refill. Then she brought the check and did not even ask if dessert was in our future. Thankfully the food was great (the only reason this gets a 4and not a 5, our waitress). The waffles light and fluffy and the toppings we got were wow, just wow! And there are so many choices. I chose the chicken and waffles. I didn't even need syrup on it. The waffle with its pecans, light and fluffy. The fried chicken tenders on top were sweet, tender, and a little crispy. The hubby chose the sausage gravy and waffles, double portion which didn't look like a double but who are we. But the sausage gravy was seasoned wonderfully with nice big  chunks of sausage. Overall, the food is delicious. Our waitress was not good. But I would and we will certainly go back.
