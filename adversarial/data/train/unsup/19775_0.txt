The Arizona Railway Museum is a fun afternoon for kids all ages.  That includes those who ask for Senior Citizens discounts!\n\nIf you have ever been to other railway museums like Union Illinois, the setup here at Arizona Railway Museum is similar, though more modest. They have a very large collection of rolling stock. Along with one of the largest Union Pacific fleets outside of a UP's train yard. It's a very impressive and kids get to have an up close, hands on experience!\n\nAs I mentioned in my Yelp Tip, admission is a reasonable $2.00 and they're only opened on weekends, from Noon until 4:00 pm. The gift store is also well stocked with train magazines, train whistles, old time engineer hats and other collectibles. \n\nWhat's really nice are all the enthusiasts who volunteer here who are willing to share their love for trains, along with the history of railroading. \n\nWhen you are done, plan to stop at Roy's Train World. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/roys-train-world-mesa#hrid:hwZIL_Nby6LbKvw6paeUQw  It's just a few short miles up the road, at 1033 S Country Club Drive in Mesa. They carry various HO, O and N gauge models of everything you'll see here \n\nBTW, don't forget to bring your camera.\n\nEnjoy!
