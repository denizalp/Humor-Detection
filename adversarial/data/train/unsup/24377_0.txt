\"Section 74.05 of the Competition Act is a civil provision. It prohibits the sale or rent of a product at a price higher than its advertised price.\"\n\nThe Corned Beef house was hands down the worst dining experience I've ever had. A few buddies and I went to the corned beef house and attempted the challenge- if you dont complete it, both the website and the signs in the building say the sandwich is 29.95. The waitress tried to tell us that its actually 3995- to which we said, hey, the advertised price is 29.95, thats how much we have to pay. She then tried to charge me the 3995, to which I repeated that they must honor the advertised price. At this point, the chef came out yelling profanities- he called me a \"fucking snake\" and told me both that he didnt care about the extra $10 and then to shove the $10 up my ass. He yelled at me for about 5 minutes in front of both my friends and other patrons, screaming insults and profanities.\n\nI will never go here again, ever. I cant believe I was called a thief and a snake as a paying customer that merely asked for Corned Beef House to honor their advertised pricing. I cannot support any business that will engage in both underhanded behaviour to avoid honoring their prices and then will abuse paying customers. I will be posting this review in as many forums as I can- people need to know about this experience. Are the people running this business aware that their employees are acting in this fashion to customers- previously I was happy with my meal and the quality of the food, and would have returned. I would like an apology for the service I have received and I think you would do well to rid yourselves of such an abusive employee. \n\nPlease avoid at all costs as a consumer and take your business to restaurants that value their customers and will honor their legal obligations.
