I still do like this place. But today I've been told, when I asked them a bit of hot milk to warm up my drink coz I took a large size and did not finish it before it got cold, that they do not WASTE milk to do that ?\nI never had any problems in any coffee before for some milk, so I am a bit insulted, paying over 5$ for a drink and they won't give me some hot milk. They did offer to put it in the microwave. \n\n_______ \n\nThis was my previous 5\/5 review. \n\nI really like this coffee.\nThey have delicious pastries and some choices for lunch.\nyour matcha   latte tea is really good !!\n\nFree wifi.\nWide tables to work on. Bonne ambiance, quiet.\nParking is easy in collateral streets.\n\nI did not notice before I went there but you can also reserve tables in advance.\n\nWe went there as a group x five ppl on a Saturday morning and did not have difficulty finding a table for 1030. By lunchtime it got quite busy though.\n\nOnly thing is that they close early week time: 6 pm, which is a bit less convenient for students.
