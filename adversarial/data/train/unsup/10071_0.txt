Please stop giving this place good reviews! Just because you ate dog food back home in Detroit doesn't mean it's good! It smelt like a portapoty inside and I walked out literally smelling like a fry cook. If you decide to eat there please make sure you eat outside. You might enjoy your dog food a little bit more.
