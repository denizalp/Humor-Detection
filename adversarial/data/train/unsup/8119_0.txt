Hot little spot in the midst of THE Fremont Street Experience. \nWe were starving and even with all there is to do and see in this wild town sometimes you need that late night pizza slice. \nThe pizza was delicious, the drinks cold and the service is excellent. It's just a bit divey and full of fun characters ... and Evel Knieval stuff but what else could you want!
