Craft cocktails are always a welcome treat. Craft cocktails served by a cool waitress\/bartender are even better. Craft cocktails served by a cool waitress\/bartender while listening to awesome music is the best. Philemon is a lot of fun. I can see how\/if the place was packed that it might not be fun but most places, when packed, are not a lot of fun. Lucky for me and my friends, we came on a quiet Sunday night and enjoyed all the space and (relative) quiet that we liked. Well, if you count listening to dance and new wave as quiet. I do and it's fantastic!\n\nKnowing that PB was known for its libations, I started with a #7. The drinks are numbered and grouped by spirit. I'm all for drinks with a sweeter tinge to them (and not to say that this drink was like drinking a soda) but the experience was a bit beige for me. That's when Naomi, our waitress\/bartender, swooped in to action and told me that I should have ordered an Old Fashioned. I let her know that I'm from Kentucky and was Old Fashioned\/bourboned out. She scoffed and said I'd never tasted one of hers. Intrigued, I ordered one and, true enough, I loved her take on an Old Fashioned. I don't know whether it was the bourbon, the bitters, the fruit, or the simple syrup\/sugar, but the drink was as good as I've had and not at all humdrum. Vindicated, she told me that I should always trust her. I became a believer that evening. Trust in the cocktail powers (and infectious awesomeness) of Naomi. Now you know.
