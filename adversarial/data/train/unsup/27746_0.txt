Lunch here was simply fabulous.  We ordered the following:  chicken Milanese w\/ arugula & mashed potatoes -- tender & moist; Campanelle with a generous serving of salmon slices & asparagus -- perfect balance of lemon and cream is my favorite; and Ni√ßoise salad with a huge serving of fresh tuna -- one of the best versions I've ever had in all my 58 years on this planet.\nMeliya, thank you for such attentive service and your pretty smile.  \nDo yourselves a favor and try this 2 month old addition to the Scottsdale scene.  The chefs take their craft seriously!
