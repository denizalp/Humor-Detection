Amazing low prices for fresh really good food.\n\nThis is a clean casual little place were you order at the counter and seat yourself.\n\nAs we were ordering the cashier hands us some cream of zucchini soup to try. It was a nice surprise and I have to say it was really good.\n\nWe ordered two plates of tacos the 1\/2 Lb Ribeye (4 tacos $6.99) and the Pescado (3 tacos $7.49) Both plates came out nicely presented with a Grilled Mexican Onion, Blistered Chili, and Sauces. Everything was tasty and everything was fresh. They have a condiment bar and I really enjoyed adding the pickled onions to the Ribeye taco.\n\nThis place seems very solid.
