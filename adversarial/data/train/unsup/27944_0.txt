Actually a pretty decent dimsum place on the King Street strip if you're not willing to venture as far as Chinatown. It does feel a little odd to be eating this fare in a more bar-ish dimly-lit atmosphere but hey, doesn't detract from the quality of the food. Servers are friendly and attentive and the food comes out quickly. \n\nNote: Yes, you do pay for the tea.\n\nTried:\n+Singapore noodles\n+Meat Dumplings: Siu Mai\n+Sticky Rice In Lotus Leaf with Pork
