The RM Seafood is a really In place.  The greeters are indifferent.  The wait staff is indifferent, and the food was rather in definable.  \n\nThe 20 dollar carafe of wine was a quarter carafe.  \n\nThe wait staff put us near the front where other people would see us.  Only problem is that the other people were smoking and lighting up so that really bad smell blew in on us.\n\nThe really bread offering was a couple of very salty flat breads and two really tiny corn cakes.  The tiny, soggy bread sticks that came with our meal were very bad.\n\nAll in all the RM Seafood is a really In place.
