Yelpers are losing their marbles trying to figure out what the best ramen is in Las Vegas.  I'm not here to tell you that Fukumimi is better or worse than the next ramen spot.  I'm here to tell you that I had quite a pleasant experience here, and I would recommend you to come check it out.\n\nA lot of people recommend the tan tan men ramen, but spicy soups are not my style.  I went for the tonkotsu with soy I believe.  There is no menu online for me to confirm the exact name, but I got the soy based one as opposed to miso or salt or a spicier variation.  Chashu, green onion, and corn.  That is all I need.  I didn't feel like it was overly salty like some have mentioned.  I recommend the soy broth if you don't want to be so mainstream, delicious and simple, and more natural it seemed, as opposed to other flavorings.\n\nThe karaage is also a perfect appetizer.  It's like getting raisin canes from Japan!! (joke, although I am very fond of the Canes chain).\n\nThis restaurant will be successful.  The staff are very sweet and accommodating as well.  We were sitting next to another couple, and our server asked us if we wanted to move our table a little farther so we could have more privacy.  It's the little things, I like that.
