I have to admit, I walked up to this establishment with hesitation. My co-workers don't have the greatest taste in food and I was walking in blind (hadn't checked the Yelp). It looks a bit sketchy from the outside, but usually the hole in the walls are decent. So in I walked while quickly scanning reviews.\n\nIt's located on Sahara in the Smart & Final shopping center a couple businesses down from the Biscuits Café. \n\nOne of my co-workers has been frequenting this joint for 6 years is what I've been told. So the nice lady did not bother to give her a menu because she was getting the usual. I quickly scanned until I found the lunch specials. Lunch specials include your entrée choice, soup, low mein and fried or steamed rice. I decided to go with the Cashew nuts chicken and steamed rice. She provided us with a Styrofoam cup of arrowhead water that she kept cold and full the entire time. I wasn't totally keeping track, but the soup came first only about 2-5 minutes after taking our order and the food followed maybe 5-10 minutes after the soup. Food was extremely hot and totally delicious. I actually had to let it cool off before I stuffed my face. The one thing that stuck out the most for me was the chicken. It wasn't chewy and rubbery like I normally find while eating Chinese food. There was plenty of food in each portion, so much that I couldn't finish mine completely. \n\nThere was nothing negative about my visit. Fast, friendly and good food! I'm looking forward to trying it again!
