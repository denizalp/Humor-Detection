This is the worst Appliance Repair company in Vegas, if I could give them a zero I would.  DO NOT USE THEM UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.  I waited a 1 1\/2 weeks for LG to schedule them to come out on a Saturday.  The repair man Rodney came the last 15 minutes of my allotted time only to tell me that I need to defrost it first and to start defrosting my frig on Wednesday and he would be out the following Saturday and I agreed.  On Wednesday their office called I thought to confirm my appt. and I called them back the following day only to find out that I had no appointment scheduled and that they would not be out on Saturday I stated their employee promised they would be.  I was put on hold for 10 minutes or more only to be told basically that again they would not be out on Saturday.  The girl kept talking over me and then stated if I could be quiet   I stated no I was the customer and she needed to listen to my issue.  She said no she wouldn't listen to me and placed me again on hold.  I refuse to use them and have not spoken to them since.  Avoid a bad experience don't use them
