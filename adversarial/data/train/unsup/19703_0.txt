I came to this newly opened store to find a product that was sold out at the Sprouts near me. I'm glad I stopped in. This store is larger and well organized. The aisles are wide and everything is not crowded together. They have the same items and quality as other Sprouts Markets. They do have a nice salad bar in their deli section and a small section of tables to enjoy your salad and one of their homemade smoothies. I will be back when I need something my neighborhood Sprouts is out of. For those living in the area, you now have a really good Sprouts close by.
