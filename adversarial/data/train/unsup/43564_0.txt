I really wanted to like this place as I was told it was like a more gourmet version of Pieology.  I was starving but my wife ate more recently so we shared a pizza.  First complaint here is the per topping cost.  That is one of the biggest pluses of the build your own pizza joints... being able to go crazy on the toppings choices without having to worry about being charged $2 to add a few leaves of fresh basil on your pizza.\nSo a quick bout of drunken math concluded we might as well try one of their available specialty pies.  Forgot the one we picked but it had rosemary and ham.  \nThe pizza was good but didnt live up to my expectations of being worth the price premium over Pieology.  Also I ate this while starving and plenty of whiskey flowing through my veins... a cardboard box should have tasted really good at this point.
