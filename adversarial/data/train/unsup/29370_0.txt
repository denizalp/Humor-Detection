So I followed Trish over from the last nail place and have not looked back. The quality is amazing. She is very talented and is up for anything I or my friend throw at her. Rather it is custom drawn lace pattern, rhinestones, faces, or etc. she has done them all. The quality is nice and my nails actually last. I am at 3 weeks and not a rhinestone has fallen off. My toes where I got a classic french tip (no gel) don't have a single chip either. I have gone to other salons and my nails are chipped and peeling within a week. Have not had that problem here.\n\nI have not gotten eyelashes but my friend does and loves it as well. They also do eyebrow waxing and tattoo. This place is a little hidden gem and I recommend you come and try it yourself. \n\nSo worth it!
