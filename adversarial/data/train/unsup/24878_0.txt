A buddy wanted to see this show and who am I to say no to titties?  I left utterly confused after this show.  Being at the Rio, I expected a better venue.  It felt like a buddy hired a couple of strippers off of Craig's list and set up a show in his basement.  While the music was cool, the light show was a little intense.  Only one girl had a natural rack, all other's must have gotten theirs in a Tijuana alley.  When the intermission happened some guy came on stage and tried telling some jokes.  He wasn't even the listed comedian and sucked.  His whole act was based on one joke and it failed flatly.  The dancing wasn't all that good but the girls were trying.  When I left, I felt like I had just witnessed a train wreck.  Save your money, there are better options in Vegas.
