Yup that was me passed out on the chair by the pool!\n\nI was in love with this place from the front elevator door.  I love that feeling like I've been transported to a new place as the doors slide open.  \n\nI had a great hot stone massage, where I'm about 80% sure I started snoring.  I love the water under the glass steps, that is really just a great touch!  \n\nBy the time that ended I floated back down to the women's area where I spent an entire day!  I loved the chairs there, but I do wish they were heated.  I enjoyed the hot tub and I like the look of it but I do wish it was bit wider..nothing like looking at a naked stranger whilst relaxing (solved with cucumbers over the eyes...thanks strange naked lady!)\n\nI love the private bath tub areas...I mean what a great idea!\n\nAs I lay there in and out of sleep, the staff there made the best fruit punch (now if only they had put some rum in it!) and the brought it around to all the ladies and refilled my glass as I slept.  They may have even put a blanket on me that part is hazy :-)\n\nThere are so many great spa's in Vegas...but this one always stands out thanks to the great staff!  If the hot tub was wider I would have given it 5 stars...I have very strict rules on naked stranger time!
