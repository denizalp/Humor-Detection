I went in really wanting to like this place and did not have the best experience. When I got there I was greeted immediately which was really nice and I had a short wait. Unfortunately the downfall for me was the quality of my nails. I had never gotten the dip powder but she suggested it instead of gel and I don't know if it's the powder or if it was the technician but my nails are different colors in different areas and she hit my nail bed on two different fingers. I understand it's hard when doing someone's nails, but one is quite bad. She noticed something was not right with one of the nails and had a different person come and finish it. He fixed a few fingers with gel instead which I was appreciative of but the rest are still something that I am ashamed to have. I may try and go back just having a different person do my nails and sticking to the gel.
