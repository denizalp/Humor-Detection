My BAE and I had one of the best meals at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant located in the Paris Hotel. We had made reservations weeks in advance.\n\nA very romantic place where we had a window view of the Las Vegas Strip. From the hostess that guided us up the elevator to our waiter--the staff was so helpful and accommodating.\n\nWe started off with our regular Hennessy and two seafood platters. The platters included, lobster, crab, oysters and clams. The meat easily came out of the shells. I don't think I have ever had crab meat come out that easy. Very good start to our meal.\n\nThe filet mignon was cooked a perfect medium rare and accompanied by a side of (classic) potato gratin. \n\nWe finished our dinner with a pumpkin souffl√© and espressos. A very romantic and enjoyable time. Great food, date and view--what else can you ask for?
