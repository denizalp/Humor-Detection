We came back for a drink and a snack this afternoon.  This time, the service was fantastic.  The bartender could not have been better.  He was super friendly and he gave us really helpful suggestions.  The rose we had was great.  The gouges are to die for.  For us, food is always more important than service but it's nice to see that the service has gotten better over the last month.  We will definitely be back for dinner again soon.
