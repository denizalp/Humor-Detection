I first found SES on Nextdoor Neighbor. I decided to have Mike B. come out to our house to give us bids on various electrical projects we wanted done around our house. Mike came on time for our appointment. He was professional and polite. I appreciated how he took the time to listen to our wants and needs, even offering some suggestions. He is prompt in giving bids and is reasonably priced. He just completed our first project installing security outside lighting. We couldn't be happier! He started and finished in a timely manner. We plan on having Mike do many more electrical projects!
