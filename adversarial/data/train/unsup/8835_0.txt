Highly disappointed! Had a prix fix menu for a party of 20... messed up our orders. Chicken or fish, how hard is that? Then waitress came close to one in our party & drinks spilled off her tray. She told us WE need to apologize to the guest who's drink it was?!  Really? \nOne star for the waitress just because he was nice. Food not too good. Didn't eat the dessert... something wrong w that coz i'm all about dessert.
