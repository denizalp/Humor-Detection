I had a great time last weekend.  My hubby had been talking about Federal Pizza and I have been reading all the reviews, that I couldn't wait to visit.  We were worried we couldn't get a table, because I've heard the wait it a little long.  We decided ahead of time that we were going to sit at the bar.  When we got there, we valet, got inside and there were two seats open right in the middle of the bar area, score.  We ordered the Manifesto, and since lately I've been easing my way into beers, I asked for some advise and the recommendation was great, it was the Sierra Nevada Kellerweis, I liked it a lot.  My hubby had the Four Peaks one.  The place was buzzing with energy and the servers were working really hard.  It had been about 20 minutes after we ordered and I saw a pizza coming by, it went straight from us to another person at the bar who I thought had gotten there after us, hum, ok, maybe I didn't realize they were here.  Ten minutes later, a server\/manager? approached us and apologized for having given our pizza away and they made another one and they told us it was on them.  That was very classy, because I really didn't know it that pizza I saw go by was mine and they could have just said the kitchen was backed up.  Thank you again, Federal Pizza for being so aware and caring about your performance.  This was a Saturday early evening and there were people from every age range.  We also had the chopped salad which was delicious and for dessert my hubby had been raving about the berry cobbler.  I can't wait to come back.  I have so many items I want to try.
