I'm in from out of town and wanted to watch the Buffalo game while having lunch. I walked up to the bar and asked if it was on anywhere, was told no. I asked if they could put it on one of their many TVs and was again told no because the manager said the TVs were staying on the games they are already on. Now the place was not full by any means and I could have easily had the game out on one of the small TVs. But not even double checking is just lazy and terrible customer service. So here I am literally around the corner at Buffalo Wild Wings instead and I will be very reluctant to try them again over the next few weeks while I am here.
