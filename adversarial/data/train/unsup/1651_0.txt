Burger= double Whopper. Fries= meh. Location= superb. Whenever I don't have BK coupons, I can see myself returning.\n\nHow many guys does it take to make a burger in Lakewood? Five. One to drive everyone two blocks in his parents' crossover wagon with Sierra Club stickers. One to skateboard in front of the store on his break and fail at all tricks. One to sit around preaching about how he's going to attend OU and then feed all starving Africans with his 311 cover band's charity concert. One to leave early and make a boring YouTube video of his friends quoting Adult Swim cartoons at the T Bell drive thru, and one to microwave two Whoppers and slap them together without splashing mayo onto his gauged ears. Ta da!
