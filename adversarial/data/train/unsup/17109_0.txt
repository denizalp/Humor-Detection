They have the new menu out now with some great selections, flatbreads, sandwiches, appetizers, all amazing.  The staff here today are fast, friendly and really know how to make you feel welcome.\n\nWe had a party of 6 today, so we had 2 orders of the wings, they only offer 2 flatbreads now so we got one of each for the table and then some vegan sushi and some regular sushi.\n\nEverything was amazing, the only point I can make is that the wings were not hot when they came to the table, they were cooked but had been sitting around before being served.\n\nLike last time some sushi rolls were well made and some were very sad looking but overall everything was great, the price is right and we will be back.\n\nThe one thing I especially like is a girl kept coming around to check on our drinks which is a huge plus in a restaurant.  Our glasses were never empty that's how good the staff was today.\n\nThey work hard and try their best to make you feel comfortable and it was a great experience.  They have specials running all month so go check them out.
