11\/28\/14: PLEASE let me save you from coming here!--TOURIST TRAP of the worst kind!  DÃ©cor is very trendy and artistic.  Looks beautiful in a dark and mysterious way.  Well, the parts you can see anyway cause this is probably one of the darkest lit restaurants I have ever been to.  Tip: Use the flash on your phone to read the menu.  Well, as I was saying, it looks and feels like a heavily themed Disneyland ride, though a beautiful one,... and that's what you get with the food too: described to be luxurious on the menu with prices to reinforce, but served up cardboard.\n\n1. Moscow Mule $18: Says on the menu it's made up of vodka, lime, and ginger beer... and whadya know... it tastes just like that.  Yes, that's right, go home and mix your own vodka, lime, and beer and you got the same dang thing.  ZERO complexity.  Tastes fine as a girly drink--but you don't pay $18 for a cocktail you drink at your cheap company's holiday bash.  1\/10.\n\n2. Salmon Pizza $21: Crap.  Utter crap.  I don't care if it has little tiny dabs of caviar and is covered in salmon.  The bread is a tasteless piece of cardboard, and this dish is hardly deserving of your hard-earned money.  1\/10.\n\n3. Bone-In Ribeye Tomahawk $58: Straight up LIE.  It says \"24 Ounce, 2 Signature Sauces\" as a description.  Look... I've had honest 18oz steaks that I could barely finish, ...this is NOT 24oz.  I wolfed it cause it tastes good, but was still plenty hungry.  Note that this steak is extremely marinated--like it's completely saturated with some kind of marinade which really covers up the natural meat taste.  Yeah, I'd say it tastes good, but for $58, you don't pay for a plate of marinade.  $58 will buy you an amazing steak at Mastro's or Alexander's... this place has no right to serve this crap at that price.  3\/10.\n\n4. Bread Pudding $9: OMG, one sanely priced item.  Too bad it doesn't taste that great.  Your local diner will probably serve better.  Well on that note, there is one curiosity--do I spy Captain Crunch Cereal covering the dish!?!?  (See my pictures!--seriously.) I don't get it.  I mean, did they attempt to try to make Captain Crunch in-house?--or is that really the stuff you buy at the super market?  Well, if they made it, it sure tastes like Captain Crunch.  Would an ultra-high-end fancy-pants I-got-$300-caviar restaurant dare put Captain Crunch on a dessert???  Sigh... 4\/10.\n\nIf you think I'm just joking around and you think the current 4-stars it has on Yelp could be correct... go right ahead.  Just promise me you'll get the bread pudding and ask for some milk--tell the waiter that you will need it to go with your cereal.\n\n1\/5.\n\n#Russian #vegas #overpriced #avoid #touristtrap
