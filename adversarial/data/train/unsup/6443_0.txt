RECOMMENDED\n\nIn the past, one of my most agonizing experiences upon arrival at McCarran was to enter the rental facility after an endless five plus hour flight from JFK and observe endless lines at my chosen rental car vendor.Since I decided to spend a few more bucks with Avis, this has not been happening during the course of my last four or five visits to LV.\n\nOn Tuesday, 7\/19\/16, I arrived at the Avis Rental A Car here and pleasantly observed only a single person waiting on line ahead of me. A nice young lady summoned me to her station promptly. I will not name her because she made me very happy by not going through the typical BS  hard sell annoyances. Her corporate bosses may not like that as much as I did.\n\nI asked for an American car, not because I'm patriotic but I'm idiotic to the extent that I prefer familiar things. I like it when I don't have to ask someone how to open up the gas tank when I try to fill up the rental upon its return.The counter lady politely tried to upsell me to a Ford Mustang for an extra charge. I politely declined.\n\nThe counter lady did not try to sell me the ripoff insurance. Hurray!! She did not try to sell me the ripoff gas option. Bravo!! She did upgrade me to the Ford Mustang at no extra charge. Yippee!!\n\nDid I already say......I LOVE AVIS!!!!
