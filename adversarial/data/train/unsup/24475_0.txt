This is a great place to visit when you are in Scottsdale, AZ.  We were on a vacation trip from California to Arizona.  This was one place we had to see.  In fact, we had to spend two days here before we saw everything.  When you pay to go in, they give you a headset so you can listen to the videos.  The place is set up for each contenent of the world, then by each conuntry in that contenent.  When you walk to see a country, the headset activates and you can hear the video that is playing on the monitor.  There is an example on one of my pictures.  We also liked the kids section of the museum.  In here you can play lots of different instraments from different parts of the world.
