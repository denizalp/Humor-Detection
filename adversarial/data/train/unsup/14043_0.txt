Here's the story: \n\nWe bought a natural gas grill for our new house on Sunday morning. The line was already in place so we figured it would just be a few snaps and we'd be on our way to delicious grilled meats--- we were wrong. \n\nThe connection from the grill was not the same size as the line. At a loss for what to do we searched the internet trying to find out how to fix it, nothing; went to Home Depot to try and get help, nothing. We called Weber and they said we need to call a plumber. At this point it's 5:00 on a Sunday, the reality is setting in that we will most likely not be enjoying grilled meats for a few days. \n\nAs a last ditch idea I quickly searched plumbers on my Yelp app and Mike the Plumber was the first one that showed up. I gave my husband the number thinking we would receive an answering service- nope. The phone was answered by Mike's wife and after a 10 min conversation, Mike was on his way to our house, one a Sunday evening! \n\nMike and his wife (they are a team- he does the work and she does the billing and serves as his \"helper\") showed up, he looked at the connection and within a few mins said that he was off to Home Depot for a part and that he would be able to fix it!! \n\nOff they went and a few minutes later they were back with the part and within a few more minutes it was working, the grill was working and all of my dreams of grilled meats were coming true! \n\nFor what I consider a very reasonable $80 the grill was hooked up on a Sunday evening and I was not forced to wait to fulfill my craving. And to top it all off Mike and his wife are super friendly which made the experience that much better! \n\nHopefully I won't find myself in need a plumber again anytime soon, but if I did, I wouldn't hesitate to use Mike!
