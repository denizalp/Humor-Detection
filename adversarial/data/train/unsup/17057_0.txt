One man's trash is another man's treasure and sometimes one man's 3 star review is another girls 5 star! \n\nI wanted French toast and I wanted it bad and no frozen French toast sticks would not suffice. At 11:00am on a Wednesday this diner was poppin' to say the very least.\n\nI had French toast with powered sugar only, corn beef hash and chorizo patties. \n\nI was so pleased with myself for getting the chorizo patties they were spicy and a great kick start to the day.   My corn beef hash was barely on the table for 2 minutes before it was devoured. \n\nCall me a pig , but one thing that Pamela's in Oakland has over the Strip district local hot co-ed waitresses!!!  \n\nGreat greasy food, fast service and cheerful environment.
