Too much hassles with parking and why does every mall have those annoying Isreali women putting stuff on your hands. Also more annoying people trying to get you to donate and adopt some foreign kid and give away your money to who knows what company. Food court is too cramped and the stores are your average run of the mill junk with one exception on third floor being the Pepper palace. Tons of interesting sauces, salsas and powders up there and even a few guys whining after they tried the really hot sauce on display. Otherwise, you can find all this stuff without the hassles at any old mall in the area.
