Stopped in after looking on Yelp for someplace to eat. This is a very nice restaurant in a busy restaurant row in old downtown Chandler. People were friendly and the steaks were excellent. The side dishes, especially the asparagus, was out of season and very woody. Service was good but not five star, one server working several tables alone. Five star requires water runners and other assistants. Anyway, we will definitely go back. Budget $40 a person for steak or seafood without any appetizer or dessert. Other choices can be had for a little less. It would be easy to spend $55-$60 if you add courses or wine.
