WOOOOO! Snap'into'a'sparerib! \n\nThe newspaper clipping with a photo of the former and much younger Ric Flair posing for a pic with the owners of this shop on the wall gave us something to read while waiting for our takeout order. \nThey provide excellent reading light - it's damn bright in there. \nWe also spotted a board advertising they had received the award for top 100 Chinese restaurants, Um? Who judges these things? And then again what year? \n\nThey have a few tables inside the VERY small restaurant. Few=three. They also deliver. \n\nWhile I am a sucker for a mom & pop shop which this one seems to be, I don't know bout this one. \n\nI'll make this short and include photos. If the food taste half as good as the pictures look , we would have been pleased. \n\nWhen the spare rib bag was torn open, we thought they looked delicious. Not so much. They were actually very, very dry and tough as if they had been reheated 100 times (hence my opening line).Same goes for the appetizer of roast pork. If you can believe, it was even more dry then those spare ribs.That appetizer hardly deserves to be mentioned but I have a photo, so I had to. \n\nThe fried dumplings also looked good. Little dough covering the (small amount) of pork filling. The dipping sauce had no flavor AT ALL. That sucks, that's the best part of those things, the sauce! \n\nThe shrimp fried rice looked pretty good with green peas and carrots thrown in. Poor little puny shrimp. Not only were they small, they were mushy. They never stood a chance. The photo shows the size of the shrimp compared to a cute little pea (they must have changed quality since their website photo was taken). \n\nThe lo mein was meh. I had the house special. Includes (sparingly) shrimp (poor baby's) and chicken and some fatty beef. \n\nThey do seem to have a number of tofu choices so if that's your thing you might have better luck. \n\nMy boyfriend and I both agree, nothing stood out enough for us to make a second visit. \n\nNOPE. Not even the photo of Ric Flair. WOOOOO!
