this place is pretty cool, right in the middle of crocker park.  stopped in during the afternoon for happy hour...tried the ahi tuna nachos, chicken egg rolls and drinks.\n\nfood was flavorful but nothing out of the ordinary.  drinks were kind of watered down. \n\nwhat really miffed me was that as a few more patrons came in, we got forgotten about.  i didn't think it would be that difficult to check in on us.  it sucks because i really wanted to try the lobster mac & cheese.  therefore, when our server came back, we just requested the check.\n\nit's a shame too because the place is really cozy, but the service left a lot to be desired.
