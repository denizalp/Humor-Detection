I have loved going to the Avenue ever since it opened as The Avenue Club and the Bubble Up Bar. The South Side on the East Side is my go to cocktail and the Short Rib Stroganoff WAS my go to entree. We made last minute reservations at The Avenue last weekend and were eagerly awaiting the incredibly tasty Stroganoff and was very disappointed to see that it was no longer on the menu. I substituted for an OK NY Strip. I REALLY hope they bring back the Stroganoff. That may or may not be a deal breaker regarding return visits.
