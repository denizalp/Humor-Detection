At this location a waitress named Kristin was very rude. My teammates and I were talking to each other about how we did not get our freckled lemonades in the special cup. She proceeded to walk up to our table and said with attitude, \"Are you sad you didn't get it in a special cup?\" I believe this attitude she gave us was disrespectful and should be addressed.\n\nBut I give the waiter Shannon 10 stars he had amazing service and was very kind
