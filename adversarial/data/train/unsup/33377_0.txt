Excellent customer service!  Called at 5 to make sure they had a motor in stock for my air conditioner, then rushed down to make it before closing at 6.  I was greeted by Eddie, who helped me with the necessary motor.  I brought the motor, fan, and cage in with me as I had no clue what was needed.  Eddie helped take the old motor out, put the new motor in, cut down the excess shaft length, all the while explaining what was wrong and how this would fix it.  In a short time I was out the door, feeling like I was a pro and ready to put it all back together.  Fantastic shop, full of knowledgeable people ready and willing to help any person who walks through their door, I can't recommend this store or Eddie enough, so thank you!
