This is yet another business you will find in the Sinclair Choice \"compound\" located on Windmill and Rainbow.\n\nWe pulled in this morning just for a simple oil change. The guys working there were probably the friendliest I've ever encountered while going to get my oil changed! I was really impressed. What was more impressive is that the guys were saying that I still had another 2,000 miles to drive before I needed it done. Of course, they said they would do it if I wanted but that it wasn't totally necessary. I was blown away! It sometimes feels like most auto places will try to get you to do any service they can get you to approve just so they can squeeze some more money out of you!\n\nWe decided to get it done anyways, because I'd rather be safe than sorry. We decided to go try out Chili Verde Express (see separate review) while we waited for our quoted time of 15 minutes. (BTW, 15 minutes?? Wow that is quick!). \n\nThe prices for the oil changes range from $30-$60. We opted for one with synthetic oil that ran for $48. Not the cheapest around, but I am a firm believer in \"You get what you pay for\".\n\nWhile eating at Chili Verde they approached us to let us know it was ready to be picked up as soon as we were ready! Nice! You actually pay at the convenience store register and than walk over to get your keys. \n\nEven as we were leaving, everybody was friendly and smiling. Last thing he said was, \"We'll see you next time.\"\n\nYes. Yes, you will. \n\nWithout a doubt!\n\n4 stars.
