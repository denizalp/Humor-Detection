Nice digs! Being from Montana, the constant heat and sunshine was amazing and the pool area definitely helped. The gym is nice though I didn't get to use it because I was relegated to my hotel room with a respiratory infection and the flu but my wife did and enjoyed it. The gym also had free earbuds in case you forgot yours and complimentary apples for a healthy post-workout snack. The hotel is in a great location surrounded by shopping, restaurants and the AMC movie theater.\n\nThe only downside was our bed was too soft and because I was sleeping most of the days and nights, my back is now killing me but overall, the experience was good!
