I came here with a friend around 7:00 on a lovely summer evening. \n\nW Burger Bar was a pretty good venue for us. It is clean and well maintained. It has a pretty fun ambience and lots of TVs if you want to catch up on the latest sports game. \n\nOne thing that I didn't like was that the music was very loud, which made it difficult for us to hear each other and we often had to ask the other to repeat what was just said. \n\nOne aspect that I really liked (and appreciated) was the cheap drink menu! They have drink specials for each day of the week (Friday was a Long Island iced tea for $6.99). They also offer $2 shooters! Pretty hard to resist if you're looking to have a good time!\n\nMy friend ordered the potato skins and I had the house salad. Both were decent. Neither particularly stood out, but given the name 'Burger Bar' it's not fair to judge them on dishes that aren't part of their namesake!Service was friendly and attentive.\n\nI'll return for sure, and will definitely have to try out those $2 shooters at some point!
