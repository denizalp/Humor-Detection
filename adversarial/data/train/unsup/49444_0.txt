Village Inn is one of my favorite breakfast places to eat. The facility was very clean and well maintenance. The food was good, but my order was wrong and I asked them to correct it two times and it still was wrong. The staff were very friendly, but I feel as though they would not let us eat because they kept trying to have conversations with us which is very lovely.
