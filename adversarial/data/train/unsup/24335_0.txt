This place is packed.  Its very short staff.  I keep getting asked what i ordered.  The one complaint i have is i haven't seen one employee wash their hands.  They touch the screen as they check us out then preparing your order.  Im disappointed.  I let i think one of the owners know about not washing hands.....the response was sometimes the girls get flustered\n\nYour response is very rude.  You as the owner know you showed up the last five minutes i was there.  I watched you yourself make two shakes touching ice cream and not once washing your hands when you walked in.  There were two girls working both touching the screen, sliding cards, touching the counters and handing items to customers not once did one person wash their hands.  I guess touching money and credit cards dont count right.  Im a local and i live in the area where my family eats often.  As for a fake account its not.  Ive never felt the need to complain about other places we have been
