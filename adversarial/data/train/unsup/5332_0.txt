Bad. Real bad. I got a mani\/pedi. They had one person for each. I can see why people get annoyed when they don't understand the language. I speak the language, and they were talking all kinds of shit!  The lady who did my nails was real snarky and didn't do a good job.  My nails were smudged, and my cuticles are a mess. The dude who did my pedi was awesome though. He rubbed and massaged for at least 10 minutes. \n\nI wish there were good, white folk who do nails. Lol.
