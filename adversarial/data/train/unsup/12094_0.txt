Came here for dinner with my husband and his friend and the only Mexican food lindo is comparable to is the dog meat they serve on the side of the road In downtown cancun . I can't believe we paid 75$ for a dinner I could have got on the clearance shelf at smiths . The table side guacamole was bland . I don't understand how it is possible to screw up guacamole that us Made with\" fresh \" ingredients but apparently it very easy ! \n\nI got a three item combo , everything did not have good flavor . The chile relleno was covered in the same red tomato sauce as the chicken enchilada that has dry chicken meat . The beef taco was the best part of my meal and was comparable to Roberto's \n\nMy husbands meal was the worst part of our whole experience . His beef dish wasn't edible as every few bites had so much fat I had to literally ask for a new napkin just to spit the meat I couldn't swallow into . Who serves meat like this at an establishment that is so well known ?!?! I have literally had better quality meat from don tortaco ! WhAt a disappointment ! \n\nThe only thing I can say was good about our experience was the service , our sever was very attentive and it was not his fault a \"Mexican food \" place was serving food that should not have been approved by the FDA .
