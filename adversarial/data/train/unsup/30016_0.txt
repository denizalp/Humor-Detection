This branch gave me a rental car without a license plate. I asked the agent about that and he said, \"oh no, you'll be fine because the car has a sticker in the front window from the DMV.\" Sure enough I got stopped by the police before I even got to my meeting, but of course this also made me LATE for the meeting b\/c everything has to be checked by the cop. The cop was nice and told me they had been telling rental car places for years not to do exactly this. It's very irritating when you pay for a car, mention something to the agent about the car at inspection, and then have that exact thing impact your timing to a meeting. Way to go Enterprise.
