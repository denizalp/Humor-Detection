I paid Tempest a visit during Restaurant Week at the end of July and was kicking myself afterwards for not having stopped in sooner because Tempest is fantastic. The atmosphere, service, and quality of the food is on point. \n\nWe dug into a 3 course meal for an incredibly fair price of $35, and what's more is the portion sizes didn't appear to be scaled down in the least. During restaurant week, you'd expect restaurants to provide you with the same food items, at a cheaper price only because the amount of food is substantially less. This was not the case at Tempest. After a delicious appetizer, entree, and dessert, we left here stuffed.\n\nWhile the namesake oysters were not on the restaurant week menu, we knew that was something we had to experience. We simply ordered one west coast and one east coast oyster and both were fresh and well worth the extra expense.\n\nThen for my first course I chose the She Crab Soup with King Crab & flying fish roe. I am typically not a soup person, which makes this selection curious, but I had heard great things and having now tasted it, I am glad I did. The soup was very creamy and had a unique yet delicious flavor to boot.\n\nThe second course was the Blue Marlin, broiled with hazelnut pesto lime aioli & fried leeks. I loved this fish. It was a large filet and I polished off every last bite. The outer crust was perfection and the taste of the pesto and salty crunch from the leeks were great with this particular fish.\n\nFor dessert I chose the Chocolate Caramel Walnut Tart and boy was this a large slice of decadence. From the thick layer of hardened chocolate to the gooey caramel interior and interspersed walnuts, my mouth salivated with anticipation between bites. I don't recall putting my fork down until I had near cleaned my plate of this very rich, very indulgent dessert. \n\nI took advantage of a few spots during this latest restaurant week, but Tempest has stuck out in my mind as one of the best.
