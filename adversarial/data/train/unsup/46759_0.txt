I made reservation for me and my husband to during dinner because he really like the yardbird in Miami and I had never ate here. We order there porkbelly and chicken, waffles and watermelon. I'm usually not a fan of eating porkbelly but the sauce l had made the porkbelly taste good . The chicken was very moist and the watermelon had a kick of spice to it with sweetness.
