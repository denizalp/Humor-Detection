I would not hire this company!!  Seems my experience is similar to C.H., I was almost ripped off by Alin!  I will have to go the legal route to get the rest of my money back, what a nightmare!  Alin said the job would take 3 slabs and completed the job with only 2 but failed to tell us this until I figured it out and called him on it!  This is an easy rip off!  You pay for 3 slabs he does job in 2 and returns the 3rd slab to the yard and keeps the money!  Make sure this doesn't happen to you, beware!
