I can't say enough about this place!  I would give it 10 stars if I could!  It is so zen and so amazing.  It is nothing like the traditional acupuncture I tried before.  It is a much more calming environment.  And the zero gravity chairs with heat and massage... so awesome!!!  With Modern Acupuncture I have had relief from knee pain, a strained hamstring, and acute back pain.  Also, the staff is fantastic.  I just can't say enough!!!
