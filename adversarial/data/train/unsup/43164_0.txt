There's one certainty-- we all die.  We don't know where we go when we die.  But short of Heaven, there won't be better food than the Emporio's meatballs.  Decadent, tender, balanced.  Absolutely delicious.  My wife and I truly regret we won't be making our hitherto annual Pittsburgh pilgrimage this year.  These are the best meatballs this side of mortal demarcation of life and death.
