Awkward set up that is messy and unorganized. It's one of those places where you are not sure what to do or where to stand or where to get your food and coffee - and they don't care. They are trying so hard to be hipster and cool that they forgot about customer service. They just need to re-think they way they operate, and I think they would rock, since the coffee is very good. The food is just average, however. My biggest complaint is that there is one dark haired short girl that works there that just seems out of it and rude. She does't look at you when you order, and then end up making you repeat yourself several times. Also - she's not very polite. Maybe I just wasn't hipster enough for her. \n\nI think most people go here b\/c of the hype and to scope out others... If you don't feel like getting looked up and down while you drink your coffee, don't go here. Lola or Urban Beans are much better.
