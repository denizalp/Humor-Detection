I have been coming to this Hula's for years.  It is one of my favorite spots in midtown.  So many memories coming to Hula's.  It would either be coming with a group of friends or coming late at night to have a drink after work or coming here on dates.  What matter which time or who I was with the service is always great.  \n\nOne Wednesday's they have happy hour all night.  The menu is a decent size for being a happy hour menu. I normally get the pork tacos and a couple of Mai Tai's and I'm all set for the evening.  \n\nOn the patio they have a big fire pit that they turn during the winter months. So that you can stay warm while you are drinking and eating. I enjoy sitting by the fire pit on night to keep me warm, since I'm cold all the time. \n\nLast thing, if you feel like trying something different you should come to Hula's for there brunch and try the Spam Benedict.  It is amazing, I enjoy having it once in a while.
