I have been seeing Dr. Cherrington for over a year now.  This is the nicest staff\/group of people I've been exposed to in a dental office. Dr. Cherrington recommended a crown for me based on an x-ray he took. I asked some very difficult questions to him about whether this was really necessary, and he took the time to write a detailed answer to my e-mail explaining why he felt it was.  I believe there is a high level of integrity here. This morning, I actually got the crown, and honestly, as far as procedures like that go, it was great.  I felt no significant pain including the needle going in, and the drilling...sure some discomfort, but the novacaine has worn off, everything went great, and now I can avoid root canal in the future.  Laura is one of the Dental Assistants, and she always does a great job cleaning my teeth.  The whole office has a good vibe..upbeat, and with a sense of humor, but professional and efficient Highly recommended!
