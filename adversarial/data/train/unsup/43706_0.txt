Ummmm I'm kind of obsessed with Tutti Fruitti.  I've visited similar stores in the US such as Yogurtland, and was hoping the trend would come up to Canada. Very happy that is has! They have a wide variety of flavours - the standards like vanilla and chocolate, and everything in between from coconut, passion fruit, green apple, salted caramel and taro.  They also have a lot of healthy fruit toppings. I like that the store is not overly crowded, and there is plenty of seating.  I will be back on a weekly basis! Love this place!
