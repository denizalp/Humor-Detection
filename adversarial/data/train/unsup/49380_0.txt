This was THE THEATER in my neighborhood. It was one of the first my husband and I attended when we first moved to Vegas. \n\nWe have not been here in a while, but what a big disappointment it has become. We went to a late showing, buying tickets no problem, got in only to find one person in concessions and at least a dozen people in line. \n\nThe ticket taker called on the radio for help only after a woman complained. A second call finally got someone but by that time what was a single long line that had formed by so many waiting patiently was skipped by the newcomers and suddenly those waiting where at the back of a very long line while others cut.\n\nOnce at the concessions, I swiftly asked for a large water and large coke. She disappeared to grab large cups only to come back with a stack and had to put them away then, having forgotten my order had to ask again what I wanted.\n\nSo, finally with drinks bought, I knew a stop at the lady's room would be needed. With all the stalls, not one had toilet paper and I had to usey tissue from my purse!\n\nMade it into an empty theater with our choice of seats, however, all seats were uncomfortable and the theater was hot! So a sad experience was had. At least the drinks where cold. \n\nI hope they plan to remoldel as others are doing with improved stadium seats and better air or they might be finding us and others going somewhere else!
