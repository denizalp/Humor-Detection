Came here for my first Vegas buffet experience so I can't compare it to the others. I would say its just ok. Good variety but pretty much nothing was amazing. It has the appearance of fancy food but is really just nice cafeteria fare. The prime rib was disappointing. The brisket was juicy was bland. The lamb chop was a bit better. Best parts were some of the random sides, like some scalloped potato thing, creamed spinach, etc. The desserts were spot on though, I ate six different ones, all delicious. I guess you get your money's worth but I kinda wish I'd just gone to cheaper one that doesn't pretend to be fancy.
