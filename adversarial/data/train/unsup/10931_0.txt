This is a 1 star review solely for the Pharmacy.  I called to verify the prescriptions were ready and was told YES both are ready. I arrived and here I wait. It seems one was ready the other had not even been started and the cashier is an assbag about it. I Loves Sams Club but will be taking my Prescriptions elsewhere where they don't lie and waste my time. Guess what now they are out of the 1 med that an hour ago was ready to go. So a massive waste of 20 minutes. Lies and BS
