Like many of you, I did my research on local carpet cleaning companies to come out and clean my carpet and tile. Noble Carpet Cleaners had many great reviews and they were a local, veteran-owned company. I've been more inclined to use local business after having bad experiences with known bigger businesses. \n\nI had sent an email for a quote and received a prompt response in the morning. I asked for service on the next available Saturday and looked forward to their visit. Communication was excellent as I had received an email confirmation of my service along with an invoice. I was given a window of 3-5pm. I planned my day around their arrival, clearing space in my house for them and vacuuming. I got a reminder text at 3:40pm that Gene was on his way. \n\nI met Gene and Joey and they were very nice and personable. They did a walkthrough of my home and explained the work about to take place. From there, I waited patiently as they thoroughly  did a great job on my carpet and tile. I was presented with a great price for the work on my entire home and was not disappointed. I also got a 5% discount for paying in cash! Highly recommend and a great professional organization. I've used other services before and have seen \"big-name\" companies just rush in and out without saying a word using unskilled workers. Noble Carpet Cleaners is the real deal!
