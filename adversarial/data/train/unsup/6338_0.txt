Ughhhh!!!!!\nDon't do it. You'll be sorry.\nSo I make an appointment, come in and when I show up, I am told it will be 10 more minutes (since the nail technician was running behind.)\nI sit down, and wait. Two minutes later the owner comes over and asks if I want a Pedicure? I say no, I have an appointment for my nails. Then she asks me if I need my eyebrows waxed? Nooooo, I have a nail appointment. Really lady?? Quit pushing your sales on me! Thirty minutes laters, my nails are done. Two nails are crooked, one is too wide----wider than my thumb, and it's not the shape I asked for. I proceed to pay for these services and they charged me an extra dollar because I used a card. Wow! You have doubled your sales in a year, opened an extention to the salon, hired more people and you can not afford to pay your credit card machine fees? Are you kidding me? And the best part is that there is a Lexus parked out front every day but you can't take on those credit card charges??? \nCan you say money hungry? \nI did voiced my opinion on what I wanted fixed\/repaired and the nail technician screamed at me across the room in front of other customers, as if I did something wrong. I was mortified. What ever happened to the customer is always right. And for the record, I wasn't trying to get free anything, since I double tipped you. I just wanted it fixed. That's all. \nWell good thing Madison has a ton of nail salons. And cheaper prices.
