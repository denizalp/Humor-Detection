I never knew a Bone-in Ribeye existed till I ate at N9NE. It was like something out of the flintstones, HUGE and DEEELICIOUS. I couldn't  finish it. I was definitely full from the appetizers. We had a cold shellfish platter, fresh and amazing. They have wonderful seafood at a  steakhouse. But my favorite thing was the truffle fries.  I'm not a huge fan of fries but these fries could be an accompaniment to my death row meal. \n\nEveryone knows this place is modern, sleek and sexy.  It adds to the dining experience.  If you don't want to go for a long drawn out dinner, opt for the bar and have one of their specialty cocktails and an order of truffle fries. If you opt for dinner, the Bone-in Ribeye is the way to go. \n\n*Special shout out to Andy & Tiff for taking us out to an incredible dinner.
