A visit to Sushi Hiro was at the top of my list since I was dying to complete my imaginary \"Chef Hiro\" omakase trilogy.  Unsure as to why three of the standout off the strip sushi restaurants are all spearheaded by such talented chefs with the same name (Sushi Hiroyoshi, Tokyo Boys are the other two), but I plan on legally changing my name to Hiro for a couple of weeks to see if that raises my own culinary game.\n\nPrior to arrival, we called to discover that their corkage fee was a ridiculously low $7 (?!?!?!?) and snagged a couple of bottles at Trader Joe's up the street, which enhanced dinner smaaaashingly.  This is also the most price accessible Japanese spot offering omakase, starting at $49, but we opted for the $89 premium option and were seated in front of Chef Hiro himself in order to compare it fairly with the others...and because I am a fucking pig.  \n  \nWhile Raku's version of tofu is the gold standard for Las Vegas, the one that the Chef Hiro doles out is excellent and would save any Henderson resident some car fuel if they were jonesing for a soy fix.  The tempura dish, the other option for this specific course, was also first-rate.\n\nThe ocean trout sashimi was definitely a highlight, cut thick and delicious; these mini filets had me absolutely fish-giddy.  Served on a bed of crushed ice with several other cuts of sashimi and a mini-box of uni (kawaiiiiiii), it was easy to see that the chef and his staff take great pride in details.\n\nAll the nigiri served was terrific with the most unique being the special chu-toro from Massachusetts of all places.  This provided a unique flavor and chew; almost like a cross between ika and maguro...even in color!  Overall, this was another noteworthy dining experience that I would gladly return to.\n\n4.12777492739204 stars!
