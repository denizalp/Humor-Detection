So I've been coming to this gem of a hole in the wall for years but this is the first time I step out of my comfort zone and tried something new. I had the black bean noodle and let me tell you it was the most amazing non meat dish I have ever tasted. The flavor of the black bean sauce is sweet mixed with the right amount of savory. The veggies taste fresh and crisp cooked just enough to hold the flavor. I was truly taken a back. The customer service is always warm and friendly and they are all willing to answer questions and be attentive. This is exactly how every small business needs to be from food quality to customer service 5 stars from me.
