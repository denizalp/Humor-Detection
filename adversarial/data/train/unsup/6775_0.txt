I've been a client of this business for about 2 years. It is *SO MUCH* more convenient than going to the MVD. I used to renew online but one time I never received the new tags. That perturbed me. They didn't refund the charge on my credit card so after that, I started using third party title agencies.\n\nDesert Title Services has done an excellent job each time I've come. I highly recommend this business!!!
