First time here and we had no reservations for a Saturday night.  Hostess went out of her way to find us a seat on the patio.  Waitress was personable and friendly.  The cook and the bartender exhibited a level of expertise I really did not expect.\n\nMy wife was not real hungry and ordered from the \"Starter\" list.  She had the Tuna Putanesca.  The serving size was perfect, and Terri remarked that the chef was excellent in understanding the importance of including an anchovy when preparing the sauce.  She ordered the Peach Sangria.  I tasted it, and it was the first time I could say I really like Sangria.\n\nI just ordered a small Pepperoni Pizza.  It was good.  I asked for a Cuba Libre and got the old fish eye.  Quickly changed my order to rum and coke with a wedge of lime.  ;o)  It was the perfect accompaniment to my pizza so I ordered a second.  This time the bartender thankfully held back on the Coke.  ;o)\n\nAnd we had live music and a wonderful breeze to make the evening nearly perfect.\n\nAs we walked out, knowing the excellence of the bartender, my wife remarked that this would be a great place to come to just for a cocktail in the evenings.  I have a very observant wife.
