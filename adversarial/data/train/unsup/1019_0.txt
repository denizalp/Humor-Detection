Appreciated how Mad Greens gives the public a sampling of the food they provide at their Grand Openings! Another thing to love besides their service is the usage of local ingredients! \n\nI got the Crazy Ivan which was a salad of baby greens, roasted peppers, pumpkin seeds, goat cheese, roasted beets and a miso sesame vinaigrette. I'm not a fan of beets so I had those left off, but also found they left off the goat cheese as well- bummer. The salad was delicious even without the goat cheese! Flavorful, light and the pumpkin seeds added a great crunch. The flavor profiles of their salads are well thought out. The greens of the day were also from Buckeye! The free drink that came with their free salad allowed you to choose from their Maine Root soda fountain or their flavored teas. I like Maine Root's mission and liked their Mexicane Cola in terms of flavor and sweetness factor, their Mango tea was fruity and sweetened with honey if you're looking for a non-soda option. \n\nThe service for their grand opening was spot on. There was a long line, but expected. Just a small hiccup in their assembly line which was apparent that they were still in training, but enjoyed how friendly, quick and informative the staff was here. So happy to have Mad Greens closer to where I live and can't wait to go back!
