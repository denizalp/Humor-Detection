DOUBLE-X BLACKLIST. WON'T GO BACK. EVER.\nI hoped that having Hiromasasan at the sushi bar could save this place from wraithdom, but i was wrong. Not even the finest sushi chef in the valley could save you, benihana!\n\n--sushi deluxe sampler lunch \"features\" one piece each of their \"best\" fish. POO!   NOT FRESH!   \n--I could have done better at Kyoto Bowl !!!\nSHAME ON YOU!\n--ever felt like you might actually be dead, and \"this\" is purgatory? yeah, that was me.\n\nwhen it was all over, i whispered, \"are they forcing you to serve this &$@# ?\"\none eyebrow up.\n\n\"are you proud of THAT?\" i pointed at the case.\n\"no.\" came the reply.\n\ni have such great respect for you kyodasan, but\n_WHERE, OH WHERE HAVE YOUR STANDARDS GONE?_\n\nthat was last week.\ni went again today to give them one more chance. (double-x is serious business, you know.)\ndidn't even make it past the hostess nazi.\n--as she told me there is a \"10 minute wait\", i peered into the restaurant and saw...\n--5 empty tables filled with dirty dishes!!!\n--all but two seats at the bar were empty\n\n@Hiro: let me know where you end up next.\n\n@benihana: DOUBLE-X.\nYOUARETHEWEAKESTLINK GOOD BYE.
