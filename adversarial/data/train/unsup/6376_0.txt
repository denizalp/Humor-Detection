This review is solely based off shopping for dog supplies. I've been thinking about rescuing a dog and the fever is real to spoil her.\n\nAfter stopping at a few other local pet stores for basic necessities, my Mom and I left feeling disappointed. I had low expectations when we entered this Petco but ended up pleasantly surprised! They had a fantastic selection of toys, grooming\/health supplies and even dog apparel. I appreciated how the leashes and collars were organized by size (XS-XL) in straight lines so you could see exactly what was in-stock. I appreciated the diversity of styles, too, especially because I don't consider myself the type of dog owner who will be into the super obnoxious pretty pretty princess pink stuff.\n\nI thought all the merchandise was really neatly organized and the store was very clean. A few people stopped by to see if I needed help, which is always appreciated. I found everything I needed without problem. I also am obsessed with their doggie bakery at the front of the house, which included make your own treat bags and gourmet dog biscuits shaped like ice cream cones - too cute! Overall, they had the best selection of dog supplies I've encountered so far in this part of town.
