I wish I could give out negative stars, but alas, that's not possible. This tourist trap is located at Showcase Mall, right next to M&M World on the Strip. It's right next to MGM and across the street from New York New York.\n\nTheir \"specialty\" is margaritas by the yard. So, my posse is walking down the Strip towards our hotel, The Excalibur. Me and my homey Dead Mike decide to stop and gits us an $18 margarita. For $18 it has to be good, right? WRONG! \n\nI got a berry margarita, I think Mike got raspberry. They both sucked. I don't think either of them had more than a drop ot tequila. By the time I finished my margarita I thought I was going to get sick just from all the pre-mixed artificial berry concentrate, and I was sober. Mike just stopped drinking his. What was the point? \n\nFor $18 there needs to be an ample amount of tequila in a drink. Hell, for $18 it should all be top shelf with pure agave. Instead, this place dumps some concentrate into a blender with some pre-mixed margarita. The \"advantage\" is seemingly that in Vegas you can walk around with a drink in your hand.\n\nWell, if I want to walk around with non-alcoholic margaritas I can do that at Disneyland. I get infuriated when I think about the nerve of this place.
