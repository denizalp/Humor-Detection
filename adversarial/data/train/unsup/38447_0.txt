Stumbled upon Xawaash on our way back home from another place that did not work out. Walked in to a large dining area with multiple tables and booths. The order counter could be described as cafeteria style, pay at cash and walk down the line, however, if you dine in, they will serve it to you at your table. \n\nWhile in rome (somalia in this case), I wanted to try something authentic, I ordered the Suqaar Beef with somali rice as an extra side. It was quite tasty and the portion size was very generous. One thing I realized afterwards was the dish is described as pan-fried beef strips with peppers and onions, but there were no peppers anywhere in the dish, the pictures do show green and red bell peppers. Despite the mishap, it was still very good and I would go back and try more dishes, this time I will pay attention to what should be included. \n\nOn the downside, the dining space is large and very open, with the coffee machine going, it was extremely noisey to the point where I could not hear myself talk. You don't realise how loud it is in there until you get outside and your ears are ringing! Gave me memories of my ears adjusting outside after a rock concert.
