Update: My husband spoke with the owner this evening after he had reached out to us through email and cellphone. They had a good and lengthy conversation about all that occured. :) A full refund was given and, if we would consider trying them again, he would give us a party tray the next time we would like one. Both were mutualy disappointed that the situation had esculated so far when it was a simple fix. We appreciate and thank you Mr. Brady for taking the time out to address our concerns and provide a resolution.
