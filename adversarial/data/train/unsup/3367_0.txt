I come to this Wendy's more often recently because I'm in this area more now.  Evans and Kipling is pretty much a light industrial area and this Wendy's is a combo Wendy's and mini drive through Tim's much like the one on the Queensway not far really but the \"Etobicoke\" Wendy's on the Queensway is the \"nice\" Wendy's.\n\nThe most depressing Tim's\/Wendy's is the one near Kipling station on Dundas, the one on the Queensway is the nicest most modern one and this Wendy's is something in between.  \n\nThis Wendy's feels more old school and the parking lot is shaped oddly.  When going to Kipling to exit it's awkward because you have to watch 2 drive in exits, the Tim's and the Wendy's not to mention cars coming in and when leaving cars are whizzing coming downhill from the overpass.\n\nThe inside of this Wendy's could use an overhaul but I wonder being in a blue collar area if they will fix this place up like the one on the Queensway which has the couches and fireplace not to mention the self serve Coke variety machines.  \n\nAt the end of the day this is still Wendy's food which is in my opinion one of the better fast food franchises out there now.  However just like the other nearby Wendy's and basically all McD's these days this place needs a much overdue face lift to brighten things up.
