I stayed here for the first time during my recent visit.\nMy friend that I came with is actually a regular.\n\nThe hotel is spacious, bright, clean, welcoming and pretty to look at.\nGood place for those of you who don't like casinos, cause this is a hotel only.\n\nPrices are fair and reasonable.\nRooms are spacious.\nBeds, pillows and blankets are super comfortable.\nBathrooms are huge, love the walk in shower and hot tub.\nThey offer complimentary hygiene kit if requested. Comes with toothbrush, toothpaste, and comb.\nOur room came with a mini fridge.\nAnd a kitchenette stocked with cooking supplies and utensils and cups if you wanted to cook.\nComplimentary coffee and water! Always need water!\n\nNot to mention that we learned that Trump Hotel has their OWN DRIVERS!\nBut there's not too many available, but if you can get one, they'll take you anywhere you choose, and you pay them depending on how much you think you should, not by mileage, which is awesome as well.\n\nOverall, I had an enjoyable stay.\nNot the fanciest place, but very very nice accommodations.
