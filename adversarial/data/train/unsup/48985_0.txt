Update: Notice that Mike in his reply didn't say he didn't steal, but instead tried to shift the blame.  I would love to share the direct message he sent me telling me his assistant was at my counter where the giftcards were, but that means nothing.  For the record, not filthy, just regular dirty grout, I would assume when folks want their grout cleaned it must be dirty, right....Just for context, this is a very nice house and nothing was filthy in the property.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS THIEF AND BAIT AND SWITCH PRACTICES!\n\nBought a living social deal for a new house.  When he showed up, he said the grout was dirty and it would cost more money(that is why a called a grout cleaning company!!! did he think it would be clean???) and it would cost more.  I bought the deal for $99, and when I asked how much, he said $200 more.  I then noticed his assistant around my counter around a card we were given by our realtor with 2 gift cards worth $150.  When I told them I wouldn't pay the additional $200, they left, but the assistant asked if he could use the bathroom...guess what, both giftcards were stolen by them.  STAY AWAY, the police have been notified!
