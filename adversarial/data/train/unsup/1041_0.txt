I had never been to Tea Station, but have passed it many times in China town over the years. I like Tea, I am not a fan of Boba so much.. but I figured maybe I would give it a try based on some friends that wanted to drop in. \n\nI had a green tea Boba.. nothing wrong with it.. tasted like hardcore green tea (which I really like) and then some Boba. Maybe I don't have the finer palate required to .. drink.. slurp.. chew? Boba? lol.. Someday I am sure will go back and try something else.. for now my curiosity is satisfied. \n\nThe other guests in the place seemed to really like it.. and the staff was prompt and energetic.. lol.
