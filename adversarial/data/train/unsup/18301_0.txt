I enjoy a cup of Boba every now and then.  Back in college it was an up and coming hot thing.  So Starbucks vs. Boba was a daily debate.  Boba Tea House - wow what an original name!  Yeahhhhh...... As usual my boba selection was off the charts?  Why so much flavor man?  I only and always get the Thai Tea with Boba....might as well call it \"Bo's\" Ba ... :)  Service was easy going and I get my tea the way I want it.  However, what's up with the A\/C?  They have fans blowing left and right?  Does making Boba take that much power that you have to switch off the A\/C? or does the salt water tank with the fish need to be at a certain temp?  They have a leather couch, but no thanks I like the skin on my legs where they are.  Not sure what's up, but I bet all their workers can't wait till the winter season - enjoy!
