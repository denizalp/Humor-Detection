Interesting, although limited non-traditional menu, somewhat on the quirky side. Decent, but small selection of micro beers.\n\nStopped in during their first month of business, had fish and chips and was delighted to see they offered Left Hand Milk Stout, an excellent dark beer from a Colorado brewery, that is next to impossible to find in Nevada. Nothing special about the fish and chips, but it was fantastic to find a Milk Stout from Left Hand Brewery.\n\nWent back a few weeks later, and to my great dismay, they had abandoned the Left Hand Milk Stout. Too bad, since I had gone out of my way and made a special trip there primarily for the Milk Stout.\n\nHate it when that happens! If you can't trust a joint to maintain their beer selection, you can't trust them for anything else. \n\nWhat I really miss about this change of pace from Whole Foods is the loss of the gelato bar.
