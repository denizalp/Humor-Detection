I noticed a lot of pictures for the location in the Clock Tower on this listing. This one is located on downstairs, not the tower. Walking in I noticed the display case right away and all of the goodies inside it. When I saw they had Chocolate Almond Croissants, I knew that would be my choice. The price was marked $4 for the croissant and it was packaged to-go for me. Inside this location is smaller, but there is some seating and tables right outside if you want to soak up some of the Strip air while you enjoy your food\/drink. Later for dessert at home, I heated up the Chocolate Almond Croissant and it was flaky and tasted good. I'd like to try the Apple Croissant next. French pastries, tarts, macarons, cupcakes and cookies as well sandwiches and salads that are made fresh each day are offered here on the menu. Coffee, teas and house-made juices are the beverages offered. When on the Strip I'd stop by again for sure.
