Row after row from floor to ceiling of anything your heart could desire in regards to hardware.  The store was near and organized. I did notice that most of the employees stayed behind the counter even when we asked where certain items were- they just gave us the row # and let us hunt down the items on our own.   \nOther than that, a superstore that's for sure!
