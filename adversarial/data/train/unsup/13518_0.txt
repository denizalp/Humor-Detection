I have been to Rosallie a number of times and it's such a fine place to go for a coffee and pastry or something more substantial such a a sandwich with a small salad.\n\nToday, I had quiche Lorraine and a large latte.  The late lunch\/early dinner was just perfect.  The quiche was perfect, the latte tasty, and service was excellent.\n\nI got a piece of walnut pie to bring home for later but later came sooner than I had planned.  It was very good.\n\nI'll be back many times.
