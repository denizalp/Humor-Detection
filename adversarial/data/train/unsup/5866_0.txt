If I could give them 0 stars, I would.\n\nAuthentic? No.\nTasty? No.\nMSG-drenched? Probably.\nCheap? Yes.\nPortions? Large.\nRats and bugs? Infested.\n\nI don't know how people can simply turn a blind eye to the fact that this place is a dump, and cooking within a dump is not healthy nor enjoyable at all, for any price whatsoever. The last time I stepped foot in here was when I saw a rat with my own two eyes running around the kitchen. I stormed out of the restaurant, and if I had known better, I would've called Health Services to take care of it. \n\nSome people have written how this place is so tasty, despite all that is wrong with it, but why is it so tasty? Because it's drenched in MSG? Because it's drenched in garlic dressings and whatever sauces to confuse your taste buds from realizing you're eating something horrible? \n\nEverything served here is low grade, deep fried, and over-sauced, let alone cooked amongst insects and rats. If someone paid me a million dollars I wouldn't eat here again. \n\nTo those of you who can, I feel bad for your palate.
