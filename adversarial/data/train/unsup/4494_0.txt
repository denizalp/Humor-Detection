My friends and I have been returning customers to Tealicious ever since it opened at this location. We have always enjoyed the nice atmosphere and good service.\n\nWhat happened was a big disappointment today, and me and all of the 25 or so friends that we have introduced to Tealicious will never come back again.\n\nMy group of 10 friends visited Tealicious today to celebrate a birthday, and we brought cake with us. Everyone ordered a drink, everyone paid, we tipped, and we left in 2 hours. We offered the staff some of the cake since we knew we couldn't finish it, but the waitress politely refused. Everything was fine until my friends and I were leaving, and the owner of Tealicious took our leftover cake and THREW IT OUT ON THE SIDEWALK IN FRONT OF US. He did not put it in the trash, he just threw it onto the middle of the sidewalk.\n\nThis left my friends and I all very shocked and disappointed to see such rude service. I am especially saddened to know that I will not be able to come back to this place again, since I have created some great memories here.\n\nIf bringing in cake from outside was a problem, they should have let us know instead of bringing us a knife, forks, and plates for the cake.\nIf leaving the leftover cake was a problem, they should have told us to take it with us and we would have done so without a complaint.\n\nHaving experienced this horribly rude behavior coming from the OWNER of this tea shop, I strongly recommend that one does not visit this place for fear that this happens to another group of unsuspecting customers.
