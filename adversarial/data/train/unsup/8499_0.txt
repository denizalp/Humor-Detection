Island Flavor is just as ono as the one on Durango. Tasty food with big portions. My favorites are the furikake chicken and the loco moco. Sometimes they have on special oxtail soup. The meat is super tender and broth full of ginger. Great for rainy days or hangovers. The kalbi ribs are good, but not great. There's spam musubi at the register, perfect for a quick snack! Service is always good here. Interior is on the smaller side, but usually not an issue since I do mostly to-go orders.\n\n*****Yelp 2016 100 Challenge*****\n72\/100
