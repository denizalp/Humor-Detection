So I called back and talked to Patrick on Monday to follow up on what is happening, he said he talked to both Managers and they agreed to have the part expedited and sent 2nd day which was ordered in Saturday.  Patrick said he was off until Thursday and when he comes back in the part will be there, he will call me and I can bring my bike in around lunch time, go get lunch and it would be done by the time I was done eating lunch.\n\nWell guess what???  No surprises here only consistency in lying...Thursday came and went and NO CALL FROM PATRICK OR ANYONE ELSE AT REI...you just cannot trust what they say as they have so much business I guess they really don't care about customers...loose a few here and there, the business won't be affected.\n\nObviously management and corporate do not read these reviews...the store itself is an AWESOME store with great products, it just the customer service especially in the bike repair side that is not good.\n\nSo to finish this, I DON'T enjoy writing bad reviews, I would rather write a positive review.  As a Yelp user, we are supposed to write honest reviews about our experience with a business.  I have detailed in two reviews the failed promises and lack of customer service this business provides in one area of the store.  \n\nTime to look for an honest bike shop who cares about customers and standing behind what they say.
