Service King, Peoria Arizona Location\n\nSubject  2011 Land Rover\n\nRE:  Unhappy Customer\/Poor Customer Service\n\nI recently had a bumper\/taillight replaced on my 2011 Range Rover.  Service King, Peoria location did a wonderful and swift job on the exterior repair of my vehicle but failed miserably by breaking the center console cover\/latch of my 2011 Range Rover.  They also failed miserable with how dirty, and dusty the interior of the vehicle was presented to me. (I'm still trying to figure out how an internal part of my vehicle could get damaged when the work was performed on the exterior)\n\nI am a military veteran and a recent customer of Service King, Peoria Az.  I am very unhappy with the service and overall experience with Service King Collision repair.  I was under the impression that Service King was a trusted place of business and my bank USAA highly recommended them.\n\nSo in closing I would just like to say I would not recommend Service King to any other customer.  The interior of my vehicle was not only damaged but dusty and disgusting.  It appeared as if they took no pride whatsoever and majorly inconvenienced me because I had to take an additional day off from work to get the center console repaired.\n\nBut I would like to point out in all fairness that the other location(tolleson 99th ave) that had to fix the center consol by installing a new center console did a wonderful job & the manager over there Armando Arivizu is a stand up guy! (Located in tolleson az off of 99th).. so if u have 2 choose,choose the tolleson location! He did his best to salvage a negative situation!\n\nSincerely,\n\nMr. Russell\n\nVeteran\/Concerned Customer
