24 hour donut shop! OK!!!\n\nFresh donuts round the clock, what else could you ask for? The donuts here are pretty much the same as all other donut shops, nothing really stands out.\n\nThey are pretty fresh though and they don't get hard after a day like some places. \n\nThey were near where I was staying in AZ so it was convenient.
