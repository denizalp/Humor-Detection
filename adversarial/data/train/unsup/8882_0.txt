If you're like me, when you think of horseradish, you immediately think of a brat topped with white basic horseradish and that's where your opinion of horseradish ends. Last night my whole opinion of horseradish drastically changed...in a very positive way! During Phoestivus at the Phoenix Public Market, I browsed the rows of local food vendors and stumbled across Grate Roots. Intrigued, I started to ask more about horseradish. At first, I tried a sample out of courtesy and then my mind was blown. When did horseradish get a tangy taste with a serious kick to it? Why did I just want to take a spoon and eat the whole thing by itself? I was blown away. This local company makes several flavors including their seasonal flavor Cranberry, a fruity flavor, the basic flavor and then beet. Yes beet. They had me sample the beet flavor and again, I did it just out of courtesy and then to my disbelief, I fell in love! I immediately thought of a turkey or tuna fish sandwich topped with this spicy goodness, so I had to make a purchase. I left with Beet horseradish and I plan on making myself a tuna fish sandwich topped with this yummy local flavor to add a kick to my day. I learned that they sell their products at local Farmer's Markets as well as AJ's. Now I know where to replhish my stash.
