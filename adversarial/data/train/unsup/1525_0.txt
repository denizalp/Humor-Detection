No place says that you've \"arrived\" more than Nami. \n\nSure, you could get excellent sushi from any of the 350 Sushi restaurants in the city for $15,  but at Nami you can get the exact same thing for eight times the price.  \n\nAll this, and you get to be surrounded at lunch by a variety of the top middle management in the downtown core, all wearing their fancypants business costumes.    \n\nIt's like Harry Rosen himself, munching on Tuna rolls like there's no tomorrow.  \n\nIt's a delicious, but expensive time machine.   You're whisked away to 1989.   Going for sushi is an ethnic delicacy and you're comparing business cards as you argue who to expense lunch to.     Recommended.
