Came here for lunch during a convention (reservations definitely needed). The short rib taco special was tasty, as was the recommended guacamole. Portions were perfect if you don't want to overeat for lunch. The service was prompt considering it was packed. They really advertised the celebrity chefs, but they were no where to be seen. While the food was good, it did not \"wow\" me - I have been to many other gourmet Mexican restaurant that have.
