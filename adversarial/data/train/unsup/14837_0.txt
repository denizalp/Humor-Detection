Not impressed at all. I tried several here things and liked about half of them. The only good thing about this place is that it's cheap. \n\nGood: \nBabaghanooj\nBeef shawerma\nChicken shawerma\n\nBad: \nHummus (no flavor)\nLamb tongue (chewy and horrible!)\nGyro sandwich\n\nUnfortunately, I ordered the lamb tongue and only had one bite. Wish I tried the falafel instead. I won't be back.
