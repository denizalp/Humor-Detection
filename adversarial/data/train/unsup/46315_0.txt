This is my second time contacting Barefoot Organic Carpet Care. My partner and I are very sensitive to chemicals but really needed our rugs cleaned. They did a fantastic job, they were very thorough and super friendly. We are renting out the house this year and have new renters who are also chemically sensitive. I trust this company regarding the products they use and the quality of their service that I wanted them to come back again. Very satisfied!!
