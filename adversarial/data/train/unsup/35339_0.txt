Love the $0.99 two piece leg and thigh special on Tuesdays. I've been going here for several weeks now and I haven't had any service or food quality issues. In fact, I've even gotten extra pieces sometimes.\n\nGo here on Tuesdays and get yourself a bunch of cheap fried chicken. Not much else to say.
