I was on my way to the car after dining out at a Italian restaurant in the same plaza, then I noticed this place at the corner of my eyes. Well....I am already here so why not? We stopped by to check out this place. The bright color and cute decoration completely caught my eyes. \n\nSince it was towards to end of the night when we arrived, selections were limited. Nevertheless, we ordered the 3 cupcakes and get 1 free deal. They were all well decorated just like what other yelpers said. Unfortunately, their frosting was so sweet I ended up removing them before taking the cake. I have to admit, it doesn't taste as good as it looks. I still want to give it a 2 stars for great customer service and how well the cup cakes were decorated. Other than that...yeah I probably will not come back here again.
