I could just as easily award this place 3 stars, as there was quite a number of items on the menu which weren't all that great - even with tempered expectations for AYCE. On the flip side, there were also many items which I really enjoyed too. Armed with the knowledge of my last experience, I could return here and still have countless items to order which I know that I'll really enjoy - so I'll let that be the tie-breaker in the rating.\n\nI know it would probably be helpful to the review to break down what I ordered. But if you knew the obscene quantify of food my group ordered, you'd understand that it would require Stephen Hawking level IQ to remember it all and then evaluate it several weeks later.\n\nIn a general sense, the fish quality is pretty good for AYCE, but could be improve with slightly less rice for the nigiri in particular. The torched sushi was the highlight for me.The cooked meat options rarely rose above average - though chicken wings always have a way of being better than the rest.\n\nIt's quite nice inside and the service was terrific. I really enjoyed my evening and most of the food was enjoyable.
