I guess the shortest way to describe this market is that looks like an abridged version of Pro's Ranch Market. You will find lots of fresh produce, hot and cold prepared foods, baked goods, meats, beverages, and groceries. There's also a nice selection of Mexican cheeses which are hard to find in regular supermarkets. The market could use a bit of sprucing up to make it look less old and more organized; but other than that, it is a good place to shop for inexpensive groceries and Mexican specialty foods.
