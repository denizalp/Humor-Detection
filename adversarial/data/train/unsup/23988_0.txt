Ok, I found this place on yelp & some of the other reviews said that the museum presented a balanced viewpoint. No, it doesn't. The museum makes absolutely no mention of the indigenous inhabitants of the Marshall Islands and what has happened to them as a result of nuclear testing there. In fact, the museum specifically states that the testing in the Marshall Islands occurred there as it was far from any population centers. \n\nThis makes zero sense, as the US government has even acknowledged this tragedy & offered monetary damages for it. Google Marshall Islands Jellyfish Babies. \n\nOn the positive side, the exhibit in the side gallery right now, is full of awesome soviet propaganda posters.
