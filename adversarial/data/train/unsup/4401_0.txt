Millions of dollars were spent building this stadium for the 1976 Olympics...rather than letting it rot into a rust bucket, someone brilliantly converted this massive structure into the \"Biodome\".  \n\nInside you'll walk through five different ecosystems, each with different climates, flora, and animals...including penguins and puffins, my two favorite birds. You'll start walking though a warm humid recreation of a tropical rain forest and end up sitting in a re-enactment of the cold icy antarctic islands.  As in any zoo, the educational information is rather light, but enough for the average science deficient human...and definitely too much information for the under educated conservative American tourist. \n\n$20 Adults, $10 kids, but multi-pass discounts are available, and its also covered by the Montreal Passeport, which I had.
