Still a great place for Indian grocery items. They have an enviable variety of spices (I picked up some amchoor powder, nigella seed, and curry leaves), various sauces and chutneys (Including a unique date chutney I couldn't resist), beef bacon, and all sorts of packaged items with fun names. The selection of fresh grocery items was pretty bare, probably because it was later on in the evening and because it was a holiday, but the fresh sweets look as good as ever. Service is still friendly and nice.
