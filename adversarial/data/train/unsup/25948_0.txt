This was my first experience with Portuguese char-grilled chicken.  I didn't really have any preconceptions; the closest comparison I have is Peruvian chicken a la brassa.  Major differences? The Portuguese chicken tastes like there is wine in the marinade, and the skin is not nearly as crispy.  It also comes drenched in a pretty bland piri piri chili oil rather than being served with flavorful dipping sauces.  The chicken was also a little flabbier than expected, as though the fat needed to render more.\n\nOverall, I liked but didn't love this style.  We sprang for a papo seco (fluffy, crusty Portuguese roll), which was a good call dipped in the chicken drippings. I also enjoyed trying a passion fruit soda -- not something you find every day.  Maybe one day I'll have the chance to try a competitor's chicken to see who best represents.
