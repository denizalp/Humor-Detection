After seeing the Matinee performance of the Phantom of the Opera, me and my husband decided to have an early dinner at Penelope Greek Restaurant.\nWe had dined there many years ago when we were first dating and we had a very pleasant time eating there.\n\nThis time was was just as special. The atmosphere in the restaurant was very warm and inviting, especially after walking outside in the cold from the theatre. It was also nice that it wasn't very busy, since the dinner crowd had not started yet. We were seated at a very nice table by the window which had a perfect view of the Princess of Wales theatre in the foreground in which we saw the Phantom of the Opera.  \n\nWe had some delicious whole wheat bread with butter. The bread was like nothing I ever tasted before, it was light and warm and it almost melted in my mouth. We ordered our food which arrived very quickly. I had the beef tenderloin souvlaki dinner which was cooked perfectly (medium). The beef tenderloin pieces were seasoned perfectly and tasted so good. The potatoes had a very nice lemony taste and the rice was also very good.  What I liked about the rice is that they didn't give me such a huge portion like other chain Greek restaurants, that make you feel too full. The vegetables were also very good too. Needless to say, I finished everything on my plate.  \n\nMy husband had the kalamari and he also had the same sides as my dish had. (Rice, potatoes, vegetables). He said that the Kalamari was cooked perfectly and it was very tender.  \n\nWe would definitely eat at Penelope again!! I would highly recommend it to anyone.  The restaurant is very elegant and decorated in that upscale downtown Toronto flair. The waiters who served us were also very polite and frequently filled our water glasses. Dinner at Penelope made our special day out even more special as we ended the evening.
