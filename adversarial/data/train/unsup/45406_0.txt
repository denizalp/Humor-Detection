I had a Groupon for a conventional oil change and I was unaware that my car cannot take conventional oil, I've always just taken it to the dealership for oil changes. The Groupon I purchased would make it cheaper for me to get my oil changed at Midas instead of the dealership. Well in making the appointment the rep from Midas told me my car can't take conventional oil and it would be a $30 up charge. I can get my oil changed at my dealership for cheaper than that so I told him never mind and became very rude and condescending about how I can't put conventional oil in my car, assuming that's what I was going to do. I've worked in customer service for over 6 years so I usually don't like to leave bad reviews but I was just so taken aback at how I was treated that I couldn't let go. If that's the customer service you want to put forward then I have no interest in doing future business with you.
