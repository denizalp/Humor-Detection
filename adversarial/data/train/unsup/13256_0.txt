My hatred for this walmart burns with the fire of a thousand suns.   The ONLY saving grace of this craphole is that they carry quite a bit more inventory than some of the other walmarts.\n\nThere are always employees everywhere but where you need them.  There's a multitude of them milling about the store, except in the paint section, the camping\/ammo section, the cash registers...you get the drift.\n\nAnd, while my expectations aren't terribly high as it's a Walmart, holy white\/black\/brown\/olive trash Batman!  They should just go ahead and put in a meth section and make a few extra bucks.\n\nIt's dirty, it smells, the customer service is nonexistent, and you have to wade through the tweakers, but it's cheap and they have a lot of stuff.
