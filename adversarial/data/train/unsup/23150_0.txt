We came here for lunch today. My kids love clay pot Casserole Rice but I'm not a fan. So it was good that they serve congee and rice rolls too. They have a promo, at the moment, where you get one pot of rice for free, when you order 3. There isn't a huge variety of rice pots to choose from, I think there's 5. My kids chose the chicken & Shitake, pork rib and salty fish & minced pork rice pots. All rice pots come with an unsalted daily soup too. The rice pots came and they weren't fragrant when the lids were lifted. The rice was a tad too soft and the crunchy rice at the bottom of the clay pots was virtually non existent. I don't think we'd ever return for the rice pots, they are not on a par with Good Taste Casserole Rice, who have more variety and a much better product. In fact, my daughter mentioned that my rice pots were better than the ones here. I ordered a salty pork bone congee (which was way too salty) and a few rice rolls. The beef and pork were nice but avoid the bbq pork one.\nI think I'd return, if I was nearby, for congee and rice rolls. But I'd not be back for the rice. Service was terrible. We were sat down and not given menus, we had to flag someone for some. One server was complaining that her wrist\/arm\/hand was hurting.... and being all miserable.
