Took a co-worker to grab a drink before we could even finish half a beer a employee, albeit not the person serving us or anybody we talked to or greeted us , walks by and says quietly they are paying for our beers and we need to leave. Was confused and talked to the manager and SHE stated she was not getting involved. Confused as to a place is run when the manager acts this way...not to mention the passive aggressive way I was told to leave by someone who I guess has a problem with someone I know. As a patron and homeowner in this area just disturbing to find a company treat customers this way as it is very unprofessional and actually childish to think people don't check there egos or at the door of work!! Side note  good beer but not worth being belittled at the expense of trying to support local business.
