I emailed the shop with an inquiry and got a reply in 30 mins or less!  I was referred to Steven who called me shortly after.  I sent him pictures of ideas of what I was thinking and he then made a plan and contacted me back.  He was very open with his schedule and gave pricing up front.  Very pleased with his work and the tattoo.  Highly recommend - I'll probably make it a point to stop here on future trips when possible.  The shop is comfortable - not a tourist trap and Steven was great.\n\nUpdate 8-6-17. \nI was so happy with previous work and Steven I contacted him again when in Vegas for a convention.  Although I didn't mention previously I may want to extend the tattoo at a later date he was able to do so.  Only at the Fremont St location.  LOVE HIS WORK!  This is the second time of many future stops at Rockstar and with Steven.
