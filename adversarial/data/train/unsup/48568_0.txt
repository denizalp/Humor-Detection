My family and I have been going to this office since 2005. Today I was treated like a criminal for asking for some pain medication due to a dislocated shoulder. I was told by the doctor that since I wasn't her regular patient she wouldn't prescribe anything. She didn't bother to check to see that another doctor there was my primary physician. What a lesson in customer service....I am sure I will not be missed since they are always very busy.
