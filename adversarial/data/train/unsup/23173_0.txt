I took my family to see Monster's University here this past Sunday.  The box office employee was courteous, but when we stopped to get some refreshments that when the wheels fell off.  The young kid behind the counter, Cody, was slower than molases in January.  When he finished with the couple in front of us he just stared out into nowhere.  What the .........?  I had to state to him, \"Can I order?\"  He then proceeded to tell me that he was waiting for me.  Hello?  Customer service!!!!!!  I will have to think long and hard about returning.  Cinemark, screen your employees.
