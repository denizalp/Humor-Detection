If Vegas has a center piece this would be it. I've had the good fortune to spend time here through all season's. There's always a new experience with each visit. You can't be in Vegas without glancing over and being delighted by the dancing water.  The variety of music is pleasant. The fountains dance to the different music so it's always different.  During hot summer days the added water in the air lowers the Vegas heat around the fountain. \n     This last visit a new experience. I didn't wait around for the next show but I did stop over and watch a layer of slow moving fog graze the top of the pool. That was cool in a weird eerie way. Like a gigantic fog machine was turned on. Never seen that before at the fountain.  Also never saw anyone Jetski in there except Bruno Mars for his 24 karat Magic video.  At least Jesse J was nice enough to walk along the left side of the fountains respectfully ha! \n     Best place to view from an eagle eye vantage point. Go up the  Eiffel tower at Paris in the evening or if you happen to get a room at the Bellagio facing the fountain. Other than that anywhere along the perimeter of the fountain is a good general place at any given time. Or have a meal at one of the Belaggio restaraunts that overlook it. Sometimes across the street is a better view. You can see the entire width of show without the crowds. If you are in one of the enclaves you are looking straight up. It's like sitting up close at the movie theatres. It's sometimes best to take a step back to see the entire width. In Vegas or going? Spend sometime in the evening watching the fountains. It's free
