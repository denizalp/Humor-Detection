First off, my car looks great.  I went to Cobblestone for the first time today for a Basic car wash (15.99).  The intake person was very friendly and gave me a ticket with my name on it.  I took the ticket inside and paid cash.  I was never given a claim check, which since I hadn't been there before, didn't know this was the procedure, especially since everyone was addressing me by name.  When the car was finished, I went to claim my car.  I was asked to show my claim check by a white male in a maroon shirt, whom I assumed was a supervisor.  I told him I had not been given one.  Immediately, he reaches for his walkie and radios someone to verify if 1) it was my car and 2) if I had paid.   He looks at me, put his hand up and said, \"I'm going to need you to stay put\".   I showed him my license and registration to verify it was my car.  He told me \"put that away\".  He then gets off of the walkie and said that I had not paid.  I told him that I had paid cash, gave the tall guy at the register nearest the door my money and was not given a claim check.  He continued to claim that I had not paid.  I told him I paid, got in my car, and drove off.  He yelled at me some inaudible statement as I pulled away.  If he is a manager, the way he handled this was insulting, insinuating and unprofessional.  He needed to have asked right away who had helped me, so that he could have addressed the concern with that individual.  I will not be returning, nor will my family.
