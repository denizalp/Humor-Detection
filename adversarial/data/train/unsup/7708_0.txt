Nothing really new\n\nWhen it comes to the talent on their acts there was nothing new. I had seen every act here or there.\n\nThere was a lot of forced sexiness that looked really awkward to me.\n\nNothing amazing at all\n\nA lot of topless women, a couple of muscle guys, a lot of trying to be sensual.\n \nAerial fabric or silk, super weird act, maybe I just didn't get it\n\nOnly part I enjoyed was when people from the audience were pulled to stage, some funny moments there.\n\nI personally didn't like, would not recommend it, and wouldn't go back even if it was free.
