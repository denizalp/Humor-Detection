Food here is really good. Maybe needs a little dash of love when made though. Staff was helpful & generous but they all seem so stressed out. Supervisors seems so strict but that's non of my business about how they handle it. There was this one specific gentleman I think his name was Richard or something, REALLY awesome supervisor & his cooking skills were A1! Wish he made my food . Anywho, this Johnny Rockets the TRUTH.
