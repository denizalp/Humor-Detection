Finally got to try White Castle.  Its pretty good.  I definitely prefer the slider with cheese instead of the regular one.  The service was pretty quick but afterall it is a fast food joint.  I can't really compare it to other White Castle but in comparison to In N Out and other burgers spots its right up there in my opinion.\n\nIf I'm ever in Vegas again I wouldn't be oppose to picking up a few for the road.  They are really affordable and thats probably the best thing about them.  The sliders are really flavorful.  We drove to get here so it kinda sucks but if you're walking the strip I don't think it should be that bad.\n\nOverall I'd definitely return again.  The sliders are legit and taste way better than I expected them to.
