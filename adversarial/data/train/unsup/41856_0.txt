Rebecca was my lawyer for many years throughout a very high conflict divorce and custody battle. What I have always appreciated the most about her is that she never fed me things I wanted to hear, she was 100% straight forward with me, gave me the hard facts and truly  coached me through one of the hardest periods of my life. She was honest and professional. I often wonder if I had never come across Rebecca - where my life would be today... There are so many lawyers out there that will take your case and simply tell you what you want to hear knowing you don't have a chance at a positive out come. THANK GOD I found Becky and and I thank God she helped navigate me through a war that is finally over.
