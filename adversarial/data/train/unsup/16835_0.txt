New neighborhood restaurant?! We have to check it out, and we did. \n\nWhat we ordered: \n\nChawan Mushi - Not steamed in the typical cup-size, but rather a wider, slightly shallow dish. Also, their version did not have any meats or veges in the custard. Regardless of the variations, I enjoyed the creamy texture of the custard and the flavor. I did not miss the meat and veges, and liked the fine slivers of pepper garnish as the added texture and flavor. \n\nBeef Gyoza - \nI'm still undecided about this dish. I know the gyoza were made with good quality Angus beef, but I'm not sure I am ok that the beef was cooked medium-rare inside. \n\nBone Marrow - It was good and it was certainly a larger portion than expected. The salts on the side were not needed, as the top of the bones were sprinkled with enough salt. Not a huge fan of the tortilla chips that came with it and there was not enough for the two large pieces anyway. \n\nChilean Sea Bass - Always a solid bet with Chilean Sea Bass.. and was no different here. The fish was pan-fried, not overcooked and seasoned well. The jalapeno sauce sounds overwhelming but complemented the white fish, and added a freshness. It kind of reminds me of dishes they serve in the tropics. The menu tells you the oz. the fish will be, but the one we received looked larger than what was stated\n\nFried banana dessert - the fried banana with the Phllyo Dough was good, the Green Tea ice Cream was good... separately though. \n\nYes, it's true, they have large bottles of Panna for $3 - that's a steal for a restaurant. \n\nLooking forward to coming back to try other things. Maybe I'll run into LJ! Lol!
