It's rather impossible to stay at the Gladstone and not compare it to the Drake. I love the Gladstone's common areas, their beautiful hand-cranked elevator (the only one still in operation in Toronto), and the wide staircases that lead up to the guest rooms. However, based on rooms alone, the Drake handily wins out.\n\nHere's why:\n- The \"European-style showers\" at the Gladstone are too tiny. There's no way you can bend over in one without touching the walls (and I'm not exactly a giant.)\n\n- No iPod docking stations in the rooms at the Gladstone. One of the things I love most about checking into the Drake is entering my room and immediately filling it with music. My music.\n\n- Odd bath products. I lived in the San Francisco Bay Area for nearly 10 years and these offerings - little slivers of nubby soap -  were still a bit too crunchy granola. A little liquid shampoo would've gone a long way for me.\n\nEverybody's got their something. Mine are music and showers and nice-smelling bath products. It makes me especially happy when I can have all three at the same time \n\nAt the current exchange rate, a standard room at the Gladstone is under $150 USD. Given the hotel's unique charms, free wifi and super soft linens this is a steal.
