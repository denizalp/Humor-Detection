George and Gayane and their daughter Jessica own and operate this lovely little waffles and ice cream parlor.  What a fantastic and original combination!\n\nThe waffles are light.  Almost to the equivalent of funnel cake light but better.  The ice cream is delightful and creamy.\n\nWith a simple and minimalist decor, the ambiance is of mother's charging and kids squealing in delight.  One little girl was twirling in a pirouette in delight.\n\nBring the kids here on a hot or any day - I highly recommend this place and it'll be a refreshing stop in between appointments during the week.
