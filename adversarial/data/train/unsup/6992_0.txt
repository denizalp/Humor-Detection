Rude and unprofessional!!! Well, I was going to try this establishment.  I changed my mind, however! \n\nI walked in, and there was no \"wait to be serrated\" or \"seat yourself\" sign,.  When I looked around unsure of rather to sit or wait, I was passed by a waitress that thought so highly of herself that she didn't give eye contact, or acknowledge my presence in the slightest.  \n\nWay to seem inviting to a new customer.  I'll take my business elsewhere, and I suggest you do to!
