Why I like this location:  Not a very high traffic Fascinations so it is not awkward perusing around.  The other fascinations close to me is right near strip club row in Old Town and let's just say there is always a whole lot going on in there.  The sales people here are always very friendly and helpful, but not in an overbearing inappropriate manner.  And my absolute favorite thing about this store is they have lots of lingerie, though some of it is overpriced...Some people have shoe or handbag problems!  Also, they have some clubbing apparel that is actually pretty cute, if you are into the more risque club look ;)
