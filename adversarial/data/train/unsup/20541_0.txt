I love theater.\n\nBlue Man Group takes live theater to a whole new level.\n\nThis show was evocative.  It was informative.  It was visually appealing.  It was interactive. It was funny.\n\nWords can not really explain the variety of tidbits that stimulated your senses through this entire experience.  From black lights, strobe lights, toilet paper, paint, marshmallows, drums, tv's, posters, digital art, and voice overs.  This was so unique it defies explanation.\n\nIf you have not been to this, you really should before you die.
