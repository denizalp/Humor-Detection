First and most likely last time here. In Vegas on a business trip, staying at Holiday Inn. Saw the restaurant across from the hotel and decided to have dinner there since it was a walking distance. Walking in around 4:45, nobody there. Just one guy at the bar, 1 bartender-hostess-waitress and another guy in the diner section. Waited 5 minutes to be seated.. Ordered chips and salsa for appetizer... Had only two dips of it. The nastiest salsa I ever had! Pretty much canned chunky tomatoes mixed with chopped onions and greens. Guacamole - spicy as hell! It's NOT supposed to be spicy cook gurus! Then ordered one of the sandwiches... Dried bread, chewy bacon and tons of turkey. In other words I'm happy to have brought snacks with me to munch on them later. Even if I come back to the same hotel, I won't be eating here. Oh yeah and they don't take AMEX :) Just lovely.
