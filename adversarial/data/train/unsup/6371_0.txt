Walked up to counter and checked in. They told me the $30\/day insurance was mandatory because I only had a 1 day rental. Refused to remove it. The rental was only $12\/day but the insurance is $30\/day and its mandatory?!?! Since when is insurance 'mandatory' ???? Agent was trying to earn a commission. Went to rental company at the next counter. \n\nBeware of this rip off.
