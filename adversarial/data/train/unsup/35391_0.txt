Glad I don't have to travel to downtown Phx for a great breakfast! This place is within a short distance from home and I am loving it! The hubz and I came here on a Saturday for an early breakfast and enjoyed every minute of it. The service was great, didn't have to wait a long time for our orders and the server was very attentive at 8:00 am. The food was delicious and portions matched the price. The ambiance is similar to the restaurants you would find in downtown Phx which is a great improvement from the super casual ambiance of most Chandler restaurants. Definitely making plans to return. We noticed the dog friendly patio on the side and cannot wait until the weather cools down so we can bring our pup with us.
