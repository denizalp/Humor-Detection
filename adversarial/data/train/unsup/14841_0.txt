Currently I'm not very happy with this place because it seems that I've been lied to. Having never used my health insurance from my job in over 3 years, I finally dicided to see a doctor for a physical. I looked up  Dr  Shirley Rodriguez and saw that she had a good status as a womens doctor. Back in May I called Dignity Health and set up an appointment with her. When I talked to the appointment maker on the phone, I asked her more than once \"is the physical totally covered by my insurance?\" I was reasured that is was and when ahead with the visit. \n     \n     Fast forward  to may 18th, my physical with Dr  Rodriguez was great. She answered all my questions about my examination and what else I should have done next. She recommended having blood work done. I asked her the same question as the appointment maker \"is this covered by my insurance?\" The doctor did go out and ask her colleagues if i was covered for the blood work and she said YES. So on the same day I had blood work done. I left that day happy because everything with my body is fine, and my visit was all covered under my health insurance.  Wrong!!\n\n     Today 08\/6\/16 I get a letter in the mail in the form of a bill from Quest Diagnostics saying that I owe 15$. I'm super angry and puzzled about why and where this charge came from. I ASKED those stupid  women over and over before and after the check up \"IS THIS ALL COVERED BY MY INSURANCE? ???\" They said I was covered and i shouldn't have to pay ANYTHING. If I was told from the get go that I had to pay for something I wouldn't have done anything in the first place here. But instead these women lied to me and now i have a bill staring at me. I won't be back to this doctor or any Dignity Health clinics! Neither will friends or family of mine who dont want to be screwed by idiots who don't  know anything about insurance coverage.
