The manager of this store, David, is awesome. He was a huge help in directing us towards the right king-sized mattress & frame in accordance to what we told him we were looking for. Love it! We had small issues with delivery & one of the pillows we bought but David resolved those issues expediently. Life is going to happen & issues are going to arise but in my opinion it's how companies deal with these issues that puts them at the top. We couldn't be more pleased with the service, cost & product.
