What's not to love about Showmars?  It almost seems a shame to call it fast food, because that's often an insult.  It is good food fast!  This location has a relatively small parking lot, but there is overflow parking around the side and out back.\n\nI just LOVE their fried flounder sandwich.  They call it the \"world's best fish sandwich\", and I can't argue the point.  I've never had better... and it often comes piled HIGH with flounder, especially after the lunch rush.  And nary a bone to be found... unlike flounder sandwiches I have had elsewhere (Yorkmont Cafe).\n\nIf a fish sandwich isn't your thing, the pita burgers are awesome, as are the Greek dishes.  Shakes, fries, baklava, etc., all good!  Showmars is always a treat I won't pass up!\n\nService and people are a big plus, too!!  Not the typical attitude and bad customer service you will find at most fast places.  They usually have people coming around the dining room to refill your tea without you having to ask!
