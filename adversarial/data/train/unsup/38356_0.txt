Ordered combo 3.  It comes with two plates or rice (or bread), one skewer of chicken breast kebob, one skewer of koobideh, one skewer of barg kebob, 3 grilled tomatoes, a plate of parsley and sliced radish, a bunch of basil.  No salad.\n\nThe meat were all very flavourful, not dry and juicy!!! The taste was very good.   Definitely a lot of food for two people. :)\n\nThe waitress was very friendly and attentive.  \n\nI read another review that they do not accept amex, and yeah they really don't.  But I asked before I paid for the meal so it's ok.
