The entire Fresh chain is overhyped and overpriced. $10 for a smoothie to go is a bit much when Jugo Juice and Booster Juice have them for around $6.\n\nI complained to the staff that my order didn't taste like it had any sauce, so she asked if I wanted more sauce. Obviously. Then later to my surprise I realize that she actually charged it to my bill! Ridiculous.\n\nAlso, apparently extra pita bread for the dip tray we ordered also warranted an extra $3 charge (could be more, I can't remember). I could definitely buy a whole bag for that much.\n\nThey nickel and dime you at Fresh and clearly do not comprehend customer service as the \"better\" restaurants do. Extra bread with your $15 dip tray order, extra sauce to make up for the fact there wasn't enough on it to begin with... all that stuff should be complimentary. I'm pretty sure it's up to the chef to make sure that the dip trays served have a good dip-to-pita ratio and when there's a discrepancy like this I've never been charged for more bread before, especially since it was one small pita bread cut up.\n\nThis place is overpriced and overhyped. They definitely know how to tap into the vegetarian\/vegan market of people who don't realize that they can go to a BETTER restaurant and order a vegetarian option (or ask to have one made). Any respectable restaurant (of higher calibre than Fresh, that is) would accommodate vegetarians. You're better off going to a non-veggie restaurant and getting something made properly and served properly by proper kitchen and wait staff.\n\nThey don't take reservations either.
