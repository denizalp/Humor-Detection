If you have their application you can go online and look at the menu and actually place your order.  The time given on the application for the food to be ready was spot on.  I arrived early but they were working on my sandwich when I got there and everyone in the place was really nice.  The best person there though was the guy making my sandwich.  Even though they were all really nice the guy making my sandwich seemed to be the only one focused on this visit.  I heard him ask several times for replenishment of items at the station but everyone seemed to be to busy chatting with each other and you could tell he was getting frustrated because he was not getting any support from his fellow employees.\n\nThings happen in the workplace and people have the right to have fun and enjoy their job however when customers are in the store, there should be a level of professionalism exhibited which is what the customers observe, not one person working and everyone else playing and not supporting him.  That was kind of embarrassing and he did apologize to me several times for what was happening in the place.\n\nThis is a place I will return to as I like the food, they have always been consistent on the quality and quantity.
