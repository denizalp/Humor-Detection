Wow one of the faves that's off the strip... We tried majority of the main courses. I would have to say that the crab legs was the best part. Really good and it comes with different sauces. Juicy. Soft. Tasty. Lamb was great, fish was drizzled with furikake nori (definitely ordering that again) and the steak was on point medium. Too bad they didn't have white rice for me to eat with the fish but the smashed potatoes suffice.
