3.7865 stars \n\nI honestly wasn't a fan here. Maybe that's why I never tried the DTLA location. The portions of everything were so tiny I had to eat off left overs from my friend's portion. Best part about eating this place was meeting Philip T! \n\nThis shabu place is set up as a bar and I didn't like it. Maybe also I like family style hot pot? I guess this is the hip new modern shabu shabu. \n\nThe customer service was great and attentive but a little smothering. I understand that it's a soft opening but being asked how's the food every 10 minutes does get too much. I really did like how the waitress went through the whole entire menu with us since we're first timers at Yojie. \n\nI ordered the sukiyaki with pasteurized egg with the Yojie cut geisha size. The broth was honestly way too sweet for my taste. They even diluted it water. I really did like the egg with all the condiments mixed in with it!  I wish I order the spicy miso like Jen Z. ! Her broth was much more savory and rich than mine. I had to switch with her after her meal. The portions of everything was very small. I pretty much ate everything of mine and finished off all of Jen Z's veggies and noodles to feel full. The quality of the meats were superb and fresh! \n\nI'm really glad I got to finally try out this place maybe I'll check out the LA location for the family style shabu shabu.
