This is a nice theater. There is a sausage bar that has a line by itself and you can also get beer and wine there. The sausages are $6.75 and they have a good amount of fresh toppings. I liked how clean he prep area is. I had a sausage with chili, cheese, onions, and jalapenos. I liked the sausage and toppings a lot but the bun was rock hard. Not worth the money at all but I gave it a shot. I shared nachos with my wife and they were damn good. Nacho cheese is good! \n\nThe seats inside the theater are nice. They recline pretty far and are roomy. There is a table for each chair that is big enough to hold a good amount of junk food. The screen quality was good and the sound too. \n\nOrder your tickets online to reserve your seat without hassle.
