I am extremely upset with how poor of an effort the team at the MGM Signature have put on behalf of me and my friends. We stayed at this particular resort because a good friend of ours Kyle Price recommended it and regularly stays there. \n\nToday I was notified that we were charged $500 on top of the $657 ($1,157 for two nights at a one bed suite) or so dollars we already put down on the room because 1 or 2 guests of ours had smoked cigarettes outside on the balcony with the sliding glass door sealed closed. We even had them wait to let it air out before they came in to make sure we were being mindful.\n\nWe assumed that was OK since no air came in the room that could have affected the cleanliness with the door air tight shut. Also those guests were outside in open air so we assumed it was OK. \n\nOn top of that the Signature staff made ZERO effort to warn us in any way to be mindful of this large charge. You would think that if your policy was to penalty bill $500 you would mention that to take care of your guests right? When we checked in they made NO mention of their policy which makes me think this was a strategy to over bill their customers. \n\nTheir response when I asked how they did not think to mention this at check in or put up a sign or notice to warn people was that it was MY fault because I did not reference the fine print at the bottom of their checkout page and cited a small plaque in the kitchen that noted it was a 'non smoking' room. \n\nI will never stay with, support, or let any friend or acquaintance of mine EVER support a business affiliated with MGM and I recommend that anyone reading this posts does the same.
