I was really excited to see this show, because of all the reviews I had read\/heard.  And I really love beatles music!  But this show was boring.  It just seemed like a bunch of random chaos.  There were maybe a couple of moments where I was really amazed with the acrobatics, but all in all I was extremely disappointed.  I really wanted to like it :(
