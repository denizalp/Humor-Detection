I write this review with sadness, as this was my go-to sushi restaurant over the last two years.  \n\nSUMMARY:   Long delays, delievered wrong order, mediocre food, billed for the wrong order, more delays waiting to correct my bill.  \n\nDETAILS:   The wait staff was not knowledgable and were not attentive. The food (curry udon and salmon teriyaki) was OK at best, but then we had massive waits in order to be served.  After a very long wait the food arrived, bringing the wrong plate which was then sent back.   We then waited....and waited...and waited some more.   As we finished our lunch, I gave my credit card prior to the bill as I (correctly) anticipated further delays.  They charged me for the other salmon dish that they brought by mistake, and I then had to wait another :10 for them to credit my card and get my correct bill.  I can't take :90 lunches especially with poor service and mediocre sushi.
