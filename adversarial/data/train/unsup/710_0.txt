\"Hurts so good\"...it's gotta be the theme song to Archi's.\n\nThis place needs a disclaimer or some kinda waiver form.  They need to let you know that if you want to be macho and order some spicy food, they are gonna beat you like a 2 dolla ho.  my goodness, this place is serving up some super spicy food...on to the experience...we arrive around noon on Sunday and are promptly seated.  Menu looks to have typical thai fare and I roll with the pad kee mao which is flat rice noodles with veggies, basil and your choice of meat.  I order the beef and then comes the million dollar question:\n\nHow spicy would you like that sir?\n\nThat's so loaded when you're asked that in front of  a bunch of friends.  it's like the 'do these jeans make me look fat' question.  it's complicated.  I like spicy food and at thai places around the bay area, i order med-hot and i can finish my food and enjoy the heat.  Here, they have a scale of 1-10 here so I feel like 7 is pretty safe.  That along with a thai iced tea seemed like a safe choice and then it begins...\n\nthe noodles came out piping hot and it honestly did not look spicy.  there wasn't any chili oil or a bunch of chili flakes.  It looked like a great dish of noodles...until i took my first few bites.  holy hell, the noodles were marinated in devil piss or something.  I could not stop sweating.  halfway through my dish, it looked like i ran a marathon.  beads of sweat running down my cheeks.  The thai iced tea was my life line.  I was a sweating mess by the end and I couldn't finish my food because the heat was too punishing.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the food was delicious.  flavor profile was great,  but it was....painful.  minus 1 star for no warning on the heat scale being off the charts.  Order a 4 or a 5 and enjoy the food.  Seriously.  If you challenge the heat, remember this: \n\nHot In and Hot Out.
