Frozen yogurt is a great go to dessert or snack spot and Menchie's is solid. They offer most of the typical toppings but also chocolate covered strawberries which I haven't seen anywhere else.\n\nThe service was really friendly and the girl behind the counter was very helpful and attentive. \n\nThe store was clean and toppings were filled to the brim ready for customers to make frozen creations.
