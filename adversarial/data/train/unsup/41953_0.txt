Memorial Weekend isn't the best time to go to buffets because of the mass of people waiting in line. But with the wait well over an hour I paid the $15 express pass fee.  Worth it because people I saw in line were still there when we finished.  \n\nOn to the food.  It's my personal favorite in Vegas. The Lobster tail medley is amazing, but you have to time it so you can dig in right when they put the fresh pan out. \n\nClam chowder is really good. (New England)\n\nSashimi is B+ quality. \n\nDessert section is amazing. \n\nAt the end of the day, it is what it is. A BUFFET! \nSteam tables, long lines and sneeze guards. Those wanting a 'juicy steak',  'succulent Lobster Tail' or \"Huge King Crab Legs\" need to go to a restaurant specializing in those fairs. Don't be cheap and go to Joe's Stone Crab. Don't expect a Bentley at a Honda dealership.
