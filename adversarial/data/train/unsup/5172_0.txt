One word.... ROACHES!\nIts impossible for me to give this hotel anything over 1 star because I found a roach lingering in our restroom.  That is a deal breaker and ruins a stay automatically.  Paid money to sleep in a roach infested room., disgusting.\nNow to be fair, the good and bad of it all:\nGood: Nice, fun pool and service was good. \nFelini's was awesome!!! Delicious and service wonderful.\nBad:\nRoaches\nToilet not flushing on first night and took 5 hours before someone came to fix.\nFar off the main strip\nValet service is slow and don't make it a point to open doors\nThe decor looks like its from 1972\n\nDo not stay here!!!  Its not worth the cheap room rate, seriously
