Have been coming here for years, many years. Actually this last time I thought, this will be my last time here because the staff is not that friendly and the previous Dr's were horrible with my pup. Coming in last week to meet Dr. Askyou was the best thing for my pup.  My dog had zero problems with her as she took the time to meet my dog and let her sniff instead of going right for her neck or bottom to give her vaccinations. Most dogs don't like a stranger to just grab at them as that scares them and outs them in defense mode. Really only come here for the savings as any and all vets charge three times the cost for the same exact vaccinations!
