i returned to islington subway station after many years away. nothing has changed -- if anything, the pigeons are more aggressive and really own the station now.\n\nfirst, why does it feel like a dungeon on the ticket-collecting level? has anyone thought, in the past 20 years, to add a few more lights?\n\nand does it really need to be so dirty everywhere?\n\nbut, you know what really gets me? this subway station is constantly busy, because not only is it a hub for a lot of buses, it's also where mississauga transit drops off and picks up a lot of passengers. so, it's a kind of bustling place. maybe it could use some comfort improvements? oh no.. MUSEUM STATION, WHERE ALMOST NO ONE EVER GETS OFF, GETS A RENOVATION?!?!? this offended me to no end. ttc, spend some money on a station that your loyal customers use day in, day out.
