I'm so glad this place decided to treat my friends and I like scum, I love that! \n\n-Waiting 20 minutes for simple food? Check!\n-20 minute wait for any type of communication from the waitress? Check!\n-Attitude from said waitress? Check!\n-Giving us the bullshit fake line about the Credit Card minimum? DOUBLE CHECK!\n\nThis was basically the visit from hell and assured that our weekly happy hour meetups will no longer be taking place here. Congrats Kerry's! You have lost yourself steady business.
