Beef rib is their signature dish was so yummy. It was juicy and tender with some sweet source on top. It really makes your mouth sings :)  well, $26 a piece, you better be good :)\nAlso like the noddles and the broth. The owner said they use lots of cow bones to make the broth and that made it so special. No wonder I won't feel thirsty after having a bowl of noddles. I gave it 4 starts because there is not too many choices in the menu and the dumplings was just ok.
