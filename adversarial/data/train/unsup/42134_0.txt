I've been here twice. Both times for lunch on the weekend.\n\nI liked the menu here. They had more than I expected. One thing that we had and really enjoyed is their pizza! It's homemade with fresh toppings. Took a little longer for our food because of the pizza, but the server let us know when we ordered. Also, ordered a calzone on our second visit. Delicious! I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Salad both times. It had lots of chicken coated with a choice of mild, medium or hot buffalo sauce. I ordered medium. Very tasty! \n\nService was very good. I couldn't decide what kind of drink I wanted. After talking to the bartender, she made something for me that wasn't on the menu. Food was hot. Bartender and server attentive.\n\nPrices are on par with most places that are dive\/sports bar. Drinks are good. Decent pour.\n\nGreat place for a relaxed lunch!!
