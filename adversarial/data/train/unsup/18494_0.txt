Phoenix Phresh is just what we needed on our side of town! A place that focuses on fresh, simple, healthy, nutritious packed meals. And they do it for the right price! Mostly focusing on Acai-bowls, Wraps, Fresh Juices and Smoothies, you can be sure you wont ruin your post work out meal or snack here. They also have a variety of salad's, sandwiches and some rice bowls.  The day I went, I got the Diablo Wrap: Wheat Tortilla, Brown Rice, Eggs, Spicy Sliced Chicken, Chipotle Sauce, and Jalapeno's. I was only able to eat 1\/2 and it was so fresh and tasty. My husband got the Bob Marley: Acai and Pitaya topped with Hemp seed Granola, Banana, Strawberry & Honey. I was able to sneak in a few bites and it was so refreshing. The girl that was behind the counter was super sweet and made everything right as you ordered it. We are really looking forward to coming back. Yay for another great local business! I hope they do well!
