I'm glad I came here an hour before closing time, that way I didn't have to wait in an hour line just to eat! **ALSO, if you're signed up with Total Rewards, you can shave a few dollars off your bill, free to sign up.***\n\nWent up to the hostess and she told us to wait in line while they got our table ready which took 5 minutes. The only awesome decor that I see that they had set up were the flames 0.0 how I wish I was able to sit next to it. The place was a full house, busy and loud of course. I didn't realize that the menu was already placed at the table and was used as decor for the silverware. Nifty :-). The waitress took a while to greet us and didn't come fill our drinks once... \n\nCouldn't decide on what to order just yet so we started with the parmesan fries which my sister and I were extremely disappointed in. They come out as steak fries which is not terrible, but when they come out soggy it's not enjoyable. The dipping sauces were delicious but it wasn't enough to make up for soggy fries. \n\nNext up was the Hell's Kitchen Burger. We took this to go since we got tired of waiting for slow service and figured it'd be a better experience to bring it to our room to enjoy. Especially having some water to drink! \nWe went upstairs, turned on the TV. Much more relaxing.... They cut our burger into two cooked at medium rare... Nice and juicy the way I like it. First bite into it... O my... I was surprised how great it was. The ingredients all came together to have this tangy jalape√±o beef burger. I wished I was filled up on fries so I would feel like a chubster wanting to eat the other half. Sadly it went to the sister.. I will definitely come back and try a few other things on the menu.
