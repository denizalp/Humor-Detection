Southwest is Southwest but what stands out now is that they finally offer internet in flight. It's $5 and worth it but the connection can be very, very slow. My advice is only buy it if you need to work on the flight but be warned the connection might be slow. But hey, we are thousands of feet in the air so it can't be a huge surprise it's slow.
