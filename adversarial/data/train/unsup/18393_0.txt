I think a clinically retarded person designed the layout of this store.\n\nI stopped in a few days ago and was pleasantly surprised to see the registers were not at the front door anymore.  I hated that my first impression was a line of people.  So no more lines at the front.  Nice.  Now you have open space.  I love that.  Maybe the idiot that did the initial design has moved on.\n\nBut wait, I need to pay for my item.  Where are the registers?  They are mysteriously nonexistent.  I had to ask the guy guarding the front door where to pay.  He has to lead me to the back of the store and find an available employee-I guess one who is authorized to handle money??  First, they want to know how I'm planning to pay.  I don't know where I would have been led had I said \"cash,\" a back alley maybe.  But since it was a credit card, I was led to another location where my transaction could be processed from a portable machine.  Okay, that's cool, but how exactly do you cue customers with this system?  If someone is already helping you, great.  But if not, good luck finding someone to take your money.  \n\nThis is a recipe for chaos, and buying on-line just became that much more attractive.
