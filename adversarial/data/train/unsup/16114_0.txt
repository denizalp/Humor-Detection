Can this really qualify as a bar?  Yes, there is a bar here, but there are so many bars in every hotel in Las Vegas that I don't think each one qualifies to be called something different. But ok, I'll play along. There's a bar here and they serve drinks. It is a few yards from the elevators to the rooms I stayed at. So did I drink here? Yes, one night. Was it pretty much the only place to drink that night? Yes, pretty much. Don't make this bar your destination in Vegas or you're really just missing the point. But for pre-gaming or post-gaming, I guess it serves its purpose.
