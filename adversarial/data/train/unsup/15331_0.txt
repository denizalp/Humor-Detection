I see this place all the time, out of the corner of my eye as I am making my usual beeline for Choklat. As something unexpected came around, I finally decided to try out Kin Sushi.\n\nFrom the looks of it, nothing is made to order. All the dishes are premade and packaged in to containers akin to the ones you find for premade sushi in Safeway, or Sobeys. \n\nAs such, the sushi all tastes like Safeway sushi, and for that, I was slightly disappointed. I guess, your expectations are a little higher when you see a place surrounded by all the fresh produce available from the Farmers Market. It wasn't bad, it was just glaringly ordinary. \n\nAnd with the prices being on par, or higher than those of other Japanese places in town that actually make the sushi to order; it's made me far less inclined to visit them in the future. I'd almost rather get Safeway sushi, because it tastes the same and it's $2 cheaper. Hey, sometimes you get a craving for sushi and don't have time to sit down in Kinjo.\n\nBut in those instances, I think I'll be heading to Kingsland and their Big Catch.
