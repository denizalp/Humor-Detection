My daughter was referred here for root canals and it was the absolute best dentist experience for us ever my daughter is terrified of dentist but they made her comfortable and reassured her she was ok the staff was just so nice and attentive they were seriously busy but that didn't stop them from asking if I needed water or a magazine.. Best place ever thanks for the great experience definitely recommending to anyone looking for root canal work!
