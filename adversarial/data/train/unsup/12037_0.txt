Netflix and chill takes on a whole new meaning at\nPearl! Who would have ever thought you could watch Netflix and get your teeth cleaned?! But you can at Pearl! They have two TVs in the room and one is on the ceiling so you can watch tv while you get your teeth cleaned. \n\nThe instant I walked into Pearl I was blown away. The chic modern design is refreshing because most dentist remind me of graveyards ( I don't like the dentist). They play techno music, which made me feel like I was in the club haha, but it lessened my nerves about the dentist. \n\nThe staff was also so friendly! My dental assistant Jen was great and Dr Jenny was very professional (my name is Jenny so I was fricken loving this place). \n\nOverall, I had one of the best dental experiences here. I'm excited to go back in two weeks to get my cavity filled- jk.
