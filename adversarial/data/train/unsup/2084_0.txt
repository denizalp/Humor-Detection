A great stop to pick up a hearty protein-packed lunch.  \n\nI love, love chipotle ketchup.  The smokey flavor from the chipotle compliments the char-grilled beef patty perfectly.  Highly recommended.  The beef itself was okay, not as juicy and flavorful as I would like.  The shoestring fries were a disappointment.  They were soft and soggy, with a lot of broken end pieces in the bowl.\n\nClassy d√©cor.  Light color walls and dark furnitures give off a modern yet classic space.  The best thing about this restaurant was the service, fast, attentive and friendly.
