Chino rocks. Seriously, for a place that looks as hole-in-the-wall as possible, this is the greatest mix of Asian, Mexican, and Jamaican foods imaginable!\n\nI'm being a bit facetious, but, seriously, there are items here that are just incredible. The Jade Red Chicken and Jen Red Pork are delicious, especially in a quesadilla. The same goes for the Jerk Pork. Their black beans are the best I've tasted, anywhere, and every one of the fried rices is delicious.\n\nTo top it all off...you get a big-ass snickerdoodle cookie at the end.\n\nDon't pass this place up.
