Heavy Metal Love! \n\nSuch a great store carrying so many band shirts, hats, patches, pins, stickers, skull caps, hats, adults to children's sizes, etc. Even onesies for those babies you are bringing up the right way as a metal head!\n\nHeavy Metal, Punk, Hard Rock & Rock merchandise of all kinds and with so many bands represented. From the well known to the obscure. \n\nGood prices too. The owner was a nice guy who chatted with us about the Montreal rock scene and life in general. Super clean, and well organized shop. Also has a dressing room to try things on before purchasing. So much cool stuff jammed into this tiny store. Right around the block from Hotel 10 where we stayed. \n\nWe made sure to drop in and make some purchases before heading back to NYC. \n\nUp The Irons! \\m\/
