They've got the hot dogs.\nYou want the hot dogs.\nThis is where you get the hot dogs downtown! \n\nUnfortunately the hot dogs do not taste very good and that is putting it politely. I have tried several variations including the chicago dog and the moki and each time i am less than thrilled.\n\nPer their website: \"At Short Leash Hotdogs our mission is to create a unique twist on a classic favorite\".\n\nI think this is part of the problem; No one asked for a hot dog served in naan bread, it's strange and unwelcome. The issue for me is the ratio of naan to hot dog, it is completely and utterly out of whack. The dogs themselves (you can choose between beef\/brat etc...) are small, particularly when placed at the bottom of a parachute-sized naan.\n\nI recently gave the chicago dog another shot. Their food truck was situated at Hance park for an event. I was let down again, I was also figuratively let down as all of the toppings fell out of the naan as I picked it up to take a bite. It seems to me that they just don't really try that hard and it shows in the food. \n\nThe staff is always polite and the actual restaurant is in a good location on Roosevelt Row but I think the concept is where they went wrong. I will not eat there again, there are far better options in the area.
