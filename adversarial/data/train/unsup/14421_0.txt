I had never been to Longboards, or whatever ill-fated establishment failed in the location prior, but watching the renovations unfold from the street piqued my interest. \n\nThe space is well decorated with a vintage western vibe - garage door windows, antiques light fixtures, and distressed wood textures.\n\nStarted with the queso loaded with jalape√±os, beans and chorizos to start. It was delicious. Beautiful, indulgent, cheesy deliciousness. Maybe the best queso I've ever had.\n\nSide note: $2 PBRs everyday in a glass boot - if that's your kind of thing.\n\nOrdered the mole and raja tacos. Enjoyed both, but they were a little smaller and not as stuffed as I had expected? Maybe they're bigger for dinner? I also enjoyed the few bites I had of the chicken chorizo tostada and will likely order that if I return.\n\nMaybe not the \"authentic Mexican street fare\" like they claim, but if anything, go for the queso!
