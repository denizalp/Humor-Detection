JUST GO SEE IT! Not only are the hunky men (well, most of them) a sight to see, but the mini games with the audience are hilarious! If a granny is in the crowd, you are guaranteed some great laughs with what the guys put her through...haha! You may be shocked at how dirrty these lil ol' ladies are.\n\nMinus one star for:\n- The *only* nudity I saw was perhaps a nutsack that slipped out of a man-thong in the dark\n- The overly excited women who kept standing and blocking my view of the visual deliciousness.\n\n$15 per person photos with the Chippendale's group (ouch), but TOTALLY worth it!! \n\nBut if you're a cheapskate, then you can take as many photos with them at the Flirt Lounge. Nothing beats the group photo though. =P
