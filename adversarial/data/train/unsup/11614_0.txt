The staff is super awesome. They make an effort to learn your name and a few things about you. Customer service sets an example for all the other places in Vegas.\n\nThe food itself is decently priced. The breading on the chicken is light and crispy with a juicy inside. Grilled veggies were seasoned nicely and weren't overcooked.\n\nSweet tea is quite nice. \n\nOverall i can see myself coming back here quite often
