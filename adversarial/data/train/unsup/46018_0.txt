It was my friend's birth day last week and after having nice dinner and roaming around the city, we finally decided to go for some desserts. Initially we were gonna go to Dolce which is a block away from this dessert shop but for some reason we ended up here. Yea, i remember we parked the car in front of this store and ran to the dessert shop like a group of zombies without giving single look at the sign. Ahaha. Anyway, thanks to our desire for sugar rush, new found glory!\n\nWe've tried several cakes. Coffee, mango, strawberry mousse, cheesecake and one i can't seem to recall. \n\nMousse was dreamy and cheese cake was also very delicious. I have to be honest and say i have had better. but never at this price. Mousse was not more than $2\/piece i remember and other cakes we picked didn't hurt our wallet at all. and they were all good as in WAY above average! Also their coconut and tiramisu gelato was AWWWWesome! \n\nBy the time i left the shop i was in sugar coma and couldn't be more careless if the world explodes in next 10 min. \n\n2 cups of gelato with 2 flavors each, several pieces of cake cost us somewhere around $17. Some say you get what you paid for but in cr√®me you can get more ;)
