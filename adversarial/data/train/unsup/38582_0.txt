Great showroom, not huge.  Comfy seats. My husband is especially wide and they accommodated him comfortably.  If you are in a seat at the outer rim, you might have to turn your neck a bit to see the stage, so if you have neck problems. make sure you are in one of the 3 center sections. The sound system is good and the temperature is too.  We have been to 5 shows here so far and each has been a good experience.  You can bring in outside drinks, but they must be in a plastic container.  There are plastic cups set up outside the showroom for you to transfer your liquids from a glass container.  The ushers are friendly.
