I dropped my car off after I had what I suspected was an exhaust leak near the engine. My local mechanic said he suspected the exhaust manifold and that I should take it to the dealer because it should be covered under exhaust warranty. Toyota of Beford said they found nothing wrong and all is operating correctly. I then took it to Classic Toyota in Mentor. Within an hour of dropping it off they called me back and said they found the front right exhaust manifold was bad and needed replacing. They said it would be covered under warranty. Wonder why Bedford didn't find it. Could it be that I am 1500 miles under my warranty expiring? Or perhaps they are just incompetent. I would avoid them regardless.
