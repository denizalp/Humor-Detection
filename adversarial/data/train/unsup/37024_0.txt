I want to write a review on Medshape Weight Loss Clinic in Mesa, AZ because I have been a patient there for the last 6 months. This place is fantastic. I started the weight loss program at 212 pounds and so far I am down to 163 pounds. I mostly meet with the owner on my weekly visits. Sometimes I met with many different people. They have their staff go to other locations frequently. Reading other reviews, people seem to want to complain about seeing different staff. From my experience, I learn new things from each person I meet with and liked seeing different people. I also hear this is the reason they float their staff. My likes are: you eat real food, don't have tor purchase anything extra, you learn new weight loss techniques, you can follow the new app on your phone, there staff is very helpful, they care about you genuinely, there are a lot of medical staff, the program really works. You really have to Want to lose weight. Ig you don't want it, it obviously won't work. Also follow what you are told. This is the most important part. Don't blame someone else if you can't follow the program. This is not a miracle but will work if you do it.
