Eh!\n \nI was excited to try this new place on my lunch since they offer quite a few vegetarian options. However, I was less than thrilled with my food that I ordered. I chose the Adopted Luke veggie burger, grilled corn and strawberry lemonade.\n \nCons:\n \nTaste: While the quality of the food may be great, the taste is not \"good\" at all. Nothing on my veggie burger was seasoned. It was extremely bland  and unappealing.\n \nPrice: I paid $14 + for a veggie burger, side and drink -_- \n \nPros:\n \nCustomer service: I ended up requesting a new corn on the cob after  I saw that I received the smallest corn that they had on the grill. It was extremely small to the point that It shouldn't have been sold at its normal price of almost $5. The employees settled this issue quickly and even offered that I keep both cobs (I declined ).\n \nGrilled corn: Though my original corn was tiny , it was replaced with an average sized piece that was pretty good. The jalape√±o\/ cilantro ranch was delish! It probably would be a great compliment to the bland burger that I got.
