Visited this location to celebrate a friends birthday. We were greeted and welcomed by a friendly hostess and seated fairly quickly. We were then greeted by our server who took our drink order and allowed us some time to look over the menu. \n\nThis visit I opted for the chicken scampi. One of my definite favorite dishes. Served with chicken fillets, bell peppers, onions over angel hair pasta in a light garlic butter wine sauce...omg droool!!! Still love the salad dressing. The bread sticks are a bit salty. \n\nOur server was great, he was attentive and friendly.  He was able to embarrass my friend by singing happy birthday to him so I was utterly pleased!!
