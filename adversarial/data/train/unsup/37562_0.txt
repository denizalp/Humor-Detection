Traveling with my boss, we had dinner here since it was convenient to the hotel. Food was good as usual but we ended up with a young man who had not been a waiter for very long. Brought us a bottle of Cabernet when we ordered a bottle of Chardonnay.  Told us he had never opened a bottle of wine before. Expected better service at a place like Mitchell's.
