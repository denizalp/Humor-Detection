This place is a diamond in the rough. Let me start by saying they have the best remoulade. I want to buy it to use at home! My favorite thing to order here is the special $9.99(with the purchase of any beverage) fried seafood basket. I always get it with oysters.  It also comes with fries,  coleslaw,  & hush puppies. The oysters are large.  The breading is just right,  not too thick or greasy. \n\nThe only downfall of this place is the service. The problem is two fold.  On one hand they are understaffed. The waitresses are spread too thin covering many jobs that would typically be back of the house responsibilities in a restaurant. On the other hand the waitresses themselves are not adequately trained\/skilled in working multiple parties at once. That shortcoming ultimately falls on management.\n\nThis isn't fine dining, but good flavors and foods for an affordable price.
