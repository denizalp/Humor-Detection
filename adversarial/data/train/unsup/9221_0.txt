A warm and inviting cafeteria style restaurant with decorated cushioned benches along the walls.  I love the menu and the empanada \"glam shots\" on the walls! Very well thought out and attractive!  \n\nWe were served by one of the owners and everything he recommended was delightful--the soup, the beef, chicken and humita empanadas were beautifully wrapped and so comforting to eat :d The owner was so kind and attentive.  \n\nThey've elevated the humble empanada to stand alone! The beef and chicken are especially good with a drizzle of lemon.  The wraps were nice and crusty. \n\nI also had the beet salad which was good and the tomato, cheese, basil empanada but since I'm not vegetarian I preferred the meat ones more :D
