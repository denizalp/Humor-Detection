The best thing about this place is that it comes with a side of religion. I guess the founder is some kind of cult leader. Whatevs - judgment free zone. But the place is TINY. There are maybe 3 seats and they're small. Small like Ikea children's dining set small. And while they explained the long wait was because they were training a new cook, the only thing we could do was watch the TV that plays supreme leader's propaganda on loop. \n\nOther than that the food was pretty bland. A lot of rice noodles. Not a lot of vegetables. IMHO, to be a good veg restaurant you have to be good with vegetables and not simply remove meat from dishes.
