Second visit in two weeks, decided to have it again for my cheat meal. I love the simplicity of the burgers made at this place - their beef patty is made from ground sirloin fresh daily and is not greasy at all. Toppings are always fresh as well and the bun just compliments the burger \n (and no I have no tried other gourmet burgers: Burger's Priest or Holy Chuck - as FB is my go to joint) Ordered it with fries again, same quality as my last review, delicious. They do have California fries which are not on the menu but you can order it - which consists of caramelized onions cooked on the stove top with american cheese and then their fresh burger sauce. It was pretty delicious if you're on an onion person because they load that thang up. Anyhow - will be coming back soon.
