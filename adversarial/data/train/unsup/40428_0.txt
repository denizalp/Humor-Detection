I always forget how expenssive Bumble and Bumble salons and stuff are... \n\nI do like my cut and color. \n\nRafael was very sweet also. \n\nI like a little more energy and conversation when I am saloning though, I know that not everyone does, but I do. I am very talky talky. \n\nIf it weren't so expenssive I would certainly go back. I will have to think on it though, just because of the cost... I am not used to spending 130 on cut and color! : (
