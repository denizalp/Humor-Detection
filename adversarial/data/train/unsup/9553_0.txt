When in France, eat french toast. That's what I say. And really? It just makes sense. If they didn't make good french toast, why would they stake their nationality on it?\n\nThe french toast is deeeelicious at Le Papilion, a great French place that I've only visited for brunch. It's not too fancy, but clean, friendly and I can read things on the menu (I appreciate that, thank you). \n\nRun! Go! Eat some eggy-bread goodness!
