Glorified Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles ($15.95) is a must order item.\nWho doesn't love fried chicken & waffles? This is one of their popular item on their menu and the portion is HUGE. Perfect to share with people. Definitely in love with  their smoked bacon waffles and fried leeks. The little bit of tiny bites of bacon inside of crispy waffle & fried leeks, and you eat it all together with fried chicken breast (crispy outside and juicy chicken meat inside). What more could you ask for a perfect brunch meal like this? The taste of savory fried chicken & waffle with sweet syrup pouring all over and every bite in my mouth is like heave. It's so delicious yet very filling. This is a highly recommenced item and it definitely hits the spot!
