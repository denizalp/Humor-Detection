This was my first visit ever to a BRAVO and loved the whole experience from the moment I walked in the door with a girlfriend for a girls night out. \n\nMy friend suggested the restaurant for dinner and wine. I made a reservation with open table to gain more points and use my $20 gift card from open table. \n\nIt was such a good night! The restaurant was mostly empty, many dinners choice to eat outside, it was a nice warm evening for it. \n\nWe started with bread and oil. I ordered the Chicken - Bacon  Flatbread, I also ordered a Caesar Salad and Wedding Soup EXCELLENT! The soup reminded  me of the Wedding Soup we used to order at Johnny Carinos, I so miss that restaurant in Monroeville. \n\nThe Moscato Wine was very tasty ! I had Two glasses. \n\nMy girlfriend ordered, The Bravo Pasta dish, she offered a taste, it was delicious  !! \n\nThe atmosphere and service I enjoyed. \n\nI whole heartedly recommend this restaurant and I know we will return. I will return with family as well.\n\nUPDATE:   Second dinner - Birthday celebration bring us back \nExcellent service and dinner as first time. \nHighly Recommend!!
