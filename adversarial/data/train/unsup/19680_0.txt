I chose to stay at a cheaper Fairfield Inn for this Madison trip but someone I was traveling with who outranked me wanted to stay here. She said it was 10 miles closer to our next destination though it was $40 more. I don't know..I tend to try to save money. However, since she chose this place and we would be staying at a nicer hotel, I was in!\n\nBeing a full service Marriott, it's pretty nice. It's still a bit old fashioned and the rooms are all surrounding this hollow center and the atrium houses the restaurant. Such a waste of space I thought and it's a perfect place for a jumper to make brain splashing everywhere. I wonder if it ever happened? Every time I looked down from the 10th floor, I had that imagination in my head of jumping.\n\nAnyway...they gave me an upgrade this time. I had an expanded junior suite with living area. That was nice. The room was really spacious. The concierge lounge wasn't bad at all. We had breakfast there and they used real eggs for the scrambled eggs. It was so creamy and not like those dried hard scrambled eggs made from dehydrated egg powder.\n\nOne thing I really don't care with all the full service Marriott is their toiletries. They used to have Bath and Body Works but now they switched to a brand called Than. Not sure wtf is Than but it smells too oaky woody masculine for me. Ugh. Change it. \n\nOther than that, It was a good stay and I have stayed here many times before. If the price is right, I'd be over again soon!!
