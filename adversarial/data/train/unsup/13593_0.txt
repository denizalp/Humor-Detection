I promised that I would re-review this place if I could go in and have an experience that didn't destroy anyone's life in the name of customer service.\n\nSo I did just that this morning.  My sister and I wanted coffee, so we stopped in, had a nice cup of joe, the music was decent, the overall vibe was decent, the customer service was spot on, and worked well to accentuate this return visit.\n\nI wanted so badly to like this place from my last review, and here I am, on the precipice of second chances.  And what do you know?  For all of our sakes, I can finally say it: I really DO like this place.\n\nNow I just want to return, peruse their record collection for some unique, quirky album, and try out some of their other foodstuffs.\n\nI still need to work on my poem from last time, though.  I may call it \"Despair's Jamocha\".
