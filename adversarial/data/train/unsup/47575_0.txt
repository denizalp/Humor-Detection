I booked to take my daughter here for her birthday for a unique experience. I really did hesitate with the 2 star rating because I think the concept is great and our server, Victor, was amazing too, but at the end of the day they are trying to sell this place as a restaurant.\n\nThe appetizers were fine, I had calamari and my wife had the arugula salad.\n\nUnfortunately the main courses were where they really fell flat. My wife had risotto with shrimp and said the risotto was terrible, my daughter and I both had the filet mignon and thought the mashed potatoes were far too runny and overly garlicky too. But the bigger problem was the meat - i took mouth after mouth of fat which when your not able to see what you were eating really made it hard to continue. My son had the penne with red sauce and said it was fine - that might have been the safer choice in hindsight.\n\nAs I said, i really didn't want to go 2 stars, but the food quality wound't let me go any higher. Sorry.
