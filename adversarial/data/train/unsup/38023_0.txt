I always get a chicken burrito, so I can only speak to the quality of those, but I find them tasty and very filling. Occasionally I find a piece of chicken that's burned or mostly fat, but I can forgive them during the lunch rush (and it is VERY rushed). The food has a lot if taste and is just the right amount of spicy. The guacamole tends to be a little too salty, though.\n\nService is speedy, but be careful if you want to eat in the restaurant. It's often full of hungry, loud college students (of which I am one) and can be hard to find a seat.
