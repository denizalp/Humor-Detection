First, I'll just get this out of the way before I go on my rant. The food there is a 6 out of 10. It's ok but nothing to go crazy about. \nHere's where I go crazy. I hate this place! The only reason I've been here maybe 6 or 7 times is because my 11 yr old daughter loves it. Why? I have no clue. Maybe it's because she doesn't have to deal with that complete cluster f**k of a mess when you try to order and the painful process of walking that line all the way to the register. \nSo I order my sandwiches at the first stop, then stop 2 is salads and you either order salads or keep moving down the line to soups. Then I stop to give them my soup order and then I'm getting asked what I ordered! Why? You would think maybe so they can hook the correct soup with the correct sandwich. Nope! Not sure why they ask because they're just putting soup bowls on the tray. \nAfter that, you arrive at the register and they ask you for a 3rd time \"what did you order?\" At which point, I'm about to lose it and freak out on all of them. It's so unorganized and when someone like me orders for the entire family and I have to remember all 6 sandwiches, what soups go with what sandwiches and then I have to repeat it a total of 3 times? Not to mention they rush you and that doesn't help when you're trying to get through the process so you can just sit down and eat. \nYou people need to get your act together! I can understand this happening the first couple days of grand opening but by this point, one would think that this place would have streamlined this process! Nope! It's gotten worse as time goes on. \nAt this point, I'm willing to bribe my daughter with just about anything up to and including a car for her 16th birthday to prevent having to go to this place again!\nIf you dare go here after reading these reviews about what a cluster it is, make sure you come armed with Xannax or your medical marijuana cuz you'll need it 10 mins into this circus!\nI'll get my soup and sandwiches elsewhere!
