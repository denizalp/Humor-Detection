I live in the neighbourhood and have passed this place a number of times, but not being vegan nor thinking that 'unchicken' sounds particularly appealing have not ventured in. I went for the first time yesterday and left with what I can only describe as a mild case of food poisoning. I had the Hogtown Burger with a side of Mac and Cheese, and I'm fairly sure it was the mac and cheese that did it. I like to think that I have a hardy stomach, but when I got to the bottom of the bowl and saw about 2cm of orange grease I knew I had made a mistake.\n\nIn short, if you're in the neighbourhood and want good vegan food that isn't some outlandish combination of tofu\/meat substitutes masquerading as soul food then go to Banjara, which is basically right next door. I will never understand this obsession that vegans have with eating meat-like foods. Veggies are delicious in their own right, and I'd rather have a bowl of roast brocolli than tofu drenched in soy cheese.
