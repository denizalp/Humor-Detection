Maybe I've been watching too much AMC but Hotel Valley Ho made me feel like I was in an episode of Mad Men...and that's a good thing!\n\nI was here for a couple of nights attending a work conference. I arrived a bit early before check-in  so I went for a quick bite inside the hotel restaurant. Although the burger was a bit on the pricy side, the ZuZu burger and fries were very tasty and started my experience at Hotel Valley Ho on the right foot.\n\nAfter eating and strolling by the  surprising awesome pool scene, I checked into my room. The cool\/hip rooms had a mix of modern amenities with throwback colors. There was a huge, deep tub I took advantage of on the first night. The separate stand-up shower was also spacious and very nice. The 2 queen bed were comfy and everything felt\/appeared to be clean and well maintained.\n\nFor one of the conference mixers we were able to use the balcony terrace just before sunset. The views of the mountains and dessert were amazing with tons of photo ops. When it finally became dark the outdoor space was well lit and our conference patrons enjoyed drinks made by the friendly bartenders. The space was well kept and really worked well for our function. \n\nAfter a couple days at Hotel Valley Ho it was time to check out. Overall I had a great experience. From amenities to the friendly staff to the great retro design, Hotel Valley Ho really made the conference a great success. Not sure when I'll ever be back to Scottsdale but I'll have to come up with some excuse just so I can stay here again.
