Here is what you need to know: JC's served me the best pancakes I've ever had in my life and they came with pure maple syrup, to boot! This was a match made in heaven and since being there, I haven't been able to get them out of my mind. The good people of Geauga County take their maple syrup seriously, and JC's truly went the extra mile to make sure the stacks we received were both fluffy and cooked to perfection. Try the cinnamon or chocolate chip variety. The coffee was very underwhelming, but seemed fresh. Next time I'll skip it and grab a cup at the coffee shop around the corner, instead. \n\n \nReal maple syrup on the side - $2.50 for 4 oz and one order is enough to share (They will give you a small to-go cup if you can't finish it). Breakfast served until noon on the weekends.
