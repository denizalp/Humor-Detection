One of my bridesmaids and I were tasked with purchasing liquor for my pre-wedding\/bachelorette festivities, but we stumbled upon this gem while en route to the liquor store at the strip mall next to Encore. I've frequented Tacos El Gordo in San Diego, but since I've moved back to the East Coast, I wasn't keeping up with the chain's expansion so I was ecstatic to find run into one in Vegas!\n\nI stuck with my favorite, lengua (tongue) for $2.25 each and devoured it. 3 tacos is probably more than enough. The food is super fresh and the service is quick and there's plentiful seating so you can be in and out. They also have Mexican drinks such as horchata (!!!) readily available to be dispensed.\n\nI'm definitely coming back again when I'm in Vegas!
