I'd love to go to this place very near to my place,breakfast is so cheap and delicious.\nI hope they will improved more like the fish section and meat,I was disappointed seeing how they prep the fish on display ,seems like they don't have procedures on the proper handling of thawed fish,I saw this guy adding ice  he removed the salmon fish heads on display I thought he will removed it or changed the fish on display but he put it back on his cart with water from thawed Salmon heads in plastic  so the poor fish heads for display is like swimming on the water at the cart I was watching him doing it,thinking he would change the fish on display ,he added more ice and returned the fish heads on display  I was standing next to him . I hope u must follow proper handling g of fish consider temperature,and contamination issues...this is our Filipino market we should be proud and make sure you follow proper sanitary guidelines to avoid contamination and maintain highest standard at all times.your meat labels says Mexico,USA ,Canada why not specific?wild or farmed fish ,origin?
