How can you deny this place 5 Stars? Was having crave attacks in NC***\n****\nIs it the sauce? Or the meat? Can't be the buns hun cause sometimes I go protein style. Whatever causes a fluctuation in my brain to gravitate towards an In-N-Out, don't even wanna know.\n\nThe menu is simple, and they don't do breakfast or other foo foo stuff. Just honest to goodness burgers, shakes, n fries. Their slogan \"Ordering as easy as 1,2,3\" is exact. The \"secret menu\" is not so secure as most diners order a variety of ways to enjoy.\n\nFounded in 1948, they have been pounding out great fresh food and thats most likely the key habit-forming ingredient. All I know, the urge to have an In-N-Out makes my car swerve to one, every now and then, although more often every time :)
