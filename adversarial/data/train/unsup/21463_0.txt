After a trip to Valley of Fire State Park with one of my former students and his family,we came here because his wife had been told that this restaurant had the best BBQ pork in Las Vegas.  They may, but you couldn't tell it by me.\n\nThe place is very small and we had to wait about 10 minutes before they put two tables together so the 5 of us could sit.\n\nI think I may have simply ordered wrong.  I got # 71, BBQ pork chow fun (dry style).  It was good but there was nothing with the BBQ pork that stood out. \n\nI did however want to grab one of their Peking ducks and run out the door quickly.  They would have stopped me I'm sure.
