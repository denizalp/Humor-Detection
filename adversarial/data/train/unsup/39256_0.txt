Since this outlet came to the area I shop no where else! love the store selection and the walking areas are very well kept, the have fire places in the sitting areas when it chilly out. I know it's in expansion so I am hoping to get a larger variety of places to eat but there is so much construction going on that I am sure thats in the near future. It gets really full for the holiday weekends so do your shopping during the weekdays
