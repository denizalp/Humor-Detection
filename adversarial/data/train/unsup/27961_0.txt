Recently stayed at the Hilton during a \"boys night out\" on a Saturday night into Sunday.  Did a Google search and booked through priceline.com.  We reached the hotel around 3 in the afternoon on Saturday driving down from Ajax.  Tip#1 If you are staying here and coming in from an area which the Go Train services I would recommend taking the train instead of driving because if you look for overnight parking around the hotel it is going to run you $35.\n\nCheck in was smooth and woman at front desk was very pleasant, smiling and welcoming.  Room had 2 queen sized beds...very comfortable and clean.  Free wi-fi, large flatscreens, safe, microwave, coffee maker and fridge.  Washroom could have used a fan in the ceiling to eliminate condensation built up from shower. \n\nCheck out was smooth and had the same front desk woman taking care of our invoice.  She asked all the right questions to make sure we had a great stay.\n\nI would stay here again and recommend.
