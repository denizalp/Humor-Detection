First of all their self parking is small a fuck. Came here on a Monday and they didn't even have one spot open second of all. They have a $100 hold on you card like what the fuck. I was just at diff hotel and they didn't do that for us. Never comin back. Their signs are ambiguous and barely any taxis. I want to shit on this place n never come back
