I am giving this two star review based solely on the poor service we received here on Monday July 6th.  We are regulars of Wahoos and I wanted Paul to know that this is the kind of poor service that is being given here when Victor is not around.  From the beginning when we were placing our order, the cashier seemed indifferent and wasn't personable at all like Wahoos employees normally are.  Shortly after, the same girl brought our chips and salsa.  My Dad clearly asked for two pico salsas and some Cholula hot sauce.  The girl came back with one pico salsa and an empty bottle of Cholula.  When I approached her and asked for another bottle that actually had some in it she gave an attitude.  Shortly after, she dropped the empty bottle and it shattered all over the floor.  Another girl that worked there finally brought a second pico salsa after asking again for it.  The food was served by this other girl as well who seemed to have talked to the other girl as she also had a bit of an attitude and the food was served lukewarm.  Really ruined the whole experience so much that my Dad who loves Wahoos said he probably won't go back to this location as this has happened once before to him at the same spot.  My wife and I have experienced the same problems here but it had improved greatly since Victor was brought in to this location to get it squared away.  Every time we eat here and Victor is working, it is nothing but a positive experience.  I wish I could give the girls name who had such an attitude and gave such poor service but of course she wasn't wearing a name tag (imagine that).  I can say that she had blonde hair and wore a low cut t shirt and short shorts and worked on July 6th.  Have to give a big thumbs down to her and her poor attitude and say that I will be hesitant to go back here unless I know Victor is working!  Need to clean house on some of these employees that want to just show up and get their paycheck without any care for the customer experience!!!
