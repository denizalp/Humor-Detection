Shame on me for not reading reviews before eating at this Applebee's.  \n\nMet some friends for lunch this week.  The wise choice for us was Applebee's (off Warm Springs) because it was one of the closest restaurants to my friends work.  What started as a wise choice, ended with an overall 3 star review.  If you read other reviews like I did not, you can probably guess what the issue was.  That's right, service here is amazingly slow.  My friend works in the buildings right next to this Applebees and one of our other friends works within 10 minutes.  The plan was for me to arrive and then let them know once I'm seating.  I just wish now that I ordered ahead of time, like 45 minutes ahead of time.  We ordered our food at 12 PM and by 12:35 PM, nothing.  The waitress was called over and we asked about our food.  Viola! Within 10 minutes we got our food after complaining.  This led to speed eating since both my friends had to get back to work.  Long story short, this place doesn't get packed for lunch, they are just slow for lunch.  This is also the same song and dance if you read the other reviews.  C'mon Applebee's...your customers are trying to tell you something. \n\nAs for the food, I got their Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp.  I had an extra chicken breast added just for good measure.  The overall meal actually tasted pretty good, but that was just taste.  Texture wasn't so great. Both my chicken breast were a little dry. \n\nOverall, I think I'm being generous with 3 stars.  I am giving them 3 stars only because I finished my plate.  Service needs to get better, at least faster.\n\nBourbon Street Chicken & Shrimp:   http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=2ur8pXFTFraCZnKwSEV4BA&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\nLovely Pair:  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=QHGjqvOeYqQEo01Gr6KlqQ&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ
