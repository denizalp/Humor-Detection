Located near the K-Mart and behind Si Se√±or Mexican restaurant. \n\nThe facilities are nice and seem to be well kept. Soap starts up very quickly when using the sprayer or the brush, which saves time, effort, and money. \n\nPrices are a little high compared to other self serve car washes I've been to. To get started with 4 minutes it costs $2.75. Luckily, I like to race against the clock so four minutes is enough time for me to soap, brush, and rinse most vehicles. \n\nWould recommend prices be reduced to $2 to start for 3 minutes. 3.5 stars but bumped to 4.
