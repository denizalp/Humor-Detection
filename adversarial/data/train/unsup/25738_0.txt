As I was sitting, Jennifer came to get me and she was very friendly and energetic. She reminded me of Katie Hudson. She made me feel very comfortable. She answered all my questions and she explained everything clearly with enthusiasm. I wasn't sure about the nurse that helped me out I think her name was ivana? Even though she had a smile on and was nice, her body language just told me that she might be tired or lazy ? She wasn't friendly like jennifer. She didn't explain to me or introduce me to the machine she was going to use. As she was preparing for the procedure, she was talking and explaining things without looking at me or paying attention. She sounded like she was memorizing a script, which is why I didn't understand or remember any of what she said. As a nurse I think she should have been more helpful, friendly, and show at least concern and interest that she wanted to help me out. I have another appt with them and I hope she's more perky this time.
