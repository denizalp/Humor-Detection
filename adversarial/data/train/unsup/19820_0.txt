I drove by Poorani Vilaas an Indian takeout joint almost everyday after work, sometimes even after 9 PM. This place is still open and looks busy. \n\nI finally went in and check it out this afternoon, since I have no time for a sit down lunch and takeout seems like a much better idea.\n\nWhen I entered the store, I was greeted warmly.. but I really have no idea what should I get and what tastes good! I think eat in an Indian restaurant once in my whole life time.\n\nThanks for the lady at the counter being so helpful. Answering all my questions! Since none of the items are labelled.\n \n\"What is that?\" \"What is this?\"\n\"It is spicy?\" \"It is sweet?\"\n\"What's inside?\"\n\"How does it taste like?\"\n\nEven when she told me what that is, I am still not sure.... \nShe was really nice offer to let me tast the yellow looking rice (which is really spicy fried rice with chicken) and a pastry like mini donut thing that is salty...(I still not sure what that is) If I can taste everything  :)!\n\nAnyway, I decide with Biryani (chicken fried rice), 1 chicken curries and 2 Vaaipan (brown baseball looking thing, she told me is sweet with banana inside). The meal also comes with a tomato salad full of chilli pepper, yeah!!!\n\nI have to tell you the food is really good. Spicy enough that I don't need to add anymore hot sauce. But the smell is really strange, the whole office ask me what I am having for lunch!\n\nAll the prices includes taxes. \n\nI would definitely go back and try out other items they offer.  \n\nExcellent services, clean environment and friendly staffs!
