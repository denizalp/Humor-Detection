My son was recently diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. There are two things he can't stand; pants (sigh) and haircuts. When the clippers get near his ears he freaks out. I was so nervous taking him somewhere to get his haircut but Mrs. B made everything so easy. Her room is colorful, big enough to fit 6 of us in there, and was filled with things kids love. She put on his favorite show and turned the volume up  to max. He doesn't like wearing a cape so she put on a fireman jacket and he tolerated that much better (who would've thought?). She started the cut by letting him hold the clippers and then help her cut his hair so he knew what she was doing. Every time is got too overwhelming she would take a break and let him touch the clippers. After 15 minutes his hair was cut beautifully, he didn't cry a single time, he got a lollipop, and he gave her a high-five. She just got a client for life and we'll recommend her to everyone we know.
