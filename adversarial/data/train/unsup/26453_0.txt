I usually don't comment much on breakfast places because I usually order the same typical breakfast regardless of where I go, but I especially liked this particular place; my bf and I came here on a weekday morning, staff was very friendly and very observant in terms of coffee refills. Their menu has interesting selections; we ordered a breakfast poutine and my typical breakfast (haha), I'm usually not a big fan of poutine, but it's not too heavy as breakfast here with the way how they made it.\n\nThe place doesn't look it from the outside, but it felt quite homey on the inside, staff was very friendly, food was great. I'm not a morning person but it felt like a great relaxing morning. Would definitely go back again.
