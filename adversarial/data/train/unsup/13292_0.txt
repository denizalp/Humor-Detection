Okay, I get this place isn't for every one and it definitely is not amazing food.  But there are some definite bonuses especially for people with children.  We happen to be here on a weekday evening to pick up an entertainment center, so we decided to be lazy and eat here as well.  I like that they have high chairs and bibs for the little ones AND if you buy an adult meal, it comes with free baby food pouch!  And honestly, mashed potatoes, mac and cheese is pretty kid friendly.  The kids meals are $2.50 and adult meals are $4.99....that's dirt cheap.  But thank goodness the food quality doesn't reflect the price.  They have some healthy options besides the Swedish meatballs they are known for.  They have antibiotic free roasted chicken which is a nice healthier option paired with a salad or the vegetables.  Also, the stuffed chicken with brie looked pretty tasty...tasty enough that the couple was willing to wait for it to be cooked ahead of me.  They also have microwaves to warm up food for the kiddos if you brought your own food for them.  All in all a good experience, the dining area is clean and there's tons of space to spread out.
