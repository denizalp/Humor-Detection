This is the largest Express I have been to.  Great deals and great selections.  The staff members were very helpful and very nice.  I ended up buying a jacket I've been eyeing for for awhile now but didn't want to spend $159.00 for it.  I came to this express and it was on sale for $40.00 and they had many sizes when all the other stored sold out of it.  The men's section also had a large selection and stocked with sale items.\n\nEnded up purchasing over $400.00 dollars worth of clothing for only $92.00.  Well stocked, many selections, great deals, and friendly staff, short lines... That deserves 5 stars in my book.
