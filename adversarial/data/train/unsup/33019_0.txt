I came here for the first time with a couple of friends earlier this week and we had such an amazing waiter, Anthony! Very welcoming, attentive and amusing so service is 10\/10. Should totally have the brussel sprouts nachos or their beef machaca tacos, too; they're so delicious! I will definitely be back soon (:
