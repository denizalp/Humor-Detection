Outstanding experience!  Raquel and Dr. Ensign were caring, compassionate, thorough in their assessment and explanations!  Lucky has found a new concierge practice in town!  We came in for an emergency and even though they were booked solid they managed to squeeze us in with minimal wait time. I'm beyond pleased!
