I love this place! For the past 3 years, I have been frequenting the Line Thai Restaurant even though it's quite a drive for me. The food is outstanding and the service is friendly and accommodating. I've brought guests in the past who are on special medical diets. The chefs are more than happy to cook to order. To add to it all, the atmosphere is quiet and the seating is spacious. If you like Thai food, check out the Line Thai, for sure!!
