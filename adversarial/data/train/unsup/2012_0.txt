For the longest time, I drove past this place thinking it was called the \"Clam Jumper\". Now that I know better... well, I still call it that anyway. It's not bad for what it is: a junior Cheesecake Factory knockoff with a giant menu of massive portions of super-caloric food and laughably huge cake slices for dessert (for $11, natch). \n\nSLIDERS were dry and overcooked, served with LTOP but no condiment sauces? Enjoyed the good-quality thick-cut cheddar, selected side of SPICY THAI SLAW which was actually really fresh and light.\nBF got the TRI TIP PLATE, meat was a bit tough but well seasoned with a tasty demi sauce, sided with nice roasted veggies and some dismal mashed potatoes. Added a large cup of the CHICKEN TORTILLA SOUP, which was actually really flavorful!\n\nPortions were huge, left stuffed. Service was friendly. Much like CF, menu doesn't really have a focus so it's hard to decide what to order.
