Mmm... Pita Jungle.\nI had been craving it all week and finally my lunch buddies decided they wanted to go. This location is BUSY at lunch time; full of corporate type as well as families with children (bad idea to bring kids at lunchtime, it's just WAY too packed). Yesterday we were seated at the bar. I was kind of irritated (only mildly) because when we walked in, we were greeted by the hostess and a guy I assume to be an owner or a \"big wig\". The \"big wig\" looked us up and down like we didn't really belong in the place, I really don't know what that was all about. So I asked if we could sit at the bar, we were initially told there was no room, but then an employee that was sitting at the bar decided to move to let us sit (duh). So that little irritation aside, we were seated and greeted again by a very nice bartender\/server. I mentioned that I was STARVING and ordered the pita burrito, the bartender asked me if I've ever had the Medchilada. I said no, she said \"Oh you must try it, it's full of beans and you can add chicken.\" PERFECT. After a very short wait, our orders arrived. My friend had the Philly Chicken Pita and the other had the broiled chicken pita. EVERYONE was in pita heaven! My food was so flavorful! The chicken was moist and tender, there were about 3 different beans in the dish. I don't usually eat brown rice because it tends to be crunchy or too grainy, Pita Jungle has managed to make brown rice moist and enjoyable! very nice! The only thing I would change about my food is that it had A TON of chicken in it and it almost overwhelmed the dish. Pita Jungle is and will remain one of my favorite \"long lunch\" spots!
