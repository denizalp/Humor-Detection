I'm not impressed.  This store is large and has lots of stuff, but it's a bit disorganized.  The front of the store (check-out) is also a bit of a mess.  Sometimes the line is really long.  When it is, there is often a second clerk behind the counter, doing something, but not checking people out.\n\nThey are also out-of-stock on LOTS of stuff, like all those balloons they have on display.  \"No, we don't have that one.  Don't have that one, either...\"  Why have such a large store and not keep it stocked?\n\nFinally, the associates there are sometimes a bit on the not-so-friendly side.  I won't go so far as to say \"rude,\" but they sure don't seem to be having a good day at work, and it shows.  They must not like working there...
