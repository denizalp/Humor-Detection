I was super excited about this little tavern while in Cleveland.  Overall, I found the food to be average, the atmosphere to be timid, and the service left me wanting more. The beer selection is large, so if you are looking for a bar with food options, this might be your place.  If you are looking for a place with awesome food, you may want to try a different option.
