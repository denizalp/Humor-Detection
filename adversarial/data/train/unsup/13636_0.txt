This Starbucks can often be a cluster in the mornings. It is situated in a very busy commercial center surrounded by not only UMC, but a lot of other medical facilities. It is also just down the road from the fancy pants Rancho Circle area of town where there's a lot of $$$ homes. So you really get an interesting mix of people here.\n\nLuckily the staff are equipped to handle the mornings. I've only ever waited maybe 5-6 minutes for a drink after placing the order, even when it's slammed.\n\nParking is a bitch though. If you don't want to deal with that, there's another Stabucks further North down Rancho that has a drive-thru, but in my opinion has much slower service.
