I've come to Saddle Ranch primarily as a bar, but have eaten there once or twice as well. I prefer it to other bars in the area because of the overall atmosphere.  It's a bit more laid back and less pretentious than McFadden's tries to be.  Never a cover charge (a plus in my book), and watching fools on the mechanical bull is always good for a few laughs.  A few weeks back in particular we went to the bar in the back just as the bartender was shutting that station down, but she went out of her way to make us all one last drink before she completely closed up shop.  A little customer service like that goes a long way!  As far as food goes I remember is being ok for the most part, aside from the sweet potato fries which were great with the side of cinnamon, marshmallow-ish dip (just try it, it's good).
