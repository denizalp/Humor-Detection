Its been a continuous stream of problems since arriving.  First my room keys didn't work. Than my bathtub overflowed while in the hall trying to get my problems addressed. \n\nThere are no menus in the rooms . They email them to you.  Unfortunately,  I ran out of time to order food.\n\nStill waiting for housekeeping to bring my a bath robe for which I spoke to 3 different people. \n\nNow security is showing up wanting to fill out a report.  Demis from the hotel management was rude, accused me for the flooding problem and wanted to charge me $200.  The head of maintenance agreed with me and dropped any extra cleaning fee. \n\nI am hoping that senior hotel management sees this post and can provide some assistance.\n\nCurrently, I plan to stay elsewhere on future visits to Las Vegas.
