Relaxing atmosphere, sinfully rich dessert and fairly priced.  This pretty much sums up my opinion of Main Street Bakehouse.  \n\nWe ordered a cinnamon roll ($4), a butter tart ($3.25) and a coffee.  The baked items were wonderfully sweet.  I trust you can \"see\" the sugar from the pictures.  The outer ring of the cinnamon roll was a bit hard to the bite, but the rest was moist and soft and fresh.  There was a strong buttery taste, too.  The outside of the butter tart was surprisingly not too sticky.  The inside was all gooey.  It was sugar heaven.  I was glad we didn't add sugar to the coffee.  I needed that bitterness to balance the sweetness.\n\nThe ambiance and decor is rustic and relaxing.  The furniture looks cute yet it is comfortable.  The staffs are friendly.  This cafe is perfect for a coffee chat on a weekend day.
