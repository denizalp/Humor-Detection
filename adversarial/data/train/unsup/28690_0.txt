Ummm, wow! My family tried Yogis Grill (delivered by Uber Eats) tonight and I honestly was not expecting it to be this great! The prices are awesome for the large portions you get. I had the spicy tuna bowl with cucumber and avocado. It was so good! My only complaint about it is that it was a little skimpy on the sauce and if you want more than what's on it you have to pay extra for it. Maybe having it in a separate sauce container would be good so you can put as much on as you like. Edit: you don't pay extra for more sauce, you just have to specify that you want it. \n\nOverall I would highly recommend Yogis Grill, everyone in my family enjoyed their quality, delicious meals!
