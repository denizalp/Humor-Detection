I think we got ripped off here as the \"drunk tourists.\" It's off strip (we walked) but there were all these rules about number of hookahs, drink orders, etc. Also, they were not happy that we had pizza from next door but were just passive aggressive about it.\n\nLots of selection on flavors. Overall, a too expensive & inside was so smoky 2 of our friends got ill just walking in.
