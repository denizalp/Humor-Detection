Pure unadulterated MADNESS.  Just happened to be in area and in need of groceries.  After dodging zombies I settled in for what was almost a 20+ minute wait to make my purchase.  Despite the growing lines there was no relief in site as no other lanes opened.  I was but a lemming drawn to a cliff of low prices.
