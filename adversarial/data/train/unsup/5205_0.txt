I recently took my VW Jetta in to have a scratch\/dent repaired on my door and let me just say the service and workmanship done by 427 Auto Collision was phenomenal. I shopped around before coming here and nowhere else has this level of professionalism. Ask for Brandon, he took care of everything and was extremely helpful. I would definitely recommend this place.
