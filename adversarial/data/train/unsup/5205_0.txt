2 stars for the stupid kids who work here. I'm pretty desperate for boba when i'm in Arizona since I don't have the luxury of having a boba place in every freakin corner like i do back home....... so i might will be back, but i'll make sure to make my order crystal clear to the kids who work here.\n\nSo I went in a couple weeks ago, and this girl working the register is totally staring into space as i'm ordering. Now it's like a million degrees outside so I'm definitely craving something cool and refreshing, nothing milky. I tell this girl... \"I want two jasmine green teas\". I made sure to make myself clear.... i did NOT say jasmine MILK tea, i said jasmine green tea since this has happened to me at this location before.\n\nWhen my drinks are done, the teenage boy yells \"2 jasmine milk teas\". OMG. Did i not make myself clear??? SO i explain to this boy, i wanted jasmine green teas, i didn't order a milk tea. And he gives me the craziest look and says \" sooooooo you just want green tea?\" So i repeated myself and he says \" soooooo you don't want milk?\" YES CHILD, THAT'S WHAT I SAID! Do you not make that here? Omg I never had an issue ordering a jasmine green tea back home with workers who could barely speak english!!! I was so annoyed.\n\nI took my teas since i had already created so much confusion behind the counter. Ugh, i must find another boba place in this state!
