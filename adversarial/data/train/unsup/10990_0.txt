I honestly like it here. \n\nSo I just picked up my to go order and it's really good! The price is understandable because of its location and the fact that it's a small business. The food quality is worth the price; the portions are big on the combo meals. Their chicken katsu, teriyaki chicken and steak are perfectly cooked and well seasoned. I really like their salad dressing too; it's light with a kick of garlic. The staff is polite and friendly. I will defiantly come back.
