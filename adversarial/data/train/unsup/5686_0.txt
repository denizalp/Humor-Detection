I'm giving this place 2 stars because of the terrible customer service I received by two differenct associates.  I went to them to get a ring appraised and called the day before I was told that I could pick it up to make sure it would be ready.  I was told that no one had started on my appraisal and that the person that did appraisals wouldn'te be in until the next day.  I had left my ring with them for TEN days, so it was a little concerning that the appraisal hadn't even been started.  Then the lady on the phone cut me off twice when I was asking about the time I could pick the ring up the next day.  She transfered me to her manager and he didn't even say hello to me, he just started telling me that my ring would be ready sometime the next day.  I wasn't arguing with them, I was really just trying to plan my schedule around when I could pick up the ring.  I felt they were very rude and will NOT be recommending or working with them in the future.
