Well, don't go hungry. Me and 8 of my friends went here for girls night. The point is share the food tapas style but when you get tiny morsels of food (from $12+ a plate) its barely enough for one person to enjoy. (4 pieces of fish the size of quarters is $16??) Please. The service was good, and the ambiance is contemporary and inviting, however it's not the kind of place to indulge in, just feeling like snacking and paying $70 a person for basically an appetizer. If you feel like a tapas style night, there are a half dozen other places I could would rather go.
