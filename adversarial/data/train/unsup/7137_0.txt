Weee this is NOT a lawfirm. Thank god for that!\n\nI changed, rechanged, rethought and cancelled my appointment a few times and finally one day decided today is the day! They were actually able to shuffle me between colorist and stylist and fit me in on a 3 hour notice. That alone is worth at least 3 stars.\n\nMy junior stylist, Sheena, not only coined the term \"micro-trim\" for me but also delivered the perfect micro-trim when I told her how little I wanted cut because I was trying to grow my hair out. A stylist that actually LISTENS to me! Unheard of. No really, UN-effin-heard of!
