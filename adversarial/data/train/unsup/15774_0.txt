Is it possible? Another 5 star review for a Sushi joint? Yes! Yes it is. \n\nI was going to have dinner with my BFAM, Kevin and decided to look up Sushi. I chose Yen due to the great reviews and BOY was I glad that I did. \nWe were greeted and chose to sit at the sushi bar. I suggested to Kev that we go Chef's choice all the way. Of course my brother said \"Hell yeah\" to that! The Chef was mildly surprised at the request but quickly warmed up to the idea. If he was aiming to blow our socks off, he was dead on. \nThere is something about simply made, FRESH food that tends to wow me. He started us off with a sashimi plate to die for. It included salmon, yellowtail, tuna, and octopus. Amazing. Every slice was fresh, not even a hint of being old. The best way to describe the after taste is \"Clean\", no fishiness or weird after taste. The chef then presented us with thinly sliced striped bass with fresh wasabe. Amazing... amazing! The slices of bass were so thin, you could see the plate underneath. The next thing we ordered was eel. Now, I'm usually not a fan of eel because it seems gritty or greasy to me. When we were served the eel, I was surprised to find nothing of the sort on my plate. It was delicious! The eel was crisp and flaky from the broiling. \n\nThe entire meal was great from start to finish. I can't wait to visit Yen again.
