Spazmatics present all the tunes from the 80's that you'll remember and want to sing along to. I say they present the tunes. The band consists of two guitars, drums and vocals, but the music has keyboards, synth, brass, and all kinds of other instruments not seen on the stage. That's because their act is primarily prerecorded on a computer that they lip synch and play air-guitar to. Truly not a band per se. Just some bad actors in costume jumping about on stage and making it look real. But it's really all prerecorded. The only musician on the stage might be the drummer. The guitarists are not really playing their instruments, and the singer may or may not be actually singing. If you must see this act, don't pay money. Go for free. You'll see.
