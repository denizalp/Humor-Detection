***STAY AWAY FROM THIS DEALER!  IT WILL ULTIMATELY COST YOU IN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER!***\n\nI had a recent incident where I put a deposit down on a car and was ready to pick it up.\n\nI questioned the Sales Manager Greg Clifford over a fee.  Next thing I know, I receive an email threatening to cancel my order.....I REPLY to his email....then the liar responds ABOVE my last email saying he hasn't heard from me all day and CANCELLED my CONTRACTED order.\n\n...***BREACH OF CONTRACT!!***....\n\nThe guy has so low ethics that he tore up a written contract because I questioned him on the Doc Fee.  Unbelieveable!  Surreal! \n\nI called his assistant, Internet Sales Manager, Kim Beck who avoided my calls for follow-up explanation.  I also called Greg Clifford who cowardly avoided my calls for explanation.  All my calls were sent to voicemail as they saw my phone number pop-up on their phone screen. I then called the GM Gregg Randolph, who also avoided my calls.  All my emails were unreplied.  No explanation.  Nothing.....Surreal indeed.\n\nThe fact that I live in another state prevented me from visiting these loose casino free-wheeling scam guys in Vegas, otherwise I would have addressed this PERSONALLY, if you get my drift!\n\nI've filed official complaints with Audi of America, BBB, State Attorney's Office and anywhere I can to let people know what a horrible, UNETHICAL dealership this is.\n\nIf you Google this dealership at different websites\/forums, you will SEE that they are one of the **LOWEST RATED** Audi dealers in the entire West Coast Region  The main complaints they get is the service dept. doing fraudulent repairs at extremely high prices and sales people pulling scam maneuvers which are even worse than my experience and complaint.\n\nI have a friend who nearly sued them for a fraudulent sale on a used car.  Only at the last minute did they make things honorable after they sensed that a lawsuit was going to hit them.  Unbelievable!  I thought his experience was an anomaly. It isn't.\n\nThese complaints aren't just anomalies.  There's just TOO MANY COMPLAINTS with this dealership.\n\nI hope Audi of America takes their franchise license away as these scheisters are giving Audi a really bad name.\n\nGive your business to another dealership.\n\n...If you ignore me....Good luck!  You've been warned!.....\n\n\n***   P.S.  I don't work in the auto industry and have no vested interest in these guys other than how they treated me and my friend and to lend voice to the CONSISTENT CHORUS of COMPLAINTS that this dealership is continuously receiving.
