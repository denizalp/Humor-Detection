How could you rate this anything less than a 5? It's a must see when you come to Vegas. They have shows every 15 minutes of the hour. Get a spot & take some insane photos. The music is always changing so it's never boring. I could watch this all day if I had the time. Truly a favorite when I come to Vegas.
