Ah.. the Student Union... how much better it could have been.\n\nThis place is super noisy as my yelpers have noticed. Get here during peak hours between 11am - 1pm and the place is packed. Long lines for the mediocre food court - subway, a Taco Bell with a limited menu, Panda Express, salad place and Metro Pizza. Very average mall food court type set-up. There is a Jamba Juice and Starbucks but expect long waits so make sure you have time. There is a theater on the first floor for events but the seating  is flat and very cramped, make sure nobody sits in front of ya. There is a decent game room but its usually packed with the students.\n\nThe second floor is nothing but empty meeting rooms and a ballroom. There is a computer lab but other than that nothing really for students unless you are attending a specific event.\n\nThe 3rd floor is more offices: Rebel Yell, OCED, Student Government, again nothing really for students unless you have specific business. \n\nI wish there was more for students to do than just eat and sit around. But hey, its better than nothing right!?
