What a great experience I had today on 9\/11 at this Wingstop on Olive. It all started from the cashier Nikki, she greeted me with a smile and that's great feeling, and even the Manager\/cook Angela said welcome to Wingstop that was awesome. I placed my order and with Nikki and she talked about the cheese for my fries and she was right. Amazing! And I got a large drink and a roll which was also amazing, and Angela made my wings perfect.  I ordered garlic Parmesan which is my favorite and lemon pepper. My wings were sauced to perfection and I will keep coming to this wingstop cause it made feeling like it was home. Even the Area Manager Adam came bye my table and with big smile and ask how everything was and he was very professional and polite! I will be back for sure. Thank you for your great service... see you soon!
