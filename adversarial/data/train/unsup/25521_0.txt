Stopped here for lunch. Split a brisket supper with a friend. The brisket was amazing! Great sauce. Great service. For sides we had beans and potato salad. Both were good, I preferred the beans. Clean place, nice clean restrooms. Games all around the place. Prices were good. Only thing is they only have plastic silverware, but other than that, we were more than pleased!
