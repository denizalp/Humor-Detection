Ordered from this place through postmates and it was absolutely terrible. My husband got the chicken and waffles and they have the audacity to use eggos like frozen eggo waffles?!? The chicken was basically just tenders so it was eggos and tenders. I got the spaghetti w meatballs. Well it wasn't from a box frozen but it was really bland. Even after using a few dried herbs and seasonings it still tastes bland. Not worth the money at all! Will not be ordering from this place again.
