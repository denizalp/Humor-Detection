Man. I'm torn about this place. Let's talk good stuff first: It's convenient, it's close to everything. I love their zipparitas in every flavor, they often have great deals on food and drinks. It's a great place for watching sporting games. \n\nI mean it all sounds great, right? Everything you'd want in a sports bar. Well listen up, about 80% of the servers there are just straight twats. The customer service blows big ones. Idk why they've even got attitude, some of them aren't even cute. Check yourself girlfriend. I get it, you're busy. But we're your customers, get that bitchy look off your face. Enough with that rant, aside from their god awful customer service - some of their items are mediocre at best. They charge you for every side of ranch. Oh wait, you're not making enough money off all the drinks we have there, you need $.25 for the ranch too? It's a pet peeve of mine. Don't charge extra for condiments! \n\nSad thing is even tho I get so frustrated with this place, I'll still come here and tolerate their rude servers because sometimes you get lucky and there's a new server who isn't jaded like the rest of those B's. And those damn zipparitas. I love 'em. Sooner or later, I'll give up on this place for good.
