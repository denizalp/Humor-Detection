I almost didn't go here due to a review that said the pad thai was noodles in a pool of orange oil.  I should have listened, but there were so many positive reviews I decided to try it.  Yelpers, you let me down.  \n\nI can't speak for the other menu items, but the pad thai was the worst I've ever had, and I've had it a lot all over the US. I left half of it on my plate, which I NEVER do.  It really was a plate full of over-boiled, mushy noodles swimming in orange oil.  I also ordered the Thai iced tea which was opaque orange in color and tasted like sweet milk that had been stirred with a cigar.\n\nThe service was fine.  The place wasn't crowded when I went.\n\nPersonally, I would go to the Lebanese place a couple of doors down before I would ever go back here.
