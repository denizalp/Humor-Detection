A grass knoll suitable for taking in a concert. There is no assigned seating here, so those that have the best portable seating options will have the best time. According to their website, the lawn holds 3000 people. There is plenty of room to move about, plenty of parking and if you get bored, you can run across the street and go shopping at the Premium Outlets.\n\nYou're not going to see U2 here, but for some free Jazz shows or a more local oriented festival, this is a convenient and comfortable spot.
