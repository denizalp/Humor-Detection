I was disappointed to learn that everyone in this group is over 40 despite being sold a membership based on the statement that the average age was 30.\n\nAlso, the old people are socially awkward and creepy.  I believe that is the real reason online\/real life dating didn't work for them.  I don't accept drinks from anyone there and avoid any afterparties.\n\nThe cost of a membership is a ridiculous $2500 for a year.  You can buy a lot of shoes and alcohol in one year and have some real fun for way less than the cost of the membership.\n\n- Refunds are impossible.\n\nThey give you small discounts if you write positive reviews.
