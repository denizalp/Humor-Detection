***Formerly on the Palomino Yelp site.\n\nThis place is wild!  The only reason I am knocking down a star is because after getting a lap dance by one of the cutest dancers I came home with one of the most horrible flu's I have ever had.  We were on the male side which is to say the one with the male dancers.  There were 4 of us out on the town for a Bachelorette party.  I have been to plenty of strip clubs in the Philly area but NOTHING prepared me for what I was getting myself into at the Palomino..... NOTHING.......  It was completely insane.  If you are looking to have a wild ass time with your girlfriends go here!!  You might want to check into the booth service, the girls in the booths were getting most of the attention and wackiness, we tipped out to get the back couch so we got to observe the insanity without getting too involved.  If you are going to Vegas especially for a bachelorette party this is an experience you must have!
