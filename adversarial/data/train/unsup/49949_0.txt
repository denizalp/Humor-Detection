Not impressed...besides the horrible order...two days they skipped cleaning the room...coffee pot in the room but you will pay a fortune for the coffee that is available for your use.  Tried to go to the pool...oh I'm sorry you will have to go long way around, we closed this exit for a convention...try to get a tube to buy...oh I'm sorry...you will have to got to the other end this one is closed...LIKE REALLY...by the time you get to the pool, get a towel, tube and a chair...plan on an hour or more.\n\nCalled for dining reservations...oh I'm sorry it is closed for a private party...\n\nI would never stay here again.
