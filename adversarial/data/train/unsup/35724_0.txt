I went there to do the initial consultation to correct my botched permanent makeup and I was excited and nervous at the same time.  Theresa put me right at ease and thoroughly looked over what was done.  She did indeed confirm that it was poorly done and recommended the best course of action and took the time to explain why and how it will be done.  During our consult, she really got into detail about her background and training and I knew that I was going to be in good hands - she specializes in permanent make-up correction after all!  The consultation lasted about an hour and I left feeling hopeful and excited for my upcoming procedure.\n\nI have no work done by her or the others as of yet and I will post an update after my correction takes place.  I am looking forward to it!!
