Nice ambiance !\nLate night for drinks and music. \nDidn't get to taste the food. \nJust enjoyed a cocktail at the bar listening to live music with just a piano, a bass and Jonathan Karant, jazz singer and I really enjoyed my evening. \nThey have those jazz evenings every Friday and Saturday from 10pm to 2:00am.
