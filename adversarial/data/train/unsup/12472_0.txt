In first 2 minutes, hate it here. Put my players card in kiosk to see my points I can use for lunch. Daily games available on my account. As I'm clicking on them, screen freezes and notification comes up that account needs players club attention. I walk over to club. I had to reenter password and the women gives me a new card. I return to kiosk to check my point balance available for food. Again, same notification...I feel like one of the dorks playing pokemon, running back and forth. Lame. No thanks...casino employees treat me badly anyways so...keep your card and my 70k I put into machines last year with not a single perk returned. I hope something bad happens to this casino chain.
