with a menu full of tempting and delicious smoothies, paradise juice delivered us daily during one extremely hot week in phx. the people who work here are super friendly. we totally made friends on day 1 and built a solid relationship by day 3; i'm pretty sure that we could walk in years later and receive the same jovial reception. our relationship mainly consisted of them making super accurate recommendations for their amazingly tasty and satiating treats and us oohing and ahhing as we sipped heaven from jumbo straws. this is definitely the place to come for your smoothie fix and veggie juice cravings. i promise you will leave happier than when you came in. i sure did.
