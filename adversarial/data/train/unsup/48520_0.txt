Maybe I missed something here, but I wasn't impressed. Had the cheese steak, which I can see had great potential but was...well...bland. Also had the arancini and it also was bland and a bit overlooked. Actually it tasted burned. Maybe just that evening but it all could have benefited from some more seasoning. Lots of other really good reviews so I'd likely give it another chance, but maybe not.
