What the hell happened to this place!? Man, what a dump it has become. The service is absolutely awful. It was freezing in there the entire time, so much, that I had to wear my jacket for the painful hour I was in there. Our drinks came out about 20 minutes after we ordered them. Our appetizer came out first and we had A)No drinks B)No water C)No silverware. You would have thought it was our waitress' first night on the job - it was terrible. I will not be going back any time soon. And seriously, fix your decorations! They look like crap and they're falling apart. PS, the food was not great either. Such a bummer, I used to like this place.
