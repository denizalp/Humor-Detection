Big library fan - I swear I am.  So, it is not easy for me to go under 5 stars,  Guys, you gotta get some tables.  In addition to a brain, training,  and lots of patience, a table is an essential ingredient in tutoring.  And, if it is not too much, some plugs for laptops.  i am old enough to remember when this library was built and I know it was before technology was as big as it is now. Still, some tables and some plugs and I'm a happy girl.
