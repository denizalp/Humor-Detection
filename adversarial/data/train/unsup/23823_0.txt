I like Subway!  They have come quite a ways from when I first started eating at Subways in general.  They now have many bread options from wheat, cheddar and white, flat bread plus some others.  I like the $5 options that you can get here and some footlongs sandwiches are less than $5.  I can eat a 1\/2 a foot long for lunch and the rest for dinner!  So great value!\n\nFresh baked bread, toppings and cookies are always good choices.  \n\nIf you want to skip the bread, you can always get a salad!\n\nThis location always seems clean and the employees are friendly!  When I've gone here there hasn't been too many people so service has been fast too!
