The best Chinese restaurant in the city, and probably the only Chinese place I will take my parents to from now on when they visit. I've been here many times and each time the food is consistently delicious. It gets really packed on weekends and evenings so try to call ahead. Personal favorites include the scallion pancakes wrapped over beef, ribs\/eggplant dish, and the basil fish casserole.
