Stayed in the Valley Tower, which is newly renovated. DÃ©cor was great.\n\nCheck in was intimidating at first but was quick and painless, via the electronic check-in kiosks in the lobby. The staff was helpful with the check in and was able to answer all of our questions. \n\n$100\/night hold will be placed on the credit\/debit card you provide to the hotel.\n\nI like the fact that the hotel located near the middle of the strip.\n\n$30 early check in before 3pm.
