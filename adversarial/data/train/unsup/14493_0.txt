One of the most over-rated joints on Earth, although if what you want is to stand in line for a humongous pile of mediocre food, wet, floppy french fries with bland gravy, and surly service for an inexpensive price, this is your place. I really apologize for not agreeing with the others. Maybe I went there on an off day.
