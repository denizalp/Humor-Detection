One of my friends swore by this place, so I decided to check it out.\n\nI ordered a few steak burritos and steak salads for my friends. I personally ate the steak salad and it was pretty darn good. The salad was put on top of a flour tortilla that was baked with cheese. I chose black beans to go with mine. There was rice, lettuce, pico de gallo, guac, tortilla strips, cilantro, and cheese. For salads, the dressing selections were a creamy tomatillo dressing or a cilantro lime vinaigrette. I opted for the creamy one and it was DELICIOUS. I am really picky when it comes to the quality of my ingredients. For example, if I see wilted, browning lettuce in my salad; I will not eat it. The lettuce here was very fresh and I did not have an issue with the produce. The dressing though made the salad! You MUST get the tomatillo dressing! I was just sad that they charged extra for more to-go containers of the dressing.\n\nThe prices here are very reasonable. I believe my steak salad was about $9-$10? I just wish Cafe Rio was located closer to the Strip! It was quite a drive to get here! The customer service here was pretty decent. I felt so bad for the worker who was taking my 5 item order haha! I will most definitely be coming back here when I am in the area. They also have a stamp card :)
