The Statehouse is now open to the public (as of 10\/18\/14).  Went for Saturday Brunch on opening morning.  The view is great and the Dining Room looks beautiful, as well as the full bar, which is not yet operable.\n  \nService was acceptable but not great.  He was friendly and somewhat attentive, but he seemed to lack experience.  We (2) both had coffee and noticed that they need to change the little cream holder\/dish; when you pour the cream, there is nothing you can do to keep it from dripping down the side and spilling everywhere.  \n\nThe food, like the service, was acceptable.  We ordered (1) Fruit Plate, which was beautiful and (2) The Biscuits and Gravy, which was served with fried ham and some eggs.  Very middle of the road.  I ate it, but was not impressed enough to go back for it.  We also split the Red Velvet Stack.  I was very excited because these are, as far as I know, the first on menu Red Velvet Pancakes in town.  One again, they were alright.  Not very red, but more brown, which is actually more true to red velvet, and I'm not going to complain that they decided not to put dye in them.  The flavor of the actual cakes was fine, they did however pick up a lemony flavor from the mascarpone.  I should have ordered the mascarpone on the side and asked for real butter, that was my own mistake.  \n\nI will go back to try more of the menu, as I am a Breakfast and Brunch freak.  I just hope that next time I am as impressed with the way the food tastes as I am with how good it sounds on the menu.
