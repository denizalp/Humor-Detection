Beware doing business with David Ferch, owner of Dakota Maintenance. He was supposed to renovate my front yard landscape and install a 3 piece modular paver system at my front entry and from my front gate to back patio. I found out the hard way that this contractor has little or no experience in pave installation and did not understand the random pattern of 3 piece modular paver system. Furthermore, he used the wrong type of sand for paver base and did not have any compaction equipment. He was not planning on doing any excavation to make pavers come out level with front yard. His services were terminated. The paver manufacturer recommended a qualified installer and my job got completed. It is a beautiful and very professional job.  BUYER BEWARE WITH DAKOTA MAINTENANCE. They are not even a one star!
