Overhyped? Nope, not in the slightest! You'll know how impressive the food is going to be with the intense, savory BBQ aroma that hits you like a semi truck!\n\nRight off the bat you'll see a much wider variety of meat options on the menu than most BBQ places around. I was very intrigued by the smoked sausage. Not only will they give you a sample of any menu item, they encourage it with a big sign inviting you to simply ask! I decided on the Brisket and Sausage. Usually for sides I stick with Mac & Cheese and Cole Slaw at BBQ restaurants, but because of the long list I decided on Corn Pudding and Collards!\n\nThe meats, WOW! Smoked sausage that reminded me of authentic Texas BBQ. Moist, tender brisket with an amazing smoke profile. The collards were noteworthy, perfectly cooked and seasoned, with a good amount of pot broth. The corn pudding reminded me of a sweeter version of Corn Casserole. While the corn was good, next time I'm just getting 2 collards!\n\nSo we tried 5 of the numerous BBQ sauces and I'll mow through them real quick (all purely subjective mind you. Your mileage may vary!). City sweet was... Sweet, it was OK. Original was good, balanced flavor but not very bold. Burbon was a more dynamic sauce than original, nice savory note. Piedmont Pride, uh if you like vinegar so much you can take it in an IV drip then maybe this is for you, it's not for me. Spicy Ginger, oh boy this is a winner! Nice, mild spice with just the right sweetness. Reminds me of a ginger Sweet Chili sauce.\n\nSo there you go, I can't wait to try more! The cashier had a brief moment of impatience it seemed, but they were having technical difficulties that delayed the ordering process more than it should have. Things happen, I just hope the food is as excellent next time as it was last night!
