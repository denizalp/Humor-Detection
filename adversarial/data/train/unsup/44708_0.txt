Food Fight has another faux classic diner, but at least it's a style they know how to do right. The white and blue booths are a treat to the eyes and the wide variety in the menu is a delight to the stomach.\n\nAs usual, I focus most on breakfast. They have comparable goodies to the Westside's Hubbard Ave, which does me well. I will have some of my favorite meals no matter which side of town I live on. Like most places, service is rough during the rush hours. Either come real early or real late.\n\nAnd pies. Get some pies. Any style apple will be great.
