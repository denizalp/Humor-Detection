I LOVE JAZZERCISE! \n\nA little background...My mom owns her own Jazzercise franchise back in Michigan so I have been taking Jazzercise classes with her since I was 9 and then helped her start her own classes in 2002. When I moved to Arizona last year I knew I had to find a Jazzercise location so I wouldn't miss it (and a little piece of my mom). My first Jazzercise experience was at the Metro Jazzercise center and it only took me 2 months to realize that I really fit in. I took a few months off and when I got back from Michigan after the holidays I REALLY wanted to find a Jazzercise center that I loved and I am happy to say that I LOVE this one! \n\nFirst, wave goodbye to any stereotypes you may have for Jazzercise. (No we don't wear spandex leotards and bounce around to 80s music...I save that for my living room)  It really is an awesome workout, a fun way to break a sweat, and a GREAT way for me to get my dance fix (I am a closet case dance freak!). All classes are a little different because of the different instructors and song choices but they all use popular dance music and incorporate both cardio and strength training. \n\nThe reason I LOVE this location is... \n1. Most of the instructors are VERY good and have a lot of energy. \n2. The classes are always full which is great to bring up your energy if you are tired. \n3. The space is large enough that there is always enough space to move! \n4. VERY CLEAN \n5. The schedule is awesome-they offer 35 classes a week! (I love the 5:45 am and the 5:45 pm classes!) \n6. Great price! Unlimited Jazzercise for $39\/month!! \n\nJust check it out and I know you will have fun!
