i was originally excited to see dr fisher her receptionist natalie was thorough and efficient but the rest of the staff were rude and even opinionated!!! so unprofessional! my friend said she went there and wasn't happy so i obviously am not the only one who thinks so...i was only going to her because she was listed on my insurance... if i have to pay i am definitely going to dr higgins who is respected, known and the staff is professional.  not to mention dr fisher's office is not as nice as many others in las vegas... first impressions mean alot to me!
