Well hello there, teenage self! It's been 20 years since BSB took the world by storm and I'm still here, a 30-something woman fan girling over these 30-something \"boys\" lol. If you're a 90s kid, this is a fun and awesome show for you! It brings back so many memories and you will definitely be singing your heart out...because you probably know 95% of their songs! Their dance moves are quite simple  (don't expect them to do the steps to their Everybody video) but they did sing live. And they sang EVERY.SINGLE.SONG! \n\nThis show is worth it, go watch!  We paid 120 per ticket (taxes and fees included) and we were seated at the balcony 2nd row center. The theater isn't that big and the view from there isn't bad at all but I suggest that if you decide to get balcony tickets, avoid seats that are too far back!
