Of course, coming to visit our aunt\/uncle in Arizona, we knew we were gonna have some form of Mexican food. One thing that California is not short on (unlike beautiful public libraries like those we visited in Scottsdale!) is Mexican eateries. So, I was a bit surprised when we pulled up to this obvious chain restaurant, which I didn't know it was because Cantina Laredo has not expanded to CA yet. But, I figured, let's not be judgemental.\n\nWe arrived at about 6:30 on a payday-weekend Friday night...just finding a parking space was an adventure, but at least being crowded seemed like a good sign. After being quickly and warmly greeted, we managed to find a spot for the four of us to wait the half-hour until our table was ready. Since it was still Happy Hour, we got some pretty yummy and decently sized margaritas for only $5 each. \n\nThe food was great! We got the table-side fresh-made guacamole, prepared by our wonderful server Andrew (big kudos to him for taking care of us in a friendly, courteous, and efficient way all night). Everyone liked their food very much, but I can only speak to my order of carnitas...SO YUMMY! And, I've never had carnitas served on the bone, which was kinda cool. \n\nI saved room for dessert SPECIFICALLY because I saw the Mexican apple pie with cinnamon ice cream. When Andrew brought it out, the plate sizzled when he poured the DELICIOUS and warm brandy\/butter sauce onto the plate. Sooo good! Do yourself a favor and save room to try this delectable concoction. \n\nAll in all, we had a great first-time experience at Cantina Laredo (thanks to Andrew for helping that along). :)
