My little man and I love this place. Its friendly and the food is great. I have never encountered a rude soul here. The little play area is cleaner than the McDs so I take little man there to play. We also love all of the events they have going on. Macaroni Kids Robinson and MOPS have fundraisers or free kid activity nights at this location often.
