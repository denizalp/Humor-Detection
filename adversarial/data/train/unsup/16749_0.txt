Pretty decent poke at Poke Spot - fresh fish and the usual plethora of ingredients for a poke restaurant. Pick your fish, bed of rice, salad, or both, and then pile up tasty toppings like mango, sprouts, pickled cucumbers, avocado, and crab, and douse the whole thing with yummy dressing - a top notch lunch. \n\nNice staff, clean dining room - I'm docking them 1-star for not having any high chairs or booster seats for my son - I get that poke isn't the typical breakfast of champions for kiddos, but I just feel that it's an oversight to not have those.\n\nKeep bringing the poke to the people, Poke Spot!
