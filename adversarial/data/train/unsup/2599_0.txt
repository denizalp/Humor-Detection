It's filling and good for the price. Something about it, though, makes it not that memorable for me. It's just meh. I feel like I need to pile on their sauces on the food for a kick, but even the sauces are forgettable to me. The bulgogi BEEF meat is well seasoned. Can't say the same for chicken. \nIt is set at a pretty decent price. For about $8 you can get a big meal. A whole order of bulgogi fries could really feed two. $4 for two spam musubis. $2 tacos. I've had the chimichanga and burrito and nachos as well, which I think I may pass next time.\nComplimentary chips, salsa, & guac. I enjoy the complimentary oranges at the end.
