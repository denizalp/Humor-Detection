I really wish I could give half stars because Bella is a solid 4.5. We went to dinner with our friends. We were greeted promptly and even though the parking lot was scary full, we were seated immediately. This place looks really small but there is a bigger back room and bar area. The dining areas are warm and cozy, inviting. We were waited on quickly by our waiter who was attentive all evening but not in an in-your-face kind of way. We were given a wonderful basket of warm bread. The bread here is awesome by the way. So fresh and so good. We all got either salads or soups to start. My friend did note that the croutons were not great, tasting more like oil than crunchy bread. Other than that everything was yummy! I got my usual and although a bit overdone, the actual tuna steak was sublime-so fresh! The hubby got the veal parm and it was tender and tasty. The other two in our party had pasta dishes, a gnocchi in a roasted red pepper sauce noting it was good. My friend is a vegetarian and they were accommodating when it came to leaving out the chicken and noting there were not any other meat byproducts in the dish. All in all it was a great evening spent celebrating my bday and my friend's bday (which is next weekend).
