Inability to be served due to long wait time ruined my FIRST Mother's Day. On my first Mother's Day myself, my husband, my 3 month old, and one of my best friends decided to try this Chicago transplant out for brunch. I'd seen it on the news that they just opened this location and wanted to give this new location a try. Since I'm a Midwest girl, and Love Chicago, I picked this place to have brunch with my family. I'd visited Elly's in Chicago for brunch and loved it there, so I was expecting the same here---- not so.\n\nBig disappointment. We were on their waiting list for over 40 minutes, when initially told there was a 20 minute wait. When our names weren't called after 40 minutes we went in to check and was told that they are now putting the list of names for people waiting \"on hold\" because their kitchen is backed up on orders, and priority is being given to those with reservations. Now I'm hungry, my infant son is cranky, and we have to find someplace else for brunch. We are  VERY disappointed in the way service was handled.
