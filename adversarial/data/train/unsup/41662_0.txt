Replaced my front shield on my BMW 335i. Great work, great price and the best customer service around. Highly recommended and will definitely come back if needed.\n\nI have a dash cam and I've tugged the wire myself. They offered to help re-wire it nicely so my dash cam setup look even better than before. They even gave me a plastic tool to help doing this myself in the future! Honestly, best customer service!!!
