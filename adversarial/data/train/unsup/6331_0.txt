I had heard of this exhibit (or one like it) years ago, but unfortunately I didn't get a chance to attend when it was in Vancouver, so I was excited to have the opportunity to finally see it when I was in Las Vegas.  Like everything else in Vegas (and Vancouver), it was pricey, but it was a fantastic exhibit, and definitely worth seeing.  Not much I can say about it except, amazing!\n\n[Yelp collections: Vegas 2017]
