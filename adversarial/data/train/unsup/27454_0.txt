I came here after seeing it listed under Eater's \"The 38 Essential Las Vegas Restaurants, Summer 2017\" and was quite disappointed. We had one evening off where we wanted to try something special in Vegas and unfortunately couldn't get seats at Raku, so decided to go for some Thai food in the Chinatown area instead.\n\nPrice: Food was reasonably portioned at most dishes will run you about 7 dollars per appetizer to 10 dollars for most entrees. Seafood items can go upwards of 20 dollars.\n\nFood: Flavors were bold and tasted right, but food was either overly sweet or overly salty. Spiciness level was just right, but just know that medium spice will have a pretty good kick.\n\nSom thum (Green papaya salad) - presentation on this was pretty lousy. Most classic papaya salad will have blue crab, basil, cherry tomatoes and crushed peanuts all mixed together but this was pretty hastily thrown together. You have plain shredded green papaya doused in some fish sauce, with tomatoes and a wedge of cabbage on the side. The flavors were there but the textures were not varied.\n\nDrunken noodles - too little noodles and way too much vegetables and oil. Could barely find any wide rice noodles at the bottom and most of it was just salty stir fried veggies.\n\nPanang curry with beef - probably the best dish of the three we had ordered since the beef was very tender hangar steak that had been braised. Nicely sweet, but again, overly salty. You'd have to order two bowls of rice in addition to this to help dilute the curry sauce.\n\nThai iced tea - way too sweet. Diluted this with equal parts water and it was only drinkable then.\n\nService: no problems here. water was refilled quickly.\n\nOverall: flavors are there but some dishes were either too salty or too sweet, just looking for something middle of the road here. Wound up drinking a ton of water to help with the salt. Also, just wish some dishes had more love put into them i.e. papaya salad.
