Food was good, service and attitude was lousy!\n\nStarted withe host - we arrived on time for our 6pm reservation only to be shown to the patio and a table next to the gap in the unsecured awning where the wind was blowing in. I asked to be seated in the main restaurant only to have this rude dude say \"We're booked solid with reservation\" - yeah idiot and I have one. I told him we'll sit at the bar - not ideal but apparently my reservation didn't qualify for an indoor table - the guy was a knob! He checked the bar and said it would be ok - wow, really? Guy was not cordial, did not welcome us and never smiled. Some first impression - I'd can him!\n\nBartenders barely paid attention to us - it wasn't that busy, the bar was not full but we had to flag them down if we wanted anything - they didn't even refill water glasses unless we asked.\n\n40th St location is much much better.\n\nLose the attitude boys and I might come back!\n\nMinimal tip, but you earned it!
