First off if you don't know the Rules to this place then yeah your going to get bland food and horrible service . I've been eating here since 1995 and im still alive.. but let me just put it out here this place rocks like a bon jovi concert in China , Id even eat the menu but Vue (the cook) won't do it.Now for the rules to this place,1: when you walk just act like you know everybody remember to smile and tell them that their restaurant has saved your life ..2 Always request the back table on the right hand side of the restaurant that gives you full panoramic view  of the entire place this will let them think that you are part of Chinese gangs and need the good view of the entrance .. 3 now if you go in after 9 and bring the cook a cold beer from across the street Heineken beer is his choice, you'll receive a special treat that isn't on the menu just give him the wink and the double nod  . As for the size of the plates you could feed a family of 4 and still have left overs on 3 plates and you won't feel kamikaze at the cash. In conclusion if you haven't had the spaghetti Fujiyama then you haven't eaten here yet..
