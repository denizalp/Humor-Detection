Lovely little restaurant! We were on a long road trip with 3 kids and 4 adults and we're happy to find this place. Sitting outside under the canopy was perfect. I had the falafel salad that came with a cucumber side. Both were delicious, light but filling. My husband enjoyed his meatball sandwich. One of the kids had a side of fruit and I was pleasantly surprised. It wasn't the bland melon cocktail you'd get at most restaurants - it was freshly sliced peaches (I think it was a whole peach) and huge slices of watermelon. We all loved the cherry, chocolate cookie. Service was quick and staff was friendly.
