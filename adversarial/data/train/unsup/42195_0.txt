I don't know why I keep trying to eat here. I think I keep forgetting how bad it is. Anyway I was really hungry so this time I ordered the smoked salmon sandwich. Something in it was probably bad because about 30 mins to 1 hour after I ate it I got stomach pains & stomach upset. Not fun. I don't think I'll eat here again.
