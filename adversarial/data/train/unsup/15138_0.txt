4 stars for our server Dylan. He was super cool and funny. I ordered the chop steak with saut√©ed mushrooms and onions in a peppercorn demi glace with mashed potatoes. The chop steak was SO SALTY! The demi-glace was delicious though. I really think that sauce made the meal come together. I was just disappointed how salty my steak was. I'm not a person who returns stuff, because I don't want my food messed with, so I just ate it without complaint. My bf ordered the chicken fried steak and it was HUGE. He is a big eater, but he couldn't even finish that. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meals, a burger and meatloaf. One thing to mention is they are no longer selling garlic bread. Instead, they bring a medium size roll with a marinara sauce brushed on top. It was ok, but nothing special. \n\nI ordered the motherlode cake for dessert for all of us to share and that was amazing. Super chocolatey, decadent and rich. Yum. I would come back to this Claim Jumper, but I would order something different.
