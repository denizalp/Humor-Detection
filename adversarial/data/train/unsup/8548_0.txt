Serissa Cate (not Cafe) is my favourite bubble tea house in Markham! Small location but offers a nice variety of hot and cold specialty mixed drinks, quick snacks, small meal combos and light desserts. I prefer this chic and modern location over the other 2 Serissa locations: 1) Pacific Mall - take outs only. 2) Metro Square - cozy place with wooden furniture.\n\nPretty good price for drinks I gotta say! Make sure you order a LARGE, only a $0.50 difference and you get quality AND quantity ^o^ Also, I absolutely love the mixture of small and large tapioca in their bubble tea drinks - gives it a nice chewing texture #nomnomnom. If you do take-outs for drinks, they have a stamp card system (Buy 8 get 1 Free!), so be sure to ask them for one. Apparently, drinks cost even less when you order take outs #greatnews :D\n\nHere are a few of my favourite drinks, give them a try!\n- Iron Goddess Milk tea with tapioca #lovelovelove\n- White Chocolate Moccachino with tapioca\n- Red Bean Slush \/ Black Sesame Slush with tapioca\n- Taro Slush with egg pudding... yes I'm a big slush fan :)\n- The Oz (Green Tea Slush with egg pudding, topped with whipped cream and chocolate sauce woohooo! #droolz #spoiled lol)\n\nOverall, I give this place a 4-star for friendly service and always have consistency in serving quality food and drinks. Minus 1 star for slow service sometimes... they only have 1 barista and 1 waitress on duty... but they are a hardworking pair! But it doesn't bother me much, my friends and I are too busy killing each other at monopoly deal XD\n\nP.S. Unlike other bubble tea houses, Serissa allows you to play card games or board games! Sweet :D
