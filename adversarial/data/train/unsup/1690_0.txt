These guys are awesome! Came in last minute to get my headlights restored. They were soooooo cloudy and yellow from years of oxidation. It was really harming my visibility on the road. John didn't make any promises, but said he would do what he could. The staff here killed it! When i came to pick up my car the headlights looked brand new. John was incredibly friendly and said that if I had any issues in the next few month with them, they would fix it free of charge, no questions asked. The service I received here was far superior to any other \"walk-in\" type of shop. \n\nThank you John and staff for saving me a TON of money on new headlights. You rock!\n\nThat being said, I normally take my Volvo to a European speciality shop for most things, but I'll for sure be coming back here for everything else.
