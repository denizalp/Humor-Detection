I bought 3 sessions on Groupon and I'm so glad I did. I was curious and nervous but the owner put me right at ease. My first session was today and I am very pleased. It was a bit uncomfortable at times but that's to be expected with deep tissue work. It was a very relaxing pleasant experience and my body feels sooo much better. I'd definitely recommend giving it a try if you suffer from back shoulder neck issues. And it's very affordable. I can't wait to go back!
