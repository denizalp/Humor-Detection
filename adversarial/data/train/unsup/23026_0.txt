I used Think Print on line just recently for a Father's Day gift. This company responded to my questions promptly and also called me to discuss the shipping. My Father Loved the shirt I made for him on line! The process was so easy!!!! I would use this company again on a heart beat!!! Thank you Think! This company is easy to work with and their customer service was great!!!!
