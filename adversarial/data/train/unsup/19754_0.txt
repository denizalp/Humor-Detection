One of my favorite mid-90's G-Funk songs is called \"This is The Shack\" by the group Dove Shack. Well, this is the Fish Shack. It is owned by Kate from Kate's Fish at the West Side Market. If you have ever bought fish from her stand you already know about the quality and service provided. I came here with my father last weekend on a cold and blustery night. The atmosphere inside the restaurant was very welcoming and warming. I enjoyed the fact that this is a family owned and operated small business. They were setting up holiday decorations which really put me in a great mood and allowed me to remember some holiday memories of my dad trying to set up the tree and cursing because of the difficulties of tree set up. I had the ocean perch while he opted for walleye. Both were fresh and delicious. It is good to see more new businesses opening up on the south side of W 25th. The further I venture away from Town Hall, the greater sense of relief and serenity I feel. This is the shack. This is how we act.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Lhb8CPXRVCg&list=PL062CCAD4345B40A1
