Stumbled upon this restaurant today, even though I live down the street.  Great tacos, clean restaurant, DJ spinning great music on a Friday night and Eddie the bartender was awesome.  Very friendly and knowledge in all of their tequila!  HH is from 5-7pm daily and I'll make sure to back. Def recommend.
