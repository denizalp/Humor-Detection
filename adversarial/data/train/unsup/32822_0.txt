The prices are slightly higher than Real Canadian\/Loblaws\/Sobeys, but looking around they have quality produce and meats.  I love the premade meatballs.  About the price of buying lean ground beef in Loblaws but premade meatballs mean I don't have to get my hands dirty. Only thing I couldn't find was the organic chicken.  The pre-cooked foods look really good, and even in a grocery store I like the ambiance.  It has the look of a boutique grocer but definitely cheaper than going to McEwans.  I think I'll have to keep an eye on the sales at Longos too now!
