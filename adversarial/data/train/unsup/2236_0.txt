This afternoon I called to ask how much it would be to do a gel polish change. The woman I spoke to on the phone advised that it would be $30. I explained that I was looking to have the current color I have removed and changed to a pink\/white fade and asked a second time if it would still be $30. The woman I spoke to checked with the manicurist and said that yes it would be $30. I even went so far as to explain that my nails had been done recently so I was solely looking for a color change and would not waste their time or mine if it cost more than $30. During my appointment I also told my manicurist that I did not want anything except the gel color change; no filing or shaping or cuticle trim necessary.\n\nAt the end of my gel color change when I was admiring my newly painted claws my manicurist announced that the cost would be $40. I explained to her what I had been told but she remained firm. I explained the situation to the gentleman at the front desk and the best he could offer was \"Oh sorry you spoke to my wife and she was having a bad day.\" \n\nThe last time I came to this salon I was charged $45 for gel manicure with a pink\/white fade. The prices are not posted but they were explained to me as follows: $30 for the gel manicure, $10 reshaping charge [still not sure what this means] and $5 upcharge for the pink\/white. How is it possible that a COLOR CHANGE is only $5 less than a full gel manicure and \"reshaping.\"?\n\nSo why two stars? My manicurist was kind enough to offer to forgo her tip. I tipped her anyways because at the end of the day she did her job even if the salon cannot do theirs.\n\nI have heard great things about this salon, so buyer beware. Get your pricing in writing beforehand.
