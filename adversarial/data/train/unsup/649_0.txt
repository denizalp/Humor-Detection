It's right by where I work so is convenient. The decor and efforts to make it look Irish are top notch. Here's why it gets 2 stars:\n\n1. Teach your staff how to pour a Guinness or go and actually spend some time in Ireland to realize the importance of this or at least Google\/YouTube a correct pour. One pour with a head full of bubbles and a head ranging from 2mm - 2 inches is not acceptable. If the owner (who's not Irish) is going to run a business and profit from our traditions and culture at least take the time to learn something about the country.\n\n2. Irish Breakfast should be just that - not some attempt with not even close to an Irish sausage, no rashers, beans etc . The other attempts at traditional Irish food are ok - Shepherd's Pie, Stew etc.\n\n3. Service can be very hit or miss. Never fantastic but often times it is absolutely terrible.\n\n4. Finally. A lot won't understand why this is a big deal - I suggest search the net. There's a Happy \"Patty's\" Day ornament in the cabinet on the right when you walk in. \n\nSuggestion - hire a manager\/senior bar person who is Irish or has spent a decent amount of time bar tending in Ireland and listen to their advice. Most of the problems are easily fixed.\n\n\n*EDIT - I nearly forgot about this!! To add insult to injury after point 4 above, this is on their menu:\n\nAn Broc Angus Beef Burger**\nCertified Black Angus Beef Paddy, Choice of Char or Flat Top Grilled. Served on Your Choice of Our Guinness Roll or Sesame Wheat Bun\n\nGRRRR!!
