I came around 1130 A.M for some early lunch on a weekday. For someone who is sensitive to salt, sugar, and oil in Filipino foods, I thought the boodle platter B was passable without feeling bloated or heavy from the get go. I've heard that the lechon was hit or miss, but the chicken, lechon, fish, pinakbet, mango salad, and salted egg combo was not too salty or too oily. The lechon was crispy and cooked well enough to not have the fishy or raw taste. It's a platter where each person can get 3 or more servings of rice. There were four of us that came and we still had so much leftover rice to bring home. The sago gulaman was too sweet for my taste but that can be easily fixed by diluting it with water. The soup that comes with an order reminded me of soup stock with extra scallions. If ever take-out is all you need, they're siopao was good, it comes with egg inside and the texture of the pulled pork mended ok with the bread. Price wise for the boodle B, which came around 60$, is good even with 4-6 people sharing the price and the food. You'll definitely be full.
