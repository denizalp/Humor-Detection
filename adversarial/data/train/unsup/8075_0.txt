I am loving these BYO places that are popping up all over. Blaze has a simple concept; one pizza, one size, unlimited toppings. Of course you could choose one of their signature items, but I like to make my own. It's more fun that way.\n\nI chose a regular crust pizza and got no sauce. I added mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, tomatoes, artichoke, and ricotta cheese. Then when the pizza came out of the oven, I had them drizzle some olive oil over the top. Simple yet delicious. My boyfriend heard unlimited toppings and went crazy. He got the high rise pizza dough which is thicker crust, and then added tons of cheese, and almost all the meats they had. He also got extra cheese. Don't be afraid to ask for more toppings. They only give you a handful of the toppings you ask for, but you can always ask for more. \n\nThey say the pizzas take about 190 seconds or around 3 minutes to cook, but his took a little longer because of the mountain of toppings he had. One thing I can say is I saw some of the pizzas come out of the oven looking like shit. Some of them got stuck to the pans, and I saw one dude scrape off cheese and toppings and put it back on the pizza. I'm glad that wasn't my pie. I would make sure to keep an eye on them when they come out the oven though. \n\nI was just about to pay and leave when I saw their premade salads next to the register. I chose the berry arugula salad and it was bomb. It had fresh blackberries, creamy goat cheese, and peppery arugula tossed in some type of balsamic vinaigrette. I wished I had gotten more than just a single serving. It's safe to say I would come back here again.
