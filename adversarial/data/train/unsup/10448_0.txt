Hot Tamale ($5.95): Non-GMO Masa, pumpkin green chili, and lentils. The masa was pretty dry and it seemed to be from over-cooking since it was more dry in certain areas. Otherwise, the filling and chili was tasty (although I would've liked more of both).\n\nMy Little Dumpling ($5.95): Steamed shiitake mushroom and spinach. Fantastic dumplings! Plus, the accompanying sauce was perfect (and great with the other dishes). The dumpling skins were light and chewy and the filling was flavorful. Probably one of the best dumplings I've had, ever.\n\nBao Wow ($5.95): Asian BBQ tofu, spinach, shiitake mushroom, Bao bun. A nice concept of Bao, but wasn't something I loved. \n\nSave The Tuna ($6.95): Vegan sushi; Exotic forbidden rice. Yum! A simply tasty sushi roll and bonus, it's also beautiful. \n\nPicante Pineapple Pizza ($10.95): Charred pineapple, jalape√±o, and sausage. Their pizzas are delicious!! The crust is crispy on the edges and the toppings are flavorful. They use Daiya brand Vegan cheese (which I already love). This particular pizza uses Vegan sausage that was rather good. The pineapple appeared to be from a can and not obviously charred, but it didn't take away from the dish being my favorite of the group.\n\nMushroom Madness Pizza ($10.95): Assorted mushrooms and herbs. Same great crust, cheese, and sauce. We requested half of Mushroom Madness and half of Picante Pineapple, which was a perfect sampling. I wasn't as fond of the mushroom bunch, but my sister loved it.\n\nEllen Degeneres ($10.95): Raw power tacos; collard green wraps. I really enjoy collard green wraps and etc. It's the perfect non-carb vehicle. These tacos are packed with various vegetables and other goodies; good kick of spice, too!\n\nCasa Blanca ($11.95): Moroccan tagine of Harissa roasted vegetables. Great flavor; loved the assorted squash and root vegetables with the couscous.\n\nBlueberry Cheese Cake ($7): Walnut crust, organic blueberries. Pretty delicious dessert considering there's no dairy. The \"cheese\" cake had a nice consistency and the blueberries had a good balance of sweet and tart.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed our meal. I'm definitely planning on a return visit and for it to be one of my go-to places in town. There's also so many other dishes to try and I'm looking forward to a cold-pressed juice cocktail. Service was phenomenal, too. Fabulous spot!
