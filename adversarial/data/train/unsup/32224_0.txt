I like the word \"family\" in Aesthetic Family Dentistry. Because I feel like I'm seeing family during my appts with them. But that does not mean they are not pro's because they are. They just make it personal in the best sense all the while giving excellent service. I have recommended Dr Roderick and his staff many times.
