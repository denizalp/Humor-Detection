This place made me laugh so hard. This is a tourist trap if there ever was one. But I really loved all the over the top old school cheesy Vegas feel that it has. There were tons of weirdos available for a small fee for photo ops. I saw fat man brides, Chipndale dancers, show girls\/guys, street performers, playboy bunnies, Michael Jackson and a lot of homeless people begging for money. \n\nThe light show over head was cool and they have a few stages with performers playing live music. Tons of trashy interesting people make a great evening of people watching. \n\nThis is a must see in the down town area.
