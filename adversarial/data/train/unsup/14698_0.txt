It's been two years since my previous review, and following the advice I gave -- it was a very pleasant dining experience, upgrading from 4 to 5 stars! I have to reiterate the same points: \n\n- SIT AT THE SUSHI BAR. The chefs are on point with their service and are very kind! Make sure you tip them too!\n- ORDER AYCE. It's $26.95 for all-you-can-eat dinner, which is easy to accumulate with the sushi rolls ranging from lowest $8.95 to as high as $16.95. Plus, it lets you also order from the appetizers, entrees & desserts! Easily worth it!\n- ASK FOR HALF ROLLS. If you're not sure you'll like something, start with a half roll. Instead of getting stuck with something you don't like, getting 4 pieces versus 8 helps! Then, if you love it, you can always order it again. ;)\n- GET A STAMP CARD. You get a stamp for every all-you-can-eat you purchase... and after ten of them, you get one AYCE meal for free! They should give you one with your check, but if you already have a card, make sure you let them know because you can't combine cards!\n\nIn terms of what we ordered (in favorite order): \n- CRISPY SOFT SHELL CRAB\n- YUMMY YUMMY CRISPY TUNA\n- YUMMY YUMMY CRISPY SALMON\n- SILVER STATE ROLL (my #1 fave roll!)\n- ROCK N' ROLL ROLL (no rice roll) \n- ENERGY ROLL\n- FRESH HALF SHELL OYSTERS (limit 2 pieces per person)\n- CRAZY GIRL ROLL\n- CRAZY BOY ROLL\n- OMG ROLL\n- VEGAS ROLL\n- LASAGNA ROLL\n- BAKED GREEN MUSCLES (we got 6 orders!)\n- CAJUN ALBACORE SASHIMI\n- TUNA POKE (comes with seaweed salad)\n- CREAMY SHRIMP (wonton)\n- CRAB SALAD \n- DYNAMITE \n- SMELT EGG NIGIRI\n- SALMON NIGIRI (drizzle with lemon!)\n- UNAGI NIGIRI \n- HONEY TOAST\n- GREEN TEA ICE CREAM\n\nEverything was so fresh and delicious. The service was excellent as well! The menu is very extensive and we will definitely be back soon to try out more. :)
