It's right down the street from downtown is the ONLY thing it has going for it...\n \n BEWARE THAT THIS PLACE WILL KEEP YOUR PERSONAL BELONGINGS IF TAKEN TO Lost AND FOUND! Left a bag in my room so I called to asked them to ship it to me...they claim it was never turned in. Of course not...why would their employees be honest enough to turn in a bag with an expensive good brand of glasses, expensive brand name watch, and expensive costume jewelry??? The ironic part is that they happened to find my sister's inexpensive bra and t-shirt...the rest mysteriously disappeared! \n\nOH OH OH...AND ON TOP OF THE STOLEN ITEMS...the hotel bathroom shower door is non existent.  So most of the shower water will trickle out onto the floor making it dangerously slippery.\n\nAND IF THAT'S NOT ENOUGH TO KEEP YOU AWAY...THE WINSOWS ARE NOT SOUND PROOF...ALLOWING YOU TO HEAR ALL THE NOISE FROM THE DOWNTOWN STRIP...the hotel is NOT COURTEOUS enough to forewarn you BEFORE booking, but they are kind enough to provide complimentary ear buds...which are mediocre at muffling the noise.
