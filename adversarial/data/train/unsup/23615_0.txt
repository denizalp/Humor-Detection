Came here for dinner with three friends and we got seated at the bar immediately. It's a really pretty bar but of course it is- it's in the bellagio! My drink was the \"Lychee\" cocktail which was amaze. Fruity and refreshing! Made with bellvadere and of course lychee how could you not like it? \n\nI get dynamite whenever I see it on a menu and this visit was no exception. It had the dynamite sauce, about two pieces of scallop, three shrimp and 168 mushrooms. Haha the shrimp was good, the scallops were GREAT, but there was barely any. They definitely filled up the plate with mushrooms which is annoying when you pay $30 for a quick entree in Vegas. Damn you Vegas. I hate that I love you so much!\n\nWaitress was a tiny bit snooty. But if I was as hot as her I probably would be too. \"She need a golden calculator to diviiiiide....\"
