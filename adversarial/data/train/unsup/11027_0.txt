Although I have been to Las Vegas a dozen times, I have rarely strayed from the chaos of The Strip. Feeling like branching out during my recent trip, I had a small window of time when I first arrived, so I decided to stretch my legs in the dustier parts of \"The Meadow\". Called \"The Boneyard\", this museum started as a large lot of signage and discard to now being a nicely managed space of well-known Vegas memories.\n\nSome tips: you should absolutely buy tickets ahead of time because they sell out quickly on the weekends. The docent-driven tour is about an hour long and gives a thorough detail of several signs while providing some insight into Las Vegas history. At $18 a ticket, the cost is worth it to learn a lot about something in LV other than The Bellagio Fountain. There are day and night tours, but if you take the day tour, you should also buy an umbrella to use- even in March. Seriously. It is quite hot.\n\nBe sure to check out the photos before going and remember to take your own. Enjoy!
