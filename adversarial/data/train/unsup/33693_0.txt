We stopped by Matts Big Breakfast on camelback yesterday.  It was nice inside and the employees were friendly. I was excited to eat there because I had heard how busy the other Phoenix location was.  I have to say that the food was average.  It was so greasy and shiney that I thought Rihanna was going to walk in and start singing \"shines bright like a diamond\".  I hadn't seen such glistening food since living up in the mountains in Montana.  My wife and I had to ask for extra napkins to dab off all the excess oil. I only ate it cause I was starving, but then felt I needed to run home to get my cholesterol pill.  All jokes aside,  it wouldn't be my first choice next time. But I would be willing to try it again in case maybe the cook was a little heavy handed.  One more note to the owners.  The toast was sopping wet in butter too.  I had to tear off the upper layer of bread.  Oil is not the answer for a good breakfast. My wife makes awesome dishes that any restaurant would love and she uses Pam spray.  That's really all you need.  I ordered the 2 egg breakfast with hashbrowns, bacon and toast. + coffe
