I visited this place for the first time today after reading some excellent reviews about this restaurant.  I can say that I loved it. The prices are very reasonable and the portion sizes is excellent also. Customer service is top notch. Very polite and friendly and caring about the customer. Food tasted great. I had the shrimp and chicken combo and the chicken and steak combo as well. Excellent quality. The only thing my family and I didn't like is that we felt the food and sauces were a bit on the sweet side. A bit too sweet to our taste. But other than that everything else is great! I will definitely go there again!
