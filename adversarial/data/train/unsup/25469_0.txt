Had dinner at WG after catching KA at MGM Grand. Atmosphere was lively. Drinks were inventive, including the pomegranate mojito and the cinnamon martini. Shared a crab cakes appetizer, which was among the best we've ever had. I had the roast chicken, which was quite fantastic initially. The serving was huge, with breast, thigh and a fillet as well. The meat was moist and tender. Garlic mashed potatoes were great. Honeyed carrots and string beans retained their crunchiness and flavor. Unfortunately, due to the large serving, the flavors got really monotonous after a while, and I gave up on about a third of the chicken. My friend had the raviola, which was injected with some kind of rich cheese and broth, and topped with more rich sauce. Again, much too rich after the initial explosion of flavors.
