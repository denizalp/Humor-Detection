I don't know what I could say about Liberty Market that hasn't been said multiple times already.  But here goes. \n\nThe people- helpful, friendly, accommodating.  Always happy to answer a question or to whip up a sample of some tempting little treat.\n\nThe menu- exhaustive. I've yet to try something I didn't love. If you can't find something to eat here, then you must work for the competition!  My go-to meal is the Liberty Bowl with pasta. \n\nThe atmosphere- kitschy, eclectic. The neon, the colors, the espresso machine (more on that in a bit). Plenty of indoor seating. Nice outdoor patio. Bathrooms that are works of art. \n\nParking- can be a little rough, what with all of the other businesses there in downtown Gilbert. \n\nThe Espresso Bar- Oh. My. Goodness. That E61 espresso machine is older than me- and probably most Yelpers (if not any two combined), but wow does it make a delicious shot of espresso!  If you've never had a Cortadito, I highly recommend giving it a try.\n\nGo to Liberty Market. Do it. Do it now. Thank me later.
