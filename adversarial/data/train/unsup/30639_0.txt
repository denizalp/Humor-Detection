The office had such a welcoming feel right when I walked in. The staff seemed happy to be there. They were smiling, laughing, making small talk and yet all seemed busy at the same time. An upbeat, positive environment.\n\nDr. DiMassa was great. He took enough time to explain the kind of work I needed while also setting my mind at ease with his demeanor.\n\nLooking forward to being treated by this great team of professionals.
