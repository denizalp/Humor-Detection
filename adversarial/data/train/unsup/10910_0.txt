I had a series of 3 spinal injections w no pain relief. Why? Because dr Houston  misdiagnosed me. This TOCA group is supposed to be a sports medicine group. If that was the case then he should have had no problem diagnosing this run, tennis player, over all athlete who has never stretched in his life with a negative MRI with periformis syndrome! I suffered for over a YEAR while he gladly wrote pain medicine scripts. Fortunately for me my CPA brother in law diagnosed me and showed me some extremely effective stretches. This is condition which is classic in triathletes not that I was ever examined because I doubt that pays as we'll. overall feeling like bad practice. And yes he's got a terribly arrogant bedside manner and clearly doesn't evaluate his patients adequately.
