As the city continues to grow, the selection of restaurants grows too. Ramen Hashi is the newest ramen joint to open recently. Finally got the chance to give this place a try and was pleasantly surprise how well everything was. I have a special place for Ramen, especially coming from Hawaii. Ramen is what I grew up eating and it's prepared in various ways from your traditional to your infused version. In Hawaii, we are accustomed to eating Saimin which is a fusion of Japanese Ramen, Chinese Mein and Filipino Pancit. \n\nRamen Hashi leans toward more of a traditional ramen. A cool aspect of the restaurant is the open kitchen and every seat in the house is along the bar facing the kitchen. Condiments are provided including pickled ginger in a stainless steel container, I personally love. The whole process of ordering requires you to fill out a sheet with a pencil provided kinda like the ones at DMV. After, deciding which base and toppings you want. The server than forwards your custom order to the cooks and everything is prepared fresh including the in house noodles made on site. Wow, everything was simply delicious. It was prepared as how I want it and the option of ordering extra noodles are added once you finish your first serving. Which, I previously had my extra noodles place in my bowl rather than later on. A plus, since noodles get very soggy in the broth over time. \n\nThe menu is streamlined so it's not to complicated but keeping with the traditional ramen taste. They have 4 different flavors that include; Shio, Shoyu, Tonkotsu & Chasu Don. I got the Tonkotsu, Pork based broth with soy sauce. The flavor was balanced and the noodles were just right in texture. I will come back for more especially during the cold nights in Vegas. Another great addition to the ever changing foodie scene!\n\n2017 Yelp Review #73
