I had my first spray tan here and absolutely loved it! It was my first experience having someone spray tan me; i have always used the automated booths (mystic tan, etc.)\n  \nAt first I  was pretty nervous about being full on nude in front of someone I had never met before. The nude part was pretty much my only reservation about coming here. But really, it wasn't as bad as I thought! I was very comfortable. The technician talked to me and was very calm, as if she was very used to seeing people naked all the time... haha \n\nThe shop is super cute too!! They custom mixed my color and very thoroughly explained the process. My skin is absolutely bronzed and gorgeous now!!! Having someone airbrush you is SO much better than a mystic tan. It is so even and the color is gorgeous for my complexion. \n\nIn a mystic, your face, feet, and hands usually get very dark. Here, they just do a light coat on them so it looks so much more natural!! My new airbrush tan is so even and beautiful. \nFor very fair complexions like mine, these are fantastic!!\n\nAnyways, I clearly love this place and will definitely be coming back for many more spray tans! :-)
