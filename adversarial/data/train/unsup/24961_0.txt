Sadly, I did not love Love. I wanted to! It was a great concept, but, you know, should very odd French Canadians really be let loose on the Beatles song book? You tell me.\n\nIt was totally RANDOM, man. Better vibe for like Pink Floyd or Queen. The opening number was GREAT, electrifying, cleverly live-concert like, and then things fell apart from there.\n\nHypocritically, I thought they could do MORE. The middle sagged, unlike the zero-percent-body-fat performers. And then the scene grew dark. There was a war in the middle for the love of Ringo!\n\nThe only memorable and new thing I saw was the trampoline bit.\n\nDare I say it? Could it be that Cirque du Soleil is overdone? Spread too thin? They only have a different show at every single casino. Could it be that, I know it's damn near un-American to say it, that Cirque du Soleil is totally played out at this point? \n\nAnyone else had enough of Cirque? It's the Will Ferrell of circuses!!!
