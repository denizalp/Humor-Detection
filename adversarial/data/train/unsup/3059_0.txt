Im kind of speechless here. The level of detail at this place, and the use of technology absolutely blew me away. I work in IT, so Im often overly critical of how people use technology...but I have to tip my hat here: Computers for creating account in the lobby, TV's in each dental room, and incremental photos of work done. \n\nI had a cavity that ended up turning into a crown. If I had gone to a strip mall dentist, I would have thought \"Sure it did, sounds like I just got had\"...but Dr. Tampoya is insanely detailed...and actually was taking photos of my tooth as he was continuing to check for decay and drill. After he completed drilling out the decay, he took the time to explain to me what was going on, and what he saw in every photo. He also explained how I should expect the tooth to react, and why a crown was needed. He was extremely detailed, attentive to my questions, and great at explaining my options. I was conflicted leaving feedback on yelp because I've gotten good luck with getting appointment times I wanted...hopefully not TOO many people will read this.\n\nMy only complaint:  When he was drilling my tooth and said \"Oh this appears to be bigger than I'd expected?\", my mouth was full of tools and I missed a golden opportunity to reply with \"Thats what she said\".
