Creepy Therapist, Poor Technique & NOISY (Next to a DAY-CARE!)\n\nI went there for a lymphatic message, which was a waste of money & time. First of all, the lymphatic message \"specialist\" was creepy. He did not make eye contact with me at any time - not even upon first greeting him. He gave off the creepy vibes big time. The entire time I was getting the \"message\" I kept thinking, \"this guy is definitely a serial killer who lives with his mother.\"  \n\nNow, on to the message: It was not a lymphatic message at all. I am very familiar with this type of message - so trust me when I say it was done wrong.  The technique, order and amount of pressure applied were all wrong - which can be dangerous to people with seriously compromised lymphatic systems - so beware. Plus, when I questioned him about his education (mid-way thru), he told me that he almost failed the program because he couldn't get the technique right.  It was so bad that I almost walked out. \n\nLast, they are located directly next to a DAY-CARE. They share very thin adjacent walls. So, the entire time that I was stuck in the room with what I believed to be a psycho killer, there were children screaming the entire time - and not the kind of screaming that they do when they play. They were screaming in fits - talk about not being able to relax!  One child was taking a tantrum. She was screaming as loud as she could for the entire hour.  It was  -  the worst message experience ever!  I just can't believe they located themselves next to a daycare - not very thoughtful or smart.\n\nThey did have FREE Valet Parking.
