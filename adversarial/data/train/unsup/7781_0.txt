imagine eating\na hairball your cat yakked up\nthat would be sonic\n\n\nThe quality is that of prison food. The flavor is that of a Flint Michigan public school cafeteria, complete with local water.  \nI don't think I ever tasted anything as horrible as Sonic food. Possibly, it is made of racoon poop. One bite and into the trash.\n\nCarry on.
