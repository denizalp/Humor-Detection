Heard about this truck from The Meat Shop newsletter and went over today to check it out. The lumpia was the first thing I tried, it was exceptionally good. The BBQ flavor was really excellent on the pork and chicken skewers, I wanted to order more. Tried the chicken feet, flavor was good but they were cold in the center. \nOverall it was a great meal and I will be back again!\n.
