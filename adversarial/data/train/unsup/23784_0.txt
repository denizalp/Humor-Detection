i'll admit, my expectations were rather low.  everyone kept raving, and i was like \"whatevers, it's just tacos\".  and \"my gawd wtf is up with this line!\" \"do we REALLY need to wait here and eat this... we can get mexican food anywhere\".  \nand then.... the adobada happened, and my mouth was way too full of deliciousness to whine any more.\n\nthere are 4 lines you can order from.  each line is designated for specific items, so if you want the adobada and you're standing in the carne asada line, you're shit out of luck.  better go to the back of the line, pronto!\n\nwe ordered 4 adobada tacos, 4 carne asada tacos, 1 carne asada sope, and a bowl full of chilis and all that jazz.  for all 9 items and a horchata (self serve) our bill was 23 bucks.  upon receiving all our food i really thought we were in over our heads and had ordered way too much... but we finished every single bite... and was left wanting more.\n\nthe carne asada was nothing special.  in fact, i've had better.  king taco's asada trumps el gordo any day.  but man, oh man, the adobada... the green sauce.  mind blown.  was so delicious.  \n\nthey have another tacos el gordo in chula vista, but none close enough to OC.  definitely will be going out of my way to get more hopefully soon..
