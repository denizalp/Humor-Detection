This is a review for the Stubby's portion, not Corks. \n\nUpon arrival, we were greeted by a nice, friendly young lady who promptly seated us. The booth we sat in was the last one towards the back of the building. The entire area back there had a terrible smell, almost smelled like urine. Our server came over to the table in a reasonable time and took our drink orders. Then we waited, and waited, for almost 10 minutes. When our drinks were finally brought to us, our server apologized and even commented on how long they took. Keep in mind, the bar wasn't full, nor was the restaurant. No excuses for those drinks taking that long. We placed an appetizer order (potato bombs) along with our dinner orders. We waited almost 20 minutes for the appetizer to be brought out, only to discover that they were way over cooked and hard as a rock. We sent them back and asked for them to be taken off the check. Shortly after, our dinners arrived. I can't comment on the others, but mine was not good. I ordered the cheese steak sandwich. It was very bland, no seasoning. The meat was definitely over cooked and very rubbery. The only good part of this night was our server. He did a good job. I will not be returning here ever again, unless major things change around there.
