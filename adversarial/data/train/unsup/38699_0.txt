Great fried chicken and very friendly staff. I also love their potato salad. Super laid back atmosphere. Unless you're the staff - they are always hopping but smiling and nice. I sometimes go here to grab my lunch to go. However, they do have a small seating area. If you are going with a small group to sit and eat lunch, I would recommend getting there a bit before noon. At lunch time, it is routine to have a line form but it doesn't take too long to get your order.
