I'm not a huge ice cream person, but when I crave it, it's nice to know there's a location down the street even though the chain overall is getting harder and harder to find. Their e-club gets you a free scoop on your birthday and various coupons throughout the year.\n\nFavorite flavors include jamocha, jamocha almond crunch, the cherries jubilee, black walnut, and pralines and cream: you pretty much can't go wrong. For those on a diet, they have lower-cal options, they even have sugar-free and lactose-free choices- talk about accommodating!\n\nExcept for the fact that their register apparently will not read your card occasionally, and they have no way to enter it manually. So you can go in excited, make small talk with the staff, get your ice cream scooped, then go to pay, and get handed back your card with a brusque, \"Your card isn't swiping. It's not for insufficient funds or anything, but it's not reading.\" And they toss your order and move on to the next person. RUDE.
