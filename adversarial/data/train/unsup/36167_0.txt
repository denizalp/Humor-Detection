One star is too many.  Ordered flowers for Valentines Day for my wife.  They asked for \"recipients\" email address but assured me it wouldn't be used.  Well, guess who they sent the order confirmation to (of course my wife's email) even though the account and order were under my email.  Several emails and promises later I've gotten zero satisfaction and don't even know if flowers will be delivered or not.  DO NOT USE THIS FIRM.
