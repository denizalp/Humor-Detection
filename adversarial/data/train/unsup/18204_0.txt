Great dessert spot with tons of options to satisfy your sweet tooth, especially if you're feeling some rich and pricey chocolate. The location of this place is somewhat on the backside of the Bellagio just behind the floral gardens. The service is solid and the decor is fantastic anchored by the larger than life chocolate fountain. This place is a bit on the small size but worth a peek of you're in the area and have a sweet tooth. \n\nPros-\nSelection of sweets \nService \nChocolate fountain \nCoffee \n\nCons-\nPricey\nCrowded \nLine is awkward
