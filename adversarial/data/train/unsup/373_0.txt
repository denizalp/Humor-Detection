Ever heard of customer service?! The man and woman that work there are unbelievably RUDE! I always dread going into the store because it puts me in a bad mood. It's the closest Asian market to my house and if they didnt sell empanadas on Saturdays, I would definitely make the drive to another market. I go in every Saturday and you'd think becoming a regular would get you better service... Nope! Ruder and ruder every time. \n\nTHEY SHOULD BE THANKFUL FOR THE CUSTOMERS THAT KEEP THEIR BUSINESS OPEN.
