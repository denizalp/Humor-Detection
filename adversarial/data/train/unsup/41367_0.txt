Negatives: \nIt's 11am and they don't have any pizzas ready despite the fact that they advertise 'hot and ready'. \nThe counter person was a little impersonal and the wait for pizzas was longer than the 15 minutes they promised. Employee who was prepping and cooking did not have a hat or hair net. He also had a beard. Also did not wear gloves. :( \n\nPositives: \nPlace does look clean and I like the exposed kitchen.
