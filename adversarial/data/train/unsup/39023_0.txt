My husband and I chose the Studios 5C Terrace to host our (large) rehearsal dinner. Matt and his team were incredible to work with, very professional, very responsive and had everything set up for us on time. \n\nThe space itself is beautiful and perfect for any occasion and we highly recommend it to anyone else interested in booking it!
