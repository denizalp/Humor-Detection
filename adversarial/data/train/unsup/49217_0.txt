Outstanding food. Outstanding service! I stopped in here around 7am during the week expecting it to be somewhat busy, but we were seated instantly. I started off with some orange juice, which I must say was a little pricey for one glass, but it was one damn good glass of orange juice... the food was amazing. Went with the chicken fried steak and some hash browns and eggs and was not disappointed. Their toast is also amazing! This is my go to favorite diner! And it's in a great location, right off the I-10! Keep it up black bear
