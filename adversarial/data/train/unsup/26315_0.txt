We went to the ER for my daughter today and I just had to write a review. Everyone who took care of us was amazing. They made my daughter feel comfortable and seemed like they genuinely cared. Even the staff we passed in the hall way was nice. It was a great experience but we hope to not come back any time soon ;)
