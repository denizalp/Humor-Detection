Last night my family and i had Another great meal here... We love going to santos. Perfect neighborhood Italian style restaurant. We have 6 in our family but they always make us feel welcome. They have great prices too, our bill yesterday was under $30. It is small though so keep in mind during peak times you might wait, and if crowded it can feel cramped. Staff is very nice and accommodating, imo can't go wrong with any pizza!
