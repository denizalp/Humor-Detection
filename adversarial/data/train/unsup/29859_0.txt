I was in town for business and trying to find a spin class that fit into my schedule. At first it looked like everything was booked up, and so I signed up to waitlist the Thursday 630 AM class. In the afternoon in Wednesday I got the notification that a spot for me and my coworker opened up, and so we went. We both thought it was a great class and will be back again
