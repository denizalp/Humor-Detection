We ordered some take out here, so this may have affected the rating. \n\nI don't have too much to write. The ramen was good and the broth was good. It just wasn't...great. \nWe ordered two of the same Miso Ramen. \nWe also ordered the Gyoza. It too wasn't that great. \n\nEven with the Chasu pork--I've had it super tender. It was very tough and hard to bite into.\n\nI'd like to go into the location to try it out again and maybe some different ramen this time.
