Beer Bistro was hubby's first choice for his birthday dinner, and not surprisingly so being the beer connoiseur that he is.\n\nConveniently located near the intersection of King & Yonge, It's a beautful high ceilinged interior with Art deco-ish flourishes. The Hostess was also super friendly and was very accomodating as I specifically booked a small booth\/corner and also pushed back our reservation much later than anticipated, but my reservation remained well intact even when we waltzed in 5 minutes late.\n\nThe beer menu here is expansive and with choices as exotic as Avery Brewery's Mephistopheles Stout ( at 15.92% alc.\/vol !!) and Nickel Brook Gluten Free Specialty Grain Beer.  It's evident that they'll be no no Pabst Blue Ribbon to be found here.  I love that the Beer Bistro's menu also suggests a suitable beer for every app or entree and even categorizes it's beer menu by choices like \"Quenching\" , \"Sociable\" and \"Robust\"\n\nTo start we order the deliciously crisp Wild Crab Maki Roll  that's battered with pilsner tempura, and hubby orders the Wood Smoked Buffalo Wings that is fruit beer-marinated, with chipotle hot sauce celery sticks, qu√©bec blue cheese & leek dip. Hubby compliments his wings with Neustadt Springs Big Dog Porter, which he claims is pleasantly bitter with a hoppy flavour.\n\nFor our mains I order the Grilled Atlantic Salmon with wok steamed vegetables & white beer beurre blanc which was mouth wateringly delectable as the buttery veggies with the beer infused Salmon was the perfect balance of light yet decadent.\nHubby entree is the Jamacian Goat Curry which is marinated in caribbean stout, tropical fruit salsa & coriander yogurt quinoa served with a bollock kicking scotch bonnet hot sauce which the server assures us is incendiary, but well worth the burn.  Hubby's secondary beer is again from another Toronto brewery Junction Conductor's Craft Ale, which hubby deems as having a lovely, nutty aroma. \n\nThe clientele was mainly caucasian which stunned me given that it was downtown, but hubby (who is caucasian) asserts that it shouldn't be surprising as it is a beer-centric eatery. Heck there was even a snappy jazz band by the name of \"The Gene Pool Boys\" playing some hep tunes while we ate.  I realized also that the dress code is certainly relaxed, even for a Saturday night as my Rihanna-esque outfit of a fedora, pleather pants metal spiked stilettoes and silver nails raised many a conservative eyebrow, I just can't help being a clotheshorse yo!\n\n If you want a terrific meal accompanied by an excellent beer selection with an air of sophistication and minus the hoity-toity attitude, the Beer Bistro is definite must.
