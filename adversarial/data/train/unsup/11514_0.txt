We were in Arizona for Spring Training and traveling with Dodgers fan so we HAD to visit Camelback Ranch for a game. Despite being an Angels fan, I have to admit that I liked their stadium MUCH better than ours. My husband says that it's simply because it's a newer stadium and they invested more money and such but I don't really care about the details all that much. It was a nicer stadium simply because of more space, good audio, and better seats on top of that! I think it's also pretty easy to meet the players for an autograph so that's always a plus for all the fans. \n\nThe stadium was really nice and clean. There was a ton of walking space and a lot of food and snack choices. It was also free parking which was awesome! One thing that was super weird about their security was that they weren't allowing any umbrellas in. We had an umbrella hat that was denied access but my hat that was probably bigger than any umbrella was allowed in. It was just weird especially since it's over 90 degrees all the time over there during Spring Training. Anyways, with that said it's a decent enough stadium to catch a minor league game. It doesn't compare to the big stadiums but this one is A-OK. 3\/5
