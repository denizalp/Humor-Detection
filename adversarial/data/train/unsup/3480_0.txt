If you're an RVer, stay away from this place!\nLet me start off by saying that this campground was strange from the get go.  If you look them up in the KOA directory you'll see that they boast about on site camp store, Blimpie, gas ,etc.  This is  because the campground is located AT THE GAS STATION.  The camp store isn't a camp store...it's a gas station convenience store with a Blimpie in it.  And worse than that, connected to the convenience store is a neighborhood dive bar.\nThe pull through sites are very long but most have just rocks and no smooth spot at all.\nThey don't have any fire rings yet sell firewood at the store.  We asked about making a fire and the gas attendant, uh Blimpie worker, uh convenience store worker, uh campground worker told us to just make it on the ground...IN THE GRASS! (The rocky pull through site was so bad that we asked to be moved to a grassy back in one)\nHere's the worst part...the dive bar gets crowds at night and they allow them to park up into the campground.  Supposedly they have security in the front but we drove right past them coming back one night.  One afternoon, I went into my cooler to find out that beer and wine were stolen from it...no doubt from the drunks leaving the bar.  This was a first for me.  It forced us to clean up everything we had outside, put it away and lock all of our storage compartments. \nThis campground appears to be a 1 night stay over place on your way to somewhere else.  I suppose it's ok for that, just don't leave anything outside and make sure you get a site WAY in the back so you don't hear the motorcycles and cars starting at 2am when everyone leaves the bar.  It is NOT a family campground and I wish I knew that ahead of time.\nNever again!
