If you like playing pinball machines you will LOVE this place. Just rows and rows of pinball machines and games dating back to 1940's. It is truly amazing we had a blast. They have a fresh popcorn machine, drinks and snack vending machine. The only complaints i have ,it is extremly hot they have fans, and its dark so you feel like your in a divey joint. The games are well maintained and there is an attendant on hand to help with any stuck balls which did happen, of course its pinball. The only reason we left was my daughters were spending up all my gambling money. Now that i know about this place we will come prepared next visit.
