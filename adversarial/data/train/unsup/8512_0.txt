Espresso a Mano is basically a model third wave coffee shop. They make sure they do everything correctly, without taking many chances... posting review...\n\nWait, that's not all I have to say. Allow me to indulge a bit in the wonders of storytelling, aka review writing. First off, I would like to say that I feel a bit partial to Espresso a Mano. Back when I was but a small child (about a month ago), and before I acquired my Yelping habit, I \"found\" this place. No one in my acquaintance had been here or even heard of it. I remember approaching and looking in through the open garage door and thinking, YES. This place is good. I continued inside, ordered a cappuccino and lingered on a chair, until it was time for them to close. As I walked out, my belly full of warm milk and espresso, I still had the same feeling. YES. This place is good. \n\nI've been back several times since. Each visit is a continuation of the original experience. Since the first time, I have learned that the La Marzocco they use is a wonderful machine. I have learned that the coffee they use is from wonderful coffee roasting companies. (Counter Culture, Verve, Coava, Ritual etc. etc., they switch often but Counter Culture seems to be a constant.) And I have learned that I really like pour-overs. As the name says, this is Espresso by hand, and I was distraught that they would Only offer espresso. Of course the stress only lasted until I realized that pour-overs are actually an option. Cheers!\n\nLike I said earlier, this is basically how every third wave coffee shop should be. Or at least a slight variation of this. There's nothing too outstanding, for sure not in a bad way. It's just a perfect little cafe, tucked away in a perfect little Lawrenceville that builds a perfect cup of coffee.\n\nUpdate: 12\/05\/15 \nOk so there's no pour-overs actually. But they do Aeropress.
