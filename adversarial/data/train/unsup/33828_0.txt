Wow this place has really gone down the drain. We ordered the authentic pad thai as usual. It was so incredibly ketchupy this time and didn't taste a lick authentic. They even use less peanuts now! The glass noodles were overly salty. The green curry isn't as good as other thai restaurants nearby that I've recently tried. Decent though.\n\nThe service is AWFUL too. They tried to scam us on the tax on a group buy voucher, claiming tax was not included when it clearly stated on the voucher that it was included. We bickered with the waitress and waiter for a bit before the waitress started claiming that we had to order OVER $40 for the tax to be included since if it's not over $40 the restaurant to pay the extra tax or something... made no sense whatsoever. We ordered something like $39.xx so I asked to order a drink then to make the bill reach $40. She then told us the deal was done and that she couldn't go back because the system wouldn't let her. At this point, I mentioned that it says nowhere on the voucher the $40 or pay tax rule. She said tax wasn't included at all no matter what. We  finally asked to see the voucher so they could point out to us where it said tax was not included (it said the opposite). At that point, they gave in and tossed the receipt at us, saying something like fine.. pay whatever you want and gave us a glare. Customer service at its best! I paid the tax and not a penny more. I will not ever go here again because of their unethical and rude staff.
