While staying next door at the Sheraton snd popped in for a quick bute.  It was a Tuesday at 5pm.  We sat outside and waited some time for a waitress.  Once she arrived, she told us about their dollar burger special on Tuesday.  She indicated there was a seperate menu for that and stated she would bring it.  10 minutes later she arrived with the menu.  Basically, a basic burger is $1.00 and you pay for each topping.  Fair enough.  Ordered a burger with cheddar, bacon, grilled onions, avacado, and lettuce.  The burger arrived and looked pretty basic and small in size.  It contained a single patty, one sluce of cheese, a single slice of bacon, a single slice of avacado, a bit of onion and lettuce.  Each addition to the burger was from $.50 to $1.00.  Took a bite and the burger was dry and cooked well.  The waitress never asked how I would like the burger cooked.  I finished it unimpressed but I gyess what should I expect for a $5.00 burger.  With a single mixed drink my bill was less than $12.  Worth $12 but not enjoyable at all.
