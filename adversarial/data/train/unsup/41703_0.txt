Nice place ! I've been to Mme Lee once on a Friday and I liked it. Prices are pretty normal for the kind of bar\/location. $7 for a beer and $10-$13 for a drink. They have a food menu as well but I did not see it. \n\nThe location is nice and spacious. I like the open windows.. I think the place turns to a sort of club after a certain hour since I saw a lineup.. Interesting. Check it out
