I was referred by my insurance company to New Look Collision Center after getting into an accident. Super efficient, professional, & friendly. Today I returned to replace a different part that had been on back order per the manufacturer. This time I had my dog who was greeted with warmth & kindness by each & every employee that walked by. Family owned & the manager,  Horacio A. & his staff provide exceptional service.
