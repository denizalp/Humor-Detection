Lets start off by saying that I HATE THE CLUB SCENE! So when my cousin was in town, we came up with this place as common ground.\nStarting the night out, i was still a little put off by how loud it was, but then I started letting loose and having fun with friends and family. The drink prices arent the best but lets face it, we live in Vegas. The coolest part about this place I think is the fact that they play a 10 minute set of country music and then a 10 minute set of popular hip hop[ music, so everyone is happy. The dance floor was always full and they teach you line dances before the night starts for free, also bad ass. it was a good choice as apposed to a club.\nFrom now on when someone wants to go to a club with me, ill fight for revolver instead.
