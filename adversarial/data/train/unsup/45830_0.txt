3rd time staying at this hotel for a work convention.  The rooms are large and spacious.  Towels are soft. Bed is comfy.  The bar is fun, I've had their wings and the fried chips, both delish. \n\nI was lucky enough to experience their magician Original Magic Mike, he was mind blowing.\n\nThe young ladies in the small coffee shop are not friends, spend 4 days and not 1 was.\n\nI've also used their spa in previous visits and highly recommend.\n\nLove that their a lot of things walking distance.
