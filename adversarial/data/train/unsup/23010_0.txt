My first impression: \"This is where you bring your white friends when you don't want to scare them with Vietnamese food.\" It's clean and semi-prettied up, the way a PF Chang's would be.\n\nBut the food. Yeah. I can get down with the food here. \n\nPho here is perfect for any occasion; late night snack, hangover, allergies, cold, what-ever! The soup isn't too salty, nor is it seasoned so richly that it would be undesirable on a day that your tummy is doing flip flops. \n\nI'm traditionally a Pho Dac Biet connoisseur, but their $11.95 oxtail pho was delicious. We each received 3 pieces of oxtail, 2 big bones, 1 small.\n\nEgg rolls here were mo' betta to write home about than Pho Bosa. They make them the usual way here- served screaming hot with a meat and vermicelli filling. Served with the fish sauce that actually has shredded carrot in it. Go nuts and add the extra side of carrots and cucumbers if you want to add a little nutrition to your fried goodness.\n\nOf course... add a dang coconut. Sure it's 4.75, but treat yo'self. Scrape the sides off and slurp up in a straw. Convince yourself it's a great source of hydration and healthy fats.\n\nFriendly service, even from the grandparent types. \nI had waning faith that Vegas knew what was up with Vietnamese food when I saw the glowing reviews on other places that I found to be a let down, but this place can hang with the rest of the cool kids at the top of my pho list.
