A doctor's office that runs like a business..what a concept! \n\nI had heard about this place and assumed it was expensive and way too \"sheshe\", but worth it if I could find a place that carried a decent selection of frames to choose from. I dragged my husband along who was looking to get some prescription lenses in his exisiting Oakleys.\n\nAs soon as we walked in we were both impressed! The frame selection made me feel like a kid in a candy store (the prices weren't shocking, but I don't recall any specifics), the prices were comparable to other eye doctors ($75 for an appointment), the staff was knowledgeable, friendly, and my husband was able to get his glasses done! \n\nEven when my husband's glasses came back with the wrong lenses, they were great in accommodating us. \n\nThis was an overall great experience, and insurance or not, I look forward to going back when I need new glasses. I have already passed the word onto friends and family!
