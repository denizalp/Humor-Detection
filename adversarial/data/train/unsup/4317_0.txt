1st visit, decent sushi, close to home, fairly priced. In light of the fact that there were only 6 people in the place I felt like the wristband proving my ability to drink was uncalled for. (Im 36 and bald) but whatever. \n\n2nd visit, sat down at 945 (weariong a wrist band) my gf had arrived much earlier and ordered me a beer. (they gave last call at 930) She also explained that they were gonna close at 10 so I needed to hurry, at 10:06 I had almost finished my food and we had paid the bill so no one was waiting for us. the server was friendly as could be.\n\nThe sushi chefs started changing their shirts and turning the lights off in the area we were sitting. There is a reason most \"chefs\" are hidden in the back, they all have the social graces of a masturbating monkey. \n\nSo in a nutshell, it cost me $80 to find out that the idiots behind the sushi bar run the show at this china star super buffet-turned-sushi bar.\n\nto the owners, Spend the $80 wisely because I was one of 3 customers in the entire place and I wont be returning. My guess is you wont be the last business in a retarded long string of failed restaurants in that location, unless of course you get a whole lot better.
