Everything here is top quality. I recommend sitting at the sushi bar. I also recommend you order the assorted sashimi platter it's enough for two! \nThere are fresh daily specials as well as house favorites from the menu. \nJapanese whisky TOGOUCHI is our favorite and found here. Such a beautiful smooth ending. \nBy far the #1 sushi spot in N Scottsdale. We will for sure be back!
