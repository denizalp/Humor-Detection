3 1\/2 stars. Arrived on a Monday and checked in at the Autograph lounge which means shorter lines since I'm a Premier Platinum member for life via Marriott rewards.\n\nUnfortunately like other reward programs the reward program recent adjustments don't get their top 5% loyal customers much of anything now a days.  Profit driven corporations including the Marriott program which includes the Autograph Collection (The Cosmopolitan Of Las Vegas). Platinum members are offered 500 rewards points or a $10.00 credit towards food or beverages purchased during their stay. No longer offered are the complimentary brunches at Wicked Spoon, welcome gifts of adult libations or hors d'oeuvre. Upgrades on the rooms are honored IF available and during this stay the Electronic Daisy Carnival was in town so  these were non existent.  Even the valet check in and just getting around the hotel was a challenge - it was so overwhelmingly busy I opted to avoid dinning in house or hanging out due to the excess crowds and waiting. \n\nAnother con was booking my stay here via the Marriott website which promoted three nights for the price of two & a deposit up front. The nightly fee of the room didn't include the resort fee or nightly tax which was not disclosed on the confirmation. The website doesn't disclose the nightly rate is the discounted rate per night up front and the third night was not deducted at checkout as usual.  In addition, all three resort fees and taxes were added. I thought this was deceiving and feel they impr disclosing this up front. \n\nAs for the room all was good except with the bathroom hardware handle which continued to fall off when accessed to shut or open the sliding door. I had to call maintenance to repair it - which they did promptly. I alos didn't like the mattress here due to they were overly soft and mushy - result backache. \n\nWill I return here again? The jury is deliberating on this one still!
