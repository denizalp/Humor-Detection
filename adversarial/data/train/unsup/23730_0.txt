This may be my favorite bar on Montford. The absolute epitome of a dive.\n\nYes, it has an odd smell. Yes, it's not fancy at all. Yes, you should probably have a few (and by a few I mean a lot of) drinks in you before you head down the stairs here. Yes, you will have a damn good time.\n\nI've been here with several different crews of friends. From the \"we all want to sing karaoke peeps\" to the \"we just want to people watch\" variety. No complaints... always a lot of fun. \n\nThe weekends are packed. Wait time to get on stage and pretend you're on Star Search can be up to an hour. You must either be a member or know a member to get in... not sure what the membership process is. I have a friend who is a member.\n\nIf I'm out boozing in Montford, Jeff's is a definite stop. Don't ever change JBS. You're a breath of fresh air in the land of frat-tastic-ness.
