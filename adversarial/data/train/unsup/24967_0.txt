Industrial Towing should be avoided at all costs.  They illegally towed my car from a registered and posted Park and Ride Lot. I returned to pick up my car and it was gone.  I was forced to wait until 2:30 AM to drive to Lower Buckeye to pick up my car.  Even after I provided the phone bill with the time that I called the police, the police report and my boarding activity from Valley Metro- they still refused to admit they were in the wrong for towing my car.  The police officer on the scene reminded the driver that they could not hold my car hostage and he released it.  They have since falsified reports of the pick-up time to the BBB and refuse to reimburse me for the mileage and inconvienence.  This towing company has been in trouble with the Scottsdale Police Department before for illegally removing cars and FAILING to report the cars were in their posession. (Check Arizona Republic for stories).\nIf you car is towed by them, get the police involved from the very begining and your documenation.  Any others out there that have been wronged by them- contact me and we may build a class suit.
