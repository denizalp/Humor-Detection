Need a deal or a steal this is the shoe place to come bare foot in. All items in the store are $9.99 or less. Majority at that bargain price but the shoe sales are as low as $5.99. \n\nNow you get what you pay for. There tall, short, flat and trendy but the quality is not going to be top notch but we as women often where a pair of shoes for a special occasion and then we toss them in the closet. My shopping experience here and in the past has been for Summer wedges. I score each time finding a cute pair of the perfect summer wedges each time. They do the trick and service the purpose. I mean it is not Summer all year round so it is worth the visit. \n\nCustomer service is not bad. Your greeted as soon as you come in and that is about it. This is not a store you really need help in. Everything is out on the floor neatly stacked under a display table. Pretty simple as that. \n\nNow let me add this is a ladies and young ladies shoe store only. Sorry guys you'll have to stop in to by your sweetheart a gift.
