This is my go-to spot for dropping off returns with a provided shipping label (Amazon, B&N, etc). Service here is quick and courteous, but have your package ready to drop off: if you need to have a label attached or a box taped shut, they will charge you to do so. Never had any issue with this place being busy and when I've called, they always pick up pretty quick.
