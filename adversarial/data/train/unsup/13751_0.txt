Note: Courthouse Tavern is open on Sundays, but according to their website, it's only for \"special events\" or during football season. I've added the hours of operation to the listing. Hopefully, they'll appear soon. \n\nI must say that the $50 on my Just Pay Half Hot Card certainly got me around the city a bit. First it was Bloomfield's Lot 17, followed by Scott Township's disappointing Nobby's, and lastly, Downtown's Courthouse Tavern.\n\nI'd avoided this place simply due to a wrong assumption that they were near the Allegheny County Courthouse and therefore were only open during banker's hours (they're actually a few blocks down the street from it). Alas, some research revealed that they're open late until the evening. Smacking myself upside the dome for not using Google sooner, I made it a point to hit up Courthouse Tavern ASAP after work one weeknight to use up my remaining 10 bucks of credit. \n\nAmidst a jury of blue-collar folk like myself...He waited for me with a gavel in one hand, and a noose in the other...\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=u-FLsp0ee50\n\nComprised of a premium 8 ounce patty of medium-rare ground chuck, breaded onions, pickles, and a \"secret sauce\" between a halved pretzel roll, he strode into the darkened room, declaring me...\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Aj04cyXOQF4\n\nAnd he wasn't just any kind of judge...\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tX4Tp55UyLA\n\nMy crime? Failing to recognize the Judge was a worthy burger, and this was a kangaroo court!\n\n\"Thou hast forsaken my majesty!\" It bellowed.  \"Face me!\"\n\nThus, our courtroom clash began!\n\nhttp:\/\/milehighcomics.com\/cgi-bin\/backissue.cgi?action=fullsize&issue=54721413440%2051\n\nThe hearty pretzel roll proved absorbent considering the juices from the beef and the honey mustard\/Caesar dressing alchemy that was the yellow sauce. The breaded onions provided texture to the burger while dill pickle medallions added zing to the proceedings, countering and complimenting the sweet canary-colored condiment. \n\nJustice was served. Justice was tasty. Justice was done, and I had won...\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EGFp7saTQEU\n\n\nP.S. A nifty sweet\/sour cole slaw helped cleanse my palate before tackling the burger. \n\nP.P.S. To address some of the other reviews, the service was fine, and the multiracial clientele behaved themselves. \n\nP.P.P.S. I brought home with me the Up the Creek Salmon Salad for my darlin', and she was very happy with it.
