I was staying at the Rio and we had just gave our donations to the one armed bandits Lol ! And we wanted to eat before round two. So we decided to go to All American Bar and Grill for a light supper.  It was packed but we luck out and got a table overlooking the casino.\n\nLooking over the menu which had a lot of good selections we decided and ordered , 1\/2 dozen of Chicken Wings plain served with Blue Cheese Dressing $11.00 and a order of custom Fries, served with Parmesan Cheese and a side of Ranch Dressing $6.00 , a Reuben Sandwich which came with a side of your choice we chose the Chili Lime Fries for $14.00.\n\nFirst of all I like my wings lightly dusted with flour or none at all fried crisp and tossed with seasoning or sauce served hot, the way All American executed their wings they were heavily coated with a batter and fried which left them soggy but one good thing the blue cheese dressing definitely stay on the wing they were just not my flavor profile ,same with the fries I would have loved them to be toss while hot with the parmesan cheese but it was on the side and the cheese could not stick because they were served warm. The Reuben the other dish at the table which I tasted was served on marble rye bread with corned beef, swiss cheese, sauerkraut , russian dressing , and grill all the right ingredients but it fell short not enough corned beef and the sauerkraut just didn't have the tang of a good sauerkraut my Husband did comment and stated not the worse but surely not the best and I agree. Served with fries in a brown paper bag with the chile lime seasoning on the side ,I personally like this concept but again fries were warm and seasoning did not stick well when shaken. \n\nService was excellent , seating was good , food fell a little short that night but in their defense it was extremely busy .  Don't forget to check in on your Yelp app for one free Draft Beer which hit the spot , and of course we had a wonderful evening now on to round 2 !
