1 OAK is among the most popular clubs in Las Vegas.  Located at the Mirage Casino & Resort it is not only known for its trendy vibe but also known for being ridiculously crowded and having a predominant black crowd that wants to live \"La Vida Loca\".  It's a great place to party and go dancing but coming with friends, especially a decent size crowd is a MUST.  Especially when doing bottle service.  Which is highly recommended.  1 OAK has a nice ambiance but the dance floor is small.  There are go-go dancers and hip hop is mostly played as well as EDM.  At times going to the bathroom is like walking through a jungle and also getting a drink at the bar is like a homeless person begging for money, which makes getting table\/bottle service the best option for making your experience at 1 OAK more memorable and enjoyable.  Also I recommend looking for promoters on the strip or staying at the Mirage to get on a guest list.  Early arrival suggested due to traffic on the Strip and long lines for entry.  If you have to pay to get in you can use your debit\/credit card to pay.
