Horrible experience. Bad food, staff had a horrible attitude and mixed drinks that you can drink all night and never get drunk. That works out well for a place with higher prices! No doubt they are making money due to the amount they charge for a mixed drink vs the amount of alcohol they put in them. \n\nIf this bar wasn't next to the stadiums it wouldn't exists. Skip it and head somewhere else, you'll be glad you did.
