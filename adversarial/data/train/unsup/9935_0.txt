Definitely not a five star caliber restaurant (think Dominick's or Capital Grille). But they pretend to be and even have a batch of dress code cards at the hostess stand, because they probably attract a trashy element. There's literally nothing 5 star about this place. 3.5, maybe. On par with Cheesecake Factory or PF Changs for ambience, if that. Actual 5 star restaurants don't make you wait when you have a reservation and they have tablecloths. \n\nI took a family member for their birthday, because they wanted the flying chicken. I made a reservation and told the manager that it was a birthday. \n\nWhen we got there, even though we had a reservation and the place was only 3\/4 full, on July 16, we were made to wait 15 minutes. High end, reputable restaurants do not engage in that type of bait and switch service. \n\nThe waitress comes over at the end of the meal and said that she has something special for the birthday boy, either a chocolate sundae or whatever else. He chose the sundae.\n\nNever in the history of histories has an allegedly high end restaurant charged for a birthday dessert that they offered to bring to the table. The sundae was on the bill for $8 and some change. \n\nDominick's brings out a complimentary homemade beignet tree for all of their VIP birthday guests. It's not even on the menu. Or butter cake for non VIP guests. Again, no reputable, high end restaurant charges for birthday desserts. \n\nWill never go back to this trashy place.\n\nPS. what's also telling about how dreadful this establishment is is that they don't respond to bad reviews. 5 star restaurants do, because they want you to return. This place is probably the worst and most poorly run restaurant in the valley of its ilk.
