I can't believe it! NO ONE commented on the filthy place? Rude is one thing, but filth is a whole other thing.  So far, (knock on wood) no sign of poisoning but this is a nasty ass place to eat.  The bathrooms are disgustingly filthy. (The front door filth should have been the first clue but I looked past it for whatever reason that I can't explain to myself now). We took our unfinished food to go and the baskets were disgusting and apparently not washed recently.  When we removed the paper, gross crap was stuck on the baskets.. Yuck!!  \n\nThe meat is pressed, kind of like Arby meat.  I always complain if a sandwich has any bite without meat and each end had no meat.  Really??? Who wants to eat just bread for your last bite?\n\nOrdered chicken wings and according to the menu it comes with 8 wings, but we got 6 wings not the 8 as the menu stated.  The wings would have been good if they cooked them crispy but the chewy fat skin is not how I like my wings, but they were better than the Philly sandwich.  The onion rings were OK too. They were crispy and a large portion and better than the sandwich. \n\nI can't recommend the place.  I have eaten in some hole in the wall places that probably aren't that clean but the taste of the food is worth the risk but in my opinion, not here.
