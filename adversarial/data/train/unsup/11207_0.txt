As we were driving around, we decided to try somewhere new for dinner and we randomly chosen this place. It was very quiet and only had some noisy drunks in the restaurant who were very loud, it made the restaurant lose the relaxing cozy feel it had when we first walked in..\n\nI found the service for how quiet the place was to be very slow, there were lots of wait staff running around like chickens with their heads cut off but nobody seemed to be actually doing anything productive.\n\nI expected much more from the look of the restaurant to what they had to offer and from the presentation of the restaurant, staff and prices that I should of  been better service.\n\nI ordered the 8oz filet mignon, medium-well which came with mashed potatoes  and some veggies as sides.  I found that the steak was more on the rare side, not how I like it but it was already cooked to death it seemed that I didn't want them throwing it back on the grill to make it into a hockey puck. it wasn't bad, just wasn't as good as it could of been.\n\nSupposedly they have the best ribs in the area as the menu listed but tonight that was proven wrong. He ordered the ribs and as soon as he saw them arrive, looked very disappointed. only after only a little taste, he says \"these are the worse ribs I have ever had in my entire life\"  he ended up sending them back and getting the steak just as me.\n\nThe restaurant was sort of a disappointment overall and we will probably never return.
