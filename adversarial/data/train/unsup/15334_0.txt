Hmm... I'm not sure what I was expecting from my first taste of Native American food but, my Navajo Taco from The Fry Bread House was did not live up to any ideas I had.  The fry bread is good enough... of course, anything you deep fry is usually tasty but, the taco was super bland and nothing interesting.  It basically was fried bread with lettuce, beans and some cheese slapped in it.  :-\/\n\nWhen I add the lackluster food to the fact that the man at the counter was not friendly at all... rude actually, I don't have a very satisfied feeling about my experience.  My friend was trying to order the stew and some fry bread and the man treated him like he was dumb for not knowing that you have to order a combo to get both.  Then, when we ask what drinks they had, the man kinda rolled his eyes and pointed to a sign... again, like we should have already know where the sign was or what their options were.  Really?  We walked in and right up to the counter so we didn't have much chance to familiarize ourselves with their exact set-up.  I almost said something but, didn't want any chance of retaliation in our food. \n\nSo, my friends stew was full of flavor and my taco had none.  The only saving factor was the dessert fry bread at the end... \n\nI'd go back to try other things if friends invited me again but, I might try to find a different fry bread location since the big guy behind the counter was so rude and condescending at this one.  \n\nProlly won't see ya there.
