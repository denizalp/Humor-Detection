Food is really good. We made a catering order for 50 people for 350. We got nihari, chicken biryani and naan. Also came with some salad. \n\nNihari is excellent, not too spicy or oily and a good amount of beef and the naan was really good too. \n\nThe biryani was fresh but I think there could have been more chicken.
