We recently went to Pi. It is a little strange when you walk in because it looks more like a club\/lounge, but the Pizza is fantastic. We had a calzone and the pizza and I really can't say enough good things. The crust was perfect; it had a great texture and taste. We actually think it is better than other pizza places listed on the PGH top 25. We will definately go back.
