I've lived in Las Vegas almost 5 years and somehow have avoided the Pho craze until now. I always hear amazing things about it but somehow I never felt compelled enough to drive to a Vietnamese restaurant until a few days ago when I was getting a massage.\n\nThe waitress\/owner was great. She understood that I was a Pho virgin and wanted me to have the best experience possible. I ended up with a combination Pho and was very happy with my choice. \n\nI can't truly judge my overall Pho experience because I have nothing to base it on. However, I do know that the Pho broth was incredible and the friendly and attentive service was for sure worth 4 stars. I also added a 3 bean dessert that was as incredible as it was strange in both taste and consistency. I have NO CLUE what I ate.
