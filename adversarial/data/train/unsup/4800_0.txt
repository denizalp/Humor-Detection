Love love love this place! I can't go to Vegas without a visit to Pet Kingdom USA. There is such a wide variety of animals and the staff is SO friendly and knowledgeable. I believe the owner's name is Rebecca and she's super helpful. She has a great staff helping her run the place (that is very popular and therefor pretty busy at times). Every experience of the many we've had here have been absolutely wonderful!!
