I've been seeing this place in my Facebook feed for weeks. The pics are crazy delicious looking, the comments of glowing praise almost cult-like. I had to go check it out for myself. Is the hype real? Yes. \n\nFirst things first, follow them on their social medias to see when they are open and what hours. It's kind of all over the place, and they could close early if they sell out of everything.\n\nCurrently, this pop up type business is sharing a kitchen with the Indian restaurant King of Spicy. When you walk through the door, KOS is to the left and Seafood Connection operates out of the bar to the right. There's a bouncer who greets you (why is there a bouncer? I have no clue). He'll point you to the line to place your order. I went the day before Easter at a random mid-afternoon time. There wasn't that long of a line. I've heard it can get crazy, crazy busy. So, just be prepared. I've heard it does move quick. Also, don't wait too late in the day in case they do get slammed and run out of things. I went with the Connect Platter (lobster and crab legs). Along with the crab leg cluster and lobster, it includes a piece of sausage, corn on the cob, potatoes and a couple deviled eggs. Total with tax was $30. This is a cash-only concept. There is an ATM at the restaurant. \n\nNote: there's not a ton of places to sit here. They pack up the orders in a to-go fashion, I would plan to take it home and enjoy. If you don't like butter and seasoning, you won't enjoy this. It's not healthy by any means, but it's pretty damn delicious. Everyone here was so nice and it didn't take long to get my food. I will definitely be back.
