Putting aside my complete \"what what WHAT the crap\" level of shock that anyone feels the need for four shots of espresso... my friend and I get pedicures right across the parking lot so once in a while we stop over for drinks. Today we went over,  the drive through was backed up which is pretty typical but there was only one person waiting at the window so we got in line. The person nearest the window had clearly finished ordering and was waiting for drinks, the person in the window looked at us several times and continued to go on with her conversation asking the person what their biggest pet peeves are about working at a Dutch Bros. Hers incidentally are having to open or close with new hires who she said are \"like totally incompetent\". Two stars for sub-par, over priced drinks and a serious lack of customer service.
