We have just found our new Thai food eatery!  The food was absolutely delicious!  I was in heaven with the first mouthful of their yellow curry with chicken. We also ordered Panang curry with Salmon as well as their BBQ chicken with Papaya salad and sticky rice. My taste buds were in heaven. The flavors of each dish was out of this world!  Even their Thai Tea was a delight to the senses!  Highly recommend this place, our new go to Thai food eatery!
