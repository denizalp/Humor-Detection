I've had BBQ at a lot of places, Texas, South Carolina, New York, tons of places in Los Angeles, and I will say hands down this place has the best fatty brisket I've had. It's not even close. The Ribs are also the best I've ever had. I can't wax more poetic about this place using the written word so you're just going to have to go yourself and let your mouth experience this place. \n\nDefinitely get here early though, they run of their best meats by noon and the line starts well before they open. I'd say it'd be safe to get there right at open. Be prepared for a wait, at least 30 minutes. but #worthit.
