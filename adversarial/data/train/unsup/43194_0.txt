this is and has been one of my favorite go to restaurants in las vegas since they have opened... for being inside a casino, they're pretty damn legit (authenticity wise). I'm used to official chinese food all over the world.... (people knock Mr. Chows, but besides the price, it's consistent and delicious) but I'm really used to eating such great chinese food from Monterey Park, well this is that, but presented so much nicer and the food is top notch. I see the top chefs from all the 5 star restaurants inside the wynn eat there at random hours and they don't trip on how you dress. the food is a little expensive, but I don't care. the salt and pepper chilean sea bass is amazing!!! I have had almost everything on their menu and they're just so consistent and always good. I never miss at least one meal there whenever I go
