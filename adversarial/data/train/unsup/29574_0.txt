It was my first time doing my hair here. I don't believe I'll be coming back. \n\nI asked if my stylist could do a balayage, or like a color melt, but it ended up just looking like highlights. At the top of my hair, it's as if my roots grew the blonde out rather than being blended in. The job was barely noticeable compared to my previous hair color. I knew if I wanted adjustments, I'd have to pay more so I didn't bother doing it here.\n\nI am thankful for the time spent on my hair, but I wasn't so happy that I ended up paying for my hair to look just slightly lighter. I don't believe it looked even close to what I wanted. In the end, I had to go to another salon to fix it.
