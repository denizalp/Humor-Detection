To start off, the lady gave a pretty good massage. It's just misleading on how on Yelp they advertise a $20 hr massage... but once you get there and tell them you want the hour massage, it's not the same thing as what they advertise. Talking about how it's a detox and foot massage only?? Why isn't that on your menu of services. Shady shit that I'm not into. Skip this place.
