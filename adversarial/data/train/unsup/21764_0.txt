Hidden Basement \"Speak-Easy\" in Downtown Chandler\n\nYou first encounter a doorman at the top of the stairwell on the main floor. Then, you walk down and open the door to one of the movie type doors - you know the one where they slide a tiny window open and ask you for the password. Inside is a dimly lit no window grey brick walled room filled with lots of tables, a fully stocked bar with mixologists, jazz music, and thousands of LOUD conversations. \n\nOn a Saturday night, this place was PACKED. For a chill speak-easy, this place had WAY too many people. There were so many people that my party of 4 were screaming across our little table to just get a gist of the conversation we were trying to have. I talked to a regular there and she told me normally it isn't that packed and you are even able to have the full attention of the mixologist\/bartenders if you please. The night I went, was definitely NOT the case. \n\nOverall, drinks were different, good, and strong. I'd love to try more. The food was spot on. We shared the sliders and empanadas. The sliders were AMAZING. They were so stuffed that meat was spilling out of the sides with a side of tangy sauce. I HIGHLY recommend this. The pasta stuffed empenadas were good; a little soft so eat them with a fork. I can only imagine that the rest of the menued foods are just as tastes as these two. \n\nNote\/Tip:\n- One Stall Bathroom period -___-\n\nEnvironment: 2\/5 (too crowded)\nFood\/Drinks: 4\/5\nPrice: 3\/5 \nService: 4\/5
