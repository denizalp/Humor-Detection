The ladies from my work LOVE this place.  It has won all sorts of accolades as the best Mexican place in Phoenix.  I just don't get it.  I've eaten here several times and tried many different things on their menu.  The portions are tiny and I always leave still hungry.  Strange for a Mexican place.  They don't even have carne asada.  No street tacos :( This isn't real Mexican food, it's Tex Mex.  Personally I would rather eat at Taco Bell, Chipotle, Baja Fresh or even the tacos from Jack in the Box.  I must be weird though because everyone else LOVES it like it is the best Mexican food ever invented.  So don't take my word for it.  I'm the weird one.
