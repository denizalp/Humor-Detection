Don't know how the pizza tastes as their web site loses orders.   It will process your credit card, charge you and you'll receive an e-mail confirmation.  However, when you call the store, they'll tell you they don't have your order.  \nWhen you mention you have proof of the order, they tell you to call back some other day and talk to Nick.  Only Nick can handle issues with orders placed through their web site.  They don't take messages for Nick or give you his e-mail address.  I just wanted to forward my e-mail confirmation to him, along with my credit card billing notification proving I paid.  But, This is the sort of thing you can only handle by talking directly to the mysterious Nick, that appears to only work two or three days a week.\n\nTheir website passes your order to togoorder.com, and I would assume some of the code is completely screwed, but, that shouldn't have cost me $104.24, and the hatred of a bunch of starving teammates.\n\nShop elsewhere or drive to the store and order and pick it up in person.  Being as this business can't afford to purchase their own online shopping cart, they should at least add a \"Hey, my order is missing\" form to their website.
