I purchased a 2017 Grand Cherokee Jeep about 3 months ago and waited to leave this review because I was waiting to see if the dealership would come through but they didn't. The sales guy Tony that sold me my car was initially awesome. Long story short we traded in a 2 year old Nissan Pathfinder that had some engine problems. Dealership took the Nissan and had it checked out and we did our trade. When I left dealership I was told I would get my second key in a few days because they said it was in Scottsdale. I called in a few days and no key, went a week later no key. Finally called my sales guy Tony and he told me that the manager was upset because we gave them a car with a bad engine and everyone was upset! Ok????! Not sure how this is OUR problem!!! So because they are upset they have refused to give us a $150 key! Just an FYI I will NEVER purchase another car from you because you wouldn't give me my key! Well you really showed me!! Nice job Jeep. Just like all the other reviews you really need help with your customer service! \nPS don't leave me a message saying to contact you because you know who I am just send me my damn key!!!
