I had not had any Church's chicken in roughly ten years when I still lived in Phoenix. All I really could remember was that, at that time, it was dirt cheap chicken.\n\nThis outlet is located on the west side of Rainbow Blvd, just north of Windmill Road. I must have driven past here a couple of hundred times before finally giving it a try last night.\n\n Meh. I've experienced better.\n\nThat is truly a good way to sum it up. \n\n- For all the complaints I see about rudeness or lack of customer service, I did not experience that at all. If anything, the employees were very polite and respectful. I heard lots of \"sirs\" and ma'ams\" as they were helping other patrons.\n\n- Bottom line: the chicken is just too damn greasy! It was downright slimy and slipped around on my plate. Gross. \n\nAll we got was the chicken, so I cannot give an opinion on any of the sides. \n\nWith Popeye's further north on Rainbow and KFC opening very soon right up the road, I just don't think this is a great place to go for your fried chicken fix. \n\nUnfortunately, I am going to have to consider this a one-and-done experience for me. \n\n2 stars.
