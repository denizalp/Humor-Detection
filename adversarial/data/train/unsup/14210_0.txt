Ok so I ordered the pad thai lunch special,  came with salad, fried wonton, egg roll. The taste was pretty good I liked the flavor. The portion I wish could of been alot bigger but most lunch specials r usually not that big unless its ala cart. The customer service is fair,  music is coo, food came out pretty quik after ordering it, the restaurant itself is pretty coo could use a makeover a lil. But id come again cuz I hear the curry is good so that might be my next visit.  So 3 stars for now for portions being so lil only cuz I can eat lmoa! I haven't yet to find an asian restaurant in Phoenix that is hella bomb n give big portions.
