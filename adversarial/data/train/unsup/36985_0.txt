I frequent the Desert Vista trailhead. The loop is just over 4 miles to and from the parking lot. It is challenging at points but nothing too severe. Those looking for an extra challenge can do Dixie Mountain summit route off of the loop, .4 miles up and then back down. Nice view of the valley at the top. Take a snack and take your break there! Love the teddy bear cholla \"forest\". Old car in a ditch is creepy cool. Love the peacefulness.
