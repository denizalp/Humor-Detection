I have used Beaux Amis services for about a year and I have to say she is one of the best! She is always on time, creates a very pleasant atmosphere and makes you feel extremely comfortable. the prices are great and i always feel better than i did when i came in! i highly recommend her services and have referred others and will continue to do so!! She is adaptable has great ideas and a professional opinion on what works best and what doesn't, even if it isn't in her own best interest! Love this spa!
