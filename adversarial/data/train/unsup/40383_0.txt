First I have visited many foot spas.  So, when I need a massage my first thought is for a foot spa. I walked in and first, the gal told me I had to pre pay. Ok, the special flashing on the board said $45 for combo foot and body massage.  Then she said \"You want to add $20 tip\"? I said, I'll add a tip when the massage is done. She said \"No, this is not Los Angeles where you can give $1 or $2 tip\". I said, I would give a good tip if the massage was good.   She insisted and I said 20% is fair, not a tip for almost 50%.  She said, \"this is not a restaurant\". So What!  Anyway, I pre-paid, then gave a $15 dollar tip (Total $60), prior to receiving any service.  BIG MISTAKE!!  SO, I get undressed, lay on the table, she came in and started the massage.  Within about 2 minutes the phone rang and she ran to answer it.  Then, came back and resumed the massage.  About a minute later the phone rang again and she ran to answer it again.  Then she came back in with the phone, talking.  I asked if she could call that person back. She said no, because it was her insurance agent.  I asked again if she could call back. Then she said to me, \"Just give me 5 minutes\".  She left the room. I got up, got dressed and went out to the lobby.  Then she told the person she had a customer and had to hang up and she did hang up. I told her I needed a refund and I was leaving.  She told me \"You saw me hang up\". I said, I came to relax and you have answered the phone twice.  I really just want to get a refund. She said she could not reverse the charge on my credit card. So, she then reached in her wallet and gave me $50.  She said she will try to refund $10.  I doubt it.  I left. Don't go here. Don't pre-pay. Crazy terrible service!  Plus the area is a bit sketchy!
