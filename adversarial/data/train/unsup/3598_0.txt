After searching for \"ice cream\" on my yelp app, I found U-swirl, which isn't ice cream, but frozen yogurt. Not only that, but it is also non-fat frozen yogurt. After seeing the high reviews, I decided to check this place out.  This is located next to the Shakespeare Pub and Sushi Wa on Eastern Ave, right past St. Rose Parkway.\n\nAfter entering, you will notice a lot of couches in here. This is a brilliant idea. There is nothing better than just lounging on a couch eating some cold sweets. It makes you feel as if you were at home. They also have tables if you want to eat in the more traditional way.\n\nNow, let's get to the frozen yogurt. I try to get sugar-free fro-yo to help soften the damage\nSugar Free Vanilla - Creamy taste that's almost like real ice cream. There is no artificial sweetener flavor, and it is delicious. There is also a toppings bar with an extremely large selection of fruits, nuts, candies, and sauces. It is also very cheap here, for the high quality they sell.\n\nMy new favorite frozen yogurt place in the Valley, even better than Yogurt Land IMO. I will forever be the Duke here, so come by and take my thrown, if you dare.... (crazy laugh)
