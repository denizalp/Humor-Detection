I've heard good things about this place, but I have eaten my share of Asian cuisine around pittsburgh and other cities around the country and I was not impressed. I ordered the spicy California which was cool. And I ordered the teriyaki shrimp and was a little disappointed. It's not the typical dish you get when you request teriyaki. The sauce was thin and runny. I am used to a browner thicker sauce. And the shrimp  and thinly sliced mushrooms were sitting on a bed of sprouts. It didn't taste all that bad but just wasn't something I would ever order again. There was a side salad as well with ginger dressing, again, wasn't bad just wasn't what I expected. I'm normally would have ordered a salad with the ginger dressing and received a thicker textures dressing, this wasn't that at all. Was runnier. I may try the restaurant one more time and order something else just to make sure. This was take out.  You would hope it would be the same quality but I'll try it again dining in.
