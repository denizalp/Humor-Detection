I was looking for an aerosol spray that turns your hair green, oddly enough. Why spray my hair green you ask? For a joker costume to wear to Wizard World Comic Con, duh. I noticed Celebrations had just opened in the Albertson's shopping center on Ann and Simmons, and thought, maybe this party supply store might carry color hairsprays...and I was right! For $2.99, I was able to score a neon green can of hair spray. \n\nCelebrations is a small party supply store but a welcome addition to the North Las Vegas area. They carry gift wrap\/bags, balloons, themed dinnerware, and all those other tid bits necessary when throwing a party. The cashier, who I'm presuming to be the store owner, was a nice gentleman who was really helpful in assisting me during my short trip to Celebrations. I'll definitely be back if I need balloons or more neon colored hairspray lol.\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #72
