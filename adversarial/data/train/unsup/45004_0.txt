I ordered Thai tea boba and sliced bbq pork chef special. I just didn't like it. It tasted really weird. The food wasn't spoiled or anything, but the taste just didn't blend well. I won't give up on this place just yet, because there's a lot of good reviews. I may have ordered the worst plate on the menu, though. Lol.
