I'll say the donuts are bar none the best I have had in AZ.. But the employees (not the Asian owners) are the rudest I have ever dealt with anywhere ever! every time I've been there they act like I owe them for coming there when it should be the other way around... My business is a block from them so if I want anything I send my employees cause I can't deal with their rudeness.. Plus they try to overcharge us seems severe other time..
