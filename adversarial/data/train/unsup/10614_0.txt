I rolled up this morning, for my 8;45 appointment for an oil change in my 2010 Kia Forte Ex. Meep, as she was more commonly called. She had seen her fair share of long trips, had some scratches, and her motor didn't purr as loud as when we bought her used 3 years back. I was warmly greeted by the entire department, everyone was friendly, and happy to be there. I joked about my car payment ($400 a month) and my astronomical apr rate (19.75%). My oil change tech joked with a sales woman \"If you can drop her rate shes yours.\" I walked outside to call my father to chit chat, and behind me comes Belle. She wanted to hear just how I got roped into 19.75 APR on a 2010 with 80k in miles. After spewing my life story, she gave me suggestions on how to refinance in a year or so, and not once did she hint she wanted to sell me anything. When I told her \"Well if you want to waste your time on me we can try to get my \nAPR down a bit...\" we walked back inside.. \n\n3 Hours later we walked out with a brand new 2015 Kia Forte, 11 miles on the car (lovingly known now as Sprite), for roughly the same payment EXCEPT the APR was lowered to 8.25%... We were a tough case with ok credit, one income for two people, and strait forward talkers. Bell was so friendly, helpful, and honest. We felt safe buying a car with her and her boss Terry. They were both strait to the point, broke down numbers, and got us what we wanted. We will be back for sure for everything!\n\nPS..\nDrew in the finance department was awesome. Request him if it all possible! He got us a great rate on our GAP coverage and 100,000 bumper to bumper coverage.
