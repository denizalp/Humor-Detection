Delayed flight + time to kill = unhealthy eating!  I stopped here for a piece of Oreo pie and it was good.  The bartender was super friendly and I noticed she was very nice and informative to other customers as well.  She offered people \"to go\" cups if they'd been having coffee and she was as friendly as could be to me. \n\nThe food here comes from the bigger TGIFriday's location in the airport so it might take a little longer but it's a nice little place to stop.
