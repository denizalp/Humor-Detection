They're run by amateurs. One employee consistently sends me unsolicited emails. When I complained and asked that they stop contacting me (since I don't live in Toronto) I was assured I would be removed from their mailing list, only to receive further unsolicited communications. I would not go to a gym that is so disorganized if I were you.
