Stopped in for a quick bite before a movie at the Humber Theatre, the burrito was very mediocre. \n\nThe staff was friendly- trying to find something positive to mention. \n\nI had a tequila flavoured chicken with the medium salsa - it came out sweet - I was not expecting nor do I like sweet Mexican food. \n\nThe restaurant was not clean, which to me implies the kitchen isn't clean either. \n\nI will not return, there are better options around.
