I have been here several time and I am still amazed at all the great vendors that are here every time I come. I absolutely love fresh fruits and vegetables and I really enjoy cheese, fresh cheese especially. There is such a great selection of both at this place I am always so happy to see it. I feel like a kid in a candy store when I visit. \n\nI have brought all my family members and we always make a day of it. This place is really great for a good lunch. Great food, wide selection, and lots of fresh food variety how can you go wrong?! If you have not been here you need to make a trip.
