Found small leak in tire (nail) and wanted to get fixed on wife's car. Pull in at 10:20 and am told it will be 40-45 minutes. After an hour car has not moved and no update from horrible front staff. Went to counter and they said it was next to be in.after another hour it was done. I'm guessing they forgot about it till I started asking what's going on. Horrible service for what could have been a 10-20 min job. Will NEVER go back here. Waste of a day because of a nail in tire.\n\nUPDATE! \nDay after the above review was done took car out on freeway to find the tire they fixed was out of balance now. They did not put the tire back on the rim at the same location or balance the tire. Had to stop at another place and get tire balanced. Wow, total failure on the most basic stuff.
