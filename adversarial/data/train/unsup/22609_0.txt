Spectrum Mall is wonderful.  It's everything you could possibly need.  Walmart, Ross, Anna's Linens, food for the pooch?  Got that, PetsMart.  The 14 theater Harkins is super easy access.  No parking garages that take a GPS to get out of.\nThere's a Chinese place on the South side that gets great Yelp Reviews for cheap quick chinese.  The JC Penneys is actually really nice and their prices are super.  You need sporting goods?  Got that also.  Big 5.  The Costco is super easy to access also, with dual entrances from the North and South.  Need a cheap spatula?  Dollar Tree.   Bath and Body Works and a Claire's boutique are there also.  They also have XI, which are the young girl shops equal to H & M pricewise.  Shady people?  Panhandlers?   Yes, just like Pikes Place Market in Seatlle.  Yet, everyone thinks that  is hip when they are there or they just ignore it.   No, it's not the place to go if you want a new spendy outfit for a big event or a Coach Bag or a Happy Hour at a new restaurant.   It's fabulous though if you just need a variety of stuff and want one stop shopping.   But, if your still interested in trying to be cool, no, it's not for you.
