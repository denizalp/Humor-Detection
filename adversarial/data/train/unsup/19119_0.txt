This location has some hard core reviews which should be surprising for where it's located!\nMy latest visit didn't resemble any of the aforementioned negative reviews. I was looking for one particular item, found it, and did some browsing before heading to checkout. The male cashier was friendly and seemed genuine. There were also 2 cashiers which is somewhat unusual from what I'm used to at most CVS's. The store seemed clean inside and out. \n\nI frequent this CVS when in Summerlin and do recall a few rude customers here in the past with no patience if it takes everyone else more than a minute to check out. As a CVS Extra Care card member, sometimes I have many coupons and definitely take more than a minute to check out! If I'm using a gift card, it can take much longer! They had a new Extra Care machine at this location which I hope works better than the old ones.
