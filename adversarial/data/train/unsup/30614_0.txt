Great service, delicious & flavorful food that came out quickly. Hands down the best BBQ I've had in Madison so far. We tried the smoked chopped beef brisket sandwich, mac n cheese, garlic mashed potatoes, corn, fries, & the amazing fried biscuits. I can't wait to go back!! I can't remember the cashier's name, it started with a \"P\" & she's a woman- she was AWESOME! Friendly, helpful, and just all around welcoming.
