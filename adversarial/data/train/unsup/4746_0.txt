It's crazy to think that the price points between a place like Dolce Wraps and Pita Pit are apples to apples, because the difference in flavor is night and day!\n\nIt's going to sound clich√© but I'd had Pita Pit and then Dolce Wraps in the same week and you could definitely tell which one was 'made with love' ok maybe not love but definitely made with a hefty amount of 'like'.\n\nDolce incorporated those unique Mediterranean flavors into each ingredient I had in my wrap. From the jasmine rice, to the zesty tahini sauce, the parsley, ripe tomatoes, fresh crunchy onions, the garlic, natural spices in each bite of steak. Everything was packaged into a presumably homemade pita wrap and sealed to perfection.\n\nI had a teriyaki steak wrap and they have an instant fan in this guy right here. I even got one for lunch the next day. My GF got the falafel. I had a bite and it was perfectly fried with toasted sesame seeds, all the fixins and fresh vegetables that go along with it.\n\nUnique twist on fast casual, extremely delicious. You can bet based on this initial go that I'll be a regular! Thanks for your creativity and delivery!
