For $2 you get a year-long pass to use the indoor track and the pool tables and ping pong tables. My family has the swim and trim pass, I'm not sure how much that was, but I'm pretty sure it's cheap.\n\n The place is clean and doesn't reek of sweat or chlorine like some clubs do so that's a plus. They offer a ton of classes, especially for little kids, at a cheap price. \n\nThe one bad thing is that you can't pay to use the rock climbing wall because of the budget cuts, they couldn't hire anybody to be in charge of it, even though it's still listed as an activity in the Summer 2010 parks and recreation catalog. :'-(
