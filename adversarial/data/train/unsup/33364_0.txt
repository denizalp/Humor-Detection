The $20 lunch is no joke. I had the scallops appetizer, the sea bass, and the walnut cake. The walnut cake was bland, and in my opinion, kind of dry- but the other two options more than made up for it. The scallops came with mandarin orange slices and red onions- which both seemed like an odd fit before I tried them together, but it was a perfect fit. The sea bass was a simple presentation, just lemon, olive oil and capers, I think, with a single piece of broccoli, but it was perfectly prepared. As I understand, the dinner is many many times more expensive, but for a classy lunch- this was perfect.
