STAY AWAY!\n\nThere were so many clues that this place was going to be horrible, but seeing as how we had a restaurant.com deal, we decided to ignore our first impressions.\n\nWe shouldn't have. We should have ran after seeing the mile long menu, but we didn't. I guess when we also ignored the fact that they have \"30 something\" dance parties on Saturday nights, we pretty much got everything we deserved.\n\nWe got a sampler appetizer because its Friday night and we're feeling adventurous. Out came a heaping pile of fried \"things.\" Nothing really had flavor and I'm honestly not sure I could distinguish between the three items the sampler was made up of. But no worries, the lack of differnce in flavors on the plate was compensated for with a million dips and sauces... none of which really corresponded with any of the fried things on our platter. It was like a pre-meal puzzle.\n\nWe ended up just getting burgers, replacing the beef with turkey parties. Collosal mistake. Tasted like burnt rubber, which coincidentally was also the perfect description of the limp something's they surely considered French fries. Needless to say, less than half of our meals were completed.\n\nBut, beyond the meal, our waiter also tried to charge us for three meals (not two). Besides this, she was very friendly and I can usually chalk that up to a simple mistake, but when it was pointed out to her, she acknowledged that she knew it was wrong when she printed it out, but couldn't figure out why. And, they made sure to tack on the 18% gratuity on their own...\n\nJust an all around bad experience. Luckily we had the restaurant.com deal, because paying full price for that would have been brutal. Stay away folks, I know I will.
