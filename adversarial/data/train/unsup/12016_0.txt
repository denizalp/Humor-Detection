I just read a dissertation written by a Northcentral University Ph.D. student in my field and it was so horrible I Googled the school to see if it was legitimate. The poor quality of the dissertation was shocking! I honestly don't know how a school could get away with this! There are quality distance programs, but this is not one of them if this dissertation was approved. Only 2 major researchers were named, the same material was repeated in every chapter, they did not know the difference between a theory and a methodology and the grammar was 5th grade level - if that. This is an outrage. If you are a serious student, find a school with a better track record. I've read more than 100 dissertations and not one was poorly done. The one from Northcentral is a mockery of the doctoral process.
