Always delicious!! Started off with the garlic knots and marinara!! So yummy:) Kids got the chicken tenders and fries that come with a drink. Good size for bigger kids too. I got the sausage sandwich which was ginormous!! We also got the grilled chicken club which was very good, not as big as the sausage sandwich. The sides were sooo good which was the ceasar salad and garlic sauted spinach!! So yummy
