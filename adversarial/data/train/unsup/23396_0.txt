No!  Absolutely not!  Never, ever again!  I live in town and wanted to spend an evening downtown - walk around Fremont, get polluted, etc... and decided to get a room here.   This is NOT the place to stay! The casino floor is nice, the bars are decent, but unfortunately the rooms include FREE BED BUGS!  Took a cab home at 3am, and no... they would not refund the room cost.
