What a great experience. These are mostly older machines with a few new ones sprinkled in. They charge the rate when the machine was released for instance older machines are $.25 ones from the 80's and 90's are $.50 and new ones are $.75-$1.00. They do a great job maintaining these machines. Well worth the visit.
