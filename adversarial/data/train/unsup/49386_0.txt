Omg so I am not the only one who think people that works here and the owner is rude!! Came here a few times because I have no choice, there is no Asian market close by. They hide some of there produces in the back like bean sprouts and basils you have to ask them to get it. Other vegies are so old and all rotten plus on top of that WORST customer service RUDE! never come back here
