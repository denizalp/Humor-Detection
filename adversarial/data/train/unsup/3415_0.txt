These people are horrible! I've worked with a lot of movers and never had an experience like this. They just broke a large, expensive frame of mine, did a super shoddy repair. It separated on its own a few days after they repaired it. They refused to repair it again. Worse, Anne who works there acts like I owe Owen and her something, how dare I ask them to repare something they broke. I don't usually write reviews, but don't like the thought of businesses thinking they can get away with anything they want so I want to warn others.
