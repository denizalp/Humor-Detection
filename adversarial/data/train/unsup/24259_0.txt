I've been to this location a number of times, but I have to admit that this last visit was the best.  I was immediately greeted and brought to the appropriate section, where a friendly blue-shirted employee helped me figure out whether the \"one-size-fits-all\" laptop power adaptor would work for my netbook.  We sadly determined it wouldn't work, and I walked towards the exit, only to be met by the same greeter.  She helpfully told me about Best Buy's parts program, expressing regret that the all-in-one solution wasn't going to work for me.  \n\nWhatever they've done here, color me impressed.  Figure out how to hang on to the management staff at this location, Best Buy!
