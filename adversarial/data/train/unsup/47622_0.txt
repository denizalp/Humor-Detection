My first night in Las Vegas (6\/10\/18) and wanted something fast so found this place. I've had Del Taco before in California without issue and figured this would be ok. The food wasn't very good and the guy behind the counter at the register seemed high. I'm unsure what was going on back there but it was clear something was off. The one and only guy behind the counter at the register was staring into oblivion and taking long pauses between sentences. Very weird. I suppose there is a reason people have the jobs they are stuck with. If you are also into witnessing odd behaviors this place is for you and I'm not speaking just about the employees. The area is quite a dump. My advice is to move on. There's other fast food places surrounding this one and again just run away.
