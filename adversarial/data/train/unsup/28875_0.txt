Great place with lots and lots of machines.  Has many rare titles as well.  Free admission.  Just pay quarters in whatever machine you want to play!\n\nCollecting arcade games and pinball machines is a hobby of mine so I was in my bliss.  I was surprised how many were in good working order since it's tough to keep up on all those machines.  Kudos!  Only thing I would do is work a little more on the theme & decorate the place more like an arcade.  Fun time.  I went twice this week.  Good to see people young and old in there!
