I have left a few 4 and 5 star reviews for this Company on multiple social media accounts as well as other sites like Leafly and Yelp. However this last visit has me changing all my positive reviews. \n\n\nEDIT:::Heidi is by far the rudest bud tender I have ever met at any dispensary in the 3 years I've had my card. Nothing but attitude from the beginning with this child. I swear her costume should be the big bad wolf with all the huffing and puffing she was doing. Then she decides to insult me after I asked her to write her name down. Wow natures way to hire a completely unprofessional, rude, insulting bitch. Oh and your \"manager\" Blake was just as rude and disrespectful he didn't offer any apology at all! What kind of manager allows their employees to back talk a customer, have attitude with the customer and insult the customer? Seriously what the hell happened to the original Natures Medicine?? Seems like you guys are scraping from the BOTTOM of the barrel for employees these days.\n\n\nEverybody save the hassle and go to Desert Rose where they actually appreciate their customers and treat them with respect. Not to mention the fact that their bud is superior compared to NM. I literally only come to natures for the kief and somehow they always manage to mess shit up.
