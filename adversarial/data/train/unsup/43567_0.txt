** Review written by a frequent shopper, hoping the right person reads my review & makes the recommended changes. **\nI come here A LOT. I'm a bit of a decor junkie, shop-a-holic with a penchant for bargains so Hobby Lobby scratches right where I itch.\nThe store itself I would easily give 5 stars. However, where this store is lacking, & I've seen a common theme in several reviews is the cashier staff. (Their are several stand outs like the 2 black men (whom I try to find & go through his line to avoid the others), the black woman (nice, kindly), the young girl who went to faith & a few others. I believe the root of the negativity up front lies within the Cashier Manager (long curly brown hair, with no chin), she is just plain mopey, unfriendly, flat. She runs the front like smiles cost money or a friendly conversation is a horrendous proposition.  She needs to be eliminated or moved somewhere where she can work in a bubble away from the customers. Put a friendly enthusiastic Cashier Manager up front who ENCOURAGES CUSTOMER SERVICE; a friendly positive experience & renames the current face of the company. I can tell you from reading a few reviews & my (no exaggeration) 60 experiences going in there, I solely lacking. If the Customer Service issues were addressed, this store\/location would go from a 3.5 to a 5.
