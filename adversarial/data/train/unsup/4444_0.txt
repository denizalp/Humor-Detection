Well I just keep loving LGO! I blame the baked goods that always seem to entice me when I go. Just when I think I'm done placing an order, I look over in the display at the pastries that seem to call out to me and say \"Dani, look at me! Eat me! I'm yummy!\" I'm making my way through their menu and haven't been disappointed yet. Well I'm not counting the time where I found that they stopped serving chilaquiles, I'm meaning taste wise.
