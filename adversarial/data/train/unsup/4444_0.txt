So I will start by saying I'm definitely a yard house fan and have been here too many times to count, however, over the past year I feel like the quality of the food has gone from 5 star to 4 and I'll explain why.\n\nFirst about 6-9 months ago they changed there fries and if you read reviews everyone always loved the small fries and then you could make them truffle and they were bomb.com but now there fries are nothing more than the same thing you would find at your local jack in the box. Next is they have changed the happy hour menu so some of the favorites are no longer on their like noodles and bone in wings and a few other items . These changes kinda hurt my feelings a little lol\n\nNow on to the good! They still have a lot of items on happy hour and just recently they changed it to half off the happy hour menu vs having a tiered pricing which is nice. The portion size of all their food is good and the pricing is fair , also they are a full brewery so you can get your drink on and be happy. Another thing I like is the atmosphere, it's casual with a lot of tv's so you can go catch a game or have a date night or even just grab a snack before you head to the club, This place meets every criteria . My favorites are the carnivore pizza and the sliders, and I like to order a onion ring tower and add the onion rings to my slider so I kinda create my own slider lol.
