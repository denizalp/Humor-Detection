I love Vinny's.  I am from the east coast and think it definitely what I brought up eating.  They're really quick and the pizzas are delicious.  So are the boneless wings.  The pizzas aren't as good if you load them up with stuff...I would recommend just a couple of toppings.  They're the only place I order from now, and I'm really picky.
