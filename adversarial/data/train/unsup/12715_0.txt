The nice thing about the independents is that they opened up a coffee shop because they truly love coffee\n\nThese folks truly do know their beans\n\nI am enjoying a wonderful  Dog House blend. Its a medium roast with organic nicaragua, sierra verde and tanzanian blend\n\nDrip coffee in a no 2 filter. See they know coffee\n\nBlended lattes are a popular item as well as the fresh baked goods\n\nOriginal local art adds to the dog paw theme with a well curated reading library\n\nIts a corner location in the plaza and busy social hub for locals and business folks looking for a coffee and wifi access\n\nRuff ruff with a milk and sugar
