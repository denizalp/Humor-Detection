\"Sorry you got sweet and sour sauce so you can't have any soy sauce.\"\n\nWow.\nWhat kind of place restricts condiments THIS MUCH?\n\nWe've been coming here for 3-4 years and the customer service has always sucked but the last couple visits have just been extra horrible.\nIt's not even just this instance, it's just kind of the last straw because of how ridiculous it is?\n\nIt's honestly disappointing to see that repeat customers will always be treated worse with each occurring visit :)\n\nedit: we have frequented this place much more then my check ins would lead you to believe. \nThere was a period of time that we went every other day. That's honestly why this is so upsetting.\nSupporting a local business is good and all, but not when they run their business like this.\n\nGood job saving that 2cents on the packet of soy sauce (we just wanted one or two lol)\nAnd thanks for giving us the sweet and sour sauce spilled all over the bottom of the bag.\nThat was very mature of you :)
