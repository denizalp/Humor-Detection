Sunday morning in the casino at the Palms is like being in God's waiting room.  Having said that, it seems that the Palms is either a property with a 3-way split personality or it's having an identity crisis. Or both.\n \nI see 3 distinct things going on here:\n \n They clearly market and cater to the older local population, evidenced by crowds toting the most recent giveaway, which happened to be bathrobes. Yes, bathrobes. Now don't get me wrong, BJ and I have had a lot of fun with this group. In our bathrobes.  (JK)\n \nThe Palms is home to the LV N9NE Group of clubs, which although experiencing a little slippage, are still well above 50% on the hot club scale, not to mention N9NE itself, which is seriously popular with the pre-club crowd.  The Fantasy Tower Suites clearly exist for the young, loaded and hot. (Including Yelper Tony B.)\n \nThe third personality?  There is a daycare.  Seriously, a daycare. Which in my opinion begs the question WHO ACTUALLY PUTS THEIR TINIES THERE? It's conveniently located near the middle-America-esque-mall food court.  One could argue that these things exist to tie in with the locals' marketing.  Ok, I can buy that.  It just all seems so damn disjointed and odd.\n \nSo what were YOU doing there on the aforementioned Sunday morning Liz, you might ask?\nWell, here it is....one of the reasons locals are happy there has to do with the kick-ass video poker.  So, here are the reasons I love the Palms:\n \nKick-ass VP.\nGreat music\nHot cocktail waitresses (I may have mentioned that before...)\nEntertaining, usually drunk parade-o-skanks.\nBen and Jerry's - need I say more?
