YELP 100 REVIEW CHALLENGE --- 57\/100\n\nTOPGOLF was really fun! At first, I was a little hesitant because I don't golf, EVER. But one swing and I was hooked, and my competitive side really did come out. There are different types of colored holes (large ones) on the floor and they light up. Each hole gets you certain points. The lady who helped us explained that there were different games you can play, but we chose the simple one. It's a great place for the family or a night out with friends. Definitely, a place to try out whenever you're in Vegas. Service could have been better, but I get that they're busy. \n\nOh and they have games and a great lounge area to hang out in while you wait for your spot to open. It gets really busy so make that reservation!!
