This review is for their Electrical services.\n\nI had a few minor electrical issues that I needed help with, so I called American Home Shield (my home warranty company) and they sent out Ideal Services to handle it.  The technician showed up on time and was very professional.  Here's a summary of what he did for me:\n\n- I switched to flourescent light bulbs throughout my entire home a few years ago.  However, the kitchen lights kept burning out these bulbs too fast and the lights in the kitchen and dining room were making a loud and annoying buzzing sound.  After taking a look at the situation he informed me that both areas used dimmer switches, which apparently don't work well with flourescent light bulbs unless you purchase the bulbs made especially for dimmer switches.  He said I could either purchase new bulbs, which sell for $5-$7 ea vs $.99 for regular flourescent bulbs, or I could change out the switches.  I opted to change the switches, which he did in a few minutes.\n\n- One of my light switches upstairs was busted.  He replaced it.\n\n- Two of my 4 ft flourescent light fixtures weren't working properly.  He informed me that it was a bad balast and it wasn't covered by my home warranty contract.  He told me he could install a new one in each fixture, but I had to purchase the balasts....and it would cost $114 ea.  I asked if it was hard to do on my own and he said \"no\".  He told me what model balast to purchase and gave me a quick rundown of how to do it.  I went to Home Depot and did it myself.....spent $25 on new balasts and saved over $200 for installation.  He could have been a jerk and not told me anything.\n\nOverall, it was a pleasant experience using them.  All of my electrical issues were taken care of and a little money was saved as well.\n\nWill I use them again?  For electrical issues, yes.  Don't have any experience with the other services.
