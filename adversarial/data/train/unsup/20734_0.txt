I am extremely disappointed in my service in this salon! I went in for a normal trim last week and came out with an uneven perimeter, choppy layers. I hate to put someone down publicly but Marco gave me the worst haircut since I was in cosmetology school! \n\nMy last visit was disappointing as well. Mike trimmed my hair and the blowout was awful. It was flat without any volume. I have given this salon 5 stars in the past after having a really great experience. Keep in mind this was 2 years ago. I called today to speak with Mike which is one of the managers and he offered me another haircut for free. Great just what I want. Shorter hair. I feel like crying, yes I know sounds dramatic) but I work in the beauty industry and my appearance is very important.\n\nThe reason people go to places like this is because it's affordable and convenient. As the old saying goes \"you get what you pay for\" I was hesitant after talking to the receptionist, I should have waited until I had the money to go to a reputable hair salon. I'm reading all these positive reviews and I'm in awe. #saveyourmoney #badhairtheydon'tcare
