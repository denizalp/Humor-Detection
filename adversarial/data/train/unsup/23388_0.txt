I never really expected to eat a great meal at a restaurant named after a racial slur. Luckily I had no idea what \"Without Papers\" stood for and thus my expectations were not biased when I dropped by this little pizza place yesterday night.\n\nBut first - let me say that I am seriously impressed by how well the city has revitalized the Inglewood area. It used to be a place I wouldn't ever set foot after dark, but now it's quite, to use a word that makes me feel like a 50 year old woman, \"quaint\". Well done, Calgary.\n\nI climbed the stairs with lady in tow and we were greeted at the top with a man who had a radiant face that shone like a kiebler elf. He quickly got us hooked up with a table and we had no sooner sat down than a waitress stopped by to see if she could get us some drinks.\n\nSo far, so good. They didn't have the Maple Cream Granville that I had my heart set on, but I opted for a Pumphouse Blueberry Ale instead. Drinks are a touch expensive here ($6 for the pumphouse, a shocking $15 for a Rogue Dead Guy Ale) - but they come cold and the selection is eclectic.\n\nMy lady friend and I ordered the Hutch and the Hawaiian 5-0. They came hot, fresh, perfect crusts and a great amount of toppings. Thoroughly enjoyable. The Hawaiian 5-0 was a favorite with roast pineapples, jalapenos, ham and cheese. \n\nIt's a bit like me - sort of sweet, but with a spicy edge. I like a pizza I can relate to.\n\nAs we both repeated our \"bite-chew-sweat-dab\" eating routine, I immediately was reminded of competitor Famosa. On the whole, I've got to say that I like Without Papers just a little bit more - but I've had strong experiences at both.\n\nWhile we were there they played old Christmas specials, The Life Aquatic and the beginning of the hockey game on their wall projectors. I appreciated the variety - catering simultaneously to hipsters, sports fans and seniors. \n\nMy experience here was A+ and I'd definitely recommend it if you're looking for a new place to try.
