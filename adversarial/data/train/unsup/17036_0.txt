Very attractive, casual and comfortable setting.... part of the newly renovated Palace Station.\nI found the atmosphere, and staff to be welcoming, and their service was top notch.\n\nWe really enjoyed the Beef Chow Fun.\nThe sushi was excellent (I can particularly recommend the Dragon Roll).\nWe will definately be returning to try more selections.\n\nGive the Boathouse a try. Its a \"hat trick\" of good food, good service and good atmosphere. \nI found all their great reviews are accurate and well earned.
