One of my best friends likes watching the UFC fights. We decided to grab a bite to eat at Back Stage Bar before going next door to watch the violence. The menu was pretty small. The prices and value made up for it. The salads are around $6 or $7. I had the buffalo chicken salad which tasted the same as all other salads of the same name. My friend had a 8 oz. filet for $12. It came with potatoes and steamed vegetables. He said it was good, and for $12, it seemed to be a great deal. The music was very loud and made it hard to have a conversation. We really wanted to talk about the past, present and future and where our place in the world is. It could not happen with the music blaring. The music was not good either. The bartender said it was kind of quiet too. He was pissed when my friend said the music is loud. I feel that if you review any of the bars in the Kamm's corner neighborhood, you have reviewed them all. I don't like hanging around this group of people because nobody says excuse me when they walk by and generally think they are like Steven Seagal and above the law. If the visit was not at 10 pm on a Saturday, I may have enjoyed it more.
