Even though I have shoes older than James, he is an old time professional - all about service and quality of work.  I had a gas line relocated under my grill so I could get to the shut-off easier.  He moved it so I don't have to get down on my knees to shut off the gas, which I prefer to do.  He also drilled out and replaced some backflow preventers that had lived their lives and now made mine miserable with a howling noise whenever I used those hose bibs.  Good work James.  You will have repeat work here!
