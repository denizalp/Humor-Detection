I went to SU&BU's downtown location once before and really enjoyed it so I was quite disappointed when this Mississauga location failed to provide the same experience. \n\nI had remembered I really liked SU&BU's original\/signature poke bowl. It was the perfect balance of all the components of a good poke bowl. You had the sweet, the savory, the crispy, and the umami. I really wasn't sure why it wasn't on the menu here at Square One. Taking a look at the menu online at SU&BU what we had ordered here isn't on the menu on their website. There seems to be a more limited selection here at Square One.\n\nThe bowl I had ordered was excessively sweet which I didn't expect. There was a lot of sweet components in the mango, the sweet thai chili sauce, the ginger, and the seaweed salad but it was just too much and there was no harmonious balance. Portions seemed even more small than I had remembered as well, and one piece of kale had taken up nearly a quarter of the bowl. \n\nOverall I was quite disappointed and there's definitely better poke bowl options in Missisauga.
