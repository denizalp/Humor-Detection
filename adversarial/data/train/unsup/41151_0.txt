Wasn't bad but like JK said the size for a large is quite small. If I haven't had a small meal before   I wouldn't  have been full at all. \n\nI got the one with the chopped sashimi given that it's easier to eat and you get more flavours per bite. The protein to rice ratio was good but again the overall portion was a little chintzy for the price. It was delicious but I was expecting more \"premium cuts\" considering that they're connected to Tachi... no o-toro for me LOL. Overall it was good but not worth it though. \n\nI could've spent the $25 odd so dollars at any generic Japanese restaurant downtown and gotten if not the same better quality+quantity. \n\n3\/5 but probably not going to come back.
