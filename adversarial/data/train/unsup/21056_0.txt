What makes a hotel great for me when staying in Las Vegas is not wanting to leave the hotel to hang out at other places. The MGM Grand fits into that category for me. We hardly left the hotel during our stay, and I regretted it when we did. There is so much to do, see, and eat here that I was not all that inclined to leave. The highlight of the MGM is the pool area (my pool review: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/the-pool-at-mgm-las-vegas#hrid:e3wToUSl1KBb3iVrgJCMcQ). I also liked the buffet and most of the various other food options. \n\nMy gripes about the MGM is that the iron in the room sucked, and the self-parking lot is a bit difficult to get to. However they do offer free valet parking. I also did not like eating at Craftsteak, which is their upscale steakhouse (my Craftsteak review: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/craftsteak-las-vegas#hrid:UpAxMxpkXW5_sIXlT7yhTw). Besides a few minor details, I have had the best experiences at the MGM compared to the other hotels I have been to on the strip. \n\nThe next time that I am looking for a place to stay in Las Vegas, the first place I will look into is the MGM Grand.
