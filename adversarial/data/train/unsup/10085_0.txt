So what if they don't include the e and a in the name.  You get the point right away when you comb over the menu of delicious cuts of beef.\n\nMy friend and I split a 10 oz filet ($48) and a 24 oz porterhouse ($65).  The porterhouse was an immense cut of beef, even after splitting it up, but the ten ouncer was the star of the show.  Not gonna lie when I'm saying it was one of the best steaks I've had.  The medium rare filet was nice and bloody, but not overly rare in the middle of the cut.  It was really THAT good.  Each bite was, well, pretty damn amazing.\n\nFor a high-end steakhouse, the price to quality ratio was pretty reasonable and hands down one the best cuts of cow I've ingested to date.   \n \nTop notch service.  Top notch cuts.  Top notch steakhouse!
