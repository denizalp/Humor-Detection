When you walk in, the horrid green colour hits you like a wet tea towel across the face, and you end up trying to dodge the horrid colour and it just keeps coming back, and coming back. I find it a disturbing, retina detaching, skin crawling colour. \n\nThe selection - oh yeah - it can be there - depending on what you are looking for. The meat section - holy molly - is huge. I did the test of all tests and looked at their deli. Fail - only commercial prosciutto. \n\nThey did have my favourite olive oil, but it was a few bucks more expensive than at a Loblaws chain. \n\nOverall - this place is huge (very much like an old Knob Hills Farm) and does have some vast selection, but with the uncomfortable decor and high prices, I will not be returning.
