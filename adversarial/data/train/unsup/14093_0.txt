The food here is fairly good, but definitely not worth the wait. There's only 1 guy working so you can't even place your order until he's finished cooking all the orders in front of you. I waited 20 minutes JUST TO PLACE MY ORDER. There was 1 person in front of me. Usually my husband picks up from here and I can honestly say I'm never coming here again. You can't place a phone order and the first time I came here, he was closed even though the hours said he should be open. How do you run a business like that?\n\nOh and make sure you bring cash because they don't accept credit, debit or checks.\n\nI give the food 3.5 stars but the service and extreme inconvenience 0 stars (hence the 2 star rating). Never. Again.
