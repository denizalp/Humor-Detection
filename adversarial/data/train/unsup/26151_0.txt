When the service man rang my doorbell. I answered and he was on the phone. He never got off the phone. He stopped his call only to ask me for a ladder and a towel for the work being done. First off, GET OFF THE PHONE. Second BRING YOUR OWN TOOLS AND SUPPLIES. This guy had no social or customer service skills. When I asked him how long the repair usually takes he gave me a rude answer saying \"he's finished when the microwave is working again\". Finally when he finished I went to thank him as he was leaving and he just kept walking and didn't say a word. Stay away from these guys. They have no standards.
