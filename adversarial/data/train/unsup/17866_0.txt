I'm a Yogurtland fan but this location just seems to be slipping in quality. We've been here a handful of times since it's so close to our house. The yogurt itself is great, I love trying the new flavors and I like the fact that they venture out with unusual flavors and toppings. Most of the time, I'm faced with the \"I can't decide what flavor I want\" dilemma and end up having way too much stuff in my cup that I never finish. On the plus side of that, the prices are excellent for what you get and we almost never spend over $10 for the 3 of us. \n\nMy problem with this location is the management, or lack thereof really. This location gets craaaazy busy and many times you're stuck waiting in line. That doesn't bother me much as getting through that line only to find out there's stuff out at the topping bar. Stuff that the employees apparently have no interest in refilling. We were in just the other night and the whipped cream was out. Which, if you haven't tried that, I highly suggest you do... it's really good. So, I looked the girl straight in the face THREE times and said there's no whipped cream and she looked at me like I was stupid. She made no effort to get more or even tell someone else that it was out. \n\nI have to assume the lazy employees and the apparent lack of management is why the store always seems to be dirty too. There's usually melted yogurt all over the tables, chairs and trash cans. Not to mention the yogurt machines themselves being dirty and the topping bar looking like a sweets tornado just rolled through. How they manage that with 3 employees standing behind that counter blows my mind. The product and price deserves an easy 4 stars but the service and cleanliness is 1 star and generally why we go visit other businesses to satisfy our sweet tooth!
