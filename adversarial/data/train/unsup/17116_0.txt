We have been patients, er, clients, of All Creatures Animal Clinic for years. Not consecutively. They compassionately helped us with our aging Australian Shepard mix years ago. More recently they have been helping us with Teddy Wagadoodle, our young Labradoodle. There was also a Guinea Pig who needed some special care. Not even sure what else. \"All Creatures\" means all creatures! \n\nPricing at All Creatures is very reasonable, especially in comparison to the misguided year we just spent at Banfield. I'm not sure what we were thinking. Well, I do know. We fell victim to a special offer. So happy to be back at All Creatures. The staff is uniformly friendly, thoughtful and calming. The level of veterinary care is exceptional. Nothing more need be said.\n\nAn added bonus. All Creatures is right next door to a good dog groomer and a great breakfast spot, the 40th Street Café. Only one problem, the café does not allow dogs. Fortunately, the groomer and All Creatures do.
