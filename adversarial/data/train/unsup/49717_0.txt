All kinds of yes! This place had everything I wanted and more. I am so glad I stopped in for a quick sandwich. \n\nThey have bread, oils, gravy, spices, premade meats, and a wide array of pastas and salads. \n\nEveryone in there was so friendly. The cashier lady literally made my day because she reminded me of my aunts. \n\nThis place has quickly become one of my favorites in the area. They get this Italian girl's approval.
