There are some things in life that are hard to mess up. Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, pasta and meatballs, buttered toast; the list goes on. Then there are things that seem easy but actually take a lot more effort; casseroles, a good beer, pizza, and though you might not expect it, bagels. \n\nWe've all had bad bagels. You don't know exactly what makes it bad, you just know it sucks. Maybe the skin is too chewy, or the toppings are more or less nonexistent. Or maybe it's as hard as a rock because it's a week old. Whatever it is, it's bad. Then, on rare occasion you stumble across the perfect bagel. Just like the bad bagel, you can't quite put your finger on what makes this bagel different, but everything just feels right. The topping to dough ratio is spot on, the skin is chewy but not overwhelming. The coloration is just the right amount of golden brown without being burned or raw. It's perfect.
