This is an ideal place on the strip when you are craving some legit Chinese noodle soup either for drunk munchies (since they are open late), or for a hangover cure.  By legit, I mean all the staff tha works here are Chinese, including the cooks.  \n\nI had the beef noodle stew, which came with preserved cabbage and large chunks of beef, some dense feeling hand tossed noodles, and a really really good broth base.  Perfect for hangovers.  My girl had the preserved egg and pork porridge.  It tasted almost as legit as my mom's.  We shared the bok choy with oyster sauce, which was perfectly boiled.  \n\nThe only thing is that this place is pretty expensive.  Our bill was almost fifty dollars, for what would cost only fifteen to twenty in Chinatown somewhere.  But, keep in mind you are eating in the Venetian.  \n\nPROTIP:  Large portions, so share!
