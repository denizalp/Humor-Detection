Don't let the name or location fool you, this place is legit, an absolute must! Very good Dim Sum better than anything I've had in LA and almost as good as stuff from the bay area for like 1\/2 the price! Only downside was the line to get in and they sold out of jian dui before we could get any! Definitely a great lunch spot I'll be back!
