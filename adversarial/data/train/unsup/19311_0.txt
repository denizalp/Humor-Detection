Since being featured on Anthony Bourdain's \"No Reservations\"...\n\nThe Fremont Street area has drastically changed since me and my husband's first visit. At that time it was super cool, still under construction, had the zipline which we rode (but nothing compared to the now SlotZilla setup), covered light shows, live music, street performers, cheap buffets, and great odd casinos. It was a true feel of old Vegas and we both decided the next time we visited LV we would stay at the Golden Nugget and take a cab to The Strip if we wanted to see a show or something (didn't happen). \n\nAnyway, Fremont is still all that...and more...getting borderline Disney now. :(  Packed on a week night at midnight...I guess people finally got word. Changes: At least three new casinos; another remodel to the Nugget - this one so vast the interior was almost unrecognizable; more chotsky-type tourist shops; tons more people; a few bucks extra for a beer on the street; and a lot more security.\n\nI am hesitant to say anything really great about it because I don't want it to continue to grow to the point where it's no longer \"cool.\" So, the Fremont Street Experience sucks. So NOT worth the $25 cab ride. Just better off staying on The Strip. More to do and much more fun. Really, trust me...I always tell the truth. [OMgosh, is my nose actually growing?!] Damn it Tony!
