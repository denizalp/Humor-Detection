A few weeks ago I bought a pair of pants and needed to have them altered so I had brought them to Susanna since she had done a great job with a pair jeans I brought in before. I asked her if I could have it ready by the next afternoon and she told me that it would ready. The next day I went to go pick them up, but the doors were locked. I called her to see if my pants were ready and she told me that she was on her way to the airport to head out of town for a few days. Now Most people would have apologized and told me there is nothing they could do, but Susanna came all the way back to her shop on eastern in the middle of Friday 5pm rush hour traffic just to give me my pants. The price of my altered pants was $15 and her ticket probably cost her a few hundred, but she was willing to potentially miss her flight to take care of her customers. I don't write reviews often, but Susanna really went above and beyond for me and she would do the same for any of her customers. So if you need something altered Susanna will definitely take care of you. She gets a 10\/5 star rating from me!
