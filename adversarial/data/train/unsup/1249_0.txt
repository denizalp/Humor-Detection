When I first saw this place I was assumed it was one of those \"massage\" places that you see all over Vegas. However, I looked at the ratings on yelp and figured that if shady stuff was going on, people wouldn't be writing reviews on yelp lol.\n\nI got off work the other night and my feet were absolutely killing me, so I was desperate. I walked in and told the man working at the front desk that I needed a foot massage. He motioned for me to follow him and led me into a small room. The room had two lounge chairs and was extremely dark. I sat there for about 5 or 10 minutes, not knowing what to do. Finally a woman brought a a bowl of hot water for my feet. Next, a man came in and started to massage my shoulders. I told him I came in for a foot massage...he looked confused. He asked \"How long? 60 minutes?\" I told him I just wanted to do the 30 minute foot massage for $18. He continued to massage my shoulders. So...communication was obviously an issue! After a lot of unpleasant massaging and awkward stretches, he ,moved on to my feet.\n\nThe actual foot massage was pretty good until the man started smacking my legs. Then he tried to pull on my legs, but I told him to stop....twice!! I have back issues and can't have some random person doing things that could affect my back.\n\nOverall, I wasn't happy. Not enough time was spent on my feet and that's the only reason I went there. Not to mention, my back was feeling fine before I went in but I had to get a real massage the next day because this guy didn't know what he was doing!! \n\nOne thing I find shocking is the fact that no one ever had me fill out any paperwork or sign a waiver like all legit massage places do! They are not chiropractors so they shouldn't crack people's backs and I'm not even sure they are licensed massage therapists. Don't waste your time or money!
