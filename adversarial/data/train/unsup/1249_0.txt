I've been here a few times since my last review, and though I'm still pro Saint, I think there's been a minor taint. \n\nThe prices here are fairly high, excluding their oyster deals, thus the servers must make decent coin. So, like, why so sour? I'm not one to bitch about service on the regular. I'm talking about *four* visits where I was made to feel like I was an inconvenience for coming in to eat, drink, be merry and spend my hard-earned twoonies. . \n\nSteak, bubbly and Malbecs remain divine. Giant booths still pop my top.
