It's always a roll of the dice when you try to find a new mechanic, much less after hours in a city that you don't live in. I did well though when Yelp directed me to Knight Performance.  They quickly diagnosed my car's problem, fixed it without delay as quick as a NASCAR pit crew, and recommended some great local places for follow up and new gear. I'm tempted to find an excuse to get back to Vegas just to have my car go through their complimentary 50-point inspection! Great experience - very highly recommended.
