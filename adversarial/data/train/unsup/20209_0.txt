The Cleveland Museum of Art FTW!\n\nSorry, I just learned that phrase, so I'm using it wherever possible.\n\nAnyhow, this is the perfect place to take a date in order to show them that you are an intelligent, erudite and probably romantic person, instead of the person you actually are, who eats at Taco Bell and secretly watches those slutty-ass reality shows on VH1. \n\nAlso, they have one of Napoleon's guns here. That's pretty bad-ass. (Oh, they also have a bunch of art.)
