Alistair is a pig, and I love him! \nMy first visit to this store was on a special day...it was Alistairs birthday. He was upfront in the store with a wee party hat on..( have to say though I dont like when people dress up animals, but this didnt seem like too big a deal for Alistair) and they were giving away crave cupcakes. There were streamers, Alistair was snuffling away and cheerfully receiving pats from his admirers. So THAT was my introduction to this little place. \n\nLIke most mom and pop pet food stores you will find that the prices are higher than at somewhere like Petsmart etc. It is understandable as they dont have the volume of sales.  The products they do have though are excellent, wonderful products for your beloved pets.  It is clear that the owners of this store love animals and want nothing but the best for thier customers pets. \nI will admit that I tend to go to Petsmart, but do like to pop in here to pick up a few special treats for my kitties and see Alistair. It is so cool to have a pig in my neighborhood and to go to a piggy birthday party is something that I have for the memory books.. Long live Alistair, mom and pop businesses and all those who love animals.  oink oink.. ( that was Alistair)
