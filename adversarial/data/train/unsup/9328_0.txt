Pubic hair jn your sheets and pillows!! Thats how you know you should never stay here. urine stains? Dont they clean? Well every 4 days but who knows how well they clean. We ended cleaning the dirtyness ourselves we were too tired to carry luggage and groceries to another place. Management didnt offer to upgrade or refund anything and just offered to come and clean after we have done it ourselves. The worst part was the continued calling from salesmen to book timeshare tour. They say theres no pressure but they get mad in your face when you say no. Theres no non smoking rooms they are all non smoking. Theres signs that say smoking allowed in the patio but of course people wont reapect that so expect the smoke smell to linger your room. \n\nThe pool is nice and pretty fun for kids and adults. But the condition of the room ruined the hotel stay. We never felt comfortable laying in bed or using the restroom. Patio is covered in bird poop kind of gross. \n\nAnd finally!!! The TV's. You get a 20 inch or so in the living room and 18 inch tube old tv(dont give me the its retro because this resort is not trying to go for that look its just cheap and antiquated) so there you go its up to you to decide if you wabt to stay but trust the reviews, this resort doesnt really care about quality. Otherwise there would be upgrades.
