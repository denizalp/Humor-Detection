Fusion Sushi locations seem to have cropped up all over the place. They are definitely doing well as think they have 6-ish locations now in Calgary.\n\nThis one is very similar to the ipad ordering -all-you-can-eat sushi place on Macleod Trail. Except they don't have the same deep fired cheese wontons - the other place has better ones.\n\nBut outside of that. Great options. Enough variety to choose from. Hot food as well as sushi. And the price is right.\n\nNot too much else to say really.
