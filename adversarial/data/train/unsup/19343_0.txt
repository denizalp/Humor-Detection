I ordered delivery and was given an ETA of 45 to an hour. The delivery driver finally showed up nearly 2 hours later with cold food. We ordered a Gyro platter with fries and some hummus. Hummus was spilled all over the bag. The gyro was slimy and cold due to the time spent in the drivers car I'm assuming. There's a lot of great middle eastern in Tempe. Don't waste your money at Flaming Kabob.
