From start to finish a great experience here. Each person I interacted with was very friendly and patient. I get a little anxiety going to the dentist but everyone put me at ease. I especially like how the hygienist explained what she was going to do before she did it. No wait time at all from when I had the appointment to x rays to the dentist everyone came in promptly. Very clean and nice office. Would recommend to anybody looking for a new dentist!
