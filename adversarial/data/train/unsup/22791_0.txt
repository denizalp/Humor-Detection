I came to this rainforest cafe with 12 people in total. We made reservations the day before and called the day of the dinner just to re confirm. This is a new location. The old location was inside of the MGM. Now I guess I can say I have been to both. \n\nHere's the deal. I have been to the old rainforest cafe in Vegas and the locations in Atlantic city,FL and NYC. There all pretty solid. I recommend bringing kids here. The ambiance is truly what you are paying for. The kids will love it. We had no children with our group. Just big children lol. \n\nThe staff was very nice and accommodating. The service did take a bit. But there was a miss hap on our part with the ordering and a few people drank too much at the pool. So there was some confusing moments. Luckily there was a fish tank and one of my friends spent 15 mins starring at the fish. Kinda saved the evening. \n\nThe food is just like chain style food. Chicken dishes burgers. The appetizers are where it is at in my opinion. I just ordered a chicken quesadilla. It was good. The drinks are funky and different a lot of tropical themed drinks. Hence the name lol. I do think the food is good but pricy for what you receive. \n\nThe mistake we made was ordering a lot of drinks here. The drinks were expensive. Between the 12 of us. Food and drinks. It was just over $100 a person. It's not bad. But for $100 a person I would have rather done a pre fix dinner at a staleskhouse or a higher end eatery. And have drinks there. But your really paying for the experience and atmosphere here. \n\nOverall. This rainforest cafe is nice no complaints really. The food is always consistent. The drinks are a bit pricy. But the new location has a nice view of the strip. I prob will be back
