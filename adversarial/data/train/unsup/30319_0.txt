I ordered a pizza (angry chicken pizza) from this place yesterday. It was so delicious I went back for the lunch special (8\" pizza, huge salad, and a soda for $7.99) today!! This is mine and my son's new favorite place. Until we find something better, which I doubt, this is our pizza place. They're going to get tired of seeing my face LOL!!
