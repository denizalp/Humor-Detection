A Phoestivus for the rest of us! Well, it looks like I am on a Seinfeld theme tonight, which is ok by me. And if you have a problem with that, I suggest you write it down and air your grievances at the Phoestivus next year. :-P\n\nThis was a super event. I really wasn't sure if it would be awesome or a total dud. You know how you go to a farmer's market only to find a disappointing 3 stands? This isn't that. There were a ton of vendors, and unique ones like crunchy flavored oatmeal and granolas, cool and interesting graphic tees, homemade peanut butters, lots of baked goods and jewelry, what must have been 10-20 food trucks. There were at least 6-10 rows of packed vendors (10-20 in each row), so there really were items of interest for anyone you might have with you. \n\nPLUS, the airing of grievances, the most befitting lackluster Phoestivus pole (touted as North America's largest) you could imagine, and a feats of strength area where you can challenge your opponent. It's just a lot of silly Seinfeldian fun that would still leave Frank Costanza bitching, but you would just roll your eyes and enjoy your shopping. \n\nMy bonus was meeting very friendly CM Lindsay at the Yelp table, where, you guessed it- I picked up more Yelpsticks. Schwing for swag! So fun. Just go and plan on staying longer than we did cuz there is a lot to look at if you like to shop, and oh yeah- SHOP LOCAL! ;)
