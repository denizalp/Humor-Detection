Amazing church with wonderful welcoming leadership and beautiful music.\n\nThe pastor of St. Bernadette parish, when I told him I liked going to Mass here, told me to go there an not come back to St. Bernadette. Then the deacon who runs St. Bernadette told me to go away and to start going to therapy. \n\nUnlike St. Bernadette, St. Patrick is a welcoming parish that seeks to bring people to God.
