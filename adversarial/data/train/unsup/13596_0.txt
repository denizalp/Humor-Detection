What the fuck?  Did you say this place is All-You-Can-Eat?  Whenever I go to an All-You-Can-Eat place, I always try to get my money's worth.  This time...big mistake.\n\nWhat? Chicken? Get in my bowl biatch!  \nBeef? Get in my bowl biatch!\nOnions?  Do it now!\nCilantro, green onions, cabbage, broccoli, mushrooms, pineapple, zucchini?...all right I'll try some healthy shit.  \nAll these saaauwces!!!  Cause tonight, I'm the saauwce boss!  \nWhatchyou know about stir fry?\n\n4 plates later, I was in the most wicked food coma I've ever experienced.\nAdvice...go easy on the sauce.
