This place always hits the spot for my jajangmyeon cravings! Actually, I don't think I even had those cravings till I tried out this place. I looove the consistency of the noodles, the perfect amount of chewiness and I love how long they are too! The sauce itself is so good too, I love all the onions and just overall how flavourful the sauce tastes - the noodles also grab onto the sauce real well. \n\nEvery time I go, I see people ordering this fried meat looking dish so I decided to get one of them myself this time. They have a variety of these fried meats and I got myself a sweet and sour chicken. The first few bites were really good and crispy but as the night went on, it got a bit soggy in the sauce so I'd recommend getting sauce on the side if you like a bit of crunch with your meats. \n\nThis place is real Korean though. When we looked around, we noticed we were the only non-Koreans at the whole restaurant that day. You know you've found a gem when that happens :).  I knocked off a star because it was so Korean that all the servers only spoke Korean and seemed to favour Korean customers. We waited over 10 minutes when we went up to the front to pay. The cashier took customers that were behind us first because they were able to communicate better. Regardless though, the food hits the spot and I'll be coming back!
