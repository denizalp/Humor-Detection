We came here for a couples massage and we were both extremely happy with how it turned out.  We were staying on the Strip and try to make massages a part of our travel routine.  \n\nI found this place on Yelp of course, called, set up the appointment, and set up the shuttle.  The communication over the phone was great.  The shuttle was on time and the driver was nice.  A free shuttle from the strip?  Yes please.  \n\nWe arrive, fill out our intake forms and are led to the waiting lounge with chairs and water\/ tea, fruit, etc.  This was nice as we hadn't grabbed lunch yet.  \n\nWe both got Swedish massages with the aromatherapy.   We met with our therapists and had consultations on level of pressure\/ problem areas, and we were both happy with the therapists amount of pressure and communication.  The chocolate aromatherapy was fantastic and relaxing.  Our therapists met us with water after the service.\n\nThe only thing I wasn't really used to was not being able to take a shower before or after.  The shuttle took us right back to the hotel after though. \n\nRecommended for a couples massage.  It was $175 for the 50 min massage.  Outstanding value and service.  \n\nWhen we left, we were encouraged to give honest feedback on whatever social media we used.  This is the only one I use and I was very satisfied.
