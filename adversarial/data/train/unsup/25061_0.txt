I have been here several times and absolutely love it! The Greek Lemon Chicken soup is absolutely incredible! This is the first time I tried the Grilled fruit salad. Very good. I think the seasonal Kale Caesar salad is probably the best salad I've ever had though.There is a huge menu to choose from. Would give it 5 stars but they seem to always struggle with having enough help but will definitely continue to eat there!
