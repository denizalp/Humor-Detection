Disappointing and not worth the price.  We're Top Chef fans, were in Vegas for the weekend and figured that we'd give RM a go.  The fish was cooked properly, but I found the dishes to be unbalanced, under seasoned, and unimaginative.  My husband even found a bone in his fish which is unacceptable - especially at this price point.  For almost $100\/pp I expect much more - maybe I'm just another spoiled San Franciscan.  The palate challenge sorbet tasting at the end was the best part.
