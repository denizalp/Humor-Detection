Sorry Rua Vang\/Golden Turtle Mississauga, you've been unseated. This place is literally in the middle of buttf**k nowhere. Broken rice with lemongrass pork here is more than acceptable. Spring rolls equally so. The pho broth here has a more obvious body and is more flavourful than any other I've had in Mississauga (mind you this is purely from one day\/visit). They've stated they are MSG free. The ice cold preserved lemonade was also quite good and was a perfect accompaniment and finish to the meal. Left Pho Ngoc Yen completely sated of my pho craving. Tentative 5 star, will be back to try the other dishes at some point, if I can drag my girlfriend to this inconvenient location.
