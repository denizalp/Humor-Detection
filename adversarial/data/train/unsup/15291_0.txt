The food and drinks were delicious and the atmosphere is fun, but our server Katherine was truly awful. She was slow and unhelpful. It took 15-20 minutes to get cocktails delivered on more than one occasion, our water container frequently ran dry, and she was nowhere to be found when we were ready to order entree's or another round of drinks. She complained to us that she was super hungover from some team building exercise the company held at a club the night before (How unprofessional? I shouldn't have to lower my expectations of the service because you drank too much?). She messed up and forgot orders, and didn't explain anything to those of us who were there for the first time, ie. what's on happy hour, build your own guacamole vs house guacamole, etc. The worst part is that she put everything under one tab (without asking) for a table of eight. And then made us personally separate out the tab because she had no clue who ordered what. We had to tally up who had what, and it was so awkward trying to figure out payment amongst ourselves. It's the servers and not the guest's responsibility to know who ordered what!! It ended up taking over a half an hour to tab out. I would like to highlight that the hostess was friendly, and so were a few other staff members who filled our water for us while our server was absent for prolonged periods of time.
