3\/19\/2016\nYou get a 3 year warranty from Desert Springs. And as always, the warranty is only as good as the people behind it.  We had an issue where some of the spa water would slowly leak overnight back into the pool. It took some time to figure it out but they kept sending people, tried various approaches and kept us informed.  It ended up being a check valve that was for our in pool cleaning system. My wife and I are very happy we went with Desert Springs.  Are they the cheapest...no.  But, they honored their warranty, kept us informed and stayed behind their work.....after the work was done and was paid. Thank you Desert Springs Pool and Spa.
