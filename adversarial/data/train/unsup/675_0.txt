I really wanted to like this place. But unfortunately I couldn't. After this experience I don't plan on ever coming back and do not recommend others to eating here.\n\nThe wait wasn't too bad for being Saturday. So we were seated fairly fast. Our waitress was ok nothing spectacular and after how everything ended she was mediocre. \n\nSo I will make my complaint and horrible experience simple.\nI ordered the salmon and eggs (grilled)\n\n*While waiting I prepared my coffee- and the cup had lip stick marks- mind you I'm not wearing any lipstick!  G R O S S!!!******\n\n*Now when the waitress comes with my dish she drops off a 'blackened' Salmon, I have to literally call her back to ask if my salmon was grilled or just burned.\n\n*She looks at the ticket and says oh I did put in 'grilled' not sure why they gave you blackened \n\n-Then an older lady appears at our table and asks me if I want to eat the rest of my side dishes while I wait, I responded  \"no, I will wait\"- (at this point i am pissed because she plans on serving me cold food)-\n\n******Now here's the best part, I finally get my order and the salmon is served grilled-----but it's RAW!\n\nOh man, at this point I can't take it! I call back the waitress and tell her the food is RAW and at this point I lost my appetite- I would like to cancel my order, I am no longer hungry. She quickly grabs my plate before I could capture the lovely experience! \n\nA good 10mins pass and no manager comes by to check on us or ask me the generic question-what can I do to make your experience better?\n\nThey literally do not give a SH*T\n\nSo when the waitress comes back to the table I get no acknowledgement. NO ounce of remorse or any apologies, call me old school but I expect more from a hospitality establishment.  \n\n-So I ask her do you guys actually care about customers you gave me a dirty coffee mug, wrong food, and raw food. Where is your manager at? \nUsually they come talk to the table! She looked at me as if I was schooling her on something new.\n\nAt this point she Finally goes and tells the manager to come to our table or remind her!!!! \n\nSo here's the THE BEST PART, she sends over one of her minions to act as the manager (what manager is dressed with an apron and sous chef gloves on) She didn't want to OWN the mistakes sends over an employee acting as the manger! WTF!!!\n\nThis guy clearly doesn't know the first thing about handling customer situations, all he does is say sorry, and pretends to show any interest- \nHe literally says- we tried to bring your food out as fast as we could!  Oh man! I couldn't help but complain about the lack of and the experience, that it did no good or justice to my situation.\n\nI clearly will not be back, or will I recommend this restaurant to anyone else. Maybe I am over reacting but, I am HANGRY. I haven't eaten breakfast or lunch and I am running on air!  But I don't plan on coming back- the last straw, was when the manager didn't want to come to my table to apologies for my horrible experience, she sends over someone pretending to be one.
