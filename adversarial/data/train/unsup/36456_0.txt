I liked it! I was passing by after picking up some supplies at Home Depot about 2:00 pm. The place had about 10 patrons so I knew I wouldn't have to wait. \nWalked right up to the counter where I was greeted politely. \nNow, I'm not much on building my own burger, I usually go for the specialty burgers in a burger joint so I chose the burger that comes with an egg on top, I believe it's called \"sunny side up\"...over easy is the way I had it cooked, meat: medium.\nI also ordered fries and drank water......9 bucks or so.\nSat outside as it was a nice day.\nDidn't wait too long maybe 10 mins and there it was, hot, cooked perfectly, delicious. Fries were hot and delish as well.\nSomeone in a previous review said 5 guys had better meat......I beg to differ. \nUnlike five guys this sandwich was much easier to eat, even with an over easy egg on it.\nI do feel they could give you a larger portion of fries for the money, this is why the four stars. \nI hope they make it there.....Wolfgang didn't.
