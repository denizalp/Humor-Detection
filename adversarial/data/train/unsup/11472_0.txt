Kafein, why do you hate vegans so much? There's like nothing on the menu I can eat since you changed it. And before, there was like, one item. What the heck happened to the vegie paté sandwich? Sandwiches on chewy white bread? White mayonaise pesto and cilantro and sautéd mushrooms? That's what I make at my house when I'm lazy... Puh-leaze... Accompanied with chips? Again: puh-leaze...  How about a thick vegetable stew once in awhile (curry mushroom-kale or potatoe-bean or lentil-carrot) or some vegan cookies... I gave my vegan baker friend your business card and she got excited and went by and spoke to you then called and you never called her back.\n\nAnd I wish you'd turn it around, Kafein, cause truth be told, you're not a bad place. Your downstairs is comfortable and you've got a well-stoked bar and I like your bathrooms though the urinals are set way too high, and I'm like what, 5'11''? You've got good djs and you don't come down hard on the nice homeless fella who hangs around outside though so many other establishments would - and that's kind of ya.\n\nBut come on... vegan it up for the rest of us, will ya?
