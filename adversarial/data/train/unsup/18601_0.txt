Great location in Vegas! Off the strip (behind Flamingo.\/Quad\/Linq) so you have some peace & quiet but close enough that you can walk to the strip, take a complimentary shuttle from the property to various strip and downtown locations, and a taxi doesn't cost too much. And you have a great view of the new High Roller wheel!\n\nGreat property in Vegas! Rooms are nicely decorated and have everything you need to have some 'normal' time in Vegas (kitchen with everything you need to make meals, free Wifi, HD tvs with HBO, fireplace, washer\/dryer, etc.). I need some down time after being over-stimulated in the casinos\/strip - the rooms\/property are great for relaxing and getting ready for your next round. The property is nice too - 5 pools, BBQ grills, 2 workout rooms, small restaurant, and small convenience store. \n\nThe staff I interacted with were super friendly and helpful. \n\nNot really a place for college kids wanting to party (although there were a few). Older age demographic (35-80) which I like because I don't want to wake up to staff hosing barf off the concrete ;)
