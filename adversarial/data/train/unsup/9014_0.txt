Same Song and Dance\n\n\n   There really isn't much more to say about Prohibition that hasn't already been said(especially by Clare;). Fresh ingredients, prepared properly, with a little bit of their own spin, served promptly and courteously. All the makings of a good restaurant.\n  \n   Griffintown used to be my go-to for breakfast, prior to the ownership change. Prohibition now tops that list, despite the fact that they have no alcohol.\n\n  That is a big deal, people.\n\nWaka Waka
