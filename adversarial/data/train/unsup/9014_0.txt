We came here because we were at the Southpoint anyway, and my sister thought it would be a good change of pace from our usual Mexican\/Italian\/Steakhouse rotation.\n\nI was in agreement because I saw the large menu over the bar proclaiming various offerings like oyster po'boys and jamabalya for $7.95.  Good deal, right?\n\nWrong. This was for weekday lunch only. some of the things are not even available for dinner, and if  they were, the price was about triple.\n\nWe both ordered the fish and chips. ($23) Her bf got the shrimp and scallop combo.\n($21). Ahem. In what universe are shellfish cheaper? I was assuming it would be a monstrous portion of gigantic fillets at that price point. You know what happens when we assume. \n\nThere were four small chunks of battered fish atop  a pile of fries.  They were all crisp and hot, and the fish was nice and white, but come ON! \n\nI have no idea what kind of fish it was, but for that price tag, it damned better have been cut from a mermaid's tail.  And there was no accompaniment like salad or cole slaw either. Only spotting of anything green was pickle specks in the tartar sauce.\n\nCould they be charging for the ambience? Well, considering the fact that it's cafe style seating in an open area of the incredibly loud, bustling casino, I'm guessing not.\n\nThe waiter was very sweet and seemed almost sheepish. I'd be embarrassed to bring the check, too, buddy, and I come from a long line of unscrupulous carpet merchants.\n\nIt was one of those occasions where you're forced to balance the scales however you can; up to and including scooping the entire contents of the cracker basket into your purse and leaving it all right on top, daring any intrepid employee to say a word. \n\nMy sister did just that and we strolled out unchallenged. I won't be strolling back.
