It was about $51 a person for the holiday dinner this past weekend. It was so freaking yummy and the wait was only about 30 minutes when we arrived at 6 o'clock. I don't like how you have to get your own beverages but they do offer an array of sodas, coffee, water etc. The hot crab legs and the lamb were the extra charge items and were so delicious. Another extra item was the caviar which was very delicious and I really enjoyed the spicy tuna hand rolls that were made fresh. The line for that was extremely long. The desserts aren't fancy but were delicious. My favorites were the lemon meringue tarts which had the softest, fluffy meringue on top. I also enjoyed the little Nutella waffle cup filled with cream.
