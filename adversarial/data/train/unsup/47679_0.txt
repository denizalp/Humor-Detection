We came here tonight because we live about a block away and wanted to try it out. The vibe of Alidia's is a mix between an Italian restaurant and a sports bar. The music was oldies which didn't really match what they appear to be going for. The food was good but the service was slow. I plan to come back again for a good meal but I don't don't think that it will be on my list of Lawrenceville recommendations.
