They don't even deserve 1 star. The are the worst company ever to deal with and just want to get every dollar they can from you. The new management company Pinnacle is even worse than the one before which is saying something because they were awful. The apartments are German roach infested and disgusting. I would live on the street rather than deal with this company and live there. DO NOT LIVE HERE.
