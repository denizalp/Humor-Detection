Dr Rock is great. Good listener and seems to care. \nThere is no direct line to the office so if you need something(Dr Rock said he was ordering a MRI with contrast but the radiologist had a no contrast order) so I needed the order to be changed. Forever trying to get thru to his office staff. Once I did, they were great.
