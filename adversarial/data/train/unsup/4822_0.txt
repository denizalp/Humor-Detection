Hot Haute Hot makes me wish I didn't work at a non-profit. The store specializes in modern, unique furnishings and the store embodies the vibrant style of its two owners. I spent a good ten minutes salivating over a beautiful upholstered chair and armoire, trying to concoct a payment plan or get-rich-quick scheme in my head that would allow me to buy them (Sell my plasma? Sell my body? Eat nothing but Saltines for six months?) The prices are steep, but even if you know you can't afford it, you shouldn't let it deter you from browsing. One day, that chair will be mine.
