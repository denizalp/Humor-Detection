We went around 5pm on a weekday and even though it was not super busy we barely saw our waitress. They burned our pizza and didn't tell us they were remaking it until my husband went to see why it was taking 30 minutes for a thin crust pizza. Manager nor waitress were apologetic. \n\nThe Mac & Cheese pops are now little triangles, which were pretty good. Remade pizza was burnt also but we just ate around it. They used to have a case full of cupcakes and treats in the shop connected to the bistro, but when we went the case was bare. :( Where did they go?? Do they only have treats on the weekends? Even the store looked sad, like they weren't stocked on stuff. I had been in there when it opened and it seems to have lost it's luster.
