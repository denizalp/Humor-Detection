Living in NY, I'm a big fan of Shake Shack, and I was so excited to finally enjoy it on the west coast! This Vegas location is pretty big with a lot of seating, larger than any of the NY ones I've visited. It's also brand new and really nice with a large tv screen in the middle. \n\nI came at 1am and there weren't too many people in line, they close at 2am. Found out that one of the managers came from NY, awesome! The food was as great as I remember, and my BF commented that he liked it even better than the Shake Shack we had in NY. Service was on point, and we got our food pretty quickly. This place looks like a well oiled machine!\n\nMust get the shack stack, the portabello burger on top of the cheeseburger is incredible, especially when you take that first bite and the muenster cheese ozzes out! And those crinkle cut cheese fries are so good, I have dreams about them! And can't forget about those shakes!
