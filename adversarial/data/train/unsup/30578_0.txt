Garden Court Buffet is located inside The Main Street Station Hotel near the Fremont Experience! This is a great buffet if u r on a budget. Don't come here expecting Wicked Spoon or The Bacchanal. The price u paid here r just pennies and dimes! It:s one of the cheapest good quality buffet u can find in LV. \n\nYou will get your money's worth with the quantity and quality of food! They even have a Hawaiian Station which is a rare treat and find. Also they serve caramelized confit duck breast. One of my favorite French dish of all time! You will come out of this buffet full and satisfy consider the measly amount u just paid. Bon Appetite!
