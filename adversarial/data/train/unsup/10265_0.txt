Pretty good place to get some food while waiting for your flight.  The restaurant is located in Terminal 1, D Gates.  We had the New York Style pizza and it was delicious. The pizza had decent flavors and the buttery crisp crust was perfect.  The downside was paying $10 for a domestic draft beer. Service was good with decent turnaround from the time food was ordered and presented at the table.
