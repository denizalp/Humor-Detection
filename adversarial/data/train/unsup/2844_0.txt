Overpriced and overhyped. Beer prices were ok but selection is not that great and some of the drinks are overpriced. The food is way overrated. 21$ for 4 raviolis thin as paper. Definitively not worth it. And the ravioli were cold. Chairs are not comfortable. It's loud and since it's a minimalist decor (ie the walls are down to the cement) there's no sound absorption making the place louder. Only good thing (and the reason for the 2 stars) is the sink to wash your hand at the bathroom. It reminds me of my high school days.
