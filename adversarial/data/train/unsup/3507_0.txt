Zoo Lights has been a family tradition for many years and every year it gets better. We use have a membership to the Phoenix Zoo and since we haven't been here in a while I noticed lots of changes.  Bigger and better with lots of upgrades.  \n\n$40 entry fee for a family of four. No military discount at the door but maybe you can buy discounted tickets on base.\n\nWe ventured in at 8:30 p.m. and avoided long lines and crowds and got great parking.  The music and the extra activities were spot on for my kids.  Lots of vendors selling lit up toys and you can get a yummy cup of cocoa to keep you warm.  Bring your jackets and extra cash.\n\nA talking giraffe that will address you by name with a big winner with us.  Adorable! There's a \"polar bear slide\" that kids loved too-you slide down an inter tube.  The new experience was a zip line and the kids really had fun.  The carousal is adorable and lots of animals to pick from to ride on.  From a shark to a hawk to a rhino and a cheetah this carousal was awesome!\n\nMusic was a tribute the Wizard of Oz which is my son's favorite movie.  The twinkling lights match the music and it's great to sit listen and watch the lights dance. \n\nI can't say enough great things about Zoo Lights.  It's always great to come home and enjoy all the activities we use to do when we lived here. The key is to NOT come early.  We had fun and hopefully be back again next year.
