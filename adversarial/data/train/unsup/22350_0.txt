Delivery from here is always a pleasant experience. They put something small (like cucumber maki) as a bonus for ordering (might be a $$ threshold for this reward :-)). Quality here is acceptable for a sushi addict like me. Ordering online is simple, and if an issue ever comes up, staff is nice and quick. Definitely would recommend for a foolproof sushi delivery experience.
