It's a newer location, but smaller and less variety.  All Sweet Tomatoes (aka \"Souplantation\") are good in my book, always consistent and fresh.  You know what you're going to get -- SALAD, SOUP, PASTA, and MUFFINS - done.  It's not good for a diet, you know that.  Too much temptation.  Hint: If you are on a diet, DO NOT GO TO ANY BUFFETS.  Pssst...but here is a secret: If you have one plate, you will not gain wait.  Then again, this is Vegas -- the land of excess.\n\nEverything is well monitored and maintained so it's always fresh.  I'm a fan of a good all-you-can-eat (AYCE) salad bar that's kept just like this, fresh and clean!  While this location is just more than a year or so old, it has about 2\/3 the salad bar, and about 1\/2 the amount of variety of soups, breads, muffins, etc., compared to most other ST's that I've been to.\n\nQ:  Is less more?\nA: Nahh.\n\nOne extra item just to throw a couple of more hundred calories at ya -- non-fat Dreyers Ice cream.  Both the vanilla and the chocolate are AWESOME!
