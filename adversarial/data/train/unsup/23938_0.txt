I really wanted to like this place.  We ordered a cake for our daughters birthday.  I was hoping this would be the place I would order for my wedding too.  Alas, it is not.  I went online and tried finding good reviews for specialty cakes.  After much online research, it was between this place and one other.  Needless to say, I chose wrong.  \n\nThe cake I ordered had one major flaw, the color was completely wrong, which really changed the look of the cake.  The picture I provided was clearly pink, the color they used was WHITE.  They tried to tell me it was BLUSH PINK.  It looked WHITE.  I was hoping that the taste of the cake would make up for it, but it did not.  The frosting was good, but the actual cake part was not something that went over well at the party.  Super disappointed for the amount of money we paid for it.  I should mention that this place is pricey, which wouldn't have been an issue if the cake was any good.  \n\nShe literally tried to tell me that they did their best to match the color.  She tried to sell me it as pink.  I might have felt better about it if they would have called me ahead of time and said they can't match the pink, and offered a discount or something.  But I got there the day before the party, and they tried to ignore the fact that the color was WHITE.  I told them I was unhappy.  The person there asked what I would like for them to do.  Picking up the cake the night before the party, that started at 11am the next morning, I didn't want them to do anything.  I was just hoping that it would taste good.  No luck...
