We have eaten here quite a few times and tried mostly breakfast items. They have all been 5 star, but I am here to review the baked goods because OMG they are to die for. I got my 30th birthday cake made here and it was amazing! So moist and not too sweet. It weighed about 10-15 lbs and was worth every single penny. I always buy a package of biscuits when we come by and they are perfect!! This last time, I picked up a package of cookie dough and they are literally among the best chocolate chip cookies I have ever had!!  There have been many times that I have said to myself \"there is no way everything is gluten free\" but it is. Do yourself a favor and check it out. We also love the kale chips in the potatoes. I do wish they had some non-pork meat options though. That's the only thing I can think of that they can improve on.  Maybe some turkey bacon\/sausage or even veggie burgers.  Be prepared to empty your wallet when you come here because everything from the coffee to the brownies is perfect!
