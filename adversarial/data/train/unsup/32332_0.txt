Do NOT Stay at This Hotel!!!\n\nI reserved this hotel through Groupon.com, and I'm sorry I did.  \n\nAIR CONDITIONING: wouldn't cool the room lower than 76 degrees; called the front desk, a maintenance person came up, allegedly checked everything, however the temperature only decreased by one degree.  By 11pm the air conditioning was still not working properly so I called the desk a second time telling them that I would need another room the following morning. My complaint was met with sarcasm and rudeness, \"Well, I can  move you right now!\"  I then had to explain that was with an eleven year old, and a person with medical issues, both were exhausted, and it would be worse to relocate at midnight than to wait until the next morning. Mid morning the next day we were able to move, our new room was ten degrees cooler than the first one! We were also given tickets to the breakfast buffet.\n\nKEY CARDS: did NOT work to get into the pool; had to make two trips to the front desk to get new key cards to get into the pool.  The second time we requested keys that actually WORKED, the night manager went with us-his key card didn't work either! \n\nPOOR HOUSEKEEPING: our room was allegedly cleaned however the following items were not replaced prompting two calls to the front desk: toilet tissue (we literally had none), two complimentary bottles of water, face cloths, paper cups to use with the coffee machine, and the drinking glasses that were next to the ice bucket. A discarded tissue was also left on the bathroom floor. \n\nAgain, do NOT stay at this hotel.
