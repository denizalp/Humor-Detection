A museum dedicated to Mustard? Who knew..? My Wife is in love with travel oddities and the Mustard museum was right up her alley. Although I have to admit, I enjoyed myself. \n \n The best thing about this potpourri of Grey Poupon is you have the chance to sample any of the hundreds of mustard's sold in the store. We ended up purchasing five bottles on our way out. So not only was our visit enjoyable, we're stocked up on mustard until doomsday. It was well worth the trip.
