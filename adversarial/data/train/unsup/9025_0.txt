Well, their shuttle driver crashed into my car (Toyota Prius) while stopped at a red light and caused $6K in damage. I am giving them 2 stars because they fixed the damages and gave me a rental to use. But it took 2 weeks to fix..meanwhile I wasted so much money on the Chevy that just guzzled down on gas. They were shady and didn't want to go through insurance. The paint job they did is already fading off (2 months later) and they never fixed the alignment, simple things that should be checked and taken care of when they deal with cars for a living. I would never buy a car from here just because they sell Chevys and I don't waste my money on those...
