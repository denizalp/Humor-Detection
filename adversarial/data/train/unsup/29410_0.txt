This place used to be a great breakfast spot... It must have changed ownership or something, though, because it's really going downhill. Went for bkfst yesterday and sat there for almost an hour before our bacon and eggs arrived. When it finally came, they got the order totally wrong... Our waitress was MIA so we had to hunt down other waitstaff to help. Then we sat and waited ... and waited... and waited... for the bill while watching other waitstaff argue with each other, chat  with each other and generally do not much of anything besides f*ing around while almost every table sat there with no coffee, no water refills, no food, etc. Very strange. Hope they can get it together as their prices are reasonable and the food decent.
