Bahn Mi's for me, Bahn Mi's for you, Bahn Mi's for everyone! That's almost how I feel with how often the Bahn Mi shops are popping up in Charlotte now. But what sets this Bahn Mi shop apart from the rest is their speciality bahn mi's.\n\nUpon entry, they have hip & current music playing. The place is bright and open with a menu on the wall and small menus that you can pick up on the counter. \n\nI wasn't sure what to get but I opted for two of their speciality bahn mi's and boy am I ever so glad that I did. We ordered the Porchetta Bahn Mi (crispy pork belly) and the Korean Bahn Mi and also an order of Crunchy Rolls. \n\nWhile we waited, I watched them bring out someone's fries and they looked amazing. Kind of kicked myself in the butt for not ordering some but I will definitely be back for those next time. \n\nI watched them make my crispy roll fresh. The girl even remade them because she didn't like how the first ones turned out. Pretty amazing right?\n\nWe first tried the Porchetta Bahn Mi and I was like amazed at how good it was right away. The pork belly skin was very crispy, the meat was just juicy and flavorful. And I was surprised at much I really liked the mayo they use. I am not sure what kind of mayo it was but it is definitely more creamy and thick than what we are used to as americans. It really helped the sandwich come together. \n\nAs much as I like the Porchetta Bahn Mi, I wasn't sure how I was going to feel about the Korean Bahn Mi. But the Korean surprised me. It was so good, I mean SOOOOOO GOOD. I opened it and you could see some of the mayo on top so I really wasn't sure but everything on it worked so well the together. The mayo, the kimchi, the marinated beef with the veggies - it all came together and was hands down my favorite. \n\nI promise you I will be back here and be back soon. So glad to see this yummy and delicious spot open in the University area.
