These guys are AWESOME!!!! Joe came out and gave us a quote a couple of months back that was more than reasonable for the size of our home (2,766 sq. ft.). I had some scheduling difficulties and Joe worked with me, after having to move my paint date, with ease. His crew showed up Monday, jumped right in and wrapped it up by Wednesday at lunch! This has been the easiest paint job, EVER! I would give them 100 stars if I could. Do yourself a favor and use these guys! They went above and beyond by covering everything, including my pool, fixing cracks, asking me my preference on little items and just cared! So refreshing doing business with APC! Well done, guys!!!
