Came here for our little bachelorette holiday weekend. We wanted a relaxing and tame weekend so we opted for a spa day.\n\nLocated in Ceasars Palace - they are open at 8am. We were pleasantly surprised that for a holiday weekend, it was not packed. \n\nEntrance fee is $45 which includes all-facility use - pools, spas, saunas, locker, robe, slippers, a cool towel, and snacks\/drinks. You can spend the whole day here if you wish!!!\n\nThe staff was very informative when the tour was given. After changing into our bikinis we opted to chill in the main pool room. There are 3 pools - a hot jacuzzi, a larger warm jacuzzi and a cold pool. Also available are heated lounge seats around the pool, but seating is very limited. I was able to snag one and fell asleep for about an hour. \n\nAs you walk down the halls, there is another larger pool passed the tea\/relaxation room as well as various sauna rooms.\n\nThere are 3 sauna rooms available: cedar sauna, arctic room and an herbal steam room. They're all different, so try them all to find your niche. The sauna was the most regular, the arctic room was just too cold for me, and the herbal room was too hot and the aroma was just strong!\n\nFor a few hours, this is where you get some much needed R&R. Loved my experience and will definitely come back!!!\n\nNOTE: I guess some peeps think this is a nudist colony since there is no policy that you cannot go nude. By all means, if you're that comfy with your bod - flaunt it and you go. However, if you got a lot of junk in your trunk, I strongly suggest you cover up... No one wants to see ALL that!!!
