Ideal Image lies and writes long contracts to protect themselves.  After 2 years, I still have hair growing in the treatment area.  I still have to shave every week and they will not refund and you can not sue.  It cost me 1000's of dollars.  After the ninth treatment you have to pay more for more treatments even though the hair should have been gone.
