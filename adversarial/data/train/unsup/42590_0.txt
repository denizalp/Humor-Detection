The Cheesecake Factory to us is always consistent.  Anywhere we travel we know what to expect and the Toronto location stays true to that.  The wait times are long and their estimated time they give you usually is at the higher end of the wait time if not a little longer.  The chicken bellagio was very nice with the pasta and fresh arugula and prosciutto.  Louisiana chicken pasta is always a go to for us and it's great with a bit of spice.  Wait staff are very good.  Space is tight with a stroller we had to fold it up.
