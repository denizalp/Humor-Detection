I thought  it was a Thai place at first.. It is more of a mix of American\/Canadian and Middle Eastern. We tried a grilled beef skewer in a a pita and chicken shawarma in a pita here tonight. The beef skewer pita was very good. The chicken tasted a bit dry, but still better than most other places. The toppings that you can put on the sandwich are excellent. The pitas also were fresh. They also seem to have a large menu worth exploring. Basically this is the best restaurant outside of McDonald's in this part of the city. Order time was about 10-15 minutes but worth it. If you call ahead you can get your order to go.  \n\nThey also have free parking.
