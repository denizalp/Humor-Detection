This would've been a solid 4 star rating because the food was delicious but the customer service totally ruined our dinner.\n\nHad a friend in town so I suggested to come here. I've been wanting to try this place for awhile now. With over 2000 reviews, I'm not going to bore you too much with details. \n\nCouple things:\n-you can order your burger how you want it. Well done meat for me please.\n-burgers were delicious! My friend and I both ordered the Gold Standard. Not a fan of goat cheese but paired with arugula and that garlic aoli dressing....yum!!!!\n-all burgers comes with French fries. Sweet potato fries and onion rings costs extra.\n-Yes, my burger cost $18.50. Yes, it was pricey but it IS at The Cosmopolitan and this is typical Vegas Strip pricing.\n\n\nNow, customer service was the only bad highlight of the night. Our server, TIFFANI, (yes spelled with an I) was a horrible server. Not only did I have to remind her MULTIPLE times to re-fill our drinks, but she acted like my friend and I were the blame when SHE was the one who switched our burgers around when she dropped them off at our table. My friend ordered hers medium rare and mine well done. It was traumatizing for me to bite into a red, bloody burger!!!!!!! We told her what happened and she gave us a blank stare. What she said to us next was unbelievable! She had the nerve to tell us, \"well since you guys got the same kind of burgers....do you just want to switch plates?\" SWITCH PLATES!?!?!  Are you serious!? Yeah, like my friend would want a spat-out, bit-into burger. The nerve of this bi*tch. All she had to do was take the plates back. It's not like her dumba$$ was back there in the kitchen making these burgers in the first place. Thinking about this again, is making me upset. I shouldn't even have left a tip for her. And my friend wanted to give her 20%. Ha!! I stopped her right there. Tiffani should've gotten $0.00 in tips. \n\nManagement, if you ever read this, you should get rid of TIFFANI. Or at least speak to her on how to properly be a good server. Teach her a thing or two about customer service.
