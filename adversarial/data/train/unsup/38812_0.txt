Spending a lot of time in Pittsburgh and had become convinced that lunch was going to be protein bars only. Until we found Bluebird. Great soups, fresh salads, a lot of vegetarian options that aren't available anywhere else in town. Plus the service is awesome and the staff is just adorable. Pretty much my only choice in downtown now.
