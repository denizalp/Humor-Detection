The Khun Chai Thai Restaurant has an all you can eat menu and live music in the evenings. \n\nThe all you can eat option is $25.00 not including drinks. It is available between Monday and Friday from 4-10pm. The portions are smaller to allow for more sampling of food options and prevent a lot of waste. This is a great idea - especially since they stipulates to a full price charge for leftovers.\n\nI had several of their appetizers including the Shrimp Tempura and BBQ Pork. I don't recommend the Shrimp Tempura because it was super thin and mostly tempura, but the BBQ pork was a perfect option. \n\nI enjoyed one of their salads called the Papaya Salad. It has shredded green papaya that is seasoned with lime juice, tomatoes, green beans, and chili. it was mediocre. \n\nEntrees are served with steamed rice and include items such as garlic pepper and spicy bamboo. They have several noodle options as well. The chicken Pad Thai was very good.\n\nMy favorite was the red curry (Kang-Dang) at a level two for a spice option. It includes red curry paste with coconut milk, bamboo shoots, and bell peppers. It was excellent!
