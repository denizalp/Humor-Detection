This bakery has horrible customer service and rude employees. They messed up my son's 9th birthday cake. I ordered it 2 1\/2 weeks in advance. The person who took my order did not even give me a receipt for the $100 cake I was to purchase. I talked to the bakery a few days in advance of my cake pick up. They reassured me it would be ready when they opened Saturday morning. On my way to pick it up they called and asked if I could send a image of what I asked for on the cake. After a bunch of waiting on hold and run around they said they would try to get in touch with the person who placed the order. After unsuccessfully trying to contact her I was able to locate the image of the cake. I had took a picture of a cake with it she had on her phone. I emailed this to them and they said they would have it prepare shortly.. This delay caused me to miss the 1st qtr of my son's basketball game that morning. After his first game I went to pick the cake up. Instead of it being the image of mine craft I had ordered covering 3\/4 of the cake it was just a comic strip size image. The cake looked very amateurish. After voicing my displeasure I was told in a sarcastic manner no manager was available to help me. I was spoke to several rude and unhelpful employees. I became very agitated and asked to call the owner. I was told I could email the email I forwarded the image to and hung up on. After calling back the Kitchen manager (That's what he said he was, even after I was told no manager was on duty) gave my # to the owner. No real effort or attempt was made to fix the cake. I do not recommend this bakery and would advise to get your cake made elsewhere.
