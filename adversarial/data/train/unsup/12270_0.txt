I must give props to @blazepizza so I had a free pizza I had earned, I was saving it. Then the app popped up a free blood orange lemonade for Halloween so I head over. I go out on a limb and order something I would never order, let's just say I have a new fav pizza you BBQ chicken (I added ricotta) it's so good!! Omg they let me earn a new flame, they let me use my free pie, they gave me the free drink (which again is delicious and I never would've pick it)...cost $0 happiness a million. Oh and David checked on me and smiled and everyone is so nice. Thank you Blaze in Henderson, NV #howdoyoublaze I have zero affiliation and a full, happy belly!
