We had Fazio's deliver dinner last week & I can say, that it is as good as any pizza I've eaten from the South Hills.  (If you know who I mean).  I ordered a large white pizza w\/ mushrooms & extra cheese and a Italian hoagie.  Both were fresh & delish!  The extra cheese was not necessary.  There was enough leftover for dinner the following Monday.  \n     The delivery person was very friendly & helpful.  This is my new go to pizza place and I live in an area that have plenty choices.
