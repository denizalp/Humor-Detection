Hoorah! A new BBQ joint in town! Rudy's has a new location opening Thursday (7\/5). We were invited to the private soft opening for friends and family, to allow for staff training.\n\nThe store is shiny and new. The tantalizing scents of smoky barbeque meats fills the air. The staff was chipper, all smiles, and ready to go. I give a special shout out to Tatiana at the front register and Veronica, who was walking around making sure everyone was good. She was hilarious. \n\nThe lean brisket was tasty. J loved his baby back ribs. The creamed corn and potato salad sides were good. But oh, lawd! The chocolate pudding was so very nice!\n\nThe relish bar is stocked with pickles, hot peppers and onions, as well as plenty of flatware and condiments. Try the sissy sauce. It's my fav of their bbq sauces.\n\nI will be back for sure.  With friends!
