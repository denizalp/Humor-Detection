It was a home away from home staying here! Went to Arizona for an anniversary vacay with the boyfriend and decided to book 2 nights at this beautiful resort! The check-in staff were amazing and the concierge gave plenty of information of vacation activities that we could do while we were at Arizona. We booked a 1 bedroom suite on the 2nd floor and OMG the room was beautiful and had lots of room for guests to stay. The layout was pretty impressive as well. They had a awesome size tub for me to soak in, they had updated kitchen appliances and cookware for me to use and the best thing of all..free WIFI. The main pool by the lobby was beautiful as well with a waterfall over the jacuzzi and they hold plenty of activities throughout the week to keep guests entertained. The only downside to this resort is there continental breakfast, which they only served donuts, coffee, and juice while we were there and that they don't have an oven in their kitchen but overall our vacation was pretty relaxing and amazing and would suggest this resort to all my friends! Will definitely stay here again if we ever go back to Arizona!
