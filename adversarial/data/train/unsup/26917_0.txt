The french fries are SO amazing! Seriously one of my favorite fries I've ever had and they give so much! BF got the 1\/4 chicken, which he also was raving about. The line was a little long on a Saturday around lunch time and there was no where to sit, but it was totally worth it. BTW - some egg pastry custard thing looked good, but was kind of gross - and I LOVE dessert.
