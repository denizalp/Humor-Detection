I've been coming here for more years I can count, and the quality and consistency remains the same. Only the prices have gone up, but that's totally to be expected over such a long span.\nWithout question, the best egg rolls in Cleveland, they are super crispy, crunchy and loaded with delicious, garlicky goodness, and are only made better by a dousing of their sweet, tangy fish saucy condiment. I tell myself every time I go in there that I'm gonna skip the egg roll this time, and yet once I sit down, the first thing out of my mouth is \"I'll have an egg roll, please\".\nSome of my favorite entrees include the pho soup (especially in the cold season), chicken ginger, chicken lemongrass, the deluxe pad thai and the vietnamese crepe.\nUnlike many other vietnamese crepes I've tried, this one is not at all greasy, and has the wonderful flavor of coconut milk and rice flour, which gives this crispy edged thin crepe a truly unique flavor. It's stuffed with chicken, shrimp, an array of mushrooms  and topped off with julienned carrots, cucumbers,  pickled daikon and sprouts. This, too, deserves a healthy splash of the fish sauce, and a squirt or two of sriracha.\nDon't expect a fancy interior. It's your typical asian restaurant vibe, complete with the obligatory fish tank. But what Minh-Anh lacks in style, it certainly makes up for in taste. Typing this up just made me hungry. I think I'll go there tonight...and this time I'll skip that egg roll for sure.
