Dear US Air, I understand there is no outside food allowed in your club, but you don't need to be a$$ holes about it when I left to get pizza for one of our children and came back in to gather them to eat it out side of your entrance.  To the attendant behind the counter that held up a sign \"No outside food allowed\", not two seconds after I walk in, F-You.
