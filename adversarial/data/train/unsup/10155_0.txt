This is another great store at the Las Vegas Premium outlets.\nI was pleasantly surprised to see that have other brands besides Fossil. There are some Michael Kors and DKNY watches here too.\n\nIt's pretty awesome actually because aside from the watches on display in the glass cabinets, they have tables and tables of watches on sale that are $10 and up. There are all kinds of shapes, colors and brands. You'll have a feast day looking at all the different watches.\n\nAside from the watches, this store also sells all kinds of other goodies. There are cute sunglasses at the front of the store. Purses at the side of the store and wallets in the back.\n\nThe staff is pretty cool too. I saw a DKNY watch that I liked but was looking to see if they had it in different colors. The lady I asked was very helpful and showed me all the different colors that she could find :).\n\nGreat place :).
