I have hit a lot of the Vietnamese places in town and vote this one the very best.  I had a big bowl of PHO with chicken and vegetables and all the fru fru greens to go on top.  As always, it was delicious.   Lang Van is out there as far as the location. From South Charlotte, it took me almost an hour arrive there. . But, that was with traffic and lots of stop lights to get to its location near Eastway and Sharon Amity.  As the crow flies, it's not all that far.  It is well worth the drive.   Very clean and a quiet atmosphere. Perfect as a place for a meeting of the minds!  I have been coming here for years, but sometimes forget about it due to its location.  Every time I eat their food, I am reminded what a fabulous place it is.  If you haven't been, GO!  If you have been, GO BACK!  It is consistently superb.   Five Stars all the way around.
