As close to anything you would eat in Italy! Intimate atmosphere, excellent service, and the meals are incredible! This is not an average Italian restaurant. It's special and unforgettable every time. The lobster ravioli is a personal favorite, but every dish is simply amazing.\n\nAgain, it's a small restaurant, space is at a premium. They do everything they can to accommodate you and your guests. I've seen some awful reviews from people who, by their own admission, acted like animals, then were offended when they were treated as such. All I can say is maybe a high class establishment is beyond their comprehension, and perhaps Pizza Hut is a better fit for them. Let those with discriminating taste enjoy places like Cenacolo in peace.
