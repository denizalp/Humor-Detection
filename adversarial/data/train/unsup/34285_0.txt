I happened upon this place while I was working down the road. The first time I went in the service was great and food was great. I was happily surprised to see a bookshelf with plenty of books to read. Every subsequent trip was just as nice. Staff is friendly always a smile on very attentive the cook even comes out directly to bring you your food and always with a smile. I'm not a coffee drinker so I can't comment on that but it sure does smell nice. Will return and refer people to go there.
