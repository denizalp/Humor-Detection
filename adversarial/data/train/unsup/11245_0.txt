Valet parking for groceries and a sandwich?  I don't get it.\n\nI finally visited this place for lunch with some co workers. First parking was a real issue and I hate having to valet my car.\n\nOnce we were inside there was a very long line, with a less than inspired menu of sandwiches salads and a few burgers.\n\nI went with  a veggie sandwich, the ingredients may have been local and organic but who cares when its small and not tasty.\n\nIf you want to seem emo  trendy and impress a girl and go to a locals only joint then check it out, otherwise don't bother.\n\nAlso the whole grocery part escapes me unless you can live on birdseed and condiments.
