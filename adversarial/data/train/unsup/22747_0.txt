Korean BBQ.  Monday-Thursday AYCE special $10 after10PM!\n\nOn the special menu:\nShort Ribs - Mini steaks basically, oh so delectable.\nBeef - Sliced thin for fast cooking & has a hint of seasoning of some sort.\nCalamari - Flavor orgasm in my mouth, also it cooks very fast.\nKimchee - Optimal & I had it rated by an actual Korean man from Korea.\nFish - Tilapia fillets, marinated with some sort of sauce but if you are patient enough to cook this it is well worth the wait. \nSteamed Rice - l personally use it as a grease napkin by distributing it over my plate evenly to soak excess oils from my meat, but the actual rice is quite good on its own.\n\nAs time passes, the iron grill will accumulate lard & meat debris which will form into black sludge after a while due to flame exposure, however, when asked to an attendant will remove the old grill & replace with a freshly oiled one.  Service is optimal especially being an AYCE restaurant as the servers are quick & proactive.\n\nThe washrooms are interesting in the sense that they are semi communal for both sexes, a central hall lined by doors that when opened reveal a separate washroom much in the style of a home washroom sans bath or shower equipment.\n\nDefinitely returning again & again!
