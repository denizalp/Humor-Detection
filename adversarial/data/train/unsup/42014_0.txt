I had the Enchiladas Poblanos.  They came in a tangy brown sauce.  Huge portion, delicious salsa.  \n\nIt's the best kind of strip-mall mexican, if you catch my drift.  I wouldn't bring a hot date there, but excellent comfort food.\n\nBig Flat Screen on the wall of the main dining room with ESPN.\n\nBeer specials if you care for that.\n\nCan't go wrong for about $10.
