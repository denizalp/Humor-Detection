Seneca has the potential to be an amazing golf course, but it just has some shortcomings. It's reasonably priced and pretty well kept on the greens. The rough is well rough. Good luck finding your ball! Driving on this course can be a hazard, very bumpy and uneven. I know a couple years ago they had to dig up a bunch for drainage reasons, but they never really fixed the grounds itself to make for a smoother fare way. Never the less, I really enjoy playing here. The course is pretty long and can be challenging on different holes, but I think that makes it more fun! The staff is super friendly and the carts are nice. The driving range is cheap and you can hit as many balls as you would like. Some may be too good for this place, but personally I like it and I'll continue to return!
