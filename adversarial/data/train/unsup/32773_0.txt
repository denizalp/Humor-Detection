Yasu is a must-try sushi experience in Toronto. $80 for an 18 pc omakase is WELL worth the price. I would eat it twice in one night but it is surprisingly satiating. Make reservations as it is usually booked a month or two solid but if you book thru OpenTable, you can sign up for notifications in case of a cancellation. And get a bar seat. We had the best seats in the house right in front of executive chef and itamae Yasuhisa Ouchi who served us with meticulous care and incredible skill. The whole night is a performance. Fresh ingredients that melt in your mouth. Both the chefs and servers are very attentive, which is natural considering there are pretty much 10 patrons at a time. 5\/5 would eat again and again and again.
