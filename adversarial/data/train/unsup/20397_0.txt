My first encounter with Lorna Jane was when I went to Australia. Their window display sticks out because of all the bright colors and motivational\/inspirational words on their gear.\n\nThey're a bit more expensive than my favorite: Lululemon. I don't understand why when most of their stuff are made from cheap materials: cotton, nylon, etc. and they're made in China. \n\nI marched in this store with my Lululemon bags just to see if there was anything worth buying. I saw a few tops with words of inspiration on them. \"Do you want to get a fitting room started?\", I was asked by a sales associate who wasn't perceptive enough to know that I haven't grabbed a thing that would signal one to get a fitting room started. I walked and looked at stuff in the entire store and here comes the same sales associate with the same question. When I finally found some tops I wanted to try, nobody was available to show me to the fitting room. \n\nThe sizing is off. I normally wear a small\/XS but even their XS was too big. I got a muscle tee and a $15 Yelp check-in towel. Which the two sales associate couldn't figure out how to ring up. One was quite rude to my sister and I just wanted to tell her to go workout at least once in her life so she can have endorphins flowing and make her a tad bit happier and less like a biatch.\n\nCheaply made clothes for $40-100+ and lame sales associates...I have no reason to come back here.
