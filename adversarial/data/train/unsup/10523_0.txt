I'm so confused by all the positive reviews of this place maybe it was an off day but I was just not impressed... and frankly super irritated.\n\nSo, I pull into the parking lot based off of my smartphone directions, the restaraunt is located in a long strip mall\/shopping plaza. I gave them a call to find out specifically where they were located.  I was parked near the Starbucks which is smack dab right in the middle of the strip mall.  \n\nI called and asked \"I'm at the Starbucks, where are you in relation to the Starbucks?\" The girl who handled my phone call tells me that they're at the end of the complex.  Oooookay.  I replied, is that the north end or the south end? She said to go right from the Starbucks.   Well depends on whether your are facing east or west at the Starbucks.  I tried to get more information from her but it was clear that she was directionally challenged.  We ended up walking to one end - not there and then to the other end... found it! \n\nTypical of this location and area the place was decorated nicely and very modern and clean looking. They had a nice small patio outside and my son chose to have us sit there.  \n\nFood: \nThis is what we ordered:\nSalt & Pepper Calamari $10\nSpring Rolls Pork & shrimp with peanut sauce $4\nPho Thai $12\nPho Meatballs $10 (I think)\nThai Iced Tea $4\n\nSalt & Pepper Calimari - it's Calamari steak, breaded in panko and deep fried.  It's served with fried jalapenos and onions and a spicy mayo dipping sauce.  The sauce is what makes this dish decent.  The calamari is nothing special, very similar to something that was supplied from a frozen food company.  \n\nPho Soups:  Broth was meh - mediocre at best.  It lacked the depth of flavors that I've had elsewhere.\nThe Pho herb & sprouts plate was sufficient but my cilantro looked like it had been frozen and thawed and given to me.  Eeeeek.  \n\nThai Iced Tea: Came pre-mixed, made me think that they didn't make it here since it wasn't layered.\n\nSpring Rolls:  This was supposed to be an appetizer but was served to us AFTER we were almost done with our pho and AFTER I told the waiter not to serve it to us since we didn't get it as an app.\n\nService:  Service was ok but has plenty of room for improvement.  1.  They forgot my spring roll appetizer, after we had been already partaking of the soup. The waiter asked if we got it, I said no and told them no need to bring it out now and they did anyways with no apologies.  People, take some advice, it COSTS you nothing to apologize.  It's FREE.  It's just a word that has value but costs you nothing from your own wallet... use it when it needs to be used.\n\nWhen I first started this review it had 2 stars... once I checked my leftovers... I took it down to one because I can't even re-eat it... (see below)\n\nSo we ended up leaving with lots of leftovers, the calamari app, a full order of spring rolls and our soups.  I get home this evening, unpack our food and am completed frustrated to find that they didn't include the peanut dipping sauce for the spring rolls NOR the calamari dipping sauce for the calamari.  \n\nWhat a waste of my hard earned money, I recommend that you don't waste  yours.    \n\nIf you're looking for some great Vietnamese fare, definitely check out my other reviews of other restaurants in the valley that will KNOCK your socks off without the cost.
