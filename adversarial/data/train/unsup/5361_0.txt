This is a huge, modern, very bright store. Tons of staff which is good with how busy it is. Its in the middle of arrowhead mall which is always busy so parking can be hard to find and then walking to the store can be time consuming. \n\nIt's a little over whelming when you first get there because there is people everywhere and there is just random tables but nothing to check in at. So you literally have to walk up and say excuse me to who you hope is an apple staff member to check in. You then just sit and wait. The wait time is super long but that is expected. Even with an appointment it is usually a 15min wait after scheduled time. \n\nBesides that once you actually get to speak with someone. I have gotten great customer service here. today I went in for a repair and Alex helped me. He was very nice and had great communication skills. He showed me what was going on and explained what needed to be done. I needed a new phone replacement and I ended up waiting 30min for a new phone that was suppose to be brought out but ended up not being in stock. So I am not looking forward to having to go back and wait again just for something that should have been done in one trip. \n\nI do not like the set up of the store as your kind of on your own. I recommend at least a place to check in it and some type of waiting area rather than craziness everywhere. But if you do need apple help make sure you make an appointment.
