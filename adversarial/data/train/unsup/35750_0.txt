Great great spot.  The steaks are probably some of the best in Charlotte for sure.  The appetizers were so good, we all joked that we should just keep ordering starters and forget entrees.\n\nVibe is cool, and service was spot on.  Drinks were also very good and unique.  The Ginger Basil Smash was awesome. (I think that is the name).
