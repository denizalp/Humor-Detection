Yum! We got a little flier put on our door alerting us that this place had opened right down the street. We kinda forgot about it, but one night we had a hankering for some pizza and I was too lazy to make it. I am very picky about pizza. It's gotta be a healthy crust, healthy toppings....pretty much an all around healthy pizza. This place was super yummy and the price was good too! We will def go there again!
