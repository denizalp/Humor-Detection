My hot dog craving is now satisfied after a late lunch at JJ's in Ballantyne. Not too busy on a weekend afternoon, I was able to work out my order and get into my dogs very swiftly.\n\nI chose the JJ's #1 Dog and the Carolina Dog. Very nicely cooked and very well topped (other than a LOT of mustard) with a bunch of tots (free with Yelp check-in!). Delicious!\n\nJJ's has a small bar area with beer and spirits available.\n\nThe tables were clean and the condiments area was tidy. I enjoyed the pickled carrots while I waited for my meal to be brought to the table.
