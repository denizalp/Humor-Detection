This is a top notch establishment period. We just dropped in without reservations so we waited in the bar until a table was available and let me tell you the bartending staff is great and the drinks are what they should be. When we got our table Kara was our waitress and she is probably the best server I have ever had. She quickly assessed what our tastes were and recommended meals. I love blackened dishes but hate it when a place can't do it right so I was skeptical when she recommended the blackened ahi tuna. Kara stated with no delay that not only would I be happy with it but to \"just close the menu now, you won't be disappointed\" !!! Boy was she right! I am a definite \"foodie\" and I love to eat out and I can't remember when I last enjoyed a meal this much. My friend got the steak and lobster and had his tenderloin steak blackened and it too was to die for. I am telling you folks EAT HERE you will love it! Thanks Kara and thanks Salt Cellar.\n\nDave
