The best BBQ I've had in the GTA. The beef brisket was absolutely PERFECT -- it literally could not be better.\nI got takeout and by the time I got home the redneck poutine was a bit cold and dry but I'm sure it's great fresh. I expected it to have more gravy from the pictures on the menu, but it just had a bit of BBQ sauce with the cheese and pulled pork.\nOther reviews said this place was a hole in the wall, but I disagree -- the atmosphere inside was perfect. The other BBQ places I've been to were 10x more rundown.\nThe big reason why this place isn't getting 5 stars is a) the prices.. quite steep for the portions (e.g. $6 for upgrading the fries to a poutine) and b) I ordered takeout and picked 2 sides, and when I got home realized I didn't get either of my sides, which was really disappointing because my bill came to $26 for one person.. \nAnyway, next time I'll be happy to 'settle' for just the brisket because though the pulled pork was good, the brisket was the killer.\nI will return, but I'll double check my order next time I get takeout.\n\n\nPS they have a large selection of pops other than what's listed on their online menu.
