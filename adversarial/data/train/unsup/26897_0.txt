Wow, great pizza.  I was driving by with my family after finishing dinner at a local restaurant and had to stop. Being a pizza aficionado, even on a full stomach, how could I pass up at taste of Napoli. \n\nI ordered the margarita to get a good base on the pizza:\n\nThe crust was amazing, very light and airy with a slight chew on the inside and crunchy on the outside, a hint of sweetness and a slight nutty taste.  The sauce was very good, the tomatoes (San Marzano) basil, oregano, garlic and olive oil really came through. Well balanced, nothing over powering. Just the right amount of mozzarella and parmigiana. Overall, a great pizza \n\nWe will be returning soon, this time on empty stomachs to try pizzas with different toppings. This pizzeria is definitely worth driving to. To top it off, the pizzaiolo is very friendly.
