Wow, I was surprised at how much I liked this place and the veggie sandwich we had. Fresh yummy bread, very good tasting sandwich, just the right size, very fast service and CHEAP for what you get. The sandwich was enough to fill me up and it was only $4.25. You can't beat that! Much better than subway. I'm a new fan, it's across from where I work and I will be back!
