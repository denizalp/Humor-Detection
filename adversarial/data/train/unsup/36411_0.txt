Five stars for outstanding happy hour and service.  Happy hour (hh) is offered from (5p-7p) 7 days a week in the bar area.  We used to frequent the Summerlin Fleming's hh, but it was near impossible to obtain a seat due to the limited bar area seating.  I am happy to report that the Town Square location has 4-5x the bar seating.  hh offerings consist of wine or mixed drinks and a handful of dishes plus the Fleming's burger @ $6\/each.  Our personal favorite hh dish is the baked brie that comes baked in a croissant with granny smith apples and honey glazed walnuts.  Upon slicing with the side of your fork, the brie oozes like hot lava.\n\nI can't wait to return for dinner, so I can order my favorite Med Rare Ribeye!
