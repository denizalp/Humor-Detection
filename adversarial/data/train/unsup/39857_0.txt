Really nice place! The design of the restaurant is very nice to look at. The service was amazing, probably because it wasn't crowded when we went, but they attended to our needs quickly and often made sure we were doing good. As soon as we ordered, the food quickly was brought to our table with what seemed like just minutes! The food was really good and did not disappoint! I would definitely eat her again when I visit Vegas.
