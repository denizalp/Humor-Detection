Of all the times for a credit card machine to break down, it had to he on a holiday weekend! That only made getting into the park a rather long process as everyone had to wait in line at the extremely slow ATM machines.  This place only allows credit cards at the entrance gates and the main restaurant.  Bring plenty of cash to pay for just about everything in this park.
