Okay... so let me start of by saying Salute was AMAZING! \nFrom the get-go everything was organized, the staff was attentive, professional & polite. Michelle was our server and she was informative and very knowledgeable of the menu. She made suggestions when I asked her opinion and she did not disappoint. I ordered the signature pasta with vodka sauce, tossed in a cheese wheel, flamb√©d with vodka and added meatballs. The pasta was made in-house, (which I feel is hard to come by these days) and cooked perfectly al-dente. My nephew had the chicken parmigiano and he said it was the best he's had in a long time. \nCheck in with yelp and you'll get a free dessert. We were so stuffed we couldn't enjoy it there and were going to skip it but Michelle packed one up for us to-go. Again, she was super sweet and generous but she wasn't the only one... the bus boy never skipped a beat with pouring and refilling our water; super attentive and polite as well.  If visiting Red Rock, this is the place for a great Italian dinner.
