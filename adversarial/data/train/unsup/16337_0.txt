I just came here to pick up a package that the delivery UPS person directed me to come pick up at this location since they wouldn't let me sign for it on the delivery slip, which is odd but OK. The guy working the front desk was cool to me. He greeted me as soon as I came through the front door and was very attentive at assisting me. I told him I'm just here to pick up my package, he ran through the basic \"security check\" for name and ID, he checked it off the through the system and gave me a receipt with \"Have a nice day\".. a few seconds later I was walking out with my package. \n\nParking is a little tight and if you don't get lucky on nabbing one in the front you will need to park in the Smiths parking area which isn't too far away. I'd advise if you do get lucky on a parking spot in the front be very cautious backing out especially if there are vehicles parked next to you because like I said earlier, parking is a little tight. Parking is shared with other businesses on the same strip type mall UPS is located so convenience is not a priority when it comes to parking here.
