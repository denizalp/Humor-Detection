I was very impressed with my first few experiences at this store.  The clerk at Customer Service took time to answer my many questions and prepare two money orders and a fax that took forever, even though he was done with his shift during our transaction. During my next visit the pharmacist went out of her way to transfer scripts from my old store and apologized profusely when her computer froze.  On a third trip a young male employee stopped and asked if he could help me find something! I found the store to be bright, cheerful and the selections, impressive (I was looking for some specialty homeopathic medicines.) Having said that, I'm new to this neighborhood, and just moved here from Greenfield.  I grew to love my old Greenfield Eagle, but I believe if some of these reviewers went there they *might* have more perspective.  This may not be Market District, but it's a very nice store.
