Workers here stare at you while you eat to make sure you are really eating your rice with your sushi. We went as soon as they open for lunch and today's special Kanpachi was written on the board, but then when we ordered 5 of those, they said they don't have any more and erased from the board. After we came out, I saw them writing Kanpachi on the board again. Foods tasted alright. Don't do the all-you-can-eat if you are so concerned about how much we eat. We were not satisfied to come back.
