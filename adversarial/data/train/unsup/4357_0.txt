I will give this Applebees location a 5 star and here's why. I used to work here and know the cooks and staff. I have inside information on how this location does things in relationship to other locations I had filled in at. \n\nThis location has better cooks and better management than some of the other locations. It shows in the food. Very seldom do I eat at this location and get a bad meal. \n\nBest nights to go Friday or Saturday after 4pm. The best cooks are working then, these guys have been at this location for over 8 years and they know what they are doing.
