What a waste of money. $16 for a dozen oysters, and you would expect high quality decent size bi-valves. Pearlz charges that and they are worth it. Btw Pearlz sells them for $10 dz on Mondays. So save your bucks. They passed the small cling-ons as I call them, as an oyster. You know, the itsy bitsy ones that attach to the larger oyster. Shore club: those are called freebies!
