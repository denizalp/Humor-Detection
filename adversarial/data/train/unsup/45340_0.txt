We came in an hour before they closed on a sunday night. We ordered about 17 rolls and splitting the checks between 5 people was pretty difficult since it was hard to put the right items in the checks. The server re did the checks about three times and was very patient with us and didn't seem annoyed at all even when we made it difficult and we all appreciated her for it. The rolls were very delicious and the price was pretty fair. If you get a sake bomb you can get an appetizer for half off. We all left satisfied and very full. over all a great time at this restaurant.
