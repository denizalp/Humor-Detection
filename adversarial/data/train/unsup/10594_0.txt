Pretty disappointing experience. The restaurant is nice overall but what I saw go on made it to where I will likely never go back. \n\nThey advertise fresh ingredients straight from Italy. I guess Italy means the Food Lion next door. As I'm sitting and waiting on my Raffaele pizza to be made with Buffalo Mozzarella, I watch an employee walk in with a bag from food lion. They then proceed to add 5 packs of Kraft shredded mozzarella to the bin while laughing (I wish I could add video here but the photos should work). \n\nI then receive a very mediocre pizza after 20 minutes, clearly covered in the shredded cheese rather than fresh mozzarella. For $15, I felt ripped off. I mean at least if you are going to try to pass off packaged cheese as fresh, don't add it in while laughing in clear view of customers. \n\nTo top it off, as I'm leaving, I look back to the prep area to watch another employee spraying glass cleaner on a rag, over the top of a prepped pizza, and overspraying the entire prep surface in order to clean the glass on the case above it. I feel bad for the customers who had to eat the glass cleaner on their pizza as well as any customers who then had their dough rolled out in glass cleaner. \n\nFor the price, I would expect a lot more out of this. If an ingredient is out, either bring it up to the customer and apologize while offering a refund or replacement, or purchase a comparable ingredient rather than the cheapest you can find at the grocery store. Teach employees proper methods for handling cleaning chemicals around food prep areas and raw\/prepped food. It was a true disappointment and I will likely not be back because of it.
