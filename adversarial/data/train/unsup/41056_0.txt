First off, I have no issues paying a pretty penny to eat at \"high end\" Vegas restaurants. I have also been to this place on 3 separate trips and always vouched for it. Today was one of the worst experiences I have had at any restaurant. Not only did we find a live bug in our food. The staff were treating us like we were wearing a head to toe Walmart outfit. The guy serving the wine and our waitress were both terrible. Fish was mediocre, at best. So unimpressed. Will never go back
