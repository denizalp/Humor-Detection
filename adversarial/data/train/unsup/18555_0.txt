Last night I finally had my first full take out meal from Prime Tandoori House. It was 9 pm on a Friday evening and I was already late to meet up with my friend. I called Prime Tandoori without a menu and spoke with an incredibly friendly gentleman. \nI initially requested an order of Aloo Gobi, Vegetable Pakora, Rice, one Naan, and one butterless Roti. \nA few minutes later, he called me back frantically to let me know there were no Aloo Gobi ingredients left. I requested a Chana Masala instead and the situation was diffused!\nTwenty minutes later, I showed up to get our order- he told me it would be about $19 on the phone, though it came only to $16! $16 for two to gorge on Indian food! The pakoras were delicious and came with a tangy sauce we dubbed \"Indian food ketchup.\" The rice was fragrant and perfect to eat the chickpea dish on top of, and the roti was perfect for picking up all my delicious thiiiings. I barely used utensils. \nI am already excited to find another excuse to eat at Prime Tandoori. LIFE RULES.
