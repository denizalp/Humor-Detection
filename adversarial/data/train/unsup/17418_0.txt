DO NOT GO HERE.\n\nI wish I could give this place 0 stars.  Food was expensive but solid, drinks overpriced, hibachi chef engaging, but service HORRENDOUS!\n\nService:  This is where Tomo loses all the stars.  Our server seemed lost, confused, and obviously had no idea how to handle a group or keep track of receipts.  After dinner, we got our checks and all paid individually (there were 6 of us).  We took our time at the table after we were paid up just to make sure everything was settled, and the owner came over to invite us to the upstairs lounge.  3 of our party were sake'd out (the chef has a bottle that he squirts in your mouth, we had about 6 rounds), but the other 3 of us went upstairs where there were some hookahs, music, and another bar.  My friends got drinks but I needed a break after the hibachi sake so I started dancing on the (empty) dance floor.  A few minutes later I noticed our server pulling one of my friends into the hallway and accosting her with accusations that 2 of our party didn't pay.  The server was pointing to 2 different receipt books and loudly saying that not everyone paid and that we owed her $60.  Because we were intoxicated, embarrassed without reason, and the server wouldn't stop harassing us, we eventually just gave her the money and left (we probably would have been more assertive if sober, but we just wanted to get on with our night and have a good time).  When we got back to our hotel room and reunited with the rest of our party, we all found our receipts (further proof we had all paid) and confirmed we had been scammed by the waitress (even worse behavior since I had already tipped 25% when paying my original bill).  This is truly unacceptable behavior by the restaurant and the staff, and looking back it seems like we were targeted because we looked like we just wanted (and could afford) a fun night out and didn't want to be hassled.  Yeesh...
