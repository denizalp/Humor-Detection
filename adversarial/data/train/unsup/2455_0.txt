Security is super hostile. I'm a clean cut mixed male( black and white) and was told very sternly that I couldn't come in with loafers and shorts....OK that's fine but after I left my girl was still there and told me they let SEVERAL people who had shorts and loafers on in. I live in Vegas so I've been to this club a few times and every single time security is very rude......and fellas don't go here if you don't want your girl\/wife talked to crazy.
