Great show!  She sang and danced her a$$ off.  And of course our group of girls did the same!  Lots of fun costume changes, lots of confetti, lots of fun!!  Her back up dancers were also GREAT dancers and good eye candy :)  I liked that she interacted with the audience so it felt like a small concert not a mega concert at a football stadium.\n\nWe splurged and got VIP tickets which came with a bottle of champs half way thru the show.  We got a private area with sofa style seating, and lots of room to move as well as a waitress that would take your drink orders.\n\nIf you can afford it, I would definitely recommend doing the VIP experience.  It's pretty darn AMAZING!!!!!  :)
