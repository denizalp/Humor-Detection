All the pics looked good so I went with that but what I got was not even close.  The portions of the beef on the chicken and beef combo were about half of what the chicken was.  For $15 that is way overpriced for what I got but they do try to make it up by giving you a large portion of rice, something that doesn't really cost that much.  I could have gone to another place I eat at and received a better Kabob meal for $3 less.  That's what I get for relying on pics.
