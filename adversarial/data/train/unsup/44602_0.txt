This is my first time getting my lips done and I absolutely love them ! I was very scared at first , but the staff and Doctor were amazing . He has a very light hand therefore it didn't hurt as much as I imagined and very little bruising . He explained the process and showed me everything was new and packaged . I definitely recommend him .
