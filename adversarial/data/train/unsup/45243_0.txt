This place for me is a love hate relationship. Food is amazing! I've been here several times and I always love my dish. Burger is delicious and huge! Salads are amazing! Even my child's captain crunch nuggets are great!\n\nMy hate relationship is the service. My waitress is extremely nice but not good at customer service. First time she messed up my order & I had to wait 10 mins to let her know it's not what I order. She apologized then rushed a new order, which later came out burnt! I couldn't eat it. Everyone at my table agreed it was burnt. I would had told her it was burnt but she never came back to check on us. I tried my friends others dishes and they were good! \n\nLast weekend I actually went again. Same waitress btw. My salad was wrong which she corrected but never checked on us. We waited 20 mins for our check, that's after we finished eating. I'm sure if I had just walked out no one would have noticed. But I don't dine & dash. \n\nI will continue to go there for the great food but I will just stick to sitting at the bar probably. Nice decor as well. Nice atmosphere. Check it out for yourself. Hence my love hate relationship why I have three stars.
