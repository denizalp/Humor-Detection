Stopped in to check the place out based on the name alone. My mom used to play a joke on us when we were small saying want a Hurtz donut? We would say yes, yes and she would punch us in the arm and say Hurts dont it. So when we saw this place we definitely had to go and check it out..we had such a great time with server cashier TJ  he was extremely helpful, fun and soooh nice..he made our whole experience a blast and the donuts were huge, and we loved them!! definitely recommend it!! Ask for Tj
