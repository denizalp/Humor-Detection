Family came in from out of town for Thanksgiving weekend, and they suggested doing one of those Lolly the Trolley tour things. Fine, whatever, I said, thinking in the back of my head, \"Oh man, this is gonna be so lame,\" because I am obviously too cool for school. But the two-hour tour that we took was actually pretty bitchin'. It also made me feel kind of dumb that I know so little about the city I've called home for almost eight years. Did you know that John Heisman, who is credited as the inventor of the forward pass, was born in Ohio City? Or that, in the early days of Cleveland, the Irish were forced to live in the Flats so they didn't bother the Protestants on either side of the Cuyahoga? And the two-hour tour has a 20-minute stop-off at the Rockefeller public garden, another place I have ashamedly not been before. Totally recommended.
