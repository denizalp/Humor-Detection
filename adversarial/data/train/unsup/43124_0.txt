Ashlee is AMAZING! I found her on Facebook! She is very passionate & compassionate! She absolutely found her \" calling\". & she truly enjoys the career path she has chosen! I have had numerous health issues the past 6 months, with frequent hospitalizations. She is mostly treating my main problem, along with tongue & pulse diagnoses (Chinese medicine related) which showed several deficiencies.  After only a few treatments, I already feel stronger than I have in a very long time! I am thrilled to have found Ashlee, & I look forward to her treatments & care! She is VERY knowledgable! I am so anxious to become stronger & get my issues resolved, to be the best me I can be! Looking forward to getting my life back! Thank you Ashlee..you are truly amazing! BTW , I have been an RN for 43 years, & I do require Western medicine treatments ( meds, etc) but I truly believe, along with Eastern medicine, there is now, finally, light at the end of my tunnel!
