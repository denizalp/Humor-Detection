Eager to learn the basics of sewing I signed up for a class. Savi (the owner) is *awesome*. She explains each step with patience of ... well, someone who can talk to a complete idiot. Turns out I have no skill in the fine art of sewing. \n\n(Yes, I'm that bad.) However, I loved my introduction to sewing class so much I signed up for the series. (Saving myself $10. The 3 discounted classes are $95.) Classes run about two hours. If you have a machine you can learn on that. However, I opted to learn using one of Savi's machines. (I'm not entirely sure what brand or style I'd like to purchase quite yet.) \n\nMy first class was on a mechanical machine, second with a digital interface that performs magic. The store carries a number of brands so you can try different things out. There are tons of things I liked about the class. Highlights:\n\n+ Small size (4 ppl max)\n+ Super enthusiastic teachers\n+ Fun vibe\n+ No strong sell to purchase a machine (or further classes)\n\nYep. That's right. A visit here isn't like buying a car. It's very entertaining and you'll want to go back. Obviously this is a sewing store. They sell machines, fabric, zippers, scissors mwah mwah mwah things you need to be very crafty.\n\nSo the sewing. \n+ 1st class: Basic instruction on a machine. How to thread needles, buy them, fabric basics, rolling a bobbin, thread basics and getting comfortable with a machine.\n+ 2nd class: Creating a zipper bag\n+ 3rd class: Creating something from a pattern (which you purchase separately and provide fabric)\n\nIf you haven't ever sewn this place rocks! If you're an experienced sewer there are project classes you can join. (Open sew sessions, serger use, creating dolls, placemats, costumes,  BBQ mitts, and so on.) Neat place, I really like it!
