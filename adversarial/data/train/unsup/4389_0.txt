Yes.  You win, Jupiters.  Happy hour special providing me with cheap yet delicious beer?  Check.\n\nSuper cheap pizza, making life amazing?  Double check.\n\nOkay, Jupiter's has happy hour specials that are WONDROUS.  I got a magnificent large pizza for only $8.  And it was huuuuge.  How huge?  It was so big I ate  leftovers for lunch, dinner and another lunch during the week.  For eight dollars!\n\nJupiters, I will sing your praises on the harp, lyre, and xylophone.  Seriously.
