I discovered that bakery when started dating my GF from Outremont. Ever since that day for five years we are permanent customers. Always fresh, delicious and worth driving to try if you never been there.\nOur favorite are chocolate and poppy mini croissants, mini cheesecakes, rum balls and chocolate squares. Remember, that Friday everything is sold out VERY fast and they're closed on Saturdays. Staff is extremely nice and helpful. Try it as we usually do - Sunday morning - at it will make your day much better.
