Not their best performance.  I ordered my usual the Greek Salad no feta or raw onions.  Usually this is a salad on top of a bed of yummy potato salad which is dairy free.....today however they decided to use their pasta salad that has lots of feta cheese in it....I said no cheese People!\n\nThe chicken wasn't as moist as I have come to expect but the service was good and I'm sure if I had eaten-in they would have corrected it for me.
