If it were possible to give a review with zero stars-I would have! Save yourself your time and money. There is a reason this place is a ghost town. They were beyond rude, I almost turned and walked out the second I was greeting with a mean look as if I was interrupting the show tech was watching. Thought I would give the benefit of doubt. Sorry I did-I will NeVER return to this salon for services. I have no idea how they are still in business.
