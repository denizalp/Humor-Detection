to be PERFECTLY honest...I don't think The Lodge food should be considered \"Bar Food\".  It should be considered...\"This will change your life and will slap you like the doctor did to your butt the day you were born\" good food.  I have YET to purchase ANYTHING from The Lodge menu that I didn't LOVE.  I recently just had something from there breakfast menu....the Breakfast burger(I think that is the name).  Holy hell!!!  Cooked to order clean beef, over Texas toast,  smothered in with melting cheddar cheese, with an over easy egg on top.  If i had a hangover, this would have been the cure...instead...I just REALLY enjoyed this Perfect burger.  I have been to the Lodge COUNTLESS times.  The service is ALWAYS GREAT!!  the Happy Hour specials are ALWAYS perfect.  (The Wings....THE Wings...THE WINGS!!!!!!!)  OH.....and they have this dipping sauce for your Sweet Potato Fries that will LITERALLY make you wanna slap your momma!!  I need a straw with it...and I am happy.  Overall...the Lodge is the PERFECT Place.  The Beer is always cold.  The Tv's are always clear.  The Cornhole bags are always open to play..and life is just easier there.  With all the  Scottsdale Douche Bag Bars popping up left and right........the Lodge stays close to their Roots.  VERY NON-DOUCHE BAG FEEL...at least during the week and before 10pm on the weekends  =)  I love this place.  It is my \"Security Blanket.\"\n\nGo there and tell them....Mike DLT sent you  =)
