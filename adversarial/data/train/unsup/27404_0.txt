I believe this restaurant is undeserving of a less-than 4star ranking.  FiredUp! is certainly worth not only a try, but a return visit in our busy schedules of competing leisure activities.  \n\nWe enjoyed an excellent octopus and wild-game chili appetizer with a very tasty balsamic and hot sauce on the side.  Tracy was a pleasure as our server and is definitely an industry \"veteran\".  Great atmosphere and decor.  \n\nThe drinks menu is worth exploring, with some wines and even a beer I've never encountered before, and I've tried many!\n\nDon't let other's opinions become your own; give FiredUp! the decency of your patronage, as it deserves!\n\n-Kevin Yun
