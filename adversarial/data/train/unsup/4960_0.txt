I came here with some girl friends for dinner last night.  \n\nI love the high ceilings and the decor, including the original Electric Circus sign.  We were here on a Wednesday night, so I was quite pleased that the music was at a reasonable volume so that you could actually have a conversation!!  \n\nThe staff was overly friendly.  From the hostess, to the server, to the bus boy.  \n\nNow to the best part, the food!  We ordered a the pit master platter for 2 which came with 2 big chicken breasts, 6 ribs, 3 pickle slices, 3 big pieces of brisket and a cup of fries + 3 sauces. We also ordered some coleslaw and cornbread to cut the grease and also the mac and cheese.  I have absolutely nothing bad to say about any of the food.  It filled us up and there was some to take home.   The meats were so juicy and full of flavour; I didn't even use the sauces.  The mac and cheese was delicious and cheesy, with big chunks of ribs.  \n\nThe prices were very reasonable for the amount of food you get.\n\nI'd love to come back here on the weekend.  I heard it gets more loungey.
