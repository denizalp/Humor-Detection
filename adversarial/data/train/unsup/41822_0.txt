I intended to write this some time ago, so forgive me for not sharing this best kept secret sooner. Classic Salon Nails in Lake Wylie, SC is consistently excellent with the service they provide. I've gone there infrequently for the last two years to frequently get the best service. Never are my cuticles clipped in pain, never have they been rude, and never is the establishment unclean. \n\nAlthough all of the employees are good, I prefer Kayla (Co-owner and the wife of the owner) and Kim (young and energetic). Both these ladies take their time and make sure the customer is fully pleased\/satisfied before they leave. I always leave completely satisfied with the service I received. I'm working on \"making\" more time to consistently have the experience I get at Classic Salon Nails.
