The hubby and I stayed here while on a weekend getaway. This hotel was great! \n\nWhen we pulled up there were two guys out front ready and willing to valet. They told us to leave the luggage in the car and they would have the bellhop bring it up to our room (which he did promptly). \n\nThe people at the front desk were very friendly and offered us cookies and fruit infused water (which we declined). \n\nAfter easily checking in we went to the room and it was very, very nice. There was a living room area complete with sofa bed, flat screen TV, desk, and wet bar. \n\nWe walked through the french doors and there was the lovely bedroom with a king sized bed, another flat screen TV, and dresser. \n\nThe bathroom was large and allowed for plenty of privacy. The bath tub and shower were separate (not that I would use a bath tub in a hotel room). \n\nThe room was very clean as was the rest of the hotel. The decor was modern and warm. \n\nThe whole staff was great and very accommodating. They really make sure you are comfortable and have everything you need. \n\nWe had left overs and wanted to reheat them but there was no microwave in the room (just a refrigerator). When we called the front desk and asked if there was a microwave we could use they quickly brought one to the room for our use. The staff quickly answered our call for more towels and gave us an umbrella when it rained friday......and did it all with a smile. That's what I call service. \n\nI would definitely stay here again.
