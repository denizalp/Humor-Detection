I don't know why everyone has complained about this place. Maybe because when u came lines were long and u waited a while to be seated. Not for us. Came here on a Sunday before work. Seated right away. The food was fresh and delcious wait staff was very friendly and even waiters who weren't ours checked on us and asked how we were doing. The fried chicken was good  and so was the beef nilaga soup , but the tapa breakfast plate was my favorite. Just don't forget to have dessert halo halo is yummy but I like the Ube ice cream by itself because I'm an Ube girl for life.
