Unfortunately, the staff (non-instructors) here are severely incompetent, in particular the sales manager. My experience pertains to bringing a family member to the gym in order for her to try out the gym, which resulted in a  verbally abusive, utterly unprofessional encounter.\n\nUpon inquiring of the staff in-person previously, I was instructed by the front desk staff to apply for a 1-week trial membership in person at the gym, as opposed to downloading online (3-day passes only). Rather than acknowledging his staff had thus misinformed me, this sales manager was extremely offended that I maintained this was the instruction I had received, and denied that the gym ever provides 1-week memberships. Verbatim, he dismissed his entire front desk staff: \"don't talk to them, they don't know anything, they should direct you to the sales staff.\" Ironic that he would both treat his client and staff with outright rudeness.\n\nFortunately, am here on a short-term membership plan, would never consider long-term membership at this location.
