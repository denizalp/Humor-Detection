I think it is quite possible that I am not cool enough for this place, but the food is so gol darn good I'll keep going back. And it's super cozy on a rainy day. In the meantime, I'll work on my slouch, swagger and lopsided grin. I was going to put a smiley face right here to signal the end of my review, but that would be so not cool. peace out.
