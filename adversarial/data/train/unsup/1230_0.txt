I went to planet hollywood's miracle mile shops for one thing and one thing only. Their Pink's hotdog restaurant stuck on the side of the mall.\n\nMaybe it's because I'm originally from a small city, but this mall was freakin amazing. They've got a random swimming pool outside, a casino (duhh what building in vegas doesn't..), many eateries, awesome shops!\n\nThe decor inside the building is just mind boggling. There's this huge disco ball-like thing that changes colors. I literally stood there for about 10 minutes just watching it change colors. \n\nThere are many staffs conveniently located at the entrances that can direct you where to go if you get lost. It's a huge mall, so these people are very handy-dandy. \n\nI didn't buy anything from the mall but just to look around was a lot of fun. \n\nIf you get tired from tirelessly looking at stuff and people watching, there are many couches around so that you can be lazy and lounge around. I've noticed that there were computers for internet use as well. However it's not free.
