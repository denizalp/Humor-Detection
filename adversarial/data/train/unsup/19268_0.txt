I was a little disappointed in Green Onion.  I went in for the first time to try to get some lemon grass for a soup I was making, but when I got there I realized I didn't know what lemon grass looked like.  That would have been ok, except that all the produce was either unlabeled or not labeled in English, and also shrink wrapped (preventing me from smelling any of it to help me figure out what it was.)  I ended up guessing (\"what looks the most like grass?\") and when I got out to my car and ripped the shrink wrap off to smell my purchase immediately discerned that I had Bok Choi and not lemon grass.  I hate Bok Choi!!  \n\nThey did have a better selection of rice wine (sake and korean varieties) than anywhere else in town, and about 20 kinds of mochi (I love mochi!)  I'm sure it's really hard to get actual asian produce to champaign, so I guess in retrospect I shouldn't be surprised that most of their inventory was varieties of asian noodles and dry grains.  \n\nI can see why, if I were an Asian student, I would like to come to Green Onion to get my brand of noodle bowl that I can't get anywhere else.  However, as the gringo aspiring chef that I am, I am sad to report that this isn't the place for me to get the sauces and spices I need for my asian cooking as I hoped it would be. On the bright side, my trip did make me realize that Schnuck's actually has an acceptable variety of the ingredients that I usually need (e.g., fish sauce, vegetable oil, chili sauce.)
