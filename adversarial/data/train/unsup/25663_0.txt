Stay here many times but it seems like it's always so hectic. Run in with hotel security and they were rude but front desk and room service was decent. Rooms are all suites and great to share with friends. Very comfortable. Larger suites are also great but they don't have good ventilation or a kitchenette which is preferable with big groups. Be careful rooming near families. Got a glimpse of high roller suites and were dope as hell. Decent food selection in both food courts. Have stayed here several times but likely going to switch it up next time, just 'cuz
