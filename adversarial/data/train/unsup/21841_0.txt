I came here with a group of friends on my bachelor party weekend and was not disappointed.  It is probably the most unique restaurant concept I have ever seen - a bold experiment in hospitality, wherein the servers are hired based on their natural capacity to be surly and obnoxious and say absolutely whatever they feel like to their patrons.  \n\nHere is a slice of the conversation that occurred while I was ordering:\n\nMe: \"I will have...hmmm....just give me one sec\"\nHer: \"Hurry the f%$k up.  I need to take other orders.\"\nMe: \"OK, sheesh, how's this salad?\"\nHer: \"Not bad, if you're a p&ssy.  I'll put you down for a steak.\"\nMe: \"Um, thanks but I don't want the steak.  I want the salad.\"\nHer: (rolls eyes, goes to the next person) \"And what the f@#k do YOU want?\"\n\nI'm not sure how you would like being involved in the above ordering process, but I have to say, I found it refreshing.  Even though I'm a huge fan of great service at restaurants, in life you so rarely encounter someone who is speaking their mind with such utter abandon, that experiencing it is a true novelty.  \n\nDo not come here with someone who is easily offended or insecure.  But if you can appreciate being ragged on the whole time you eat and maybe dish it right back to them too, you will have a huge amount of laughs, and memories, on the other side.
