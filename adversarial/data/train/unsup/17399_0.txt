Cracker Barrel has many goodies in their pantry, but a seasoning cupboard is not one them. The food is not exactly pricey or horrible, but very bland. Based on the southern recipes I grew up with from my great grandma, I know older style cooking typically has less seasoning than the cuisine aimed at more modern palettes. However, even fat and salt aren't enough to give their classic chicken and dumplings any interest (they were the worst of my sample platter - imagine chicken pot pie but without colorful veggies, crunchy crust, or taste). \n\nThe ham and meatloaf faired better but still are nothing to go out of the way to get (I have had better ham from a little breakfast burrito place wedged in a small strip mall). The mac and cheese was the biggest disappointment. Blandness aside, it felt like watered-down Stouffer's with a thin sauce that felt neither creamy nor cheesy. I enjoyed the fried okra (similar to a drier and non spicy fried jalape√±o), but it could use a dip or seasoning salt. The best thing on the plate was the hash brown casserole which aside from being cheesy had pepper (which they really should introduce to their other offerings). \n\nBiscuits are good. However, likes everything else, they aren't that impressive (maybe I have been spoiled by Mrs. Knotts). Also they came slightly after the meal... before would have made a nice little appetizer to spread out the eating process  like butter. \n\nAlso, you get to wait in a line in a cramped store to pay. Yay.
