I don't know where to start, my wife and I stopped by there having ordered stuff from the Internet before, hoping to find something special.  The \"in store\" experience was simply the finest shopping experience I've had anywhere.   While in town we also had the opportunity to visit the La Perla and Agent Provocateur stores.  While all three are top of the line stores, only the Kiki  store made us actually feel like we were buying luxury, the other two felt like shopping at some regular shop like J Crew.   Special thanks to the Kiki team, you two were fantastic!!!  SB
