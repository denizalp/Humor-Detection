This place gets busy and some times hard to get a table.  We had 3 of us and there was a table for 6 that only these two young ladies were sitting at, so I asked if we could bum out at the end of the table.  They were happy to let us bum!  The line was out to the door, pretty long.  The crepes were yum-delicious!!!  Papa K is the way to go! The snicker doodle cookie was YUM-NESS!
