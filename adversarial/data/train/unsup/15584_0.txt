This is a lunch review.\n\nThe Skinny (an update): come here for a leisurely jidori cutlet lunch with tonjiru soup, unlimited bowls of rice and shredded cabbage - this is a great value for $9.50 (4), service: attentive as usual (4) value: for the price of a fast food lunch, the jidori cutlet special cannot be beat (4).\n\nI cannot vouch for the other items on the menu during lunch but I can say that I am enamored by the jidori cutlet lunch special here at Yu-Yu.\n\nAs previously mentioned, I absolutely love the tonjiru pork broth with it's intense umami\/root vegetable goodness whereas I wasn't a huge fan of the actual kushi skewers and the other cooked dishes here. However, I was lured back by the call of jidori\/tonkatsu cutlets.\n\nThe best thing about the lunch specials are they already come with a cup of the tonjiru soup. Score! Plus, the cutlet lunches come with unlimited cabbage and rice just like in a true tonkatsu joint - score 2. Finally, the crumb they use with the cutlets are the slightly coarser grain compared to what they use for the kushi-age which make for a better crunch - hat trick of awesome!\n\nThe first time we came here, the hubs ordered the tonkatsu and I ordered the jidori cutlet. Although the tonkatsu is good, the serving size of the tonkatsu is kind of skimpy compared to the jidori cutlet. The jidori cutlet gives you a good portion of juicy, tender chicken. Fantastic. Ever since that visit, the hubs has ordered the chicken as well.\n\nSo in the end, I come here for the jidori cutlet lunch special only and don't really feel a huge urge to stray from this given the excellent value compared to other items I have tried in the past.
