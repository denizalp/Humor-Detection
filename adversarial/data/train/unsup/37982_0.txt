There are a lot of ranges in Las Vegas that aim for the tourist crowd who come to rock full auto. The Gun Garage is one of them, but unlike the LV Gun Store the staff don't rock an attitude. Everyone is friendly, they have a Range Officer that oversees the entire line and each machine gun rental is overseen by a personal RO that tells you a little about the weapon you're firing and what to expect. They also treat Average Joes who come to shoot their personal weapons nicely. They keep the range clean and equipment maintained. A good range and better staff. What more can you ask for?\n\nOh, and for the tourists they offer a free shuttle.
