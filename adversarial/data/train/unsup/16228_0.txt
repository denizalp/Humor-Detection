Excellent food but seriously overpriced, in my opinion. They say that eating at Carbone's is like eating at your Grandmas house, but I don't remember Grandma hitting me up for $300 after dinner.  LOL. \n\nWe came to Carbone's while staying at the Aria for New Years. After rejecting the first two crappy tables we were offered, we were seated in a really cool booth that reminded me of the Vegas rat-pack days. A quick review of the menu let me know that the evening was not going to be cheap or even reasonable, so I sucked it up and just figured I'd enjoy the meal regardless of the cost, but I'd save the steak eating for another night (because the bone in ribeye for 2 was over $200). After ordering a glass of wine we decided to share a salad and a the mozzarella appetizer. We both ordered the rigatoni for the main course. \n\nThe watercress \/ blue cheese salad came first and was truly interesting in flavor, texture, and appearance but at almost $20 for a small salad, not a great value. \n\nThe mozzarella and prosciutto appetizer was next, and it was truly excellent. Fresh mozzarella and prosciutto made for magnificent flavors and was enough for 2. I don't recall the price but it was really worth having. \n\nNext was the rigatoni. Although the flavor was excellent (spicy!!), it was served on a small plate with almost no presentation and for $27 seemed a little underwhelming. It did taste amazing but for that price, it should have been a bit more impressive. Along with the rigatoni we ordered 3 meatballs which were truly excellent.  \n\nLook Yelpers the food here is truly very good, but I just feel like there are much better values for the money in Vegas and at the Aria (try fifty 5 for some pizza!!). The service was also top notch, but I would be insistent about getting a good table as they will cram you into a two seater by the kitchen if you let them. \n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the experience, the food, and the service but I thought the meal should have been about $100 cheaper. If money is no object, I think you'll have a great time here but for $250-$300, I was left feeling a little jaded. \n\nFood      -  5 Stars\nService  -  5 Stars\nPrice      -  2 Stars\n\nOverall 4 Stars. \n\nManga!
