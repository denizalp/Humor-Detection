Had the Mediterranean Pizza for first visit to Frankie's.  I thought it was a fine pizza and enjoyed it.  I'm curious about all the negative reviews because it was a solid pizza and the staff was very nice. Was it the best pizza I've every had?  Not for me but if you served it to me once a week it would be a perfectly good meal.  The toppings were generous and fresh, the white garlic sauce was tasty.  Crust is a bit thick for me so that's a personal preference and prob part of what accounts for the 3-stars.  Pizza is a very personal taste -- thick or thin crust, topping combos, baked crispy or baked lightly brown, Red or white sauce. You get my drift. I think if you stopped off for dinner or ordered delivery you'd have a satisfying experience.  You might even find for you is great pizza because it all depends what you like in a pizza.  And although I arrived at a 3-star, a-ok rating that doesn't make it a bad pizza but rather not the way I like a pizza.  If you want a deal they often have a Groupon which is a chance to give it a try for a bargain.
