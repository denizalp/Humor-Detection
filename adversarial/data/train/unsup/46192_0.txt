Stopped here on our way to the airport before flying back to California. Thank god we did, one of the best meals we had on our trip and definitely the best in Calgary\/Banff. \n\nFood is authentic, service is genuine and the flavors are perfect. \n\nWe had chicken 65 (white meat with delicious spices that is deep fried but not oily, ask for a side of mint chutney), garlic rasam, onion\/chili utthapam (pretty spicy, so watch out) and the chicken mughali (so, so good). Perfect meal. \n\nApparently the chef came here from Spice Hut in Sunnyvale, CA to open his own joint. \n\nThis place is legit for vegetarians & non-vegetarians alike.
