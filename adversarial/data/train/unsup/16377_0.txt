You know people must still be drunk when they rate this place anything over 3 stars. I'm giving it a two because of the awesome service we had from our waiter. \nThe food is pretty terrible. Don't get me wrong, there are a plethora of options here. It's just that very little of it is any good at all. As in rubbery, old, tired, barely being able to be passed off as edible food. The salad and the super sweet and sticky chicken wings were my favorites out of this delightful meal. The carving lady (must have lost her job as the cafeteria lunch lady) did me a real favor when she cut me the most anemic piece of steak. Must have been saving the rest for tomorrow's buffet. \nOnly come here if you are extremely hungry and have absolutely no concern about taste or quality.
