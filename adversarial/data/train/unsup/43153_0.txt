Our office is near here and they came by and dropped off some take out menus so we figured we would order for the whole office. Out of 11 different orders, not a single complaint! Everything was made perfectly, and the portions were a pretty good size. I had to wait a bit when picking up, and the staff offered me some mango infused water(amazing) and gave me updates on the order by my name. The environment was really cool, and the staff was more than friendly. Beach Cafe has definitely earned some new regulars!\n\nI HIGHLY recommend the big island scramble, it was so good!
