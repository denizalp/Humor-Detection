Reservations had been made for our family to have dinner in Christmas Eve in October, confirmed in November. My elderly mother looks forward to this  10 year long tradition all year long. \n     Unfortunately, upon arrival, we were informed that there was no reservation for our group. Mother begins to cry, believing she had let her family down, as she always makes the reservations. We asked the manager if there was ANYTHING that could be done and were told that they were full because it was Christmas Eve. I remember an inn that had no room once, also. \n     The good news is, we were still able to be together and have dinner as a family. Chili's, next door to Charleston's was wonderful and we dined there. I know. Chili's lacks the upscale qualities of Charleston's. However, the most important thing was that we were all together, and they understood that and helped us out. \n     The bad news, we gave mom gift cards to Charleston's for Christmas. Oh, well. It gave us all a good laugh when she said she would never go there again. \n     Updated review:\n     On Thursday of last week I received notification from Hal S. asking for my contact information so that an area partner could contact me. I left my cell number and private email address. I left that information the same day it was requested. On Friday I again sent my information. Tomorrow will be a week since I was told that I would be contacted. I have had no contact, either by phone or by email. \n     I continue to believe that there needs to be a greater emphasis on customer service. I am very disappointed.
