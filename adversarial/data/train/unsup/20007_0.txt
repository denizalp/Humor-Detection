This is some delicious midwestern fast food.  They have, or once had, the greatest fried fish sandwich with tartar sauce and grated cheddar cheese. OMG, what a treat. My compadre ordered the fish and chips, but they didn't have any malt vinegar, so he walked down to Perkin's down the street and brought back a bottle. Hilarious it was. And of course, no trip to this place is complete without a scoop of frozen custard to make sure you are good and ill.
