OK, this is sad. I went in @ 4:30 since I knew they closed early on Fridays to pick up dinner for 2.  My wife & I absolutely loved {past tense} the place.  Their Gyro plates & Gyro salads were tops!  \"WERE-tops\" I noticed their signs up with new telephone # AND later Friday hours AND Saturdays, so I asked since when?  And the very nice ladies said since we are NEW OWNERS and we want to capture more dinner customers.  They used to close late Friday afternoons for the entire weekend.  OK, good, I was encouraged.\n\nWell... I ordered two complete Gyro Dinner Plates to go.  Allow me to say to our surprise when I got the food home that:\nA} The large styrofoam dinner containers are sectioned off with main\/large area + 2 much smaller slots for sides.  What was in the main\/large area?  Nothing but totally flavorless yellow rice - did not even have a rice flavor = nothing\/nada AND pita bread.\n\nB} One of the smaller back side dish tiny pockets had the SMALLEST PORTION of Gyro Meat I've ever seen when called a Dinner Plate and it was not very flavorful. Certainly not delicious, a bit greasy AND did not by any means come close to the wonderful & crispy Gyro meats the former\/original owners had always, always served = an utter disappointment.  \n\nC} The other smaller back section pocket had hummus.  It looked like the yummy same the former owners served.  BUT, it did not taste as good by any means.  Overly oily and quite more bitter.\n\nD} The accompanying side salad container had a decent size Salad with onions, a very few greek olives, Feta, extremely razor thin cuke slices {more like shavings} and a few thinly half slices of tomato.  The salad was OK, not great.  Missing was the crispy iceberg lettuce the former owners always served and decent size pieces of cuke & tomato.  The best part of it was their still reliable dressing.\n\nSo, I don't know how else to say it BUT, this was no mistake or accident.  The meats are NO LONGER up to par or crispy-ness and, now, quite greasy.  The portion on their most expensive take out dish was so small it wouldn't fill a yoghurt cup.  And sadly the Hummus was way, way, way sub-par.\n\nThis place under the original\/former owners on a scale of 1 to 10 served \"10 Quality Foods\"\nNo one goes there for ambiance or comfort, it's for take-out or sitting at simple, old-style luncheonette type tables.  It's not uncomfortable but, no one goes there for ambiance - you used to go there for good food.  Only now, it's not.\n\nI am not one to trash a place and I won't now.  Simply, if, if, if the new owners read this and wonder why they're loosing customers, it's because they have a long, long, long way to go and significantly improve before we will ever go back.  When you pay reasonable money for good food, you are satisfied.  Here, now?  NOPE!\n\nOne can only hope they improve.  In the meantime, we'll just have to rely on the Gyro place on 92nd & Shea in the Sprouts Shopping Center... it's back up along the far right-angle of the shopping center southern end.  Their Gyros & Greek food is now, much, much better.\n\nIt's terribly sad when a local place you rely on goes south in quality literally overnight.  But, if they don't seriously improve, they will not last a year here.  Too many other good options in Scottsdale.  AND yes, the restaurant business is never easy.  It just begins and ends with quality.  Especially if you expect it.  This place was, as little as a few weeks ago, great.  Not anymore and that's sad!
