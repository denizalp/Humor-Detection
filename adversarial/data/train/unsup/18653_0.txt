When I have complaints about receptionists, it's usually because they don't seem to care or they're rude. The girls at Mountain Dental are super bubbly and helpful, borderline excessively. They did ask for my driver's license to copy, which I thought was unnecessary, but maybe that's only if you don't have insurance?\n\nMy biggest issue was with the dental assistant who took my x-rays and did the polishing. She could not, for the life of her, figure out how to get the x-rays down. A few of them she got the first time, but the vast majority took at least two or three tries, which made me very uncomfortable. She kept on talking about how I was drooling--well, duh, if you could get these x-rays down, I wouldn't be sitting here with my mouth open for forty-five minutes. \n\nThe dentist was pretty nice. He did a good job with the exam and cleaning, although I wish he wouldn't have sent his assistant to do the polishing, where she CONTINUED to talk about my drool, as if it was totally unnatural and hilarious. I did appreciate that the dentist chatted with his assistant rather than me while he was working on my teeth--I hate when dentists ask you questions when you can't respond!\n\nAlthough the location is great, I just can't shake a bad first impression. I'll go elsewhere.
