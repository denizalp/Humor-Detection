I was so excited to try Cheese to the Mac tonight at the Tega Cay Food Truck Rally. What a great name for a food truck! But.........What a disappointment! The young ladies taking orders were very friendly but that's pretty much where it ended. I ordered the Po Boy Mac & Cheese. $9 for what would have probably tasted just as good out of a box with a few not fresh fried shrimp and what was supposed to be a spicy Cajun sauce. Instead of Cajun sauce they put a sweet bbq sauce that tastes just like baby rays. And I'm pretty sure if the shrimp didn't come from the frozen section of the local grocery store than they were possibly fried this morning.  \n\nI am a huge food truck fan, but please make sure if you are going to run one you are just as qualified and reputable as a brick and mortar restaurant. If they would really take just a little time to look at what they are serving and re-evaluate, they could have a great little food truck.
