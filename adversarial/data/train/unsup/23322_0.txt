I was in the mood for pizza--not crappy, junk pizza, but a nice pie that I could sit down with and eat with a knife and fork if I wanted to.  After dropping off my wife and daughter at the movies (it was a mommy-daughter movie night), I began searching. . . \n\nVinciTorio's, right here next to the movie theatre.  Okay, let's try this.\n\nGood service, check\nOutdoor seating with those big gas heater thingies on chilly nights, check\nNice ambiance, check\nGood pizza, check\n\nKeep in mind that's just a check, and not a star for the pizza.  There was little or no sauce on this pizza, which kept me from enjoying it as much as I would have liked to.  Not a bad taste, and maybe you will like it better than I did, but I like saucy pizzas, and they don't have them here, I guess, unless you ask for them.\n\nEverything was fresh and the pizza was well-made, with a nice crust.  No issues there.  The three stars is from the pizza snob in me who wants that burst of spiced tomato taste along with the pepperoni and sausage.  Nonetheless, I ate until I was stuffed.  I'll come back some time to see how the pasta is.
