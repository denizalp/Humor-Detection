The Westin Kierland is a beautiful resort located in PHOENIX, not Scottsdale. \n\nSome close friends of mine from Canada stayed in this PHOENIX resort for a few days, so I've hung out in its rooms and generally lounged about the property. The rooms were impressive, beautifully decorated, and spacious. We especially enjoyed taking the kids out to small fire pits maintained on the grounds, where guests to our fine city of PHOENIX can roast marshmallows. \n\nThe Kierland has some tough competition, considering that the city of PHOENIX has every one of the most famous resorts in the Valley, from the Biltmore, to the Phoenician to the Royal Palms. It does pretty well in a tough line-up. No offense to Scottsdale, which also has some great resorts such as the Four Seasons. It's just that the most famous ones are in PHOENIX.\n\n[For further information, please visit: http:\/\/phoenix.gov\/BNDMAPS\/index.html]
