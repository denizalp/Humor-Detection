Reasonably priced, conveniently located, never been disappointed.\n\nI went recently and gave the guy creative freedom.  He chopped off probably 6-7 inches, so I left stunned and hesitant to like it, but cautiously optimistic.  It was a good haircut, even though it was a drastic change for me.  Regardless, I still looked okay.  However, when I restyled it the way I wanted (flipped out, not under), I LOVED it.\n\nI'll likely go back again.
