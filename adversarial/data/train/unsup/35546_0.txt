Super irritated from Boiling Crab and Hot and Juicy. Boiling crab was way too packed and Hot and Juicy had sketchy parking. My girlfriend Elly and I noticed Urban Crawfish Station and two guys were working (Raju and Kevin). They were super helpful. They were hosting, serving, food running, and bussing. Aside from the great service, the food was also amazing, with great quality and flavorful sauces. Definitely coming here more often with my girlfriend and recommend this place to anybody who enjoys seafood.
