I've died and gone to alkie heaven.\n\nI walked in & got giddy like an 8 year old at a Hannah Montana concert.  It's basically a grocery store for wine, beer & booze.  Unlike BevMo, my local fav, which is a couple aisles of wine & a decent beer selection, this is aisle after aisle after aisle of fermented grapey goodness (I think their selection of just French wines is bigger than all of BevMo's cumulative wine stock).  \n\nI found some great Spanish Riojas, a Greek Roditis, some great South American Malbecs, and a few more run-of-the-mill, yet still excellent, Zins & Shirazes (Shirii?  Shirazus?).   Their staff is knowledgeable and ever-present, so, just in case you miss their staff picks, you can track down someone to give you a pointer.  \n\nI think I ended up with 8 quality bottles for something like $90.  \n\nTheir beer selection, sadly, isn't as huge as their wine selection, but it still includes all the favs for less than normal prices (Rogue Dead Guy was something like $7.50 for a 6 pack).  \n\nI was gonna check out the booze selection, but figured I'd save it for another trip before I passed out.
