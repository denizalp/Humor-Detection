This was the best experience I've ever had from a oral surgeon. I've been putting this procedure off for 3 years and if I would have known that the experience would of went so smoothly I would of done this years ago. Dr. Bond was very professional, efficient and engaged. He made sure he answered all my questions in regards to my process. He checked on me after my procedure and answered my questions during recovery. I had additional questions later and he still followed up. I had almost no pain and minimal discomfort and I am such a big baby when it came to this process. I would recommend him for any procedure. So happy this process went so well
