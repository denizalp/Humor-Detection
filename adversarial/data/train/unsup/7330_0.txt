After reading some of these reviews, I gotta say I was expected something amazing. However, I was disappointed.\n\nI went to the lunch buffet today. I actually tried a little bit of every dish. Overall, nothing tasted bad, but nothing tasted AMAZING either (except for the aloo gobi and paneer makhani! Which is the cheese in a butter sauce; think butter chicken but with cheese instead).\n\nHowever there weren't enough good dishes that would warrant a return. In conclusion, it was disappointing.
