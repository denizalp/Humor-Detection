I would absolutely love to tell you that I discovered a gem on Thomas Road. I would love to be able to write how magnificent this place was but alas, I can't. I never got to taste anything. I never got to order anything. I walked into this dirt hole, holding my breath and tongue, and willing to order something in the hope that I could find some good Mexican food (good Mexican food is actually an oxymoron), anyway, I stood where it said \"order here.\" I stood, and stood, I looked around, it appeared there was still business being conducted. A couple were eating in a booth. Hmmm....I stood. Waiting. No one came out from the back to acknowledge me, or take my order.\n\nNow this isn't Pizzeria Bianco where if you ignore me I will wait. If you spit on me I will wipe it off and take the abuse to be able to experience the pizza. No, this is a dirty, disgusting Mexican dump situated a few feet across from an hourly motel and down the street from a strip club. This place should be lucky anyone has walked in and kiss my feet. Well, I gave up, I started to walk out and just as I was heading to the door, some \"person\" walked out from the back. I left.\n\nIf the service is that bad, I can't believe the food is going to sway me otherwise. In fact, I feel like I was saved from a case of botulism or diphtheria.
