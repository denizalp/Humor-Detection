Blueberry Hill has a lot on their menu.  You have so many options here.  There's so many choices, that it can get a bit overwhelming and that's a good thing.  I first step foot in a Blueberry Hill about 15+ years ago.  Before this week, it's been over 5 years since I dined here. Why so long between visits?  Well, it's because the wait is usually long and there's so much more breakfast options out here.  If you don't know me by now, then that's your bad.  If you do, then you know that I love eating breakfast type food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  I would eat steak & eggs 6 times a day if I could. Obviously, I recently dined here for breakfast.  Obviously, I had some form of steak and eggs.  I had their Steak Omelet, which is 6 oz. of steak, 4 eggs, and a cup of cheese.  Hash browns and pancakes is also included.  Price is perfect at around $15.  My meal was very satisfying and most importantly, filled me up for the next couple of hours.  Am I a fan?  I use to be.  There's just a lot more options out here than there was 15 years ago.  Besides, Blueberry Hill doesn't need my Yelp review to boost their sales.  The lines are still long and the restaurant is still packed.  \n\nTIP\n-Night Owls have it good with their late night specials for only $6.95.  \n-The Patty Melt was my go-to back in the day\n-Check your bill.  They still add your check via calculator.  You're one fat finger away from being overcharged.
