I have been going to this salon for years every month to see Ben before he moved out of state and would have given them 5 stars because of him. I was seeing Selina and she does a great job. However the owners are greedy and rude and I am aware my situation was not Selina's fault. I needed a small color correction - 3 foils - anywhere else this would have been taken care of to keep me as a loyal client. The original service was $175.00 for my very short bleached blond hair with a few streaks of color. So you can imagine how surprised I was when the owner handed me a bill for $50.00!! I should have complained then - but I was so shocked and her attitude made me feel very embarrassed. Please head over to Kelly Cardenas Salon for a great cut \/ color and to be treated better than great!! If you have to go this place that somehow gets away with calling itself a Paul Mitchell Salon - make sure you see Selina and expect to be treated in a condescending fashion by the owners. For some reason - they think they are better than the rest of us. They lost my chunk of money every month!!
