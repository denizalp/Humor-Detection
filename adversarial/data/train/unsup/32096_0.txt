Came here with a group of 10, 4 of us got sick. Not because of anything that was poorly cooked, but simply the amount of fat and grease used to cook the meals here is absolutely unnecessary. My stomach still hasnt settled 13 hours later. Everything is to the extreme, the sausage is too sweet, my potatoes were battered and deep fried, the bacon in my bloody mary was candied with maple syrup and brown sugar. I really enjoyed the bloody Mary, and that was definitely the highlight, but really it was just just over the top. I feel like they're going for shock factor more than actually good food. It was a heart attack on a plate. One person got the mac and cheese bacon burger, he ate the whole thing and then proceeded to spend the next 6 hours back at his hotel room nursing his stomach. My body is nowhere near used to that amount of fat and grease. I guess that's part of the novelty of the restaurant.....but unfortunately that's all it is, a novelty.
