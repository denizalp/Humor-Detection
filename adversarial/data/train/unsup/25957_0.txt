Had a good breakfast meal on Day #4 of our March Madness in Las Vegas trip with Mr. Booth, Mr. Bloewen, and Buxton.  Although Buxton was too hungover to drink, and he doesn't really eat any solid food, the others all had a meal.\n\nMr. Bloewen and I had a breakfast burrito each.  When they first came out, the first thought was, \"We both could have shared this!\"  However, it was so good, that we both ate it ourselves.  This is saying a lot, since Mr. Bloewen rarely finishes his food!  Mr. Booth made his own omelette and also seemed to enjoy it.  Best part of the meal was the $20 all you can drink mimosa's (until 2pm).  I still have no idea how we were able to drink so many of them after the prior 3 days of booze, but we did rally.  Big time...\n\nOur server was fantastic, as we never had an empty glass.  She even gave us large \"to-go\" cups for a final mimosa that took me quite a while to finally put back.\n\nI gladly will come here for breakfast next time I am in the area, and prefer this over the champagne brunch buffets.  If you check in on Yelp, they will give you an order of fried pickles or brussel sprouts.  Unfortunately, I don't like either.  But, since Boothie loves his pickles, Buxton insisted that we order a serving.  They were good, but nobody really ate them.\n\nRecommended for a breakfast \/ brunch meal!
