I have mixed feelings. On one hand I loved the decor (old house turned into a spa with pastries and wine!  I also was super relax, so they clearly did something right.  My esthetician was super sweet as well. My favorite part was NO STEAM - instead six hot towels were put on your face one after the other. I  cannot explain it, but this was VERY relaxing\n\nSo why only three stars?  I have such a big pet peeve when there is no Hand\/foot\/head massage during the mask.  My esthetician just left me in there for 15 minutes. She also came back in smelling like smoke\n\nSo - unique facial in a very warm homey atmosphere. If the esthetician had rubbed my head instead of smoking during the 15 minute mask, this would easily be a four and probably five star review.
