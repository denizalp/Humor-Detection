So far I have had a very positive experience with the Dental Health Services. It was difficult to make an appointment as no one ever picked up the phone. I then walked over as I do work close by and I immediately got an appointment schedules for the following week. I found the receptionists to be very friendly and helpful and she gave me all the necessary paperwork to fill out at home, so that everything was ready at the time of the appointment.\n\nI was seen on time by Dr Noonan and he was very nice and seemed very knowledgeable. I am pretty nervous every time I see a dentist, but particularly in a new office. He really made me feel at ease. Because it was my first time, X-Rays were taken and then we discussed on what had to be done etc.\n\nI then came in for a cleaning and was seen by Gene. She was super friendly as well and did a really good job with the cleaning. I haven't had anything else done, so I am not sure how good they are overall, but for now I am happy with the service they provide.
