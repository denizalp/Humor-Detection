I was excited to try this place due to the great reviews and I was not disappointed! The drinks were excellent, the poutine was heavenly, and though my lamb was a tad under seasoned, my husband's steak was amazing!!! Our server was amazingly attentive and so nice. He treated us like royalty. After tip it cost about $150 For the 2 of us to eat, so it may be reserved for special occasions only but it is my new favorite restaurant in phoenix!!!!
