I would give five stars. ..but I usually do carry out service here which is fantastic.  Amazing food and the cashier is so friendly and goes above and beyond. However with dining in experience the service I've had has always just been average and the prices are very high. Great upscale sports bar for the guys to take their ladies if they want something nicer than your typical bdubs experience.
