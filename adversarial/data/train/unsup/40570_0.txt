We have been here a few times and were happy with the food but I was looking for the best pizza at the time and what we had wasn't it. Tonight changed that. Not only do they have shrimp available for the pizza but it was thin and scrumptious! :) Apparently the last time the pizza wasn't as thin as it was supposed to be. Thankfully we tried again. We have always been happy with the pasta options, but the pizza was a deal breaker. I am looking forward to our next visit.
