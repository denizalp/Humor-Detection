This could have been a home run.\nMy friends and I got many different things so we could share. \nLoved the oxtail fries. \nReally liked the wings - wished they had more heat.\nAlso liked the duck filled steamed buns. \nAbsolutely hated the James beard award winning lamb burger - one bite and I couldn't eat anymore. It was terrible! \nI would have given them a higher rating had it not been for that burger. \n\nOh, and my 8 and 12 year olds wanted their burgers medium. Not medium well or medium rare, just medium. \nThey made me sign a release of liability in order to have the burgers cooked that way. Apparently they require it for all kids unless you order medium well or well done. That was a first, a really bizarre first.
