I am not sure where to even start with this place! I have been to several Charlie's through out the U.S. and Charlie's of Las Vegas was a huge let down. I expected more from being Las Vegas. Not only was the crowd a bit weird, the bar tender was completely inattentive. He was more concerned talking to a topless male than making our drinks and messed up the order all together. No music was being played, there was a drag show that well left a lot to be desired. Las Vegas gay clubs are a disappointment. It's sad!
