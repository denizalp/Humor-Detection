Ahh, I don't even know where to start with this restaurant. My friends and I came to Vegas to celebrate a birthday and she had one request, Brazilian steakhouse birthday dinner. We found this place and we were not disappointed. We were a little late for our reservation and all of the staff were so accommodating and friendly as soon as we arrived. Jose took such great care of us, explaining the menu, the different selections, how it worked as it was our first time and went out of his way to find our choices of meat when we hadn't gotten them yet. He and all of the staff were so attentive! Ugh, and the food. We tried everything and it was so amazing. Stand outs were the top sirloin, filet mignon, parmesan crusted pork loin and the lamb chops. It was all so delicious and we were so full. They knew we were celebrating a birthday and gave the birthday girl a complimentary dessert of her choice (there are a lot of desserts to choose from!) The staff made sure this was a night we would never forget and we cannot wait until the one back home in Washington opens, we'll be the first in line!\n\nOur only confusion was this waiter who walked around with a huge shrimp cocktail but never did anything with it lol It didn't effect our night at all, but it was entertaining watching him walk around. Please explain lol
