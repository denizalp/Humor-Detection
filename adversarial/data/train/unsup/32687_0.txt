Stopped by here late on a Sunday night to get some food. Driving in I wasn't expecting much, but sometimes the dirtiest girl can turn out to be a prize.\n\nMake no mistake: this is a dive bar through and through. From the outdated everything inside, to the hidden parking behind the building. \n\nThat being said, there were really two things that stood out to me for the short time I was there: the enclosed smoking area and the food.  The smoking area IS a patio, but it is connected to the bar by a roll up garage door, and there is cover and ventilation that make it feel like you are inside. The ventilation pulls the smoke out and keeps the bar from getting a smoke smell throughout. Very cool for those of us who hate being relegated to the alley to smoke under the current smoking laws.\n\nThe food here was absolutely fantastic. The wings were 9\/10 in both flavors we had (hot and honey hot), the pizza was tasty and made from very high quality ingredients (thick hand tossed crust that is crispy where it counts and light and airy inside). The burgers also looked to be on fresh artisan type buns and my friend who had one said it was outstanding. \n\nAll in all, if you like dive bars it's worth a look, especially if you are looking for late at night.
