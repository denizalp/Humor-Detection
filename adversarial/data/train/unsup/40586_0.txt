My first 5\/5 review ever!\nEverything was superb! The service was quick, effecienr, and attentive...we were checked on by our own waitress and another member of staff: it was convenient yet non-disturptive. \nThe food was excellent. I was starving and our group ordered a decent variety: no one had 1 negative opinion of anything. The flavours were awesome and delicious. There is enough room between tables to have some privacy.\nOverall, amazing experience and we WILL be back. Thank you to the staff and chef!\nParking is a struggle but if you show up for Happy Hour, there is plenty of close street parking!
