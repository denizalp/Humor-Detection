Thanks to another yelper I tried this place as I frequent places next door. I usually go to a competitor but I decided to try. Quest bars are limited in quantity but they are the best price! They have all the products I need and they don't push a generic store brand which is nice\nAnthony is very helpful, looked up a product for me they don't carry and found me the components of that product. He always gives a smile and is quite patient with questions. Very amicable and knowledgeable\nNot saying I will totally abandon what I get at the other store but I will definitely frequent this one....
