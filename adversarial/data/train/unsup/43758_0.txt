Apparently this is the place to be on a Friday night in Gilbert because it was packed by 6:00pm. To my surprise, that didn't affect the service; our waitress was friendly, attentive and ready to serve! The service is 5 star, but the food we ordered was 3.75 stars. \nWe had a dz wings (honey hot grilled) that probably wouldve been better if we opted for the non grilled version. The grilled version was dry and OVER charred. In addition, the wings are on the smaller size. I'm used to ATL wings in Chandler...\nOn the bright side, we liked the calamari we ordered and noticed all the food at other tables looked VERY appetizing!\nWill I return? YES! A place that crowded can't be doing everything mediocre.
