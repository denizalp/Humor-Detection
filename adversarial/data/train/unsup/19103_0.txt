Rented an economy car for 4 days and only paid $8\/day. We didn't purchase car insurance since my fiance has it included in his auto policy so the total including taxes was $55. \n\nWhen we got there, we found out that we couldn't charge it to my fiance's card thus we had to use mine. I didn't have rental car insurance included on my auto insurance policy so being that I was going to be the primary driver and the rental was in my name, we had to purchase insurance from Enterprise. Now the total went up to $230. Boo. \n\nThe person at the counter was trying to sell us to upgrade to a midsize but I declined. Good thing I did because the person in the garage gave us the upgrade for free. Boo to the guy at the counter. \n\nSo in the end, we paid $8\/day for a midsize car but paid $36\/day for insurance.
