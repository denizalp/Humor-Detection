The customer service has no integrity.\nThe receptionist has a major attitude and is super rude to people who call about concerns on the job.\nThere are like over 10 NEGATIVE reviews on http:\/\/www.complaints.com\/directory\/2004\/november\/11\/38.htm\n\nShe said bubbles in tinting would go away within time and the tinting would lighten, but its been over 2 years and the bubbles are still there. After a few weeks, I said the bubbles were still there and SHE became irrate and said the job was good enough and it would cost me money to have it removed and then i would have to pay again to get it re-tinted.\n\nWhen I told her the tinting was too dark and I couldnt see out the windows at night when I was reversing, she said it was my fault because I picked the tinting and its not her job to correct me by telling me I wouldnt be able to see at night. She began to raise her voice at me and give me attitude like a teenager and I was absolutely disgusted as I'm like 8 years younger than her, and have a better character and attitude, AND I'm the one being mistreated. She had no justification to speak to me like that.\n\nIts true they are super cheap, but thats because they're not running a quality service business.  Better to pay a few bucks extra and go to another location
