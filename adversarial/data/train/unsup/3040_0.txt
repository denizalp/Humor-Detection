Not a 5 Star. Not even close. \n\nThe Wynn Pool gives you a multiple choice of pain:\nLay in the shade at the pool. \nPay $100 for your pool chair in the sun. \nForcefully ask you to read the fine print when you don't understand their pool rental policies. \n\nIf you want to enjoy the Wynn, then stroll through the lobby, eat the buffet, and then head back to the Four Seasons.
