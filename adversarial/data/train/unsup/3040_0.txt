This was the first time coming to this establishment. And I was not disappointed! Chicken and biscuit breakfast was fantastic. My daughter has been begging to go here so I had to buy her lunch and bring it to her school, Surprise!!!! Needless to say she was excited. The food arrived fast like it should. I went in to order, place was clean, help was friendly and the girl behind counter recommended there signature sauce which was great. What more could I ask for.
