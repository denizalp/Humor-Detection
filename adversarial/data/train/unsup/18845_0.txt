FINALLY! I was able to stop procrastinating and try Pinches Tacos! I've obviously been missing out because my most recent visit was amazing! I came here this past weekend anticipating happy hour however the nail salon across the way took longer than expected. No biggie! Hungry as I was I still wanted some tacos! After drooling over all the pictures on Yelp my cousin and I finally arrived. The open kitchen conept is pretty dope because you can actually look inside and see them prepare your food. Everything made FRESH from SCRATCH! Thank you taco God's! The bar has this cool indoor outdoor set up and that's what seemed most appropriate for this occasion thanks to the beautiful weather. When you choose to sit in the patio your bartender is also your server. I wish I could remember her name but the amount of margaritas I had kind of umm clogged my memory ha! BUT what I will say is that she was awesome and made some strong recommendations for us being that we were newbies. Happy hour was over but we still rolled with the tacos and margaritas! Oh let me tell you though, these weren't your typical wimpy pre-mix tasting cheap tasting margaritas by far. The pour wasn't stingy at ALL and they tasted great! The street tacos were a good size and I was blown away with the bursting flavors. All in all this place rocks! I WILL be back to make it for happy hour!
