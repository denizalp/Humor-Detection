Other than being very far out of town this place was great. There are guards that you check in with at the parking lot who were friendly and making jokes. I only waited about 10 minutes in line and then the woman who helped me was friendly and efficient. \nI was really dreading going but was pleasantly surprised.  I went Friday right before they closed.
