I love boiling crab! I have been a loyal customer since '07 at the one in Alhambra! Never a bad experience until tonight! I got my usual whole shabang medium shrimp and really disappointed in the quality. The skin on the shrimp was sticking to the shrimp and the sauce??? The sauce was missing in action!!! I usually have enough to pour on my rice but I couldn't get anything flowing out of the bag. So I asked the waitress, \"hey, is there anyway I can get a side of sauce?\" She was like \"yeah okay but it's extra\" and I told her I have been coming to this one since it opened and it's the first time I can't get anything out of the bag and even the ones in LA aren't so lacking in sauces and she said that they follow the guidelines and basically it is what it is. I thought that was rude but you know I'm just never going to come to this one again and stay true to the ones in LA! Problem solved. So finally after I had peeled my whole pound of shrimp my sauce finally came, I was starving and couldn't really wait but I didn't really enjoy it as much as I usually do. \n\nPS. It is my birthday today.
