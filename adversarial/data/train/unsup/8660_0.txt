The person is just plain rude. She was yelling at me for my asking what's her average price for a hair length and texture like mine. wanting to estimate your cost prior to getting the service is something you should not ask for? She went on this rant about how she needs to see me in person to know the price without letting me putting a word in, and went on hang up the phone right after she finished. I don't know how good you are, yet what you're doing is basically shooing people away from your business.
