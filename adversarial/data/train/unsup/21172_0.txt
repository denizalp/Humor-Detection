This is one of my favorite places to get Chinese food on campus! They are really fast and the food is delicious. The owners are extremely nice and accommodating and best of all, the food is very inexpensive. Every time family comes into town or I have friends over, we make our way to cravings for a great meal. You order at the counter and they call your number when you food is ready and all you do is go and pick it up yourself. No fuss dining. There is also free water, hot tea and plastic utensils in the front - server yourself.\n\nHere are some dishes I love:\n-spicy fried chili chicken: fried chicken pieces that are stir fried with scallions, spicy chili and sweet yellow onions (spicy and delicious! - all time fav!)\n\n-salt an pepper squid: fried strips of squid stir fried with green peppers and onions (crispy and irresistible)\n\n-masala fish: battered fish stir fried with masala spice and veggies\n\n-eggplant with ground pork: the eggplant is soft and tender, which is well balanced with the rice ground pork\n-pork belly\n-clams with black bean sauce\n-mapo tofu\n\nThe staff is super friendly and have great recommendations if you're not sure what to get. Overall, great food! This place gets packed pretty quickly so make sure you snag a table!
