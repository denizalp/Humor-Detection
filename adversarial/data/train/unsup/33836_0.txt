I wasn't expecting much from this show going in, but it was amazing.  We had really low seats sec 103 row G.  It was great to see all action up close.  We got  covered by the sheet, but it only last a minute.  \n\nI have to rate this Cirque better than O.   The music is a big plus if your a Beatles fan.  If you into typical CdS, this is not the show,  for you.\n\nIt was really good, and I highly recommend it.
