What the fuck! Where did this place spring from?\n\nAlways surprised at how much I have yet to discover in my own area let alone the whole of Toronto.\n\nDo not remember much about this club apart from the barmaids all being gifted in the chest department. \n\nThe first time I went I did not really enjoy it, being it was a Saturday night it consisted of hiphop wanna bes and Princess wanna bes.\n\nHowever went there on a Thursday night for the FCUK fashion show after party and the crowd was much nicer. Music was also good, some house which slowly made its way to the commercial RnB.\n\nWhat got me was the politeness of the staff and the front door security and management but I suppose if a big retailer is throwing an after party and bottle service that a bit of ass kissing is a must. For that one extra star for what should be normal service to normal patrons.
