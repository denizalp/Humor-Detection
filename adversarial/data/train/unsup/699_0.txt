Holy Borracho! \nI was able to convince my husband to come here for dinner (during rush hour, on a Friday) instead of our usual San Tan Brewery. \nHe is thanking me BTW. \nWe started off with drinks (per usual) I ordered the blackberry house margarita with muddled jalapeño (per my request) and it's a House-made purée because of course I asked.. because it was absolutely delicious. No funky after taste or hint of chemical, it was a fresh margarita and I am impressed. \nFor appetizer, we chose the chicka-rones which is a classic spin on the fried pork skin but instead it's chicken skin fried.... don't wanna know the calorie count on that but trust me, the plate was clean. \nEvery taco was different and we ordered 7 total. My favorite was the AVO.. fried avocado with a crispy cheese taco shell and cucumbers to balance the heaviness of cheese and avocado. Gosh, great food and service. \nPlotting our return..
