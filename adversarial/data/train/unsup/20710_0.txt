I think this place has been hyped up too much due to the visual experience and not what you're there for...dinner! Food was not average and service was subpar. After our waiter \"suggesting\" more food to order. (Really not a classy move) I ordered the short rib stroganoff and it tasted like a pot roast. Huge disappointment! I told my server about my food and he just decided to bring out the steak tartare as peace offering. I don't have any desire to eat raw meat. Frankly I didn't even know he what he brought me. You can't just throw tartare in front of somebody and expect them to be happy. That's complete BS! My wife was so upset with our time there she was almost in tears. I really think they bank on the sideshow entertainment to draw your attention away from the crumby food. Don't waste your time here!
