I went to this BigO for my wheels balancing and alignment. I have a Range Rover that I put custom 22\" wheels on, and had issues with them shaking at 40+ mph. After trying to balance them 2 times, I finally spoke with Chuck who was fantastic. He let me know that with my size rims I would need to go to a different shop with a forced variance machine. It was so refreshing to finally get an honest opinion - very hard to find. I would have given 5 stars had I dealt with Chuck from the get go. Make sure to ask for Chuck - honest guy that will get you the right solution instead of trying to sell you.
