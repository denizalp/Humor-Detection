The service is great. Unless you come on a game night. Or your friend asks the waitress for her phone number.\n\nThe food is fab. And by \"food\" I mean wings. Nothing else counts. That's why I can't really dock them for having shrunken, misshapen potato wedges, watery coleslaw, bare bones ribs or tasteless nacho chips. It's a wing joint. It would be like docking points from a pizza joint for having a dried up hamburger. Check the sign, buddy. If it says \"Buffalo Wild Wings\", then chances are that's the only safe food to eat.\n\nThe atmosphere is dull and lifeless. Unless there's a game going on. And then there's too much atmosphere. If you're lucky the screams and cheers of the other diners will drown out the fact that your food is like a half an hour late and your sprite needs a refill.\n\nThe price is appalling. Unless it's a Wing Tuesday or Boneless Thursday. In which case it's only semi-appalling, if you have no bones with paying extra for a cup of ranch or bleu cheese. Look, not to be a pain in the ass, but you have vats of them in the back. Maybe if you had a little man sitting there in the back heaving and hoeing to pump that artery-clogging goodness in its tiny plastic cups, then I wouldn't mind so much. But I shouldn't have to pay an extra 50 cents because you can't afford to offer 40 cent wings or 50 cent legs three times a week. Take a fucking economics class, you bum.
