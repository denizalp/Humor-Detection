Cleaner, more open vibe since the remodel.  I missed the large, cozy booths but quickly forgot about this once food arrived.  Veggie fricassee was flavorable and special.  Dining companion claims his steak was savory, cooked to Medium as ordered.  Best fried cheese curds of my life, paired well with the aioli sauce.  Waitstaff was attentive despite a dining room busy with St Patrick's Day revelers.  Will definitely come again.
