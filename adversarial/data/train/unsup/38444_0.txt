The guys came out & cleaned my sofa & did a good job. They texted me when they were on the way, which I really appreciated since I had an 8a-10a Time slot. Super nice, cleaned up after themselves, very pleased w\/the customer service. Couches looked good as new, even after drying, however the smell, I'm embarrassed to say from my dogs, was back after the couch dried. I would still recommend them, based on the technicians customer service skills, the outward appearance of the couches & the clean up. Some stuff can't be helped.
