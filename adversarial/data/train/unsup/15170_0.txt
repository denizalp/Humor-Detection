The most important thing to note if you come here: bring cash. If you forget rule #1, there is a Wells Fargo just a couple minutes away. Yes, I forgot my own rule yesterday and had to run to the ATM. #embarrassing\n\nThis Farmer's Market is open April through September on Tuesday, Fridays and Saturdays. It's open the entire month of October with Fall stuff like pumpkins. End of November through December.... Christmas trees and wreaths.  \n\nPlants, flowers, eggs, meats, honey... a ton of different items here. Yes, there's a lot of local produce. They also ship in items... so pay attention to the signs and what you're buying. You know, so you're not telling your friends you bought a locally grown pineapple... :) \n\nGood selection and cheap. Items like peppers are such a good deal here. Whenever I make stuffed peppers, I refuse to go anywhere else. \n\nShop local! I love having this option so close and convenient to my 'hood.
