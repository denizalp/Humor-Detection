I don't like the idea of a taxi picking me up from my residence and then taking me to the airport, since then they'd know exactly where I live and the fact that I'm going to be away from my home for a significant portion of time. Basically, I'm a paranoid person. And since my flights are regularly delayed, I hate relying on someone else to drop me off and then pick me up from the airport, especially when I don't know what time I'm actually landing. The resolution? Use the economy lot at LAS. The area seems relatively safe. I'm not sure if it's regularly security patrolled, but at least the shuttles are driving around the area often enough and keeping their eyes peeled. The charge is $10\/day that can be paid by either cash or card upon exit. Do yourself a favor and remember the lot area you are at since the shuttle taking you to the airport will ask you and you know where to go to get your car later. It's always a good idea to take a photo of the lot area and the blurred # on the ground if you can. The shuttles come pretty frequently to take you to the airport, but they can fill-up and the shuttle drivers will not allow anyone to stand inside the shuttle. Have a couple of bucks handy to tip the driver, especially if they are loading luggage in the back for you. I haven't had an issue with luggage being taken by someone else, but again, I'm a paranoid person who puts a bunch of ridiculous things on their luggage to distinguish it from anyone else's luggage then peers out the window as people leave to make sure they didn't take my luggage. The only time I don't like parking out here is over the summer, when the sun is beaming down hard, so I'll make my way to regular and expensive covered parking ($14\/day). During the holidays and other peak travelling times, spaces may be hard to come by, so prepare to drive towards the end of the lot to find vacancies.
