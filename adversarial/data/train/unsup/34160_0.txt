We went to Diego Pops for dinner on Sunday night. The vibe is young and fun, the decor is a little retro, and they played great music all night.\n\nThe food was good and not heavy. We ordered the brussels sprout nachos and chicken enchiladas to start and then I ordered the fish taco bowl with quinoa. The bowl is big and after the apps and few margaritas, I could barely make a dent in the bowl. I think the classic taco is the better way to go unless you're starving.\n\nFood and drinks were great, price was right, and loved the outdoor ambiance. Will definitely come back on my next trip to AZ!
