It was good, nothing special. We wanted to go and check what's good about Chipotle and we felt a little bit dissapointed. The food is great if you compare it to some other Mexican food franchises but it's just OK food overall. If I was visiting the area, I would definitely come back. Just a tip: avoid the weekends if you don't like to wait in line for at least 10 minutes; the place is packed.
