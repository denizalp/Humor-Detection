I was super frustrated that I was asked to send examples of pictures I really liked and told Christina what parts of my body I really love only to have her continually put me in unflattering positions that didn't emphasize the things I like and that we had discussed. I would really recommend she consider doing different positions with women based on them and not having a set idea of poses that she more likely than not puts everyone in. After about 2 hours of taking pictures I walked away with only 5 pictures that I actually liked. This is an expensive venture and I wish I had walked away wanting to do it again.
