We stayed here fearing the worst due to it being a cheaper hotel and the reviews not being as stunning as some of the others. It honestly was pretty great. \n\nLet's put it this way. On a normal day you would stay here and think it's fantastic. However, if you have stayed in other flashier hotels in Vegas with bigger rooms, then you will think this place is crap. \n\nIt is a little outdated, but the rooms are still large enough and the service is top notch. We came to Las Vegas last minute and didn't want to spend $300 bucks a night, so we stayed here. \n\nOverall, it's a nice little place and is not as horrible as some might make it seem. Still, if you can get one of the nicer hotels like the Venetian at a great price, I would stay there.
