BEWARE: Do NOT go to this location. Decided to give this new one a shot because I had a great experience at the Queen St express location. \n\nWe were the only customers there at it was before the lunch rush and only my food came out, not my boyfriends. After waiting another 20 minutes,  it still had not come out and I had finished my food already (which was not great by the way-lentil soup had no flavour and was room temp) They had forgotten to make his falafel laffa-which is baffling since there were at least 12-15 staff members working. They promised to remake it and FORGOT again, to make the laffa. I am not kidding here. \n\nAnd to top it off-My boyfriend asked for a refund at this point which ended up taking 7 minutes! \n\nThe staff and owner are completely incompetent and like they have no interest in doing much of anything. Customer service FAIL. will not be returning here and highly recommend none of you do either! I would give this place 0 stars but 1 is the lowest I could give.
