Which steakhouse is better: BLT, Del Frisco's or Capital Grille (of my 3 Charlotte favorites)?  It depends; they each have their own distinct differences (not a cop out answer, I promise).  BLT gets 4.5 stars, rounding up to 5 for: fabulous ambience, stellar service, and delectable food. \n\nFABULOUS AMBIENCE. BLT is inside the Ritz Carlton in Uptown and takes a trendy, modern twist on traditional steakhouses.  The ceilings are really high, which does amplify sound and makes hearing a little difficult but is aesthetically grand.  The dining room is bright, without the standard white linen table cloths, another break from dark traditional steakhouses.  \n\nThe main downfall is the dining area is small so you're a lot closer to other patrons, which can feel cramped and be distracting, especially if you're seated in the half booths along the back wall.  We have been twice; the first time we sat along the wall where we felt crammed in like sardines, the second, we were seated in the middle near the center flower arrangement (much better).  \n\nSTELLAR SERVICE. It's the Ritz; they lived up to their reputation of excellence.  We made the mistake of coming during Restaurant Week (\"RW\") the first time that we came (we didn't order from the limited RW menu so we didn't reap any RW benefits) and the restaurant was packed to capacity.  Regardless, the service was as courteous, prompt and attentive as when we came the second time on a Thursday evening.  The only difference is that we weren't served the delicious chicken patè during the RW visit.  Both times, the maitre d' appeared to ask about our dining experience, a hallmark of stupendous service because they are prepared to proudly stand behind their cuisine and service.  For those of you who have unsavory experiences, I encourage you to voice them; they will do what they can to remediate your negative impression. That's how they maintain their brand.\n\nDELECTABLE FOOD. Overall, the cuisine is marvelous and worth the hefty price tag.  We've had: \n_________ALCOHOL.  Heavy alcohol pour on both our Moscow Mule and my custom concoction. \n_________DIVINE.  \n++ yellowtail hamachi. The yellowtail is fresh, perfectly thinly sliced and served on a lemony bed of fresh avocado mixed with a ponzu sauce.  The combination of the buttery from the avocado and the sweetness from the yellowtail and lemony undertone is foodgasmic; one of my all-time favorite dishes. \n++ bone-in ribeye. They serve their steaks on a skillet along with a garlic flower (I like to spread it over my steak) and a sauce of your choice (the BLT signature sauce mixed with the herbed butter is Uh-mazing).  The beef is tender, juicy and definitely remarkably savory.  The first time we came, our server told us that they don't carry A1 (killjoy for my BF) so we brought our own the second time.  Our second server, bemused by our adamance, informed us that they can get it from the Ritz side next time we come (phew!  Because spilling A1 in my purse would suck!).  \n___________REALLY GOOD. \n++ complimentary chicken patè. It's very dense and flavorful, the saltiness is meant to be dispersed onto the bread underneath.  My BF doesn't usually like patè but enjoyed it here. \n++ Caesar salad.  The dressing is the perfect blend of creaminess, lemony with a hint of anchovies. The freshly grated cheese adds the perfect layer of saltiness. \n++ crab and apple salad.  The sweetness of the fresh crab meat goes well with the semi-sweet tanginess of the vinaigrette and tartness from the apples.  \n++ shrimp cocktail. The succulent shrimps are fresh and the cocktail sauce has the perfect flavorful kick to it.  \n++ oysters. They melt in your mouth like butter and are very fresh without the briny after taste.  \n____________PASS. \n++ complimentary popovers.  I don't like them in general;  I prefer traditional bread.  \n\nDIFFERENCES. Each national chain has its idiosyncratic flair and is good for different reasons.  It really boils down to how you like your steak prepared and what kind of ambience you are seeking. Personally, I like CG for its idyllic patio and lobster bisque; BLT for its yellowtail hamachi and garlic flower\/herbed butter\/BLT special sauce combo; and DF for its marinated and super tender steak.  \nBLT. Trendy upscale contemporary twist; has a fusion undertone; steak served on a skillet, has garlic flower, herbed butter and delicious steak sauce. Pre-dinner popovers and chicken patè.  No patio. \nDel Frisco's.  More traditional upscale; has French influence; steak is thoroughly marinated and served with outside layer of seasoning. Pre-dinner sesame bread. Patio seems like an after thought.\nCapital Grille.  More casual traditional country club vibe; steak is marinated but served bare. Pre-dinner bread basket. I love the patio there. \n\nOverall, if you're looking for a special occasion venue in Charlotte, the dining experience is commensurate to the price. You do get what you pay for, which is a memorable and delicious meal at the Ritz.
