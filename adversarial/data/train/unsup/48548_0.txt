Delicious food with lots of options to choose from.  Several cold bars.  Several hot bars.  Sushi.  It's all here.  Don't let the older sopping center deter you, the inside has been completely remodeled and is in great condition.  I stop by occasionally and pick up a to go box. I can grab a protein and some veg for a really good price.  Charged by the weight of course.\n\nI will say, the multiple prices for to go boxes based on the type of protein is a bit off-putting.  Its like a game of whack a mole.  You see a food item you like, then you see the little plackard that denotes it is a premium item and is going to make your price go up.  Sigh.
