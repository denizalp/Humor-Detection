A great clean shopping environment. A few of my stores caught my eye not by their brand but their decoration. They have a organize directory like most malls and the food court is like HEAVEN(comparing to New York - New Yorker here).\n \nWe came on a Saturday morning and parking was $8 for the day which was not bad. We even had a chance to walk to City hall area (approximately 15 minutes walk). We tried not to go in the stores since we basically have most of products in New York and it wouldn't be worth it since Canada's taxes are double. Our focus became what to eat for brunch in Eaton Centre food court. Their was so many varieties and they weren't all fast food. Their food court was so big and clean it was just amazing. It made me think to myself I wouldn't mind living in Toronto and coming here everyday! Would come back for sure c(;\n\n(Only con side was around 2-3 it became extremely crowded. Bathrooms was not as clean)
