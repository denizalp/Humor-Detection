My technician was friendly but was pretty sloppy with the manicure. I asked for some of my nails to be trimmed and she cut them all pretty short. The Polish was applied sloppily as well. When she took me to the nail drying area, she left me there without the fan on. They have UV lights in the drying area and because I was moving my hands around in there, I burned my hand by touching the bulb and smudged both of my thumbs. Another technician who was much better fixed my smudges. I think this place is hit or miss, depending on the tech. The guy at the front taking appointments was also kind of rude. I don't think I'll be coming back here.
