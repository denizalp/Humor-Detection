I needed service on my dryer. No one answers your phone so I had to leave messages. I contacted you because of your good ratings but not returning a call is bad service.  I contacted a competitor of yours who called me back AND kept me informed of when he would be here. Now that's great service.  I do not like writing negative reviews but nothing upsets me more than to leave a message and no one can take the time to call back.
