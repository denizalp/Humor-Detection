While waiting for Park on Fremont to open, I decided to stop by the Downtown Container Park which was nearby to check it out because it looked like a cool place to hangout for a little bit.  Going inside, the park is a lot smaller than I thought, but I was pretty amazed how they made this place out of shipping containers.\n\nUnfortunately, I was there a little too early since all the shops and restaurants were still closed and I didn't get to see the flames shooting out from the antennae of the giant mantis sculpture which I think is pretty awesome!\n\nI wouldn't mind coming back here again though to check out the food spots and especially to see the place shine at night.  It's a pretty awesome concept and it's great to see something like this built to have more visitors on the east side of Fremont Street.
