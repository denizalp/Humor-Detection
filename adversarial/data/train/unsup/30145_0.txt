I work in the service industry and am very understanding of service mishaps, but this was really really bad. I arrived and sat at the bar for 10mins before receiving a menu, and finally had to ask for one... whatever they were busy. Then ordered a side, and waited for over 20mins for it, reminded the bartender, because maybe he forgot, turns out he did forget, (but didn't communicate that to me).Okay, stuff happens, then waited another 25 mins for my side that I now ordered 45mins ago, now I'm getting concerned and ask for a manager. The manager, Calvin, goes back to the kitchen and brings me a sandwich that I did not order. I tell him that's not what I ordered and even if it was 45 mins is a really long time to wait for a sandwich, let alone a side, which is what I actually ordered. He then begins to argue with me that the ticket time was 25 mins, okay Calvin. Firstly as a manager you never argue with the customer. Secondly, if you had talked to your bartender you would have realized that he had forgotten to ring in my side then in the 20 mins between when I had ordered and he actually put the order in, he had forgotten and put the wrong order in. We then decide at this point, it's time to leave. The bartender apologized for his mistakes, the manager did not.  I give them a  0 for customer service and restaurant management. A pity really because I was really excited about the concept of this place. I will never go there again or recommend them to anyone. This was literally the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. I've also never written a review before. So thank you Calvin, for making me feel the need to download trip adviser to alert people of your terrible customer service.
