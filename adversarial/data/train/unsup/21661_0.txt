I have yet to eat here but always make it a point to stop by each trip to have at least one drink.  They are always handing out 2 for 1 drink coupons outside the restaurant or right outside the casino.  Make sure to grab one.  The rum concoctions are good, the atmosphere is enjoyable, and they have live music sometimes.  There are flair bartenders so if thats your thing and you like seeing them spin the bottle around 22 times before they pour it into your glass then you will probably enjoy this place.  When they do their full bar show everyone gets free, fruity shots that don't quite taste like alcohol, but whatever it's free.  Its a good time to sit back and enjoy a drink.
