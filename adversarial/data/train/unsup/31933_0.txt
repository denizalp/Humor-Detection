Awesome service! I was nervous to have someone come to my home and clean my carpet, however, my nerves were put at ease within 5 minutes of him being here. I have two toddler boys who are very active and well my carpet shows it :) The gentleman that was very professional, he took pride in his work and paid attention to detail. He did his walk through and explained what he will do and how long it will take etc.  I was very satisfied with his customer service and the outcome. My carpet (stairs, 4 rooms) look good as new! I am very pleased with his work and would definitely recommend Clean Genie to everyone I know! \n\nPS - Not to mentioned great price= great value!\n\nThank you Clean Genie!!!!
