I called  tru cab and was pleasantly surprised. I don't take cabs very often but was told 20 minutes and they showed up in 20 min . Driver was polite and respectful . Told him where to go and asked me which route I preferred . In other words he wasn't going to long haul me for a better fare. It's nice too see a company actually trying for customer service . Thank goodness. Will use again if needed .
