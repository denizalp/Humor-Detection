I had never eaten at an Old Spaghetti Factory until our recent visit. I walked by the Ward Warehouse location countless times, but never went in. The better half decided we should give the new location a go for her birthday, so we headed over for an early weekend dinner. It was all nostalgia for everyone else of our party with stories of birthday parties and dinners with friends. We added another memory to that list.\n\nLocated in Aloha Tower Marketplace, it's great to see businesses returning to the mall by the harbor. Parking is validated free for 1 hour only in either of the surface lots or inside the pier. It's affordable after that, but not free.  The restaurant can be seen easily; the host stand is through the main doors. Note they have a lanai, which is shaded by an awning and tall trees. We opted to sit inside and decided on a trolley booth! The restaurant feels very new and clean. The restrooms were also very nice.\n\nThe menu was fun. In my mind's eye, I didn't realize how casual and fun the place and food is. Almost every dish includes a soup or salad, house bread, and ice cream. Most dishes are under $15 with appetizers under $10. We had the cheese bread to start which included marinara for dipping. The quality of certain items leave space to be desired: the salad is just an iceberg mix (although the house pesto dressing is delicious), and the house bread tasted liked playdoh and was not remotely good (I personally always love a side of bread, so this was disappointing). I ordered the Vesuvius and was delighted that it was actually spicy and flavorful. We were all happy with our main dishes and took some to-go. The dessert was a scoop of spumoni or vanilla ice cream, or an upgrade to a brownie. I never had spumoni before and loved the combination of flavors: chocolate, pistachio, and cherry. \n\nThe total bill was cheap, we had fun, and enjoyed our food, so we'd definitely return! It seemed like a great place for big groups as well.
