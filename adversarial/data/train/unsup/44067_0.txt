I've always loved The Body Shop products.  They are mostly \"natural\", they use high quality ingredients, and they seem to avoid ingredients found to be health hazardous.  Their lip balms are petroleum free (who wants to rub that crap on your lips?), and they use organic ingredients in many of their products.  It's a bit pricey (nothing compared to the dept. store brands, though), but the quality is worth it.\n\nI'm partial to their sweet lemon line - mmm... The tea tree line is great for those of us not blessed with porcelain skin, and all the body butters are pretty dern awesome.  They offer all kinds of lotions, salves, lip balms, anything body-cleansing related (hair and skin), massage oils, and makeup.  Their wooden brush are fantastic for long, thick hair like mine.\n\nMy favorite thing about The Body Shop, and the reason that I've been shopping there for years, is that they really focus on supporting underprivileged workers around the world by becoming business partners with groups in areas that provide key useful ingredients and encouraging entrepreneurship by helping local groups - often women organized - to develop their industry and manufacture ingredients that The Body Shop then uses in their products.  I'm all for that!  \n\nAt this location (like most), I've never found the service to be anything other than kind and friendly.  If you're price conscious, shop their post-holiday sales for great prices on great products.
