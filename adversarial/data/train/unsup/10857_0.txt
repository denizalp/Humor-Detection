Named in honour of  \"Joe Beef\" McKiernan,  Joe Beef  has been voted Canada's best restaurant. Its owned by  two of Canada's most influential chefs,  David McMillan & Frédéric Morin. The menu is written on a black board and the waiting staff is more than happy to explain every dish to you. The ingredients are Québécois and Canadian but the wine list is French. Had to book a table six weeks in advance and it was So worth it. The food is top notch. We started with their home brewed Joe Beef pilsner. For entrees we ordered the Oysters & the Foie gras double down. The oysters were ok. The FGDD was f'in amazing. One of the best foie gras dishes I've ever had. For main we ordered the Lobster spaghetti & Horse steak. The Lobster spaghetti was really great, Perfectly cooked in a creamy sauce. The Horse steak was amazing too. Steak served with smoked meat & pork sausage.....and greens......Oh and Fries made in beef fat. OH YEAH. The desserts were awesome too. Can't wait to go back and try other things on their menu.\n\nFood : AMAZING\nService :Friendly\nAmbiance : Casual\nWorth the price : Yes
