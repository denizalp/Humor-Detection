This is my MUST go to buffet of all time! I've been to almost all of the buffets in Vegas and this one  puts the rest to shame. You and I can't be friends if you ate here and told me you didn't like it. Everything is amazing. Pricey but the food makes up for it. This would be my dream date! Mmmm....
