**Toula, you're getting a one star because of your food.  I would give you none if I could**\n\nI made a reservation for 8 girls for my friend's bachelorette dinner.  Told the hostess to write a specific message on the dessert for my friend, and she said she'll get it done.  \n\nWhen we got to the restaurant, I double checked with the hostess (she was very nice) about the message on the dessert, she said it's in the computer and not to worry about it.  So we proceed to the dining table.  Me and another girl ordered their risotto, and after a 30 mins wait, the food finally arrived.  And our risotto turns out to be under cooked (the rice were still crunchy), so we told our server to kindly bring us a cooked one.  He first raised his eye brows, then asked if we know \"Al dente\" means, and if we know that risotto are suppose to be \"Al dente\" (never in a million years would I expect to be question by a server about this, especially not in a restaurant on the top floor of Westin Harbour hotel ).  I told him I've had over hundreds of risottos in my life, so I know what I'm eating (I happen to be a big risotto fan).  He finally took the risotto and started mumbling something while he was walking away.  \n\nMe and my friends didn't want to make a big scene about this, cause we wanted our friend to have a good time that evening, so we just bite our tongue and waited patiently for another 20 mins before the risotto was cooked properly and brought back to us (the risotto was okay).  Then our server was no where to be found for the next 20 mins, didn't come and refill any of our drinks at all.  \n\nSo dessert time came, my friend (the bride to be) ordered a molten lava cake and I tried to remind the server about the specific message.  And before I could finish my  sentence, he  raised his eye brows, gave me the WTF look and said \" oh........of course I know\".  20 mins later, he came out with the dessert, then he started singing \"happy birthday to you...happy birthday to you\".  Everyone at the table jaw dropped!  We told him from the beginning that this is a bachelorette party and the message was suppose to be \"bachelorette on the loose\".  So he managed to mess the dessert part up too.  His reply to this was \"oh..someone else ordered the molten cake right, they can have the happy birthday one instead\".  5 second later, another server brought out the dessert with the correct message, so obviously our server was trying to be a smart @$$ again.    Anyways, so I thought to myself, \"it's okay, dinner is going to be over soon, I'm just going to enjoy my dessert\".  Turns out my molten lava cake was rock solid, it was more like a brownie.  I didn't even bother asking the server to bring it back, I fear he might as me \"do you know what a lava cake is suppose to be\".  \n\n\nWe proceed to ask for the bill, and we wanted separate bills.  He goes \"oh.....I have to charge you 18% for gratuity, and I don't know how to do that if you want separate bills. \"  (not sure if this is the first time they're having a group of 8 in their entire restaurant history for them to not know how to do it).  Anyways, I told him that's ridiculous, and he just kept on repeating how we'll still need to pay him 18% even if we get our separate bills.  At that point in time, my EQ was running really low, so I told him I don't give a crap about his gratuity, I've never pay less than 20% anyways and please do make this first time for me.  I told him I'll give him that 18% and just bring us the separate bills.  He walked away without saying a word.  So me and the girls decide to just do all the calculations by ourselves.  Then after we're done, we waited around for another 15 mins before he came back with the separate bills with the 18% gratuity added it.  I was paying with credit card, so I left my card there and went to the washroom, while he grab the machine.  When I came back, and was ready to fill out the numbers, I notice that he filled out his own tip in, and the total.  He was so worry that he wouldn't get his full 18% gratuity that he filled it all out .  I thought to myself, he might as well forge my signature.  \nMe and my friends still bite our tongue, again, because we want to make sure the bride to be will have a good time.  \n\nOn our way out, that server did not say thank you or bye to us.  First thing he did was rush over to double check and make sure he got his full gratuity.  \n\n\nSo my conclusion is, if I'm expecting service like this, I'll go to a cheap Chinese restaurant in china town.  I don't need to deal with this BS when at a restaurant at a reputable hotel.  This is a complete disgrace for the hotel and the restaurant owner and the chef.  I'll never come back again!
