Nolen is a great neighborhood spot. Love walking up there on the weekends. Its a little too \"ladies who lunch\" for me during the week. True greek touches with the souvlaki, tzatziki sauce, peppers and olives scattered throughout the menu. Not a big fan of their scrambled eggs at brunch; overdone and rubbery, they need to be improved. Their bacon is served in large, thick crispy strips. The patio is awesome anytime. I get the burger most often and think that their french fries are the best in Charlotte. Service can be a little spotty, but overall this place is definitely rock solid.
