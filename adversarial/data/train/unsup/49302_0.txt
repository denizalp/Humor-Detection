Worst customer service ANYWHERE. I walked out and the alarm goes off. Ok, no problem, I know it happens sometimes, and I didn't take anything so there's nothing to worry about. The manager looks through my bags takes out my stuff and my receipt. There were 2 things that weren't on the receipt, but mind you, I got them from 7\/11! And I told her that! All things I got from that store, I paid for and was proven on the receipt! Not only that but from the very beginning, her, the security officer, and the cashier who rung me out (Diamond) automatically thought I was stealing. The manager took my 2 items from 7\/11, set them on the counter, and said goodbye. I've NEVER been treated like that before by ANYONE because I'm always considerate, I've worked in customer service before. The 3 of them were smirking at each other the entire time and even after I left they were because I had a group of friends that came with me who noticed. And why would I pay for these 4 items and steal 5$ worth of cheap stuff?!?!?! I even came back inside and let them look through my bag when the alarm went off!!! \nI'm never going back there for other items, but the pharmacy staff were excellent so I will still return for my prescriptions.
