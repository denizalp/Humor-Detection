I feel the need to tell all my fellow Yelpers about the HORRIBLE service I received at Winners yesterday morning. Let's start at the beginning. \n\nI got there right at 9am, supposedly when they open, and I watched as the employees sat around on the counters and chatted in what seemed to be a staff meeting. It was freezing outside and considering it was 9am I was expecting the door to open any minute. \n\nI waited and I waited. I watched as one by one, the employees noticed me standing outside, and one by one, they peeked their heads around and just stared. You'd think someone would have come to my rescue, but nope. They just continued sitting around on the counters and occasionally looking back to see if I was still there. \n\nI finally got inside at 9:10am (which SUCKS because by this point, I'm late for work) and I told them I had to return an item. The assistant manager said \"Malcolm will help you on the other side\". So i walked around to the other side and I stood at the cash register waiting as Malcolm tried to figure out how to put his 'Winners' apron on. Finally, Malcolm looks at my item and says \"You're returning this? You cut off the tags\". I'm like \"Yeah, but I bought it 12 hours ago and it doesn't say on the receipt anything about keeping the tags on\". He lost it on me. He angrily pointed to this sign that Winners has that states their policy. He's all like \"You cut off the tags! You're not supposed to cut off the tags. We don't return items with the tags cut off.\" Finally he said \"Fine, this ONE time, I'll do it, but never again\". He was BY FAR one of the rudest people I have ever dealt a minute after opening. \n\nFinally he finished punching away at the register, shoved the receipt and cash on the counter and completely ignored me. I grabbed it and left the store immediately. \n\nI will never, not EVER, step foot inside this Winners again. Their service is atrocious and I urge all my fellow Yelpers to pick any place to shop but this one.
