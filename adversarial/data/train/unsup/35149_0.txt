I've been to this urgent care 4 times in the last year. \n\nThe wait times aren't the best, but I go in with the attitude that timing is everything, and sometimes you just gotta wait. The Doctors here are professional, especially Dr. Hogan. So much so that I asked if he had his own practice, which he doesn't - and I found that a shame. We don't have a lack of Physician problem in Ahwatukee, we have a lack of COMPETENT and REASONABLE Physicians like Dr. Hogan.\n\nHe is not a pushover, nor do they write prescriptions wantonly and throw them at you. He'll negotiate with you, and he asks tons of questions plus gives you a full physical as you would expect a Physician to do. For example, even for an Urgent Care, he is willing to prescribe medicines such as 12-20 count NORCO 5MG if he sees you have pain and it is obvious. Once again - these people are cautious an professional, if you're an addict: go somewhere else because I don't want you to screw it up for the rest of us. If you know something works for you, such as Augmentin for infections, SAY SO. They will help you with it. Don't go in there having seen a commercial, diagnosed yourself and ask if you can have 90 days of Cialis \/ Prednisone \/ Adult ADHD meds.\n\nPeople come to your room and settle the bill with you, Nurse comes to the room and explains everything clearly. Super nice staff, helpful and friendly. I'd use these people more often but they did carefully press the issue that I needed a Primary Care Doc. I grudginly agreed, but I will go back every few months on the weekends just because I like the docs and staff here, and it's good to have a 2nd opinion.\n\nCall ahead, plan it out, even call the front desk and ask how busy they are. Then jet in, expect to wait 30-45 minutes to get in a room, then 20-30 mins to see the Doctor, and 15-20 minutes to finish up AFTER you've talked to the doctor for a while, and odds are you'll have a great experience there!
