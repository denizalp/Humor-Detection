I was recently just here for UFC 213 and the ultimate fighter finale. I pretty much come here for UFC fights. Exception would be the kanye west concert. This place is a great arena. I mean the employees are helpful and seats are comfortable. My only problem is the beer prices. At the same time how can I complain about that when like every arena charges 14 for a beer lol. I really can't find anything to complain about .
