Dude, no lie- this is my favourite\/best donuts I've ever had in my life. If you don't know how much I love donuts, just know, it's more than you. (I have the word 'donuts' in my IG username, please)\n\nI commuted here from Markham on a busy, rainy Saturday. If you know the 401, then you know. Cry. 404-401W-427S-QEW.... but was it worth it??? HELL YES IT WAS!! The plaza is pretty much empty, but daddy o's is poppin. It was pretty full the whole time I was there and everyone parked in the empty plaza seemed to be there for a good ol' cheat day. The donuts looked absolutely amazing but it was nothing in comparison to how they taste- the dough is insane. They perfected it. It's fried, but doesn't taste fried at all. In fact, it's super doughy with great texture and you don't end up with an overly sweet, greasy mouth. Sure, they are definitely calorie dense but I didn't feel sick like I usually do when I eat sweet things.\nHere are my reviews of the flavours I tried:\n- blueberry glaze 6\/5 - MUST HAVE. Not sweet at all, very fruity and definitely delicious\n- peanut butter pie - 5\/5 omg! peanut butter is soft and works so well with the dough; it tastes like a melted reeses cup AND has chocolate flowing out of the middle\n- homer simpson - YESSS 4\/5 tastes like strawberry pocky. Plus, who hasn't wanted the donuts from the simpsons??\n- marge simpson 3\/5 not bad, but definitely not as good as homer\n- red velvet 4\/5 looks super sweet, but actually is not. Frosting isn't overpowering.. it's a cream cheese. The dough tastes like red velvet cake, not as much as a donut\n- wake up coffee donut - 2\/5 not my thing because it's a bit too sweet but my caffeine loving bf loved it\n- skor 5\/5 yoooooo, toffee heaven. Dough is on point. Superstar combo.\n- lucky charms - 3\/5, it was ok.. good dough but taste wasn't unique\n\nThe only sad part is each donut is $3.50-$4.. yikes! Definitely a good thing I don't live close to this or I'd be broke. A dozen donuts are $36.. very steep for a dessert\/snack but if you come here once in awhile, it's worth it.  (I'm definitely coming back in a few months)
