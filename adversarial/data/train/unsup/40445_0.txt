In Phoenix for a vacation with my cousin, and I enjoy one of the best burritos I have ever had - either that, or I was really hungry.  We drove about 20 minutes to go to a complete dive.  You wait in line, order at the counter, and enjoy fantastic food. Go with the traditional meats or go wtih the Asian flavors, you just cannot go wrong at Chino Bandido, and definitely order two.
