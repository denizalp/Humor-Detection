DMV's are like taxes & death. They're something you dread and cant get away from.. most DMV's are hell! This one was different!\n\nLove this place! Best DMV!\n\nCame here twice and both times i was outta there super fast! \n\nThe first time there was a line before it opened and as soon as the doors opened at 8am i was out of there before 830am.. that was for chaning my last name, so ofcourse it took a little longer cause of all of the paper work i had to bring.\n\nThe second time i got there at 845am and i walked right in with no lines, no waiting and the whole process took 20 minutes. Thats with getting my picture taken for my NV license.\n\nSWEET! come here for friendly and uber fast service!
