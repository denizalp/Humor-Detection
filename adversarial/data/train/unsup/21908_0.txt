I ate here over the weekend while attending Comicon.  I was actually pretty hungover at the time and desperately needed to plug my gut.  It was between this and a deli I saw a little bit down the way but pizza always, always sounds good so I made my decision.  In my mind, in a fight between a pizza and a sandwich, the pizza would always win because it has the power of molten-hot cheese and pepperoni shields.\n\nYay:  It was like $6 bucks for a big slice of pizza and a salad and a drink.  That's a really, really good deal.  The salad that I got wasn't like an amazing salad but it had onions on it and croutons and had a strong flavor.  It wasn't bad.  If I were a teacher and my class assignment was, \"Throw a salad together super quick and cheap,\" and I got that salad, I'd give it a B.\n\nNay:  The pizza was not so good.  But, you know, it was pizza and pizza is hard to fuck up so it was salvageable.  The big problem was that it was so greasy.  I mean the pizza sweat grease like a fat man's back.  If I were a teacher and my class assignment was, \"Make me a cheap ass piece of pizza that tastes good,\" I'd give this slice of pizza like a C.  I choked that shit down though and washed it down with salad and raspberry iced tea.\n\nSo, you know, the pizza wasn't great, but after I got done eating I felt a lot better.  I had the strength and energy to check out Comicon for the rest of the day.  I geeked out good.
