I love when I can share firsts with friends, and tonight WHITE CASTLE on Fremont was a cherry popper for my dear friend!\n\nBeing from SoCal White Castle isn't a staple, but having family from Chicago, I've learned to appreciate the simplicity of the mini sliders.\n\nThis is a fairly nice location all, although being on Fremont there are certainly some characters you'll run into. But there's nothing quite like ending a drunk night with a late night 4 pack of cheeseburgers and fries!\n\nThe service was kinda slow.. Both taking our order and receiving it. Which sorta baffles me cuz it's really an easy setup.  But nonetheless, when our food we ready, it was HOT and delicious.  \n\nMy friend has been corrupted once again. Lol! Next stop got her..IN-N-OUT!
