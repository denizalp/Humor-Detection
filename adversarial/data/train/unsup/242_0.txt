Breakfast for breakfast.  Breakfast for Dinner.  On this particular day it was breakfast for lunch.  GA had had already conducted a reconnaissance of Lumberjacks and thus it seemed a suitable option to dine.\n\nUpon arrival and a quick check of the menu, I had pretty much already decided on GA's recommendation that I consume the Chicken Fried Steak (CFS) on this day.\n\nI did make a cursory glance at the burger menu having seen a burger bar located at front of the establishment.  I did not pay it much attention after I spied you could \"load\" your house potatoes and\/or hash browns..more on that later.\n\nOur initial server was on point, though I cannot remember the name, her friendliness would eventually begin to slide.  Perhaps, she was late for her lunch break.  Thank you's deserve your welcomes.  As I recall, she did not conclude the breakfast\/lunch for four transaction.\n\nI ordered the CFS.  The eggs were over easy.  My hash browns were \"loaded.\"  Loaded- cheese, sour cream, and chives.  BAM!  This is a welcome addition to a potato prepared in any style.  Instead of bread, I went with a single flapper jacker.  Somewhat tasty, but lacking in any sort of warm to melt butter, I would eventually have to scrape it off.\n\nMight be back...might not...All in all, a solid three star experience.
