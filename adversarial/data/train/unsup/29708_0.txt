I think people are over rating this place based on atmosphere. The food here is mediocre at best. My bf and I ordered the deal for two, choosing butter chicken, chicken tikka, and bhaingan bharta. Too much sweet and fruitiness in all the food and not enough of the flavor and spice that caters to an Indian food craving. The butter chicken was standard, tikka wasn't anything special, and the bhaingan bharta had way too many peas. I also highly disagree that the portions are \"generous\". I've gotten much better indian food and much larger portions for the same price at Banjara.
