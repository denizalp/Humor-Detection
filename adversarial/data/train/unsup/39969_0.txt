A good place and calm location for a late bite!! They do a good food , prices are very reasonable and the employees are friendly, also there is a Bar next door if you wanna take a look they share a inside door !! I love the carne asada nachos and torta are very yummy, the pineapple water is ok . Antonio the owner is a very nice guy but he is there only in a day time but i go there often after midnight!!
