A solid Italian bar and restaurant with ample seating inside and outside.  \n\nMenu is excellent and covers all the Italian food groups.  Pizza, pastas, salads, calzones, etc.  And the portions are huge.  Wife had pizza there with a friend so we decided to do a lunch experiment.\n\nLots of take-out and not just pizza, plus on a Sunday, there were a number of people eating in and at the bar.\n\nWent for somewhat of a sampler so split a salad, and glad we did because the portion was more than enough for two people.  Was good.  Calzone had the best dough or as my wife says, crust, ever.  And cooked perfectly.  Just ask to go light on the ricotta cheese as it is pretty dominant.  Ours was really cheezy and could have use more spinach.\n\nPizza slice was very good.  They can do thin crust and even have three thick varieties.  And they have prepared about a dozen pies that you can buy by the slice.  Very convenient for the business lunch crowd.\n\nService excellent.  And everything is made to order, so be prepared to wait, but the wait will be worth it.
