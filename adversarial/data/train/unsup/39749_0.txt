Best food I've had in a long time!!! The gluten free fried chicken was so good. It's fried with rice flour. When I disclosed my allergy the server was really great about pointing out all the things I could eat on the menu. They can make their shrimp and grits gluten free and that was AMAZING. Also the cauliflower mashed potatoes are gluten free and very yummy. Overall I was very pleased with my meal and the service. I will most definately be back when in Vegas.
