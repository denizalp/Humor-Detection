This is the second best domestic lounge in the United States.\n\nThe best is the Centurion Lounge at DFW.\n\nTo the people who expected a five-star orgasm of luxury: what planet are you living on?\n\nTo the people who compare this unfavorably to other lounges: you have no idea what you're talking about.\n\nHere's the reality: at LAS, your options are this lounge, or The Club lounge (I won't even discuss the option of sitting with the peasants at the gate). The Club is terrible. It's super depressing, and the offerings are subpar. The Centurion Lounge has free top-shelf drinks, really good food on the buffet, and friendly folks. Comparing this lounge to an Admirals Club, US Airways, Sky Club, etc, is simply unfair. This is way nicer.\n\nI've spent dozens of hours here, and I plan to spend dozens more.\n\nYou might be wondering, why only three stars? The reason is simple. They don't have ginger beer. This is an affront to all cocktail drinkers and men of class. Furthermore, the bartender claimed that ginger beer was simply \"alcoholic ginger ale.\" I was so offended at this suggestion that I'm docking two full stars. If said bartender ever reads this review, know that those comments cost you multiple dollars in tips, and two stars in my Yelp review. AND, they don't have Hendricks gin. AND, they don't have Fever Tree mixers. \n\nAmerican Express: get ginger beer (preferrably Fever Tree or Bundaberg), get Hendricks, and get better mixers. I Tweeted at the cocktail list creator (Jim Meehan), and he assured me that he'll send the word on to AmEx. But seriously, this is an unbelievable oversight. I may cancel my Platinum Card if AmEx doesn't get ginger beer at its lounges. I care that much.
