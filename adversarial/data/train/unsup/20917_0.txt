This place has some fantastic food.  No MSG, no corn starch, just simply the food with no fillers to bolster the flavors.  Just enter Mekong Plaza through the northern most doors and walk directly back to the food court.  You practically walk right to Hue Gourmet.  Don't let the food court atmosphere fool you.  The food here is quite tasty and the owner is happy to tell you all about the food and how they prepare it.\n\nI have been here on several occasions for foodie lunches (got to try a lot of different things) and lunch with friends.   I've gone here for lunch most days and I'm partial to the Banh kahn cua.  I recommend this place for folks who enjoy food!\n\nReturn Potential:  90%
