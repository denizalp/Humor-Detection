good lord.  i am a burritosaur that just happens to burritovore.  that's right son.  best burrito\/taco shop EVER!  when i lived in las vegas, you could find me at roberto's at least once during the week, and most definitely on the weekend.  multiple locations, ALL 24 hours, seven days a week.  some locations are very much \"hole in the wall\" status, but other locations on the ritzier sides of town are ballin'.  hugantic carne asada burritos for $4.50!? say what!?  carne asada fries!?  wonderful salsa bar that even has those spicy pickled carrots to boot.  if roberto's served alcohol i'm sure they could take over the world.  i've yakked in a couple of their shops, not because their food was bad, but because i ate so friggin' much of its decliciousness when i was derailed (drunk)!  roberto's=5 stars.  roberto's+alcohol=1 bajillion stars!!
