Ahh Yelp Spring Break, so many deals to choose from, not enough money to spend LOL!\n\nMade reservations here because of Vanessa H's review.\n\nOur experience was remarkable. I've never been to a Brazilian steakhouse before so I had little expectations. The only thing I did not like about this place was house easily they refill your food. The servers took a half-filled plate of mashed potatoes and replaced it with a new one. Seemed pretty wasteful. Same thing goes for the salad bar where they rotate or rather refresh the items every few minutes.\n\nYelp has made me very open-minded when it comes to food so I was able to try pretty much any of the meats they brought to the table. The house special was what hit the spot for me, as well as the lamb. \n\nEven without the Yelp deal, I would willingly pay for this place. Which almost happened by the way, as the manager looked at my Yelp Spring Break guide with much confusion. He borrowed it for a bit and I guess educated his staff about it and everything went without a hitch!
