The pizza is excellent... The service is not. We were greeted right away, but drinks took literally 12 minutes before they arrived and we were the only table in the whole restaurant. When I did make eye contact with a waitress, she must have felt bad and realized she'd forgotten us, and said she had to go in the back to get some drinks. Then they came out right away.\nThe pizza took as long as we expected it to, probably about 25 minutes, but once it did arrive she never checked to make sure we had everything we needed or that it was okay. At the end of the meal, I had to ask a different waitress for a box and our check.\n\nService aside, the food is excellent. The pizza is fresh, crispy crust was delicious, and next time we will know just to get a pizza to go rather than sit in the restaurant itself.
