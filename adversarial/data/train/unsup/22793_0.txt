Ok, I'm not sure if the 3 star is fair, but I will back it up. I went with the supper club and we ate family style, so we did get to try a ton of their food....now, if I had gone with a small group and would have gotten what I was planning on ordering, this place would be 4 stars for sure; however, because I got to try many many things I also got to realize that about half the food was good and half the food I didn't care for. So, maybe the family style worked against this restaurant. Ok, let me start with the good: We got a noodle dish (I don't know which one...curses!), it had wide noodles and shrimp and beef...it was my fave, very tasty, the curry soup - super tasty, rich, the chicken in it was wonderful (this was what I was going to order), the grilled pork - simple, but delicious with a touch of sweetness (this is what the BF was gonna order), and the ginger beef (tasty....could have had more flavor, but if you add their hot sauce, it was really good). The not so good: The basil drink (I know people like it, I thought it had an odd flavor...not basil -y.....and it had weird jelly things in it and the texture was off putting), the bbq platter (we got two of these and they just weren't very good - they had sliced beef (which was cold and bland), chicken wings that had the entire wing (also not much flavor and difficult to eat), and a beef skewer, which was ok, but nothing special), all the fish dishes (the amok fish sounded amazing with a curry sauce, but I thought it was lacking flavor, the mango fish - just not a lot of mango flavor or maybe not enough for this non fishy fish eater, and the seafood plate which was just plain fish, shrimp, and squid....yikes), the springroll (was ok, nice and crispy, but the filling had an odd flavor). That is all I remember (maybe all we ordered...ha.). Anyway, I would definitely go back to get the few dishes that were really good, unfortunately for me it just wasn't consistent.
