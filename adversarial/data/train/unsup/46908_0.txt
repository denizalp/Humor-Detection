Been here on a few occasions, most recently Cinco de Mayo and then this past wknd to use my Groupon. House margaritas are great!  Happy hour specials are good! Food is yumm-O! Only recently did i actually eat here... We sat in the bar area and were served by the bartender. It was a Sunday night, so not very busy. Service was great. He recommended the Ahi tacos, which the bf chose and said were good. I had the Tinga and Polla Asado tacos and was very pleased. The Tinga was probably my fave cuz of the spicyness but the Asado was great and lighter feeling in my belly.  Their chips and salsas are great... and Free!  =)   The bf had the Prickly Pear marg, which he wasn't big on... He likes fruity things, so prob just a taste preference thing.  I have a few friends who rave about the Cucumber marg, which i've tasted and is very good. The Chambord marg is also quite tasty! With a name like Cien Agave, i don't see how you can go wrong.
