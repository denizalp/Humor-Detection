I was not planning on coming here but my friend's family took us here and they're awesome company. There was a bit of a wait so we looked around the gift shop. On the way there, I was heckled by the bartender for wearing a Kevin Durant shirt. Ninja, puh-leez!\n\n5 O'Clock Somewhere:\nRum, passion fruit tequila, sour mix, OJ, pineapple juice, and grenadine on the rocks. 4\/5\n\nTropical Fruit Margarita:\nFrozen fruit-flavored  margarita mix (strawberry,  raspberry, banana, wildberry or mango), Triple Sec, and tequila. I picked strawberry and banana. I got mine served in a souvenir blender cup. This was surprisingly nice and strong. 4\/5\n\nFeelin' Hot Hot Hot:\nTequila, agave nectar, Habanero lime, margarita mix, and jerk seasoning on the rocks. I couldn't taste the habanero or whatever spice. 1\/5\n\nCuban Sandwich:\nPulled pork, ham, Swiss cheese in a Cuban loaf with mustard. Served with a side of fries. I've had good Cuban sandwiches before. This was just ok. The bread was think and crispy. But I should have gotten the fish sandwich instead. 3\/5\n\nBarbecue Bacon Cheeseburger:\nNothing to write home about. 3\/5\n\nOur server was quite good. But man, that bartender.
