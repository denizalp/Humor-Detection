While waiting on my daughter to get her hair braided I stopped in here to have lunch. We ordered a few lunch specials which are wings and fries it's 6.99 I believe. Then I had 2lbs of chicken wings which is 14 wings I believe. This place has 100s of flavors to choose from including weed infused flavors. I personally don't partake in the edible craze, but to each their own!!! My friend had some and he said they were good. But he just about eats anything!!!! My son enjoyed his flavors too. I enjoyed my flavors too. Spice level wasn't what I expected, but it's cool. The waitress was very friendly. I'd go back.
