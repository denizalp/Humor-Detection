I can't believe this place got a 5 star. We've been having scorpion issues at our house. We have had them come out to spray our house at least 4-5 times within two months and we are still seeing scorpions a couple times a week. \n\nI've gone through companies before where it only took one spray within a 30 day window and we didn't see any scorpions. After 4? Why are still seeing scorpions every couple days? And whenever we call the lady that schedules the appointments always has her kids crying in the background. Not very professional.   Not to mention now they are harassing me with phone calls. I've gotten multiple phone calls, voicemails and constant text messages from them. I obviously don't want your services otherwise I would've answered already. We'll definitely be going elsewhere.
