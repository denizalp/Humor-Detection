I love summer.  Not because we become nocturnal and have to hibernate during the day.  I love summer because I get to drink iced coffee.  Up until a few months ago, all I knew was that I loved iced coffee, didn't really think about who had the best . . . until I had Hillside's iced coffee!!!\n\nHow do they do it?  How can it be so delicious?  I never noticed being impressed at other places and now nothing seems to compare to Hillside's.  I have been back three times just for the iced coffee and to see if it was a one time thing, but it was not.  Each time the iced coffee (with just a hint of milk, no sugar) has blown me away!\n\nAnd the cherry on top?  Cheddar Bacon scones!  Yep, I said it!  I have never really been interested in scones before and have always claimed to have more of a savory tooth than a sweet tooth.  Blueberry, cherry, eh.  When it came to take it or leave it, I always left it.  Today, I had to take it!  This morning, I saw the delicious Cheddar Bacon scones in the case and had to have one.  I was not disappointed.  Light and fluffy, chunks of bacon, yet each bite was nicely balanced and not over powered by either cheddar or bacon.\n\nOh Hillside Spot, I heart you!\n\nUpdate 8\/2:  I finally have an answer to my question \"How do they do it?  How can it be so delicious?\"  The answer is they get their coffee from the Cartel Coffee Lab.  Who knew!?  We do . . . now.  Check it out.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/cartel-coffee-lab-phoenix#hrid:w6hrU_1NGdkAGEM2B_ot1w
