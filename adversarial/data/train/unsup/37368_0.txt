Kaya is by far one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh.  This is one of my go-to places to take friends, relatives, and co-workers when they are in town and I have never heard of anyone having a bad meal or cocktail.  The atmosphere makes you forget you are in Pittsburgh and has an awesome Caribbean feel.  The fish tacos are pretty spectacular and are typically my order when I am there; The Don cocktail is also a favorite.  I would also recommend getting the tofu cracklins as an appetizer - I am not a tofu lover, but these are incredible.  You also cannot go wrong with the Kaya burger, conch fritters, or the chicken entree.  The pulled pork quesadilla is pretty spicy, so if you don't like a lot of heat in your food, I would recommend against that.  But overall, you won't be disappointed at Kaya - it's one of the best, and their homemade sorbets\/ice creams are a delicious way to end the meal.
