Best show you will EVER see without having to pay! This is definitely a must for all who come to Vegas. \nThe show goes on throughout the day so if you have the time make sure you see it during the day AND during the night! I promise it is well worth your time(:\n\nTIP: For best picture results, stand to the far left or far right. Since the fountain is so wide you will never be able to get the full fountain in one shot (unless you use a suuuper wide lens).
