First of all let me say the place is clean and the staff is very nice.\n\nMy wife and I both joined a year ago and signed up our daughter as well.\n\nI thought it was weird that they took out 3 separate payments each month instead of one payment for the 3 of us but now I understand why.\n\nMy wife and I haven't used our membership for months so we went in to close it out and found out there is a $25 fee for canceling the membership, and it is not just one fee, it is $25 per person. \n\nSo I had to pay $50 to cancel a membership that neither my wife or I have used for months.\n\nI am VERY upset. \nIf you read many review sites you will see I will be re-posting this everywhere.
