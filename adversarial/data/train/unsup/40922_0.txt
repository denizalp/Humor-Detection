I've came here (Putters) mostly for drinks. I decided to eat here as well today. Service was sub-par, even in just getting drinks. With Michelle and John I've had the best experiences, but tonight was short of that. The waitress was fine and good on service except for the bill. My bill was $9.72, she gave me $10 back of the $20 I gave her. Obviously 28 cents doesn't matter much, but it was the principle. Suggesting I wouldn't tip enough?  That the 28 cents would cover some type of loss?  Very uncomfortable and I won't order food again. Otherwise I'd only suggest this place for the night bartenders.
