I loathe Monroeville Mall. It is the pit of hell.  I had to go there today to run an errand with a family member.  We were really hungry and against our better judgement we went to the food court.  Much to my surprise there was an excellent Mediterranean grill.  Who knew you could have a good, fresh, healthy meal in the midst of suburban chain restaurant hell?\n\nTheir kitchen was incredibly clean, their menu large, the service extremely friendly.  I got a baba ganoush wrap.  The pita bread was great.  Everything is made fresh in house.  Veggies were good.  What a nice surprise.  While I don't hope to find myself in Monroeville Mall anytime soon, I would certainly eat here again if I were.
