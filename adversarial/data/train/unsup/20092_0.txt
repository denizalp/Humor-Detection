One of the best place we ever eat in! We travel a lot and tried many places across the country. Looking at previous negative reviews I have to wonder if they are about the same place we had our lunch in today. The place is spotless clean and cozy, nice ambient and music. The high chair for our son was the cleanest one we ever seen in a restaurant. \nThe food is fresh and tasty, with a wonderful flavor combining French and Mediterranean cuisine. Our 1 year old couldn't stop eating the hummus and bread. The prices are fair for the quality of the offered dishes (there is no place offering a generous sized humus dish for only $5, not even in the Middle East where the price is almost double).\nUseless to mention that desserts were to die for. Service was perfect, attentive and tending to all our needs. \nDefinitely a place we will visit again when back in the area.
