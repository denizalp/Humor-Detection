A quaint downtown like Waxhaw would not be complete without your standard pub! My family and I were exploring downtown Waxhaw and wanted to find a place to eat outside. Maxwell's it was! When we first walked in I thought it was going to just be a pub with indoor seating, but they actually have a cute outdoor space out back. If you are looking for your standard fish and chips, BLT, wings  and pub food, this is a great spot. We went for lunch on the weekend but I have a feeling that this is a pretty popular local spot in the evening as well.
