Now, I ask you, how can you not love a bar that actually accepts Canadian Tire money? \n\nHow can you not love a bar whose staff actually got pissed off when the place received a great review in trendy Toronto Life magazine because they were afraid the place would lose its local cred?  \n\nOnce described by NOW as \"so laid back, it's almost prone,\" the Done Right is a haven for the Queen West arts community, where lucky writers like myself have enjoyed sharing cold pints with other writers, artists, actors, musicians, and other assorted happy riffraff.  When their resident spinner, DJ Spite, is up, you can be assured of a colourful tapestry of tunage to go with your brews.  And they're even cool with you bringing in your own food, since they don't serve any.\n\nThe back patio is awesome with its high booths and the tree that yawns upward from its centre.  The bartenders are all sassy and clever, each a unique personality bringing different energy and vibe with them.  Their on-tap choices may be small, but its well selected, and plenty of other options stand cold in the coolers.  \n\nThis is a Queen West person's Queen West bar.  Beware of imitations.
