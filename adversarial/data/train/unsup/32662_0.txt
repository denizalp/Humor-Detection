My co-worker and I were planning on having Cousins Subs next door when we seen the sign for Deli Roma. We ventured inside and were greeted by a dining room full of customers. We figured that had to be a good sign. \n\nI had the panini of the week which consisted of Salami, whole milk Mozzarella cheese, and sun dried tomatoes. My co-worker had the Godfather sandwich part 1. Both of us had food comas afterwards. The portions are huge and my panini could have fed the whole island of Madagascar. \n\nI plan to go back. Prices were fair in my opinion. Just wish they offered pizza by the slice for lunch time as I don't want\/need a whole pie.
