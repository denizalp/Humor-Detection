For some reason the first time we went to Intermezzo I wasn't really impressed.  It was right when they first opened and we sat outside in the heat with lots of traffic passing by.  We didn't even wander inside.  I wish I'd known that dining inside is a completely different experience.  This time around I loved Intermezzo!  The atmosphere was very cool and cozy and had that Plaza Midwood feel.  They have cool local art work on the brick walls and they had kind of a funky music playlist that half the time included rave\/techno ish music and the rest of the time was more low key alternative.\n\nI don't know if it was just because I was starving, but I thought their pizza was amazing!  I actually ventured to say it's my new favorite pizza in Charlotte.  We had the supreme style pizza and all the veggies were so fresh and full of flavor.  Yum!  Plus they topped if off with slices of tomato which I'm not usually a big fan of but this time around I thought it was delicious.  Their menu isn't terribly extensive but it doesn't matter to me because I will always be ordering this pizza from now on.
