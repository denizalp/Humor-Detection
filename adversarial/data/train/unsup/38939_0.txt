Canada's flagship Burberry store is finally here and it looks great. The setup of the store is nice and easy to navigate. The facade blends well with the rest of Bloor street and is right at home next to Hermes and Gucci.\n\nAs I expected, however, the products suffer from the Canadian and\/or Bloor street mark-up, so you're paying about 15-30% more than what you will pay in comparable American stores. I wonder what the sales will look like, but even then, it will be hard to keep up with the Americans. \n\nCan't comment on service because I didn't purchase anything, but I imagine its consistent with the rest of Bloor.
