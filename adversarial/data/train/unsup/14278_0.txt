Who doesn't want a typical tourist photo on their 1st (or one of many) trip to Las Vegas? Taking a photo here is facebook, twitter and instragram worthy right? You'll be the envy of all your friends and followers. \n\nBut anyways, there is a small parking lot that you can pull into so you can snap a picture of yourself away. If you come in the early morning or afternoon, there tend to be less people. If the parking lot is full, waiting for a spot shouldn't take too long. It really is just a place to take a photo and drive off to the sunset to your original destination. (Really there isn't a reason to stay here for a long time since really there is only the sign here and that's pretty much it).\n\nIf you haven't stopped here before, you just should just once. Why not? You're on vacation and you're a tourist, so just embrace it and go for it.
