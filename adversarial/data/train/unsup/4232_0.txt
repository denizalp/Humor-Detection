GREAT $5 pita special, awesome jalape√±o hummus. I liked this place a lot!!!!\n\nMy one complaint?.......SWEEP YOUR FREEKING FLOORS. Owners, get your teenage help off their cell phones and tell them to grab a broom. It was pretty discussing to look at while eating.\n\nYOU GOT TIME TO LEAN, YOU HAVE TIME TO CLEAN........START SWEEPIN!!!!
