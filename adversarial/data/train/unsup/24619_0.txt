Had to update since it's been a few years since I've visited. \n\nOverall, the Cheesecake Factory is good but highly overrated. Parking is convenient as there is a small lot, as well as the deck. There is valet but it looked as through they are only available at dinner time. I just wish they would update their pedestrian crossing section because if you park in the deck, you risk getting hit by the fast cars turning around the corner. There also isn't a sidewalk that wraps around the outside so you have to walk in the street until you reach said sidewalk. \n\nThe wine I ordered with my lunch was at a good temperature for a sparkling white, which was extremely refreshing. The wine and cocktail prices were on par with competitors in the area. They didn't have any specials, if that's what you're looking for.\n\nThe food was honestly better than I expected. I went for the lunch special and ordered the herb crusted salmon. It was properly cooked with no complaints. It wasn't wowing but it wasn't terrible either. \n\nBecause of my diet, or \"lifestyle change\", I declined the cheesecake.\n\nI view The Cheesecake Factory as being on par with Olive Garden... appears to be fancy, but really isn't. I could've made the same meal at home, but I had a gift card to burn so it is what it is.
