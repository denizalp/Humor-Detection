Go for the comedy. The acts are pros and generally funny, but as with any comedy it depends on who is on stage on any given night.  We saw 3 comics + the MC (who, lets face it, is another comic). The headliner was excellent, two were quite good with one not quite up to snuff.  Still we laughed a lot and it was an enjoyable evening.\n\nThe venue, food, and service leave plenty to be desired though. The place is a fire-trap with hundreds jammed in and pretty basic decor. The servers came around often enough but you needed to be patient to get your drink.  Just don't eat there. The buffet had few options with bargain basement food and dollar-store utensils.  The place was not full but kept running out of food and plates making people wait in long lines.  The food quality was poor - reminiscent of camp food, but worse.  There are dozens of really interesting places to eat at all price levels in the area, so there is no reason to eat there  .
