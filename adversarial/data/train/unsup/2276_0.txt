Best BBQ in town.  The pork lolly pops are outstanding.  We always bring guests from out of town here.  It's great seeing people's reaction to gas station food.  Forget it being a gas station as it's better than most restaurants.  It can be packed at lunch but is worth the wait and the line moves fairly quick.
