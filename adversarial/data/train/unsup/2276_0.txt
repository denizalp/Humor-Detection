First, know that I was born and raised in New Orleans and know better than to expect much from remote places claiming to prepare authentic creole food.  Being in the desert of Arizona (business trip), I was predicting the gumbo to be tomato soup with hot dogs floating in it. The place didn't look like much from the outside (or the inside) but being a brave and noble soul I charged ahead and ordered the fried green tomatoes, fried pickles, a cup of gumbo and a shrimp Po-boy.  \nI can't believe how good it was! They might make the best fried pickles I've ever had. The gumbo was delicious...well, everything was delicious. But be warned, I ate too much and almost fell asleep at the table.\nGreat food.
