Can't say enough good things! Took my partner here for  essential massages while on a weekend getaway for his birthday. My massage was wonderful with Rachel! She was super gentle and sweet. The whole staff were very friendly and accommodating. Very clean and chic. They even surprised us with complimentary birthday cakes to take with us at the end of the treatments. Will definitely come back next time we're out in AZ!
