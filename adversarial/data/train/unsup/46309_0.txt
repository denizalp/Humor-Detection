I first saw this place on Insauga, and was quite intrigued with the fusion aspect of the restaurant. I then looked into the reviews, and was impressed with the high ratings and positive reviews. I did have quite high expectations going in, but unfortunately it fell a little short.\n\nIn terms of the food, everything was ok. I wasn't blown away. For one, the chicken karrage was good, but wasn't a fan of the sauce. In addition, the wait time was a little longer than I was expecting. There wasn't many tables seated, about 5, and there is an open kitchen, which I could see 2 chefs. I'm unsure if this is the normal speed, or if the dishes took longer than normal or if they were short staffed in the kitchen, but there wasn't any word from the servers about the wait time or apology...etc. We only ordered about 4 items, and they came one at a time, but it took about 45 minutes to get our final dish. \n\nOther than that, the service was good, they were quite nice, water was refilled numerously, and they did explain what the dishes were.\n\nThe interior is also beautifully decorated. There is parking in the back. \n\nI do look forward to coming back, when maybe they have ironed out some kinks. With their unique concept, I have no doubts of their promising future in Mississauga.
