I was skeptical after walking almost 2 miles from our hotel that we would find a bagel that would blow our minds but lo-and-behold, our minds were B-L-O-W-N from something as simple and humble as a sesame bagel straight from the oven.\n\nBeing newbies, we asked what everyone ordered and the answer was \"sesame\" and there was a pile of them coming out of the oven with just a slight hint of burn and crisp. You pick up a few single serving Philadelphia cream cheese pads from the fridge and pay less than a buck for a fresh bagel.\n\nThe warmth of the bagel combined with just the right amount of chew puts any west coast US bagel to shame. We made a mistake of ordering some raisin bagel which was from a pile that was obviously out much longer so that one was a bit harder and colder and more normal.\n\nBoth my SO and I agreed that we could've eaten a few more of those bagels each.
