Walked in here since it was right next to my hotel.\n\nThe appetizer selection is upscale but not very, well, appetizing. The burger I went for was fine, and the bun looked artisan but tasted bland. The highlight if my meal was the cocktail menu, which, unlike the entree, lived up to the price point. Even then though, the drink was somewhat weak.\n\nOverall the place is fine, the ambiance outpacing the food, but is much too expensive for an eatery in Pittsburgh.
