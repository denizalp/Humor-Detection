Kiehl's is EXCEPTIONAL. My exceptional experience began when I walked in late on a Sunday night, a bit sweaty from hoofing it from the Caesars Palace parking garage, walking past the wanna be club kids, and making my way to one of the famous curved escalators that was out of service. My grumbling at Caesars Palace evaporated like mist on a hot desert day when I stepped into Kiehl's. \n\nFrom start to finish I have rarely encountered service like I experienced here. I had questions on the products, I got answers. Knowledgeable answers too, and without any attitude. Service with a smile? I had interactions with 3 different staff members and all were professional, friendly, and very helpful. \n\nBut while service is important, it's the products that brought me in. And while pricey, I do not regret my purchases almost 2 weeks later. Their shaving cream is outstanding, and they have other products that while they can't do the work of a plastic surgeon, they have slightly bent back the hands of father time and how I look when I look in the mirror. \n\nOnce I made my purchase I didn't have to ask about samples. They asked me. And they chose things I could actually use vs. just shoving a bunch of stuff in my bag. \n\nWhen it comes to retail I am jaded, skeptical, even negative....but when I write that a place was truly exceptional...it has to be earned. The staff at Kiehls exceeded my expectations and their products did the same. \n\n5 Stars, without question or hesitation and all of those stars are as legit as it gets.
