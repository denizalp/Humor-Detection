Rude customer service, I called to order my pizza and when he told me the price of the pizza my phone signal got cut off for 2 second so I didn't catch what he said, so when I ask him to repeat it one more time he snaps and raised his voice with obvious attitude as if I didn't listen to him the first time. LOL. If you don't like your job then just quit, don't take it out on the customer please, some of us didn't do anything and just want to order pizza. I probably won't order from here again.
