I haven't posted on Yelp in a quite some time, but I felt compelled to voice my opinion here.  This was easily the worst massage experience I've ever had.  The \"hour massage\" broke down like this:\n\n1) 11:10 - Arrival\n2) 11:15 - Feet in water\n3) 11:20 - Facial Rub Starts\n4) 11:30 - Hands\/Arm\/Neck Rub\n5) 11:40 - Foot Massage and Leg Rub (the work on my feet was not bad...the star was earned here)\n6) 11:50 - Back\/Hamstring Rub + Hot Stones\n7) 12:00 - Complete\n\nNotice that I use the word \"massage\" sparingly in the timeline above.  The staff member I had (she definitely does not qualify as a masseuse) basically gave me a 40 minute rub down\/lathering.  Of the 40 minutes of work I received, only the foot portion was pleasant.  The other 30 minutes resembled a care worker putting lotion (and a lot of it) on an elderly patient at a convalescent home, wiping the patient down after with a not-so-soft towel.   On the bright side,  I guess my skin is quite hydrated.\n\nThe 10 minutes I spent on my stomach was definitely the most awkward portion of the experience.  At times, it seemed like the staff didn't know what to do.  This resulted in her repeating the same motion several times, in the same areas, with no sense of pressure.  The motion was equivalent to the smoothening out of a bed sheet on a bed, making sure all the wrinkles were out (which, I think, is actually what she was doing with the towel laid out on my back).\n\nYou know, if the staff that was servicing me actually went the full hour, I probably wouldn't be so irritated.  But when you're paying for a service that charges by the hour, getting shorted 1\/3 of the paid time is absolutely not acceptable.  Even if I start my clock at the point when my feet were put in a bucket of water, I'm still losing 1\/4 of the time that I paid for.  On top of all this, I counted about 5 minutes of break time over the duration of the rub down.  I won't count this against the full time, but I mean come on.  I'm already getting shorted 1\/4 of the time...do you need to take breaks?\n\nI've read some of the other reviews, and it sounds like there are some true massage therapists at this establishment.  Maybe I got a rookie, or someone that just didn't care.  Who knows.  Whatever the case is, I'm definitely not coming back here again.
