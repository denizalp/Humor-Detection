Food variety is ok, Service is ok. But after we get there our friend tries to go to bathroom (no bathroom in buffet) after just setting plate down - they say you can't leave and get back in.  Uh what you can't go to the bathroom before you eat or during you meal and get back in - really.  Then we raised with management who said it was ok - this time.  That's ok for $32 there are much better choices and there will not be a next time.
