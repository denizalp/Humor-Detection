Hey Diamonds here is a clue I would think most of your customers are baseball fans let alone cubbie fans .. so why would you be understaffed durning the World Series. ? Thank God for the waitress who was useless and slower then hell for passing off our table to another waiter. 4 thumbs down to her.. not sure how she forgot to put my order in for dinner when 20 feet from kitchen. Hell we had to flag down another one for drinks too. 4 thumbs up for Pepe? If I'm saying his name right. The guy hustled like crazy to serve our table 12 not to mention a few more tables in our area. He even took time out to chat as he worked. \nGotta be honest if we had the first waitress any longer we were getting ready to walk. Hats off to him. \nWill we be back for tomorrow nights game  I doubt it and that party should be close to 15 of us from Chicago ... \npoor management .. you think  they would be staffed to handle
