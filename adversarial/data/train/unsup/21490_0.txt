When rating Indian Cuisine, I tend to rate it based on a bowel-evacuation scale I developed years ago.\nFor example, a normal movement would warrant little or no Indian-food respect, subsequently, no stars.\nOn the other hand..\n\nThere's the Cleveland Trembler; a violent ass-quake followed by a shit-tsunami only a large (and very sick) farm animal is capable of. The Trembler gets a full five stars.\n\nWell, where is Dehli in the whole scheme of things?\nSo glad you asked.\nDehli has never made the Trembler, but it IS darned close.\n\nThe baingan bharta prepared to spice level eleven will send yer IBS straight into overdrive. In fact, all their dishes prepared to eleven will pretty much fuck you up for a good day or so.\n\nIf I'm in the mood for Indian, I typically visit Delhi on Saturday night, this so I have an excuse to get out of Sunday Costco and all that other husband\/father shit expected of me on my only day off. \nWhy?\nBecause even a day off with the shits is better than a day off fixing stuff around the house, shopping, or the all-too-familiar query:\n\n    \"Is that all you're going to do today? Lay around on that damned couch?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI
