I have been going to classes at CAPS since February. I was a little scared at first but Tracy made me feel so welcome immediately. I have had classes with most of the instructors since and all have the same attitude; warm and very welcoming. I am a bigger girl and when I first started I couldn't do a lot of the loves but over time and with the encouragement of the class and instructors I have never felt too intimidated to try even if I don't get it right the first time.
