This place runs like a well-oiled machine.  I've done both the drive-thru and walked in on Friday mornings before work, and in both cases I've gotten super fast and friendly service, a yummy donut (chocolate frosted) and my coffee prepared just how I ordered it.  A little secret.. the drive thru even gives out doggie treats to your furry friends.
