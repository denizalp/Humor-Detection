Finding the place is always weird!!! But we made it. \n\nValet, check in, & check out the spot. Checking in is weird because they told us we couldn't carry our own bags to our room! WTH??? LOOK WE NEED OUR LIQUOR ASAP!!! LOL Anywho, the front desk staff was nice, there weren't many customers checking in at the time so I walked up & it took about 5mins. \n\nThe rooms were BEAUTIFUL!!! Nice apartment\/condo style rooms. We got a 38th floor room so our view was EVERYTHING!!! The blinds were operated by an electrical switch which was Uber cool. Room was clean & fully stocked. Every time we called for room service they were pretty prompt. \n\nOnly issues were with valet, they get busy Saturday night & Sunday morning it's PACKED to check out. Security at night ask for room keys which is a pain on the ass when your carrying shit in!!! \n\nCheck out was also painless & quick. Nathan was the clerk he was nice & offered transportation options which was nice. \n\nI'D COME BACK!!!!
