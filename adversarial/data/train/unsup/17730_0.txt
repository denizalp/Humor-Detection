I took my sister out to dinner on a weekday night after hearing positive things about Nardi's.  If you're curious about its location, it's on the top floor of the Jonnet Building on 22 (where Monterrey Bay used to be).  This restaurant provides a fantastic view of Business Monroeville. You can see Target AND Giant Eagle! Wow! \n\nA note about the menu: it includes many veal, steak, and chicken entrees. Contrary to its Italian-sounding Name, Nardi's only offers a few pastas. A twofold warning for you vegetarians! 1. There is a little under a handful of choices for you and 2. The chef LOVES bacon and prosciutto. No, really. Bacon is on the casear salad. It's in the salad dressing. Prosciutto wraps half the appetizers and a few of the meat entrees. MY GOD, IT'S EVERYWHERE! I have a suspicion that half of the pork heading to Pittsburgh ends up in a Nardi's dish.\n\nOn to our personal experience...\n\nUnfortunately, we found the bread quite stale. Not a great start.\n\nLittle Z and I then split an appetizer, stuffed mushrooms. This was good, but for the price, I expected more than three medium-sized caps. \n\nNext came the salads. I had a tasty caesar salad topped with... you guessed it! Bacon! Sister had the chef salad, surprisingly pig-free. \n\nWe both chose steak for our main dishes. I ordered the 6 oz filet and she ordered the stuffed 10 oz filet. My steak was perfectly cooked and topped with mushrooms. Yum!  Sister said her steak was \"good.\"  It was stuffed with provolone and bacon (say WHAT?) and wrapped in... go ahead and guess. Prosciutto. \n\nTo wrap up the evening, we shared a death-by-chocolate cake which tasted like it had very recently been defrosted. \n\nOverall, we found Nardi's to be a three-star restaurant charging five-star prices. For that reason, I give it two stars. That'll do, pig. That'll do.
