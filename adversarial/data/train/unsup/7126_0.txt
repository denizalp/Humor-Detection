I grew up with this California-based chain.  For me, a polish sandwich with kraut is comfort food.  I have to eat here at least once every couple of weeks.  You should to.  Interestingly enough: you can buy a chili dog, a chili cheese dog, a chili burger, a chili cheese burger, but you can't buy a bowl of chili.
