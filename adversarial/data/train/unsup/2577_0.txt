Here is another \"Twilight Zone\" (really I never saw the TV show) Thrift Store!  Volunteers make this organization even more of an experience right out of something from a TV show I have never seen...  Even the Location is strange.\n\nI guess many Organizations with Thrift Stores \"Have a Purpose\" (Like Serving People\/ Giving, etc.) beyond simply making a profit and I know making a profit IS VERY Important, yet when Serving others especially people who do not currently have a way of repaying you, it makes giving better.  \n\nMy attraction to this place is beyond the quirkiness and the admiration of their mission, my main interest is Totally Selfish!  I found a Jacket here, for me...  In another life this Jacket belonged to a Man who donated this Tailor-made Silk Wool Blend Blazer... Conveniently he and I are the same size!!!  I can not wear most off-the -rack Sports Coats, not because I have a Tom Daley Build yet because my elbows are largely out of proportion to the rest of my torso, combined with a long torso and short arms, not to mention I wear a shoulder holster under my jacket with a Glock on one side and Ammo and a Blade on the other...  So most jackets (off-the-rack) have to be altered and are too big everywhere except the elbows... In Thrift Stores I can find some great looking Jackets that someone else had Custom-made and donated to a place like this!  Just kidding about being heavily ARMED I have a ankle holster with a \"Hold-up Piece\" for fun, a couple of Tactical folding blades and a Razor in my shoe... Hummm... No I'm not Bad Bad Leroy Brown!
