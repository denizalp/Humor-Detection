VIsited the Charleston location last summer. The place truly felt Hawaiian. Palm trees sway outside with the summer breeze. Along the side of the restaurant, the tiki toarches burn as they beacon you to the main door. \n\nThe interior, of course as you would expect, is Hawaiian - nothing particularty striking but I found the dining area to be dark. The diners - mostly older peeps - in keeping with the Hawaiian spirit even sport Hawaiian shirts.  Inside you'd really feel the Hawaiian hospitality. Everyone was nice and pleasant. :)\n\n\nMy cousin who is a line cook here hooked us up with some good stuff.\n\nAppys:\nWow everything looked tasty...and they were. Definitely try the Shrimp on a Stick with Wasabi Cocktail Sauce, Island Ahi Poke, and the Pork & Shrimp Lumpia is perfect. Wasn't very impressed with the Crisped Seafood Potstickers and the Wood Grilled Szechuan Spiced Baby Back Pork\n\nEntree:\nHibachi Style Grilled Salmon. Glilled to perfection and comes with a decent portion. And to compliment this meal was a bottle of B.R. Cohn \"Silver Label\" North Coast Cabernet Sauvignon 2003. $60\/ bottle here, $19 at any BevMo. It was  recommended by the sommelier and it was a perfect match. ...and she was nice enough to come by and offer another bottle after me and my cousin guzzle it like milk.\n\nDessert:\nThis was my favorite. Everything was served a la mode. Definitely try the Melting Hot Chocolate Souffl, The Caramel Macadamia Nut Almond Tart with Vanilla Bean ice cream was interesting and the macadamia carrot cake with a sour cream maple glaze was wonderful.
