I WILL NEVER EVER STAY THERE. We had reservation so we went through Valet and the parking attendant was mean, rude and disrespectful would not let me get out to valet. If it was not for my kids I would have been a jerk back then would have went down from there. He asked us if we are sure we belong there? He was Middle Eastern Gentlemen. I did not want to ruin our mini get away so we left.  It was the most insulting and rude experience ever. So we decide to stay at Bally's. They treated us like gold there.
