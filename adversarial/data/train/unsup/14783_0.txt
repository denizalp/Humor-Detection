I was really disappointed when I tried the spicy Korean chicken... it seemed like a lot of people praised the menu item, but it was not great at all. In fact, it just tasted like chicken with some fried breading with very little flavor. I gave the restaurant a benefit of the doubt and gave another chance of the spicy Korean chicken, and it was still the same.. so in conclusion, spicy Korean chicken is not very good. \n\nSad to say, but is one of my least favorite Hawaiian restaurants in town. Does not have friendly service either. \n\nProbably won't go back.
