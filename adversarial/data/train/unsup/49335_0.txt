Husband won a \"contest\" on the radio that included 2 nights stay at awful plaza hotel and the chance to be contestants on game show Lovers or Losers with Todd Bridges.  It sounded weird and funny so we decided to do it.  Casablanca said we would just have to sit through a timeshare presentation and we would have an upgraded room (we did not), money to gamble with, which we didn't get, it was a voucher for a fake slot machine and money to spend at restaurants which it was only coupons for poor to average quality restaurants in the area which we didn't try since we would never go there. Our timeshare presenter turned pretty rude once we made it clear we were not interested.  We didn't expect much from this whole thing except we really wanted to be on the game show.  Well come to find out they cancelled the show 2 days prior to us being there so it was all for nothing!!  The only thing they paid for was 2 nights at that hotel and we still had to pay $20 resort fee each night.  Please do your research and don't buy a timeshare from them or any other company, they are all liars.
