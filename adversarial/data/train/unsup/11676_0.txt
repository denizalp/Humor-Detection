Definitely owe these guys an update!\n\nLast time we came we kept it low key and ate at the bar. There was a Carolina game on so it was kind of busy. Our primary bartender worked in sync with the other and were very attentive. We decided it was going to be an all appetizer kind of night to really get some variety!\n\nThe appetizers came out as they were prepared and we were fine with that - what we ate:\n\nPimento Cheese with bread and their infamous bacon jam - classic gooey goodness.\n\nBrisket with pickled onions - nice sized bites with deep smoke flavor and tang from the onions.\n\nAranicini - who doesn't like Italian style deep fried risotto\/rice balls?\n\nNC Shrimp - nicely done with tempura style seasonal veggies.\n\nArugula Salad with market fresh peaches - double yum.\n\nAnd last but not least - Chocolate Pie with Market Berry Coulis - dense, chocolately, delicious!\n\nWe came on a Wednesday and they were running a house made cocktail special for $5 - great deal for Dogwood as most of their cocktails run $10-15. Add to that hand pressed coffee!\n\nOnly ball dropped was the salad which we had to remind them of - a sous chef brought it out personally though with his apologies.\n\nOverall, great place for a date night to try some great food and drinks!
