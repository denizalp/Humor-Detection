this place is a rip off, cheap products, high prices and terrible service. The large black guy working here is a ghetto asshole, i think he might have some issues, he kept staring at customers, very creepy. like wow you're so cool working at a dirt bag smoke shop. i cant wait for this place to close, then all the neighbor crack heads will have to find a new place to get their paraphernalia
