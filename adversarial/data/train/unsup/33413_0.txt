Over the year I have been coming to this location for Chinese traditional dessert. I believe this is typically a good place for those who enjoy sweet dessert that aren't too sweet.  I really like the mango pudding and their fry milk it's really yummy! \n\nIm a bit disappointed at their grass jelly n coconut milk dessert, it doesn't have much taste.... I expected it to be better in a way....\n\nPortion wise of their dessert are pretty small and a bit pricey, but hey, if u need ur fix of Chinese dessert then u just gotta do it... nonetheless as I mentioned, this place is perfect for those who doesn't eat too sweet and like dessert that are very light.\n\nMy recommendation is, go here if you got no more option but I'm pretty sure there are better one out there. \n\nThis place did not make it to my \"To go list\" but it is not in my \"'Never go to\" list either. I would still visit from time to time.
