Came across this place while walking through Chinatown. The cafe is cute & has lots of places to sit & hangout. The menu is lengthy & there are plenty of options to choose from.  I ordered the taro milk tea with boba. This place allows you to customize sweetness & amount of ice which I have never been to a place like this before which was cool. The people behind the counter were really nice.
