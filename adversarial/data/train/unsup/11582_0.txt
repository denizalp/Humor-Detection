A quick weekend trip to Madison would not have been complete without a late night stop at Ian's. The line was INSANE (or at least it seemed so to me, as an out-of-towner) but no one seemed even remotely perturbed by the idea of waiting 30 minutes while the smell of hot pizza wafted teasingly through the air. Obviously this was a challenge for me...\n\nI had heard from enough people that the macaroni and cheese pizza was \"out of this world,\" and once I saw the greasy, beautiful thing behind the glass on the counter, my mind was made up without thinking twice about my other options. \n\nMaybe it was the alcohol, the delayed gratification of waiting in line for so long, or the hype. But I swear: that Mac and cheese pizza is the drunkfood of the gods. Somehow, the Mac and cheese remained soft and creamy on top of crispy pizza crust, and the whole thing was basically an ode to the glory of cheese.  I was torn between scarfing down my slice or savoring each bite. I opted for a combination of the two, and my pizza was gone way too fast. \n\nBottom line- I would fly back to Madison just to eat this again.
