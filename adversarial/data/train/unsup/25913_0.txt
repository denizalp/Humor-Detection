lately, every time i go to vegas, i stay at the venetian. i usually stay with a little group to cut down the cost of the room. it is so gorgeous i wouldn't think of staying anywhere else! and it's so huge that you can cram all the people in there and not to squished. i think the most people i had in one room was.. 12?? we had the queen sized room which has two beds, and a sofa bed. only downfall is there's only one bathroom, but we made it work.\n\nthe venetian also has a great location. it's on the middle of the strip so it would be convenient to stay here if you don't have a car and don't feel like spending money on a cab. it's also connected to that one fancy mall that also connects to a few other hotels.\n\njust to let you all know, there's an AWESOME special going on right now that ends june 27th. you can book rooms till labor day for this special. promo code: EVTMP08
