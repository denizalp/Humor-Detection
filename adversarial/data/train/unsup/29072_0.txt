We decided to grab a bite to eat here after seeing a show at a theater next door - huge mistake!  I guess we should have realized it was more of a place to drink beer than have a meal. \n\n The hamburgers are some strange  funky tasting mystery meat.  My lackluster chicken tenders salad had wilted lettuce with 3 very small over cooked chicken pieces.  The nachos were not much more than a huge pile of chips with a bit of cheese, hot peppers and salsa on top.  I guess the best meal amongst our group was the entree with 2 sausages\/sauerkraut. \n\nAvoid the food like the plague!
