Dr. Martineau is a true veterinary angel. She has been out to the house for both animal care visits and when we knew it was time to let go. She allows you so many options to care and comfort your pet. She is extremely knowledgeable about diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. She will go the extra mile to get there as soon as she can whenever possible and she never seems rushed. Dr. Martineau is also wonderful about explaining everything to your grieving children. She offers a tissue and lots of hugs. Dr. Martineau transported my baby for cremation and ensured I received her ashes back as soon as possible. She is just an all around great person and professional. I recommend her highly to anyone who needs care for their fur baby at any point in their life! I'd give her more stars but that wasn't an option. Thank you Dr. Martineau for all you do for the pet loving community!!!
