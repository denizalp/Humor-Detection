Dropped by not expecting much given the very neutral decor. The place also has no shame promoting it's street fighter ancestry -there's art work showing Ryu serving an uppercut ramen. However, I've learned not to always judge a book by its cover.  The ramen is the best hakata style ramen I've tasted since Ippudo NY.  It doesn't compare to the variety that Ippudo offers but it comes close in taste.\n\nWhile the chicken karage left little to be desired their ramen could possibly be the best ramen in Toronto. They serve four variations of tonkatsu ramen. It's not as oily as the other popular places (Santouka), the broth has character yet not salty. The noodles are the perfect size, texture and cooked al dente as it shld be. Very likely freshly made and tasted very similar to ippudo's. \n\nThe ramen was also served without the unnecessary trimmings (corn, bamboo, seaweed) you may find at the usual Toronto ramen joints but this lets the noodles and broth shine. The chasu was also the best I have tasted in a ramen joint in Toronto. It was just seasoned right, the fat rendered perfectly brown, melted in my mouth and had a slight char for flavor. I had to order an extra serving. \n\nPrice-value wise it's comparable to other ramen places. One bowl with extra chasu was more than enough and they don't overload you with too much soup.\n\nBecause the place is new I will have to visit again to see if they can maintain my first impressions. Given my experience I am more than happy to go back and hopefully make this my go-to ramen place.
