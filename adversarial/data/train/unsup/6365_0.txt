Yesterday I had a heavenly experience at Salon Embellish as a result of purchasing their Groupon a few weeks ago. Salon Embellish is a full service salon that offers massage, aesthetics, and hair care. The salon itself is small, but functional, with Aveda products and pictures spread throughout. I had a lovely 60-minute Swedish massage from Jeff and an awesome haircut by Charlotte. They both demonstrated attention to detail and I appreciated their efforts. I would recommend.
