So it was late on Ozzfest Eve, and we needed sustenance. It's almost 10:30 PM? Who delivers at that hour? We tried calling different pizzerias to no avail. Busy signals galore! What are we gonna do?!?\n\nLittle Nippers comes to the rescue like good old Jim Dandy.\n\nGo Lil Nippers, go Lil Nippers!\n\nWe got a small round pizza with get this (blame the ladyfriend) bacon, black olives, and...pineapple?\n\nIt was a combo that worked famously, especially when you factor in a triumphant sauce, cheese that was almost gummy without being rubbery, and a crust puffier than Glenn Beck sans the obnoxious worldview. \n\nI hadn't ordered breadsticks in a while and thus had forgotten how yummy they can be. They had a real bakery quality to them and were so tastebud-pleasing, they disappeared faster than \"Cop Rock\". \n\nSomeone, SOMEONE knows how to do an Italian Hoagie up right.  The bread tasted as if it was freshly baked as opposed to being baked into concrete. Flawless. The veggies tasted as if they had been cut to order, the dressing was spicy and tangy as one of the Italian type should be, and the meat was actually generous, so generous in fact that ya felt the Catholic guilt. Well, I did anyways. \n\nMan, was it a good thing that we just happened to be in their delivery area the other night. \n\nLittle Nippers made me...chipper?\n\nOk I'll knock it off.
