Let me make this perfectly clear to the people that are reading bad reviews on this pet resort. Do not believe every thing you read. The amount of professionalism these employees have shown goes above and beyond any pet hotel I have ever experienced. The owner is extremely caring and I cannot even imagine anyone saying bad things about this person. I took my dog there for the first time last week and she had an absolute blast! We had her groomed and she looks beautiful. It's so clean and the mood is so very calming for these dogs, my little nugget can not wait to go back.
