Trashy.\nPeppermill is a gloriously trashy, blinged out, cornea scarring\/neon-ed out, portions so large you have to be rolled out version of Denny's. \n\nWe ordered the Nachos Nachos Nachos to share. We hardly put a dent in that sucker. It was SO HUGE. If I was standing I would have fallen over seeing the size of the fruit-plate (more like platter) that our neighbors got. I think everything on the menu here is required to be larger than  your head.  Food is good diner fare, and for the ridiculous portion size the price is more than a killer deal.\n\nExtra yays for free photo souvenirs and a giant jar of SPRINKLES on the table to add to whatever monstrous sized order of food you get.
