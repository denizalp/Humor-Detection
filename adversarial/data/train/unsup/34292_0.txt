I am a bit biased, as one of the people who works here is a close friend of mine.\nThat said, this Thai food is still really excellent, and by far the best I have found in Cleveland, making Coventry a new destination spot for good and inexpensive Asian food with the triumvirate of Mint Cafe, Pacific East, and Coventry Hunan. \nDo you know when Thai food is good?  It is when you are eating the curry, and you have eaten all the meat and vegetables that were in the curry dish, but you still put more rice on your plate, just so you can smother the rice with the sauce.  Mint Cafe reaches this level of Thai food, and I will definitely be going back.\n\nWhile you are there, try the Jasmine Lime drink, it is so good and refreshing!
