CLT airport is in the process of making improvements, and Terminal B in particular seems gutted - torn up flooring, loose wires hanging from the ceiling, and not nearly enough seating at the gates. I wasn't particularly hungry, but stepped into Beaudevin to escape the crush, and I'm so glad I did. The restaurant itself is peaceful, airy, and well decorated. I absolutely love the wine glass chandeliers that they have over the bar top. I took a seat at the bar and was greeted immediately; service was super friendly and efficient, and very knowledgeable about their extensive wine list. They also have power outlets on the underside of the bar which came in handy. The menu is small - salads, sandwiches, small plates - but held a nice variety of items. I had the smoked salmon sandwich and really enjoyed it. It came with HUGE pieces of smoked salmon. I'm talking like a centimeter thick, not like the nearly transparent slivers that you might get at other restaurants. The raisin bread wouldn't have been my first choice, but ended up working well with the herbed cream cheese, micro greens, fresh tomato and red onion. The wedge salad topped with diced tomato and cucumber was fresh, but unfortunately not dressed except for a small drizzle of olive. Overall I spent $27 for a sandwich and a delicious glass of Syrah, pretty typical for airport prices and well worth some peace and quiet in this otherwise crowded airport.
