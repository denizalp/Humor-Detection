Highly overrated for me. Went at 5:20 Friday evening and waited almost 1\/2 hour to order...another 10 minute wait for the food. Total bill for 4, over $60. I got the ShackStack, with a portabella mushroom fried and stuffed with cheese on top of a cheeseburger. Mushroom was quite mealy, and threw off the taste of the entire burger. Got a root beer float, because they were out of coffee shakes. Float came in a huge cup that was almost all root beer...very little custard, disappointing to say the least. My girls (college age) loved the fries, and said their burgers were good, but we all agreed that you can get much better burgers at equal price point without the wait at a number of different Charlotte restaurants. Probably a one and done for me. Not worth the wait, IMO, when I can go to Bad Daddys or Liberty and get a great burger, and a cold beer of my choice (only one beer offered at SS), and be almost finished in the time it would take me to wait in line at Shake Shack. No thanks.
