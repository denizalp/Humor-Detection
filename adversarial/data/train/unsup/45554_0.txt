First time here! But I'll likely be back. Dinner was great, on a Friday night it was about a 30 minute wait for 3 people. But they do get your number and can text you while you wait. The hostess was a bit rude, but it was a busy night. Our server though was so sweet! \nSo food, we ordered the prime rib dip, the chefs mac, and the roasted chicken. I think everyone's favorite was the roasted chicken, it was so flavorful! I loved the chefs mac- it included shrimp and sausage. Prime rib was also great, there were no leftovers ha. I'm going to come back during the day to try their coffee bar! It has its own separate little checkout area and menu.
