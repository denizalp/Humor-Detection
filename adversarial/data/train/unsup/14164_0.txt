I'm not sure whether to give this place 2 or 3 stars. \n\nWe have taken our pets to Alta Vista for vet stuff as well as for boarding.\n\nAs far as the medical stuff goes, one time the vet was very friendly and helpful and we were completely satisfied. Another time a different (and very creepy) vet tried to get us to do all kinds of unnecessary tests on our cat and recommended hitting her in the nose (wtf?) .\n\nAs far as boarding goes, the person we dropped our pet off to was great. She said call anytime to check up on our cat. I called twice. Both times I got a different person and both times they were very rude and acted like I was a bother. \n\nWhen we went to pick her up we heard an employee yell \"SHUT UP\" very loud presumably at one of the animals in their care. \n\nThat being said, our cat seemed healthy and as happy as one could expect after being boarded for a few days. \n\nThere are good things and bad things about Alta Vista. I think a lot of it depends on what particular employees you get on your visit.
