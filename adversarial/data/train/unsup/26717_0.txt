This is dinning.\nThe absolute best experience in love music and dining. May 15, 2015 Becky Boyd sang her heart out. Jim Wall on drums, Michael Bay playing lead guitar and Alfrado Guererri bring Rhythm and Blues to the best meal prepared by Chef Joe.\n\nHighly suggested by my wife and I\nBon Appitite
