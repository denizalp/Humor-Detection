Preferred Home Care delivered a wheelchair the day of surgery. They were very polite. When contacted to remedy a delivery issue (the wrong type of leg rests had been provided) they were incredibly apologetic. \n\nThe second delivery technician took much more care in explaining and *demonstrating* the functionality of the leg rests. (This was not done during the first delivery.) Additionally, the delivery tech estimated the approximate length that would be appropriate for someone of my height.  I did not feel rushed or that the 2nd delivery tech was frazzled by my questions.\n\nPreferred Home Care has wonderful customer phone service. Any time I've called there has been little to no wait time. The folks are quickly able to pull up account information without plucking every last bit of DNA from you over the phone.\n\nOne curious thing not explained (but I'm sure can be rectified by calling) is the \"return\" process. It's not clear how far in advance I need to schedule pick up. \n\nThis is a wonderful company in that they deliver products. You don't need to drive somewhere to pick up medical equipment. That rocks!
