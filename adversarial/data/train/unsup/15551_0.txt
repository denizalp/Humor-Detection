Ah the i-pod and the MP3 player!  You can take hundreds of songs with you everywhere!  And they're so convenient too!  Never again will you be bored by the drudgery of\n\n--Listening to a WHOLE album's worth of music.\n--Having to go to a record store alone or with your friends.\n--Discovering an artist you never heard of.\n--Being overjoyed at finding that old, rare, obscure album or hard-to-find import.\n--Having something you can call yours and actually hold in your hands.\n--Building up a music collection that you can proudly display.\n--Finding out about an in-store performance or autograph signing.\n\nMe, I'll take the inconvenience any day.  I guess I'm old school and proud of it.  I was here this past weekend and found a copy of Poi Dog Pondering's \"Pomegranate\".
