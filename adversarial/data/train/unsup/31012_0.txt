Had the dan dan mian, rich with sesame paste and peanuts, and pretty hot from chili oil and Sichuan peppercorns -- if you're not used to hot food might want to ask them to make it not too hot; had the pedestrian-sounding beef chow mein, probably one of the most delicious chow meins I've had in memory, noodles were al dente, beef was tender. Big flavors in the garlicky saut√©ed string bean dish as well as the family style fried bean curd dish, which came with a lovely savory sauce. Finally the pot stickers in red chili oil were perfectly fried, and the filling was pretty tasty. Pretty great restaurant.
