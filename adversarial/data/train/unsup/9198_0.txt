It's all a bunch of miscellaneous crap for a buck!!  Really good for cheap party decor, gifts for people you don't like, tons of items for kids. My son goes in here with his allowance and comes out feeling like he just scored big-time. They have health and beauty, home Decour, automotive, party supplies, toys, and even food (buyer beware).
