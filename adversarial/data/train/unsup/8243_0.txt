Me and my family went there for an exciting indoor activity and we got what we expected. Its a glow in the dark monster themed mini golf. It sounds scary but trust me it's not as scary to give you nightmares. It's a fun place. Apart from mini golf they have arcade gaming and a nice cafe. I love visiting this place every now and then with my family.
