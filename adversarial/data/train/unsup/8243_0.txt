Wawel Patisserie is a little Polish bakery that was founded back in '84 by Peter Sowa.  There are several locations throughout the city, but I was able to check the one located inside the Jean-Talon market.  I had heard about their famous prune-filled doughnuts, so I ordered one.  Since the market was just opening up, the employee had to get the oil running hot and lay out all of the breads\/pastries on the counter.  We actually waited for about 25-30 minutes or so, but the wi-fi in the market kept me busy.  Once the doughnut was received, I was pretty excited - it was oh-so-fresh, had a slight crisp exterior, a lovely little glaze, and filled inside with mashed prunes.  It was an interesting doughnut, and a nice little treat to start off the morning.  The gentleman there was super friendly and sweet.  There are some pub tables in the front of the patisserie, so you can enjoy before you walk around the market some more.\n\n+prune-filled doughnut - fresh!\n+friendly staff :D\n+located inside the Jean-Talon market
