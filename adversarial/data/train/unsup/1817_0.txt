I've heard alot about this place, and when I finally got a chance to visit, I was ecstatic!\n\nThe decor at this location is really nice + classy. I defo felt underdressed because everyone around me was in suits and fancy clothes. Woops. Also, I was partially soaked because of the rain outside...so anyways.\n\nWe had (to share) \n\n1. The App Trio with Hummus, Tabouleh and Baba Ghanouj. I really liked the tabouleh, but the hummus could've used a bit of lemon (which we did add and made it so much better). I wasn't a fan of the BBG. It's not supposed to be so creamy..\n\n2. The Lamb Skewers: They were my sister's favourite, but I wsan't the biggest fan. They were cooked well, not dry even though we asked for them medium well (my sister's pregnant and doesn't eat any raw meat). I thought they were a bit lacklustre. \n\n3. The Chicken Skewers: MY FAVOURITE. This was amazing. Perfectly cooked, and perfectly seasoned. YUM FREAKING OH.\n\n4. THE PITA? NAAN? PITA-NAAN HYBRID? thing served as well was AMAzING. Even my little 3 year old niece couldn't get enough of it, and she spent most of the night sleeping in the booth!\n\nAll in all, it's an okay place. I've heard they do a mean steak though, so I might be back.\n\nThe only qualm is that it was a bit expensive. I could've gotten the same and more at Paramount (which I like better)
