Disclaimer: use of some yuppie chow language such as \"truffle\" may be offensive to some. Stop reading now and look away.\n\nAfter feeling like an absolute fatty from eating at a buffet last night, I decided to order from the skinny side. My friend went for the fat side. I got a fresh morning sandwich and truffle fries. My friend got a burger Benedict with truffle fries. We shared a 32oz shake with banana, strawberry, frozen yogurt and of course, Nutella. \n\nFresh Morning Sandwich:\nTurkey bacon, egg whites, saut√©ed spinach, tomato, agave tomato ketchup on a multigrain kaiser roll, and a side of fruit. I had no guilt eating this sandwich but it's quite filling that I had to take half of it home. Good thing it already comes sliced in half. Everything in this sandwich tasted fresh. I love egg whites and find egg yolks disgusting so I love egg white sammies. The kaiser roll was a tad bit dry though. 4\/5\n\nTruffle Fries:\nSkinny fries with chopped parsley and drizzled with truffle oil. Their version is pretty good. Some were a bit soggy. 4\/5\n\nCreate-Your-Own Shake:\nWe chose banana, strawberry, Nutella and frozen yogurt with soy milk. A yummy shake with less guilt. I appreciate having a choice of 2% milk or soy milk since I'm lactose intolerant. Sharing might not have been a wise choice for us. I had to give Shawn the evil eye so I could get a sip. The cup it comes in is pretty cool. There's a clear part so you can see how much smoothie you still have left. 5\/5\n\nAs for the burger, I guess you'll have to read my friend's review when he gets to it since I wanted to be good and just stick with my healthy sandwich.\n\nThey have environment-friendly cups for their citrus cucumber water. Sit at the bar so you could charge your phone or other gadgets. This was a big plus in my book. The only not-so-positive comment I have is that my fries and our shake didn't come with the rest of our food.
