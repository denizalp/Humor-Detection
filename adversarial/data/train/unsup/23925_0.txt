I been to this location couple of times. This is fairly new store compare to other stores in the area. They keep it well stocked and clean. They also have a huge coffee bar along with pretty big hot dog island. One of the thing I like about Exxon on the run is they usually have two counters open so you don't have to wait in line to check out. \n\nDespite all the good things about this store I get some wired vibe for some reason and it feels weird every time I came here so I stopped coming to this store.
