If you're looking for streetwear, then you're in the right place.  It is a little boutique that has gotten very popular over the years.  It used to be located where Kuma is at, now they are in the same shopping center as Hot n Juicy and Mr. Tofu. I like that they carry  brands that are hard to find (unless you're shopping online).  Their customer service is awesome!  They are always helpful and check the back when I can't find a certain size or ask for a different color of something since they have a limited supply of the stuff they sell.  \n\nThis store caters mostly to men street wear.  The last time I was there, they only had a rack on the side for womens clothing.
