Usually well priced considering it's Scottsdale.  Well kept greens and fairways. Even though there are houses and condos around it still feels somewhat secluded.  \n\nWhat puts this place over the top is the customer service.  Played during Phoenix Open weekend when rates are obviously jacked up and told the pro shop we wouldn't be able to finish 18 and they happily gave me a rain check.
