Before I get into the horrible experience I had at sparklings I will rave that there food was amazing and there drink were incredible too!! \nAs far as service it was horrible !!!!!!!!! I will never return nor will the 20 guest we had for the bridal Shower we hosted there. The manager left his staff short staffed. Service was slow, like almost non existent If we didn't constantly ask for things we needed. Drinks were so unorganized and could have been done totally differently to make it run smoother but there was not enough help to do it that way. The waitress was really nice and tried her best but was way too overwhelmed and unorganized. Some of this could have been avoided by the management staying to help. Not the best place for a quick meal so prep yourself for hours !!!!
