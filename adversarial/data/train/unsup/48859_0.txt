This is pretty much the only straight up smoothie shop in the Madison area. Sure you can get two or three options at some fast food spots and even orange Julius inside of the DQ. But Smoothie King knows what's up.\n\nIt's my hangover cure and my energy boost. I prefer these guys to getting a coffee at Starbucks. Smoothie King also offers other nutritional products, though, I haven't really seriously browsed their collection.
