Great place to grab some sushi, I find the quality is good for the price. \n\nAlthough I feel there's to many filler pieces of sushi in there platters. For example the artificial crab, cucumber rolls (etc).\n\nFood is good overall and wait times can get bad during weekend dinners, but that's to be expected.
