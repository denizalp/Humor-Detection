Can I say that I'd been working across the street from the Metropolitan for ages, and until I got invited out by a co-worker for an \"I-know-it's-only-Tuesday-but-if-I-don't-get-out-of-here-soon-there-will-be-blood-stains-in-my-cubicle\" drink, I never knew it existed.  Post-work, there appear to be folks filtering in from the office for a quick pint, a glass of wine, and a conversation about work, how good it is, or in our case, wondering which beam in the office ceiling would hold our weight.  Instantly, the glass of Stella and the glass of Merlot hit the table.\n\nI could see instantly why she picked this place, as the dark richness of the wood and décor provide a sharp contrast to the Vitamin-D-draining light of most office buildings.  Settling into the chairs, you feel way more relaxed than when you came in, feeling the distance between ears and shoulders increasing.  In the summer, a semi-secluded back patio is available, allowing you to be sheltered from traffic, and enjoy a bit of the summer warmth.\n\nThe staff are efficient and friendly, confident in the menu, but satisfied with people just needing a drink and light snack.  A range of Italian offerings await you, with entrées running in the $18.00 to $25.00 range, and worth the reasonable expense.  The Metropolitan has surprised me on two levels, not the least of which was me going \"What, were you always here?\"
