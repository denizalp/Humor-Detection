Just had the best calamari ever here. Came in to grab a quick to-go order but stayed to eat the calamari, because as George puts it - \"that's like going to a steak house and taking a steak to go...it's just not the same. Eat the calamari here and I'll make your Chicken George to go.\" Can't argue with the man's logic. \n\nSo I did...AND he was right! He also is quite good on the guitar with an amazing voice!\n\nTotally devoured the calamari...(lightly pan fried and covered in a lemony sauce. The marinara sauce matched it perfectly, not making it too salty like most places do.) All the while he entertained while cooking and packing up the rest of my dinner. (Which was also amazing!) \n\nThis has to be the best dine in experience I've had in a while. Will definitely come back next time I'm in town!
