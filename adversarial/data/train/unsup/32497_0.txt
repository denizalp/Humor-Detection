The food was perfect .. all I remembered it to be .. I have made the restaurant a staple when visiting Las Vegas .. for many years.. the service was subpar our server was above serving us.. I guess she for got we were staying in the hotel and paid a bit of money to be there.. the food was awesome.. the service was bad,, but I would go there again.. I just love the food
