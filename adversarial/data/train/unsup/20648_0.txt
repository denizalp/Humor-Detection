Made reservations here for Labor Day weekend like a month and a half in advance. We were headed to Vegas for a bachelorette party and we knew we'd want some pampering. \n\nWhen we walked in they remembered my reservation right away and started on us. Our bride was hungover in the car and needed a little bit of time to join us but they were super understanding and flexible which I really appreciated. \n\nThey have a ton of colors and they do regular or gel. The spa pedicure chairs were super comfortable and everything seemed really clean. The ladies are all really friendly and great at their jobs. My lady who did my pedicure really took her time and the whole experience was so nice and relaxing.
