I'm surprised at the negative reviews for poor service, we saw nothing but attentive servers when we went for lunch. \n\nI can't comment on the beer selections, we don't drink, but my Diet Coke was very refreshing. We went because I heard from a friend that they had a diverse menu, which they do. \n\nWe started with a yummy southwest egg roll app served with a chipotle ranch dipping sauce. A little too spicy for my 14 year old, but Alina and I enjoyed them. Alex ordered the make your  own burger, which she said was very tasty. She also had a side of baked potato soup, which she liked even more than her burger. Alina ordered the make your own fish sandwich, which was way too big for her to finish. Alina really liked the potato bun, it went great with the crunchy fish filet. I ordered the 1\/2 lb chicken tenders app as my meal. I asked for a side of bbq sauce, and guess what? It arrived with the meal, I didn't have to send the server back to get it. The tenders were small, but abundant. I'm a big guy, but I couldn't finish the fries. Oh, I finished the tenders, no worries there. I was very happy with my menu choice, it was great.\n\nIf I had to find 1 con, it was that lunch for 3 with only 2 sodas came to $41, a little pricey for lunch. If we are ever back in Mint Hill, we will definitely return for another great meal.
