How could someone so drunk think pizza was so gross?\n\nTake that little zen koan to your mediation pillow and let me know when you find enlightenment.\n\nI can not even describe how disgusting the food was here.\n\nAnd this was when I was starving at 5:00 AM after drinking all day at Wet Republic and all night at Hakasan.\n\nThe first few slices I bought looked like they had been cooked about three days ago and then left in someone's dorm room under the bed. I do not understand how the pizza wasn't fresh as the line was literally out the door. \n\nI wanted  some greasy, gooey, cheesy, bready carb and fat-filled substance to soak up all the vodka-sugar-free-red-bull that had overtaken the proportion of liquid in my blood stream.\n\nSo I waited (impatiently). And was given two slices of greasy deliciousness.....oh no, wait. Greasy? Yes! But also dry, nasty, tasteless crust, minimal red sauce, and veggies that looked (and tasted) like they had been fished out of a fridge featured on Kitchen Nightmares. And the cheese was cheap and somehow horrible. I like basically all cheese indiscriminately - this must have been some sort of fake-cheese-product, I honestly have no idea what I must have been eating.\n\nEven the salad was bad. Again, not sure how you screw up lettuce. \n\nNext time, get room service or better yet, save yourself some calories, pass out on a empty stomach, and then get some eggs in the morning.  \n\nNote:  Although the food was f-ing nasty, the staff was really nice even though they were dealing with the drunkest people in North America at that hour of the morning.
