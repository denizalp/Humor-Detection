BED BUGS!!! Dont stay there...you walk 2 miles before u reach the front desk. And did I mention BED BUGS.  Called to speak to mgmt got a \"supervisor\" who transferred me to \"security\" who \"took\" an alleged \"report\" and gave me the number to \"risk mgmt\" still waiting for their return call...BED BUGS....GROSS!!!!!!!!  DONT STAY at the Westgate you may end up with lice and tapeworms too since they dont know how to deal with their bed bug issue...maybe need to call CDC since this place dont care about guest safety concerns!
