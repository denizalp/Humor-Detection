Dundas and Carlaw is a nice little bar with a great atmosphere.  My fiancee and I had a connecting flight through Toronto Pearson Airport cancelled that left us staying in Toronto overnight and we ended up trying to make the most of it by visiting this bar on a friend's recommendation.  The owner was there and made us feel immediately welcome - he even stayed late to keep the bar open and gave us snacks when he heard about our predicament.  A local beer delivery came in while we were there and we got to do a tasting as well.  The bar has a nice setup with a large patio, and the welcoming atmosphere and extensive beer and wine menus really helped us forget about our frustrations with travel.  We aren't frequent travelers to Toronto, but we will return to Dundas and Carlaw any time we visit in the future!
