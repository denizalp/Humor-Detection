This place is AMAZING....the food is fresh and delish...service is great.. Reasonably priced.  This is that Mexican food from Cali! When we moved to Vegas we could only find seafood only Mexican food we finally found a place that serves real Cali Mexican food... Everything we have had has been AMAZING!!!
