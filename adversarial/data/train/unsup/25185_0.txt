This place is off the beaten path and tucked away on Jones and robindale begins the gas station. It has a beach theme like the name and you feel like your on a island somewhere and you just took a break from the ocean to eat. \n\nThe staff is very friendly and laid back and the food is priced well and comes out super fresh along with a large portion size which is always right up my alley.\n\nI came here with a group so I got to see a variety of food and everyone was very satisfied. I had the fried fish which was tasty and my one of my buddies had a turkey sandwich which looked like it was on steroids it was so big and the other had a breakfast plate which he finished so fast I couldn't even get a picture lol. Oh and we also had fish tacos that were very tasty\n\nDefinitely a cool chill spot that's under the radar and worth more visits
