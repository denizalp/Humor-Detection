I hauled my a&* up to North Scottsdale (which I loathe to do ) in order to eat here. I'm so happy that they finally landed in Old Town.  Delicious burgers and a quality beer list.  I'm a beer snob and actually do know my beers.  They have a decent selection of high volume beers and I was delighted to see some of my favs on their list.  \n\nThe patio is huge and there are tons of tvs.  I have a feeling this is going to be a great spot to watch sports.\n\nNow, it's not cheap.  You do pay a bit for a burger.  However, the burgers are enormous.  I couldn't finish my truffle burger so perhaps splitting one between two would help you feel like less of a pig and allow more cash for beers!
