came in for the amazon conference. Wound up coming back twice. The drinks were great and as was the food. They have the best old fashioned I've ever had. It's bacon infused bourbon and it rocks. Fried chicken was delicious as well with the side of hot sauce. I'll definitely be back here when I'm in town.
