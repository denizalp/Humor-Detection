I had a reservation for 5 PM on a Saturday. The restaurant had just opened for the day, so we had the place all to ourselves. For our appetizers, we ordered shrimp (average taste) and pork belly (moist center, crispy outside, bit of fat). For our main courses, we ordered duck (cold temperature) and flat iron (spicy). For desserts, we ordered cheese cake (the only food there that my husband said tasted \"very good\") and peanut butter and fudge creme brulee (sugar on top but very different texture and taste from a typical creme brulee). The waitress was friendly, gave us frequent drink refills, and brought out the food quickly. I liked the food. My husband pushed his food around on his plate, and he went to Burger King afterward to fill up. :\/ Dress code is casual.
