I fell in love with Duck Donuts on a trip to the Outer Banks last year. When I heard Charlotte was getting one, I nearly fell out of my chair in excitement.\n\nThe key to a good donut is freshness, and it doesn't get any fresher than made-to-order. The maple bacon is my favorite, but all of the toppings are fantastic.\n\nI went on a late Sunday morning, which I assumed was a huge mistake on my part, but got in and out surprisingly quickly. Coffee was pretty good, too.\n\nIf you don't love Duck Donuts, you're wrong.
