Juan's Flaming Fajitas deserves the long wait, huge crowds, awards, and phenomenal reviews. Between the Happy Hour, yummy chips and dips, pozole, and the margaritas, you're in for a treat. But you of course HAVE to try the fajitas! Admittedly, other items have been lackluster comparatively, but the namesake dish more than makes up for them. Service can be slow because this restaurant is always filled to the brim with patrons. I hope they expand this location, because sometimes an hour is (almost) too long to wait.
