I love my dentist!  And, no, I'm not nuts!  As soon as you walk into Dr. Hogan's cute, sunny, clean office any apprehensions you may have about allowing someone to poke and prod in your mouth immediately wash away.  I've never had to wait more than 3 minutes to be called to the back for my appointment to begin and Dr. Hogan's dental hygenists are super gentle and efficient.  Dr. Hogan herself is lovely and so kind and professional.  She doesn't exude that preconceived \"scary dentist\" notion at all.  I really like going to a dentist's office that is small and offers personalized care without long lines and waits.  Kudos to her office manager for never giving me slack about my constantly changing schedule when I call, too!
