omfg i LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.. parisan macaron's are GINORMOUS and SO cheap.  I loved the pistachio macarons and raspberry macarons!!! The bakery was located right below from where i was staying in the venentian.    If you ever go to New York or Las Vegas, you HAVE to try this place.. i can't wait for the next time i go to las vegas cause my mouth is watering just thinking about those ginormous macarons.  Until then i guess i'll just have to pay for overpriced tiny ass macarons :(.  Til we meet again sweet airy delicious macarons. \n\nPST.. my cousin tried to eclairs  and she said they were pretty good.  If that's the case, going to the actual store is going to be on my to do list!
