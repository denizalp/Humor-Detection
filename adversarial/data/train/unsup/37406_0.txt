This Chili's HATES children!!\n\nExcuse us Chili's if your kids menu does not fulfill our preschool-age child's special dietary needs, and we bring food to meet her needs.  We are two adults who pay for full dinners, appetizers, deserts, and beverages.  Not like we're bringing in a cooler of food for anyone of us!  We particularly were offended by the waitress\/busgirl who wasn't even waiting on our table, but had a huuuuge problem with a child's special dietary needs.  Furthermore, we were offended by the rude (and sweaty and smelly) manager of the restaurant who was summoned to our table by the offensive waitress, and pretended not to know why he was there!  Stop acting like children, Chili's management, and treat the real children with some respect.  Every one of your about 50 competitors in a 3 minute distance has no problem with children with special diets, so I suggest you grow up!  But for us, don't worry, we will never, ever, step foot inside your door again.
