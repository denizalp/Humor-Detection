Noodle perfection! This place is way better than Noodle Pot in Chinatown.  Rumor has it, this is the same family that ran the Beijing Noodle Cafe over on the east side.  Seems like they made a good business decision by moving to this new location, since it was packed with Asians during lunch time and there was even a short wait.  The noodles are hand made and if you come at the right time you can see them pulling the dough and making the noodles.  We got to witness the \"knife shaving\" of the noodles, since they have an open kitchen and we were sitting at the bar.  \n\nOnto the food, I had a really hard time deciding what to get since I wanted to order everything but we went with:\n\n1. Mongolian Beef Pancake $5 - the dough was nice and crispy with a little bit of chewiness with tender beef patty inside, served with daikon and soy dipping sauce.  I suggest shoving the daikon into the dough pocket before dipping, for ultimate umami flavor.\n\n2.  Shangxi Knife Sliced Soup Noodle $8 - this is pretty much the non-spicy version of the Lan Zhou beef noodle soup for those with heart burn like me.  The soup was flavorful and the beef was melt in the mouth tender.  Honestly, if you aren't a big eater....you can definitely share a bowl of noodles.  The noodles were the perfect texture...chewy\/al dente...no soggy noodles here!\n\n3. Sliced Pork and Mushroom Noodle (Dry Noodle) $8 - I tend to like dishes that have a hint of sweetness and this is a good combo of salty and sweet.  And who doesn't like multiple types of mushrooms with tender slices of pork belly.\n\nAll the noodle dishes were cooked to perfection and honestly this is one of the best cheap meals in town...the only problem we really ran into was service.  They missed our appetizer order and we had to re-order that after our noodles came out.  But hey, Asian joints are notorious for bad service...so what can you really expect.
