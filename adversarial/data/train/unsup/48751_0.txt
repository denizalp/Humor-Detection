I received the quote from this company and I found that their estimate to be higher than others by 30% to 40%. I believe this was based on the timeline that I gave them but I don't plan to use them. I found another reparable general contractor that is willing to do the work for far less with better yelp ratings. I'm not saying use them or not to use them. I'm suggesting to get other quotes and compare.
