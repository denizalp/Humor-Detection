Dripps Soft Opening is this week so we stopped by to try out their selection! Here's the vanilla soft serve with oreo mixed in, topped with pocky sticks. It's amazing how the infusion of their ingredients create a completely new experience. They served it in a delicious waffle cone decorated with a sweet drizzle. It felt like we were kids again eating ice cream on a hot summer day. I definitely recommend trying this spot out, they have a variety of mix-ins and add-ons for you to choose to your hearts desire. I'm excited to return again and test out more combinations!!
