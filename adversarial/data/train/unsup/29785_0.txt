I was a regular at Cousins off Cactus several years ago, and on a recent trip back home to visit the parents I thought I would stop in here and grab a bite of nostalgia (we don't have Cousins in Denver). I knew I was in Scottsdale when the one woman in front of us in line took 15 minutes to complain to the cashier about how they do things at Cousins. They literally went back and forth for this long because she was unhappy that they do not have a list of toppings anywhere on their menu and she couldn't see what they have like at SUBWAY. I wanted to smack the lady, this place isn't Subway, IMO it used to be MUCH better than Subway! \n\nFinally after waiting patiently and admiring the cashier's cheery nature we placed our order and I had an Italian sub on wheat. I don't know if it was my choice in bread or what, but I really recommend going with one of their specialty breads over something plain because the sandwich just wasn't as good as I remembered them. I might be inclined to go back and give them another shot if I was in the area, but IMO there's much better options a stone's throw away. They had our sandwiches out really quick though so I am giving them 3 stars instead of 2.
