Definitely won't be going back again. I got a mani-pedi. Requested shellac on my toes and full set on my hands with acrylic. The pedi was done nicely but I had to wait half an hour to get my Mani done. The nail tech who did my fingernails told me the salon doesnt do acrylic. I was unaware that they were doing  gel nails (I had never gotten gel nails before) and then without consulting me also applied shellac. Initially I was told one price and charge way more and the prices didn't add up in the end. I was charged $130 which I feel is WAY too much and I was taken advantage of. Will never go back here as they ripped me off, and I recommend getting prices layed out clearly if you aren't experienced with nails like I was!
