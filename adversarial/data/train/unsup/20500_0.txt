Since multiple concurrent projects and Life In General have kept me up a lot more than my normal Xtr33m Vampiric Evil schedule necessitates, Aloha Kitchen has been my lifesaver when the Triscuits and Dack Janiels in my desk threaten to detach my fingernail grip on sanity. I've discovered that one can play \"Adobo Omelet\" drinking games, i.e. if you consume a bay leaf, take a shot! The styrofoam box it comes in is also ludicrously heavy that I can't help but giggle uncontrollably in hentai-schoolgirl bursts when I swear I can't take another bite, oh no the smell itself is making me nauseous, how the hell can someone eat this much in one sitting......then pop the fridge open after 2 hours and praise God that it's still there! Make sure to keep the rice cooker on standby when you get the Loco Moco; their particular blend is beaucoup SAUCY!  And will necessitate additional rice to quell the sometimes-salty sensations. Local Plate last night got a lot of seaweed musubi wrap in my teeth; perfect for the post-second-date makeout session. \n\nStudent specials (sub-$5), Tapsilog in the morning, and consistent Chicken Katsu give me many reasons to list the Kitchen among the daily expenditures. Now if only I could complain about \"it's too umame, could you cut back on the umame?\" with a straight face, then I know I've won at life.
