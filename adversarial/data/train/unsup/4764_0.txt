the BEST dining experience ever!!! \n\njoel robuchon is not just a restaurant...it's a journey that takes you to an unimaginable destination, full of surprises and hopes. let me clarify this first. this was not the best food i had, at least in terms of individual course, but the ambiance, service and presentation were exceptional, bar none, nothing short of perfection. it is not to say the food was subpar, but looking back, i believe joel robuchon's focus is on using the best and freshest quality ingredients to shine on their own rather than balancing each of their flavors to create something new out of them. \n\nso, allow me to take you on a journey to this magical destination... \n\na gold limo (courtesy of mgm, but please tip the drivers!) picked us up from our hotel and took us to the mansion at mgm which was jaw dropping magnificent. a hostess then met us at the garden and escorted us to the restaurant which actually is near the main floor of us \"commoners\" casino. the interior was surprisingly bright and intimate with about 20 tables, rich purple, white and gold colors of fabric, delicate orchids and some wild animal figurines. \n\nimmediately upon seating, we were given food and wine menus. the wine menu was quite overwhelmingly extensive, but fortunately the food menu listed just 4 different prix fixe options and 1 degustation tasting menu. i went with the 2 course menu ($150) and the hubby chose the 4 course one ($180) which turned out to be more than we could stomach after our buffet brunch (not a good idea if you want to go all out with the 16 course degustation option). \n\nevery prix fixe started with amuse bouche, a generous spread of black caviar on a bed of crab in light fennel cream. i am not used to eating briny caviar without crackers to thin out the flavor, but this was excellent in terms of textural contrast and balance; the \"pop\" of caviar and creamy, soft crab meat. \n\n2 course menu: \n* entree\/appetizer - la langoustine ($35 supplement) \nthe waiter said this was joel robuchon's signature dish, and i would not argue that. three small ravioli stuffed with truffled langoustine and chopped cabbage, garnished by strips of nori, were creamy, rich and everything you could ask for in anticipation for the next course. \n\n* main course - le bar \npan fried sea bass and octopus with lemon grass, baby leek and artichoke hearts. i was a bit shocked that the sea bass was not fully cooked, but rather seared, which made the fish a bit stringy.  the octopus, on the other hand, was absolutely perfect. the way to truly enjoy this dish was to eat all of the ingredient together in one bite. all the vegetables used in this dish truly complemented subtle flavors of seafood.     \n\n4 course meal: \n* entree\/appetizer - sorry, but i cannot remember the french name \n4 thin slices of scallop on top of baby carrots, garnished with useless daikons. there was no cooking, no imagination, no sense in this dish. the presentation was really amateur and nothing on the plate was relevant. \n\n* soup - la chataigne \nlight chestnut veloute with bits of foie gras and smoked lardon form. this soup redeemed failure of hubby's appetizer course. so light yet substantial, so delicate yet robust...infused with heavenly pork fat, this savory flavor brought out the earthy, velvety sweetness of chestnut and hint of creamy foie. make sure to spoon it all the way down to the bottom of the bowl where foie and chestnut pieces are layed. \n\n* main course - le riz \nsaffron flavored rice with chunks of butter roasted lobster and sweet english peas in spiced bouillon. more like paella than risotto consistency despite the presence of broth, the rice stayed firm and full of flavors. overall, not something i'd order again due to its simplicity, especially considering the amount we shelled out. \n\n* dessert - le chocolat \ncoffee ice cream atop guanaja chocolate ganache, puffed rice (yes, the rice krispies cereal), marshmallow like cream and lemon confit. it seemed like an odd combination of ingredients, but the end result was amazing. each ingredient had strong flavors yet nothing overpowered nor canceled each other. the chocolate was creamy and not overly sweet, the citrus flavor was light and refreshing, and the rice krispies added another dimension to this dessert. \n\n******* \ngoing over 5000 character limit...i will follow up with \"update\". trust me, the best has yet to come!
