I've been coming to this salon for the last few years and I must say that I've never been disappointed! I had a different stylist every time and they've all done a great job. Today I got a cut from Saki and it's really superb (much better than my last cut at an expensive high end salon, by the way). And at $35 (including wash), what not to like?!
