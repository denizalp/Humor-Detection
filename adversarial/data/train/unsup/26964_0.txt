I will compare this place to the only other Tex Mex places I have been in the GTA and know well - Chipotle and Chorizo. La  Torilleria is not in the same class in terms of taste and freshness.\n\nI went in with an open mind but it was disappointing and having frequented the other two places mentioned above, they are far tastier.\n\nAlthough I would say the decor is equally bad in both Chorizo and La Torilleria, if you want inexpensive good Tex Mex, try Chipotle or Chorizo.
