My colleagues and I were hoping a new noodle restaurant would open in the area and our prayers were answered. The broth, the fresh hand-made noodles and the tender beef is just delicious. They offer a few side dishes that I have yet to try but will in the future.  The beef they serve is a sliced beef, we asked if they will be serving beef brisket and they said yes, in the future. The noodles are served flat or round and both are offered in three different sizes. I did try the biggest flat noodle and it was a bit difficult to eat so choose a smaller noodle for easier eating. Definitely recommended.
