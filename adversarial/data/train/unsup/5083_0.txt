absolutely terrible im sorry but everything about this restaurant makes me want to hurl and i swear to all the ramen gods that i will NEVER set foot into this place again.\n\nfirst off, i find the servers extremely awkward (maybe it has to do with the fact that they are young and inexperienced yet but still) \n\nsecond, the ramen was just dreadful. i got the spicy flavoured one with: sea salt, pork belly and thick noodles. the ramen was not your typical Japanese ramen. to me it was like idk spaghetti noodles like EXCUUUUUSE ME I AINT GONNA PAY NO $10 for SOME DAMN SPAGHETTI NOODLES also it wasn't cooked throughly (still tasted a bit hard) the portion was too small for what i paid for and not to mention the presentation was just an embarrassment. i would've taken a picture but i didn't want to burden my phone with such a horrendous thing. the flavours weren't very compatible and the chilli oil had a weird aftertaste idk\n\nanyways yeah overall just terrible. and i got a real bad stomachache after it now lemme say HOMEGIRL here has a pretty strong stomach but yeah this caused me to feel extremely disgusted and expect to sit at the toilet a few times just saying LOOL  \n\noh yeah another thing i find it ridiculous that I have to pay for extra toppings like excuse me?! WHY DO CHOPPED ONIONS HAVE TO BE $1.00?! AM I PAYING TO EAT ONION GOLD?! DOES IT TAKE THAT MUCH SKILL TO CHOP SOME ONIONS LIKE jeez sorry my opinion but yeah redonculous.
