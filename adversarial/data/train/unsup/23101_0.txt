I was here last night, mainly to finally meet some Yelp friends for a UYE.  I've been to other UYE's, but never to one in Las Vegas (where I live).  There's a first for everything and had a great time sharing personal and Yelp stories with everyone.  5 Stars for the UYE, 4 Stars for the restuarant ambiance & staff, and 3 Stars for the food & prices. \n\nMy Eats:\n-Short Ribs (Beef):  This was my food highlight.  Dr. Pepper braised ribs that was so delicious.  Thanks Shawn H. for suggesting this.  You can smell and taste the Dr. Pepper with each tender bite.  The ribs are perfectly placed on top of Polenta Cornbread.  You have to eat this with fork to get the full experience. Their Short Ribs were worth the additional wait. Forgot to take a picture because I was so hungry by the time it arrived. \n\n-Bantam Burgers which is two beef sliders with white cheese.  I have actually had better.  Doesn't compare to 808 Tapas' sliders and messy for a slider. At least these were decently sized. \n\n-Fries and Tater Tots:  No my order, picked on Christina W's. Just okay, nothing special.  Better tots at Sonic's. \n\nPros:\n-Nice ambiance, wide open and not dark like some other tapas locations.\n-TV by the kitchen bar so you're not missing the game.\n-Not a busy restaurant. New and not many know about this place.  As a result, getting seated shouldn't be an issue.\n-Service:  Even though there was a little snafu with one of my orders, they more than made up for it. Tons of employees for a average sized restaurant.  There's always someone available to take additional request and top your drinks off (i.e water, no booze). \n-Located on the east side of Las Vegas.  Not too many eats out here on the east side, Nosh & Swig is a change of pace\n\nCons:\n-Parking.  Small parking lot up front with a handful only being 15 minutes.  Parking at the back is an alternative.\n-Food is just okay for the price. \n-No swig at this joint.\n\nThere's still a lot more for me to try on the menu.  Still want to try their Monte Cristo, Steve-O Grilled Cheese, Smokey Poke, and Salmon Skewers. \n\nPS:\n-Thanks Molly T. for putting this together\n-Thanks Stephanie S. for pulling my leg to finally show up for my first Las Vegas UYE.
