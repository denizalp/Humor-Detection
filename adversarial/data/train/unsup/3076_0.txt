This could be the best dive bar ever and I love that Google Maps can't find it. If you are looking for it, it's across the street from the house in \"A Christmas Story.\" The Rowley Inn is a great place to go with a few friends for cheap drinks and a quiet atmosphere where you can enjoy one another's company. The couple times I've been there it was dead but still a charming bar to hang out in. Pay a visit but don't go in with hipster high expectations or you'll be disappointed.
