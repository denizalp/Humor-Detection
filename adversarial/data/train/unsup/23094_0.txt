Came here in search for a durian frozen beverage, but found out that Pho Dam stopped offering durian shakes about three months ago.  PD now offers three flavors, all made from fresh fruit: mango, soursop, and strawberry.  I chose mango and soursop.  Since these are made fresh-to-order, there was a bit of a wait.  For those with allergies, you may want to inquire about how to avoid cross-contamination, since I am not sure if Pho Dam has more than one food processor\/machine to make these shakes.  (I'm allergic to strawberries, and the thought about cross-contamination occurred to me as she was making these shakes, and I decided to hope for the best.)\n\nMom and I found the soursop to be too sweet.  If I didn't have the mango to make comparisons with, then I would say the soursop is OK, if a bit too simple\/monotonal, but between the two, I'd just order the mango!  It definitely tasted fresh, and made of real, delicious mangoes, and not just ice, sugar, and mango flavoring.\n\nI didn't ask, but I'm assuming these were served in 12 oz. plastic glasses, based on the size.  Each were just under $5, tax included.  \n\nI'd return for more mango shakes.  Pho Dam, please bring back durian, and how about offering more varieties, such as cantaloupe and raspberry?  Perhaps on a rotating, seasonal schedule?  \n\nOh, how I wish I weren't allergic to strawberry and avocado...
