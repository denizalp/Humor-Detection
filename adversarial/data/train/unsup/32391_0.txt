Super intimate restaurant with an innovative approach to maximizing their space without foregoing comfort: the bar chairs looked comfortable and it's a lot better than trying to pack people in like sardines.  Thankfully they were able to accommodate my request for a proper table but I guess that depends on what other reservations they have.  \n\nThe menu is interesting - a lot of bone marrow I feel.  \nTo start I had the squid which came with avocado tempura and guacamole - I found it a little odd to have avocado twice but everything was cooked perfectly and it was delicious. \n\nFor main course I had the salmon with hazelnut, shrimp and sweet potato. Absolutely delicious.  \n\nThe chocolate souffl√© took a while as they can only cook one at a time so the wait was longer than 20 minutes but it was worth it.  The sauce was a little rich and I think it would have been nice to have something to contrast it more rather than more chocolate.  \n\nOverall the restaurant was accommodating to dietary needs and provided tasty food in a lovely environment.  \n\nI took a star off as a few little things were off: the mock tails were inventive but limited and the service was good but a little lacking in the personal touch.
