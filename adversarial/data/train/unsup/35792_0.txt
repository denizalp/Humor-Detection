As a visitor to Toronto, I had gone to about a 5 or 6 coffee shops before coming to Jimmy's (it was on my list from a previous trip but I hadn't gotten around to it). While I love coffee and I might even be a coffee snob, I am not a fan of pretentious coffee culture. Do the things that make you happy with your coffee. When you walk into a coffee shop, expectations are set by what you see, how you're treated and what kind of machinery\/menu the shop has. \n\nThis place came off as really pretentious. I almost couldn't stomach how much of a performance everything was. In the end, I got my espresso, found it to be decent but not great (despite the equipment and what seemed like really skilled baristas). For a place that comes off so pretentious, their coffee blends didn't have much of any explanation on them (they just had what some folks might think are cool\/witty names) and were priced pretty high.\n\nI probably won't visit another Jimmy's after this experience.
