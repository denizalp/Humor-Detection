Have eaten here numerous times. One week was there three times and the other week twice. Review is for dinner. Have not been here for lunch or brunch. Will post updates when that happens.\n\nYoung staff, friendly and accomodating during every visit here. This is a busy establishments. Patrons coming in to pick up and take out meals as well as customers dining at restaurant. See families here and regulars enjoying their meals.\n\nHave not tried their pizza yet, but their House Calzone is amazing. Something about the crust so tasty and filling is yummy with peppers, pepperoni, mushroom, onions, etc...\n\nSweet potato fries with blue cheese (comes in a container). Also my favorite. So use to blue cheese with buffalo chicken wings and on salads but on sweet potato fries. Three times that week for dinner we ordered sweet potato fries with blue cheese. \n\nGarlic knots are served with every meal. Like them heated up for they are soft n chewy. \n\nDo not forget to get dessert. Who knew their desserts were so good.
