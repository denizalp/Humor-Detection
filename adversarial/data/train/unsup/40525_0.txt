Despite my experience at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino on 1\/4 I came here for dinner with my guy and another couple from a wedding we attended earlier that day. I have always loved Hard Rock because I'm a huge rock and roll fan and love going to a place that plays great music and music videos and has memorabilia hanging. \n\nThis location, like the others, was outstanding like the others I have been to previously. I can't remember our waiter's name but his name tag did say Shaggy. He was so friendly and just hilarious! He had great suggestions on food and drinks and we talked about music. He even brought over the very nice music manager who took requests from us and played them. I had requested Simple Man by Lynard Skynard which they didn't have but they had the Shinedown version so he played that. The rest of what we requested, The Doors, Hendrix, etc were all played. \n\nI had duo fajitas and they were really good. The seasoning was amazing and the char on the chicken was perfect. All in all really great food and atmosphere. I will continue to go to Hard Rock Cafes!
