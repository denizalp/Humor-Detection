I've been to some really great pawn shops (it's where I got my bass guitar in high school), but Pawn America is not one of them. My mind is truly boggled with how they stay in business - almost everything I looked at was priced higher than it is new in stores. For example - a used Kitchen Aid stand mixer was priced at $349; the same mixer retails at your average big box store for about $200. If it was new and unopened I could see $150, but I just don't understand the logic in pricing it at almost double its value. Same goes for their dSLRs. Also, randomly, their football jerseys. Curiosity had me bopping around the store doing random price checks.\n\nThey have a pretty big selection of DVDs and CDs that are fairly priced - $2 for a used DVD seems normal. Their musical instruments seem pretty on point as well. Overall, though, you're probably better off reading the sale papers for deals on new items if you're looking to save a buck.
