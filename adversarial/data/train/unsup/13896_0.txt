HUBBA BABBA! HOLY MOLY! OH MY GAWD! GAWD DAYAM YESSS!! That's what ran through my head when our food arrived at our table. But what I really uttered through my lips was only \"oh my gawd! That's alllllot of food! Proportions are fricken huge here!\"\n\nMarie B, I'm upset at you. You've been holding back. Why have you only recently introduced me to this place? I should of been dining here on the regular ever since your initial visit. But better late than never...\n\nThe food here is mmmmmm gooooooood.... verrrrry gooooood....\n\nWe started off with assorted perogies - damn good! One of the best I've ever had. As my main, I had the Friday special (only $14.50) - comes with soup, fillet of sole, potatoes, beet salad, cucumber salad and coleslaw. I chose the mushroom soup - damn good! & homemade for sure! The rest of my meal - you got it, all damn good!\n\n3 of my companions had the potato pancake filled with meat & gravy (aka goulash) that Kim B writes about in a previous review. And she's right, I too stared at their dish green with envy (but I don't eat meat on Fridays during Lent). But no worries. I was able to take some home. And even the day after it was damn good!\n\nOur other companion had the ribs and that too was apparently damn good! (I didn't try any though.)\n\nGreat, efficient service. Very reasonable prices - I'd say you get too much for what you pay for. Tasty, hearty, delicious Polish food. Cozy ambiance.  We did however get a few initial odd glares from some customers - don't think they've seen 4 Filipinos accompanying 1 Caucasian step foot into the restaurant at the same time before. But that doesn't matter...\n\nI will return. I already know what I'll be ordering - perogies to start and the potato pancake with goulash plus there'll be lots leftover to bring home! I love it when restaurants give too much food!
