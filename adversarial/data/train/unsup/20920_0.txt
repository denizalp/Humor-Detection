I think Arik and Eric summed it up pretty well. WOW I was under the impression I never had to pay cover......anywhere.........EVER!! I almost had 30 years of this luck I guess because that streak was broken last night and it was not worth it IMO. I should have stayed at FEZ and followed Thomas & Rickie home. *sigh* Really!?!?! Who's idea was this anyway!?!?! I got poked and prodded like a cow here which I usually dont mind so much but there was definitely attitude here that I dont really care to experience again. I was watching the bartender \"Her name was Naomi\" let's just say I prob wouldnt order anything but beer here and leave it at that.
