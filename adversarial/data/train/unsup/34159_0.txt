3 Course Lunch for $25! What an amazing and delicious deal. Started with the Mezze platter which had some great hummus and fresh Lebaneh along with a delicious spinach pastry. The pita was hot and baked fresh. It was also served with bread and olive oil which were quite good. I had the Mediterranean Sea Bass which was a whole fish in a light sauce with capers. Good flavor. The walnut cake for dessert was good but the texture was a bit odd for me. Overall a great deal and a delicious meal. The Mezze was my favorite. Would definitely return to try the other options.
