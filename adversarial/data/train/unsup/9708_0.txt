DUN DUN DUNNNNN. The One and Only. The mecca of all raves in America. \n\nFirst things first... A lot of people are experimenting during EDC, and the last thing you need to do is die. PLEASE get help anytime you feel like something is wrong. It is far better to be safe than to never see tomorrow. Rest when you need to. Ask the ground control team for help when you are scared. See the EMTs if you are worried about something. Drink tons of water. \n\n***Now onto the good vibes... ***\n\nPeople say that EDC is like none other. At first I thought they were full of shit and being dramatic, but truly... IT'S LIKE NONE OTHER. Call me bat shit nuts, but you just gotta believe me- this is a life changing event. I've been around the world a few times, and EDC cracks the top 3 most life changing experiences I've ever had. \n\nHaving just gotten back from my first EDC, this rave is so next level. If you love electronic music and the culture, this should be the priority over any other festival for next year, no matter how long you have to save or how many other vacations you have to pass on. \n\nMore than any other rave, there is such a sense of community, friendship, PLUR (peace, love, unity, and respect), and togetherness. Can't even make it up. People are SO receptive to meeting others, dancing with strangers, and high fiving everyone that comes into their paths. You've never made so many friends in your life.\n\nOverwhelm your senses. Massive fireworks shows that outlast your expectations. Just when you think it's over... it keeps going. And then it goes on some more. Stand back in wonder as the fireworks go off in sync with music above your head.\n\nThere is SO much to look at when at EDC that you can't possibly get bored, even if you are stone cold sober. It is truly just that fantastic. Lights on lights on lights. Tons of colors, lights, and activities everywhere you go. It is absolutely beautiful, and they just KILL IT with the energy, venue set up, and extra details that make EDC extra special.\n\nThere are several main stages (like 7?) along with smaller sponsored tents with live DJs. Roaming LED floats of Pacmen, boom boxes, and anything crazy that the fine folk at Insomniac can dream up. \n\nOnto the details! \n\nTRAFFIC: \nA nightmare. Since this is not changing, my only suggestion is that you leave EARLY; would you rather get there way early and sit in less traffic or get there late after sitting in two hours of traffic? \n\nTRAFFIC TIP: So I'm not doing myself any favors by sharing this, but this is something most people actually don't think of- DO NOT follow the directions that your GPS gives you. Instead, take a look at Google Maps ahead of time on your phone, and take surface roads as far as you can while avoiding red roads (like I-15), which = bad traffic congestion. You can get hella farther a lot faster if you just have your wingman read the map to the driver instead of following the GPS direction, which is what 80% of EDC attendees are probably doing.\n\nIf you have seen Dash Berlin or Galantis close, I swear that it's absolutely worth it to stay until the very end each night, so don't let traffic deter you.\n\nTHE STAFF: Beyond amazing. People refilling waters, staff encouraging you to dance and be safe, and everyone else in between. \n\nThe cops at this venue are awesome, too! One even wanted to trade candy (bracelets) with me as I was dancing from one stage to another and said hi while passing by. \n\nTIPS:\n1. Bring a Camelbak. This will be your LIFELINE, especially at EDC, which is HOT HOT HOT as the heat still rises off the pavement at sunset. Have your own and do not rely on a friend in case you split up. If you don't want to die at EDC, having a Camelbak will help contribute to staying alive. DO NOT get a water bottle. Who wants to carry something while they are dancing???\n\n2. In addition to a Camelbak, bring a small fanny pack to store all of your valuables like your ID, phone, and money. I've had two phones pickpocketed from my Camelbak at raves. \n\n3. Bring your own wet wipes\/ anti-bac wipes in your Camelbak. Festivals run out of water by the first hour and hand sanitizer by the first few hours of everyday. \n\n4. Toilets: AVOID non-portable toilets that are specifically male or female. That's how you end up waiting for 20 minutes to pee instead of waiting 2 minutes. Also, when at the portable toilets, walk to the VERY END of the enclosure, and you'll almost never wait to go pee. Promise.\n\n5. Set your phone on night screen and battery saving mode. Leave the photo of the lineup as your lock screen.\n\n6. ***HAVE A MEET-UP SPOT with your friends before you even split off. Find something that doesn't move and is easy to locate, no matter what state you are in. That way ya'll can meet for certain sets, and if people get lost and lose phones, you'll always know where to meet at the end of the night.***\n\nFor me, now we wait.. only 51 more weeks until the next EDC...
