This was our 3rd time here.  What a shame that not more come to check it out.  I loved the Sunrise Tofu with the peanut curry sauce.  I specified a spiciness level of 7 and it was just right.  My husband wasn't crazy about the ginger-flavored shrimp (can't remember what it was called) but it was more of a personal preference.  He said it was actually pretty good and definitely a hit with somebody who likes that flavor.
