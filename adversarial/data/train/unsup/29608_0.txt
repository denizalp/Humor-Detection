I grew up with Greek neighbors across the street. I feel quite lucky to have homemade meals by these neighbors. The food at Kyklos is legit. Everything was fresh and full of flavor. Also, the owners (especially Sof) were so kind. Not just to the customers, but they are so patient and very nice to their employees. We were in Henderson for a wedding and stumbled upon Kyklos at the mall while shopping. If I didn't live in LA and close to Henderson, I would eat at Kyklos all the time!!!
