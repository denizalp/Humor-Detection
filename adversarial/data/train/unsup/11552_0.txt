It was hidden away on the second floor.  I got a $50 coupon, so I went.  What a pleasant surprise! \n\nI sat at the bar, and the bartender had an in-depth knowledge of how the food was prepared, even though he really didn't need to.  It was the best service I've had in ages.\n\nThe lobster bisque soup had a very nice presentation, with how he poured it right in front of me.  It had such an intricate flavor, which the bartender said came from the truffle.  The filet mignon was one of the better ones I've had.  When I didn't like the spinach, he gave me asparagus instead.
