I'm a fan of the Yard House, so when I saw that there was a location at the Desert Ridge Mall, I had to stop by for lunch.  I ordered some Sliders & Fries and a pint of Green Flash IPA:\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/p9v9Sl2g_ibaajWvO0NjkQ?select=sy9P0ShsAXZrv2H-CVje9g\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/p9v9Sl2g_ibaajWvO0NjkQ?select=9i6Nv0PT-Uye96zJrz8W3A\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/p9v9Sl2g_ibaajWvO0NjkQ?select=uK60mVysXfTVfvznGgsozg\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/p9v9Sl2g_ibaajWvO0NjkQ?select=4AbpvM3j4KJYChtYIz-SFw\n\nThe Sliders & Fries were pretty good.  You get a stack of 4 Sliders and a pile of Fries.  The IPA went down smooth with the meal...yum!\n\nWas there during lunch hour on a Saturday, so the wait was short dining at the bar alone.  One of the best things about dining at the bar is that your glass is never empty.....\n\nReturn Factor - 90%
