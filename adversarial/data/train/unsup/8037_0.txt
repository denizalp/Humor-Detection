This was my first time at this location .. it was chosen because of the vegan\/ vegetarian options on the menu (and there are lots of items!!) .. truly something on the menu for everyone in the group..\n\nOur drink order was taken care of right away and our food order was placed .. we waited a while for our food .. be prepared for a long wait and they weren't crowded or busy..\n\nThe food however when it arrives, is full of flavor and the portions are generous.\n\nOn today's visit I had the three taco plate with rice & beans.. the tacos are served with double tortilla, the filling has great flavor (the pickled onion although pretty to look at on top of the tacos did not compliment the tacos, way to acidic).\n\nTry the salsa bar there are plenty of delicious options ..
