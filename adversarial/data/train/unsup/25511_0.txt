The white cheddar\/bacon\/raisin bread sandwich is awesome!  It might be the best sandwich I've had in Toronto (though I'd have to try Negroni again to before bestowing \"Best in Toronto\")  Nice relaxed atmosphere, and cute little patio.  No a\/c so you might not want to go when its too hot out.  Beware this is not fast food, it will take them a while (eg. 10 minutes or so) to make your sandwich and more if they have a backlog of orders.
