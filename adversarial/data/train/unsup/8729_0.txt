Love, love, love.  We went here on our first night in Vegas as we were staying in the hotel (MGM) and wanted a nearby experience so we could go home if we got tired.  We stayed out all night and watched Tiesto kill it.  So much fun, we were dancing on the table ledges and we even went back a few nights later!  (Yes, 4 days in Vegas is too much).  Definitely on my list for next time, which might just have to be next month.
