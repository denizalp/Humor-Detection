This hotel has been the worst hotel I have ever been to!!\n\n1) Hookers are roaming around the hotel at all hours of the night\n\n2) The ice bucket is so small\n\n3) There is no refrigerator whatsoever \n\n***The staff are disgustingly RUDE*****\n\nThey definitely need to make changes. My body itches from this hotel. I wake up with my nose filled with dry blood. \n\nAt all hours of the night you hear people screaming and police sirens. It is just unbearable!! \n\nNever again!!!!!
