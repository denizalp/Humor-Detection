In spite of healthy skin care practices, my teenage acne RETURNED upon moving back to Arizona from Colorado. Damn. This. Heat.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm not one of those women who flip out when a \"major breakout\" of three small zits appear. I'm talking a flood of oil, cystic acne and mega redness. NOT A GOOD LOOK AT 24.\n\nMy teenage brother recommended Dr. Kwon to me. My Dad also had MOHS surgery here when his doctor thought there was skin cancer on his nose. They both spoke of his humor (THIS DUDE IS PURE COMEDY!) and his committment to finding solutions for patients. \n\nIt's took almost a year of co-pays, reactions to the wrong topicals, not wearing make-up on my face for months at a time, trying anything and everything . . . but my face has finally returned to a clear state. It was worth it. \n\nI'm in \"maintenance\" mode now, so hoping this keeps up through our Summer of Hell until I go back in November! :)
