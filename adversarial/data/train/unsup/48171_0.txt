Well, it's been a week since my Grey's surgery and we had our first follow up appt (at no charge, I might add) and Spectre seems to be doing GREAT! Dr. Hershey not only evaluated his surgical site, but examined him for every little concern I had.  I know that the treatment choices we've agreed upon will not \"cure\" his cancer, just buy him more time and make him comfortable. She addressed beginning Naltrexone before I even had the chance to ask. I am grateful for every day I have with my \"spirit dog\" and having a Dr. that thinks outside the box. Spectre is acting like his old self... today. I'll take it :) Money well spent. (I will continue to update throughout our journey. Hoping the bridge is farther away than it was a week ago).
