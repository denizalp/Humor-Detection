I've taken my car here regularly for the past two years. The customer service workers up front are polite, friendly, and professional. I have not felt pushed into buying any extra services or parts. The pricing is a little high, which is to be expected of a chain auto center. The one thing that bothered me is that the trigger that opens my hood from inside the car was broken after I received an oil change. Now my hood does not seem to stay entirely closed. I would have normally been okay if the mechanic had been honest with me about it, and pointed it out to me after it happened. It's an old car, I can handle it. But not telling me makes me concerned about the integrity of the mechanics when more important things break.
