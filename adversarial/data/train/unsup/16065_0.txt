We had drinks at the bar, dinner at the restaurant and night at the club, overall it was a great experience. The drinks were really good and their mixologists are willing to prepare any cocktail you order. The food at the restaurant is amazing, taste and good portions. We ordered family style so we had a chance to try several dishes, all very well prepared. The service was amazing. The staff at the club was very friendly, we had a table and the waitresses were constantly on the lookout waiting to pour our drinks, always nice and smiling. We had a great night.
