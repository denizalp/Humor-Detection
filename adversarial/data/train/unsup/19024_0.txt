I have been here a few times, and I must say this is probably the best Chinese buffet in Montreal.  Normally the food at buffets is stale and sometimes cold and lacking, but I can't get enough of this place! I always get the wonton soup (which is delish), and fill my first plate with equal heaping piles of fried rice and broccoli, and then add on an egg roll, some chicken on a stick and general tao. I absolutely adore the fried rice and broccoli; thinking about it now, I must admit is making me salivate. After downing the first plate, I pretty much made the same plate a second time around; except instead of the chicken and egg roll, I got more broccoli and shrimp (which you grill yourself). For dessert, a couple of fresh sugar doughnuts and a mix of cappuccino and chocolate ice cream. \n\nAnd so ensued the food\/msg coma, which was well worth it. I always try to get my 20$ worth, regardless if it leaves me sluggish and full!
