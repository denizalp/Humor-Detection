I came with my boyfriend for a drink on Friday night, because we were in the area.  I was pleasantly surprised when we walked in.  It was a cool industrial style bar with an awesome history.  I liked learning a bit about the Pittsburgh steel business just by reading the menu!  There were lots of beers to choose from and they had beer flights available too (4 for $10).  We tried some beer which was great and a side of Brussels sprouts.  I have had better Brussels sprouts, these were a bit too chopped up for me, but they were ok.  As for the drinks and atmosphere I'm definitely a fan!
