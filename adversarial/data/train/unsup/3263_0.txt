It is clear to me that the creators of Yuan Vegetarien dove into my dreams in an attempt to create my perfect restaurant. They got a few of the minor details wrong (the server should be Ricardo Montalb√°n, and the music should contain lyrics regarding whether the \"pink\" or \"green\" hypothesis is the best explanation for how perfect my girlfriend is), but they got all of the major parts correct.\n\nThey always (lunch or dinner) have a \"buffet\" menu available. It is $18-$20 and is set up where you tick selections off of a paper menu and then they freshly prepare small portions to bring out to you. The process repeats (with new paper menus) until you are about to enter a food coma, and then they offer you a fortune cookie. I have never been able to eat the fortune cookie. A highlight of the buffet menu is the General Tso's \"Chicken.\"\n\nThe buffet menu is a large subset of their full menu. The full menu includes a huge variety of both straightforward vegetable dishes (e.g., Ginger and Basil Eggplant) and fake meat dishes (e.g., Pepper \"Steak\" and various \"Seafood\" Sushi). A highlight of the full menu is the General Tso's \"Chicken.\"\n\nFor lunch, they have available a small selection of Lunch Specials for under $10. This price includes extras like soup and fruit. Depending on the dish, it might come served in a colorful Bento Box with even more extras like crispy sesame seed something-or-others. A highlight of the Lunch Specials menu is the General Tso's \"Chicken.\"\n\nThe quality of the food varies from \"Excellent\" to \"OMG what deal with Lucifer did you strike such that you are able to prepare this perfection on Earth you Faustian restauranteurs?\" The fake meat dishes sometimes are delicious without being realistic (e.g., Orange \"Beef\"), and sometimes are delicious and are realistic (e.g., Pepper \"Steak\"). Yuan Vegetarien's awesomeness is increased by having a freezer section up front where you can purchase their wide range of meat replacers for use in your own cooking.\n\nBefore I end my review, I would like to specially highlight the General Tso's \"Chicken,\" just in case I have overlooked mentioning it in this review. It is the second best General Tso's Chicken I have ever had in my life, and I am including all of the dishes I had *prior* to becoming a vegetarian. The only better preparation I have had was over a decade ago at the Princess Hotel in Israel. However, a quick internet search has revealed to me that the Chinese Restaurant at that hotel is now a French Restaurant, clearing the way for Yuan's dish to hold the current \"World's Best\" title.
