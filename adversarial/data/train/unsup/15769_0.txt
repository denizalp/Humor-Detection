Weird restaurant name but good reviews on Yelp, sounds like a place worth trying.  First of all, the restaurant has a fresh interior which is very clean and spacious.  This is a contrast to the neighborhood which is a bit on the sketchy side (Eastside of Las Vegas).  We made it out alive, so it's not that bad.\n\nFor $26, it's a few dollars more than it's AYCE peers.  Is it worth it?  There is nothing to complain about the sushi, a good rice to fish ratio, precise cuts and fish is of decent quality.  The sashimi is limited to one serving per person and it's worth it, it's a much higher grade than anticipated.  Service is pretty good, with consistent check ins to make sure we placed our orders.\n\nThe honey toast was a downer, it's just a sweet bread roll that is slightly toasted with some honey and a scoop of ice cream.  Stick with the ice cream instead\n\nThe verdict, I would say it's worth just on the sashimi itself.
