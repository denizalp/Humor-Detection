We decided we'd get something different for dinner and I was off to Buldogis which has been on my radar for a few months.  Driving out of Village Square one evening, I spied Buldogis so now I knew where to go.\n\nFor the two of us, I got a Smoked dog, an Angry dog, a small regular fries, and an order of Euro special fries.  I enjoyed the small amount of heat with my Angry dog.  I'd say it was more of an irritated dog than angry.  Perhaps I should have added jalape√±o slices so my dog was a bit more angry.\n\nMy wife liked her Smoked dog.  The slaw and garlic mayo were very good.  The Euro fries were tasty too. \n\nI was so glad I got things to go.  There is so much topping on the dogs that it gets your hands full of liquid and toppings as they are squeezed off the dog no matter how gently you hoist that doggie!  That's not a problem.  It's just that I'm glad I could be sloppy in the privacy of mine own home rather than dribbling in public.\n\nOne downer--in looking at the photos, I saw Vegas J's photo of some bread pudding she'd had for dessert.  No dice.  They don't do desserts anymore.  Oh well, I still have a few 'Lette macarons from my last trip to LA so I had a Plan B that was quite good.\n\nThe order was made quickly and the counter guy was very helpful and polite.  Everything was A-OK!
