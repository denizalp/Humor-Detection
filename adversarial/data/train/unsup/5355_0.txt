Coffee is something hard to find on Main Street in Las Vegas, until I discovered this jem that I have passed up so many times. Well I have learned and now I know where to come to find coffee downtown. They make some of the best espresso drinks that I have had since leaving Seattle. It is so great to see espresso made properly and extra strong, with no sugar! \n\nThe servers here are wonderful and when they do get around to you provide the highest of quality service. It takes them some time to get to the guests since they are always so busy. It is worth the wait, I had the time today and now I am glad to have found my new downtown coffee bar. Jesse was my server and since I did the Yelp check in and ordered the flat white latte I received 20 percent off of it. The espresso was so perfect and took me back to those days in Seattle when I could find \"real coffee\" in latte form. Now one can too right here on Main in Las Vegas! Yeah!
