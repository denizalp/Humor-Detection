I was here for lunch on cinco de Mayo this year. We  obviously had to get our Mexican fix and I wasn't disappointed. It was a great day and we got a nice table at their covered outdoor area. The margaritas on special were good.. came in a plastic cup though. The guac is made right at your table. Some find that really cool, I find it gimmicky. The guac is nothing fancy, just your regular guac ingredients, tomatoes, onions, cilantro, jalape√±os and lime but yummy! I also ordered the veggie stuffed peppers and a veggie empanada both of which were excellent. The stuffed pepper appetizer is highly recommended! We ended with their tequila cake which is a tequila infused tres leche. It tasted like a regular tres leche with no sign of any tequila infusion but tasty nevertheless! For vegetarians especially, La Palapa is one of the better Mexican restaurants in the city and I'll definitely be back here again!
