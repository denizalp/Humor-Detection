This is a beautiful place! The way they've set the place up open, yet cozy, and very social with those beautiful ovens in the back as the focal point is stunning.\n\nI came for a late dinner on a Tuesday night and the place was packed both up and downstairs. Good sign!\n\nI got the special for the night which was tomato sauce, basil, garlic and buffalo ricotta. It was phenomenal. \n\nFor the 3 of us to eat, and with some sparkling water and a couple glasses of wine the bill was pretty hefty, over 100$ for 3 people!!!!\n\nQuality is good, service was good (although a little inconsistent), and I was a little bothered by the fact they charged 3$ for a bottle of sparkling water (which they make themselves) but when we finished our bottle our server brought another to the table and only charged us for the 1. Not sure if he forgot or it's standard which made me feel a little better.
