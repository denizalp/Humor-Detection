I'm so close to giving it a 4, but I can't because their signature thing - meatballs - wasn't that amazing. I got the matzoh ball soup which was really good, tender balls, hearty broth, perfect balance of salty and doughy. Then I had the poutine with mushroom gravy and a beef meatball on top. Poutine was top notch, fresh fries, melty perfect cheese curds, and delicious gravy. However, the meatball was a little dry and didn't have much flavor. \n\nBut the ambiance was nice and the staff was great, so I'd give it another go if I'm ever in town. Also would love to try their upstairs charcuterie.
