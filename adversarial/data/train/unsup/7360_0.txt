$5 martini classics on Tuesdays! My friend had the cherry bomb, $5 normally $10. Other friend had the donkey punch mule. Both strong. If not clear or don't know, caters to LBGT audience, welcome to everyone of course.\n\nVery friendly staff. Few friends and I just had drinks and a few apps. The lamb sliders were delicious. Interesting great twist on a classic appetizer. \n\nFries to share come in several choices for seasonings and garnishes, you can even mix two.
