I agree with what everyone else has to say about this place: horrible experience. I came to the ER around 1:00 am because I was having severe ear pain, and the tall, bald, white dude working behind a screen told me that my case wasn't serious and that I shouldn't even be there. After back and forth arguing of telling him why I should even be there, he finally gives in and transfers me to a nurse who proceeds to check me out. \n\nCall me sensitive, but him laughing at me for being there in the first place was super inappropriate of him- let alone, unprofessional. I was so infuriated that he would even treat me as such, that it made my experience that much worst.  I was there for a reason, I wasn't there to waste your or my time, so at least treat me like a human being. Isn't that what you're there for? The CNA's, medical coders, and other nurses that assisted me were much more understanding and sympathetic than he was. \n\nWords to management: get rid of this prick- there are better nurses out there. He ridicules people and has a really bad attitude. The guy thinks he's a \"know-it-all\" about the pain level you're in (which he has no clue about!), and if it wasn't for me being adamant about how bad my ears were hurting, I wouldn't have gotten the help I needed.
