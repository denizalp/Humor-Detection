Om nom nom. Warm and full and happy. Came right before the lunch rush. We were one of two tables occupied. It started to fill up about midway into our lunch though. Service is efficient, but not in a brusque way. Fairly pleasant, actually. Interesting thing to note: chopsticks and spoons are self serve from a container at the table. The chopsticks are disposable, but the spoons are metal. Side note: If you sit at the booths close to the door and the door opens, it can get chilly (but it's alright if you have a piping hot stew in front of you).\n\nHad:\n\nBlack goat stew ($12) - single portion. Came with purple rice. Oddly enough, my rice came when they brought the banchan to the table (about 5-10 minutes before my stew came out). What that meant was that my rice got to cool down before my stew came. Not a good thing, but something I can live with because my stew was still boiling when it came to the table. Goat stew had a lot of bean sprouts in it. I thought there wasn't that much goat, but there was a decent amount. It was shredded and boneless goat, for those of you who dislike having bones in your meat. It was quite tender, and had a mild goat taste. Soup was spicy and delicious. Love that they sprinkled perilla seeds on top. I like the crunch.\n\nDolsot bibimbap ($10) - What I really like is that the dolsot bibimbap and the regular bibimbap are the same price. Dolsot is the one in the stone bowl, for those of you who aren't familiar with the term. It usually costs a dollar more than its non stone bowl counterpart. Big bowl of bibimbap. My mom only finished about half of it.\n\nBanchan: 7 dishes here, which is a plus in my books. Kimchi, radish kimchi, sprouts, wakame salad, pickled radish, spicy fish cake slices, and dried anchovies and peanuts in a seasoned soy sauce.\n\nAwesome bonus: These prices are tax (but not tip) included. Yep. Their menu prices are exactly what you pay (sans tip)!
