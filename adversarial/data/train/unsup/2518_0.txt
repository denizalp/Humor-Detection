I have not actually stayed at the Main Street (but I know people who have), but from what I get I think other than the buffet and the less crowded casino I would stay across the bridge at the Cal.\n\nInside of the Main Street you will find the Garden Court Buffet, which on its own is a pretty good deal! I have had the breakfast buffet and the dinner buffet here and will vouch for the food. The prices are not bad as far as Vegas goes, and they are about a dollar cheaper if you have the B-connected card (players card for the Cal & Main Street). Also there is the Triple 7 Brewery and Restaurant (read my review for that, or don't, and just stick to the buffet). \n\nThe casino is not big, but there always seem to be room for more players. When the Cal is super packed, we normally just walk across the bridge and find tables easily at the Main Street.\n\nFrom the people I know that have physically stayed here, they all suggest just staying at the Cal. The parking and location of the rooms is not that great, plus you have to walk all the way across the hotel and casino to get to the rest of Fremont.
