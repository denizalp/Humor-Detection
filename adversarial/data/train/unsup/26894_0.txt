I was craving some bbq tonight and happened to stumble upon this gem.  I ordered the pork ribs (3 bones) with the Marsha Mash (the purple yam mash) and the corn on the cob. The pork was tender and juicy, with a wonderfully tangy bbq glaze. I did not want to share my dish - at all - but I did.  Across from me, my bf ordered the beef short ribs, along with the sweet and spicy coleslaw and beans.  The short ribs had the perfect amount of fat to meat ratio.  They were cooked maybe between medium-rare to medium, so it was perfect.  The coleslaw was pretty good, too.  We also had the chance to try the mac and cheese.  I usually am not a fan of mac and cheese; i think they're just basic, simple, and I can microwave some of Kraft's and throw in some additional cheese and voila - I didn't have to spend money ordering a small dish of it.  Well, the mac and cheese was brilliant.  It was so creamy and light, with a mixture of stanky-good cheese.  The chef said it had a mixture of 4 different cheeses, just magnificently delicious.  We also tried the mashed potatoes as well, with, I think it might have been pesto drizzled on top, or something similar to it, and that was good too.  However, I was still focused on that mac and cheese.  I honestly started drinking the cream from it.  \n\nWe went in at about 8pm, an hour before close, and there was only one other table occupied.  The space is pretty open, with nice tables and decor.  There were some sports posters up though, which didn't really go with the ambiance the place educed. The chef\/owner was nice, too.  He did seem a bit worn out, though. \n\n\nAnyway, if you're up for trying a new restaurant with great food that is decently priced, I would definitely give this place a try.
