Stirfry Republic is simply amazing. First off I want to say I've done a review for them on google during their opening week  (go check it out). I've been a frequent customer at least once a month since opening and never once have I had an issue. Unfortunately my order was wrong today as I asked for two different proteins and it wasn't present in my order. I only discovered this once I was home. Immediately I called them to let them know my order was charged for the proteins yet I didn't receive any (everything else in the order was perfect). I spoke with one of the employees and immediately apologized for this and said she would reach out to her manager. I was passed to Kentrisha the manger, she apologized about the situation and looked up my order. This is where they went above and beyond. Kentrisha refunded my order for the \"dish\" that was wrong, and she also offered to comp a meal. This truly made me happy as she not only fixed the \"issue\" but also delivered a \"wow\" by letting me know she would comp my meal. I had a wonderful experience in the end as always. The staff is truly well mannered, trained and simply kind. Please stop by Stirfry Republic and try their delicious food! Can't beat excellent service, food, and their amazing interior. This family owned restaurant will always keep me coming for delicious stir fry!
