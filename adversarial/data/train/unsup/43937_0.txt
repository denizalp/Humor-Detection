Dr Kim and her staff are outstanding.\nI think Dr. Kim is one of the best Dermatologists in the valley. Very well trained,experienced and highly skilled. I arrived at the office early and was seen within 5 minutes of my arrival! WOW.\nAll my questions were answered and a biopsy was done to diagnose a patch of irregular skin. I also scheduled another PDT while I was there. They take there time, listen well and are genuinely interested in you as a person. I have seen both Dr Kim and Dr Jeffy and have had excellent experiences with both of them. My wife is in healthcare and this practice was highly recommended by physicians she knows. I highly recommend this practice.
