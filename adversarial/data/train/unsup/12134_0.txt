The problem with writing 3 star reviews is that I'm writing about an average experience, which is neither horrible nor wonderful and as a result, I feel rather uninspired.  \n\nToday's visit was the third time I've visited over the past year and a half or so.  First time with my mom.  It was fine, the sesame pancakes were not as flaky as they should have been.  Second time with a friend.  It was ok then too.  I just remember the pot-sticker dumplings to be a bit disappointing - too thick skinned.  And today with my husband and daughter we had deep fried squid (I've had better), gai-lan with garlic (good), xiao long bao (good, but nothing exceptional), and spicy shredded beef (good flavour but overcooked I felt).\n\nFor average food it's on the pricy side.  I guess you are paying for the dark decor?  \n\nSo sorry, no witticisms or clever observations in this review.  I'm even bored after proof-reading this.
