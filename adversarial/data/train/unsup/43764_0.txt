My husband has flown Allegiant out of Minot ND 2 times this year, no problems. He has used their mobile phone app for check-in (electronic boarding pass) both times with no problem. On this 3rd flight with them, leaving tomorrow out of Billings MT, he was NOT able to check in with the app. He uninstalled it, reinstalled it, nada.  Grrrrr. Researched online and found it is extremely *buggy*. I ended up checking him in online and then emailed his boarding pass to him so he could print it at his office before leaving for the airport. This time he's using a puddle jumper to Billings, with one hour to spare between flights, so I hope that's not going to be an issue. We didn't book Allegiant for the price, but because the 3 major airlines in Billings didn't have schedules that would have worked with the puddle jumper flights to the tiny town he works in. Also, Allegiant allows you to buy super cheap insurance to change flights for any reason... something the other airlines don't offer (and which we used one time, easy-peasy).  However, if this doesn't go well this time around, I guess he'll be back to driving 2 hours in the snow to Williston, ND to fly Delta.  I'll update this review if things don't go as planned.
