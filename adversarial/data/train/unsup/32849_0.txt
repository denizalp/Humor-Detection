Went in last week to get a simple DVD player installed (to replace a broken one) before a long car trip. The employee (can't remember his name) said to buy one online then come back and they could easily install it for $40 and would only take about 30 min. He was very nice and helpful.\nMy husband came in to get the DVD player installed today. He talked to R and was told he didn't have time to install it anytime soon (even though no one was there). R also told him it would be $80. R acted like he didn't even want to try to help my husband schedule an appointment.\nMy husband called the scottsdale location and they told him they could get him right in and install. It was only $49. They were much more friendly and helpful. We wont be going back to this location!!
