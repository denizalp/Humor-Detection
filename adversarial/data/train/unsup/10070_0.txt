This location we visited was at Ross Park Mall. We stopped basically for some sweet treats. They had pumpkin muffins and pumpkin scones with frosting. My girlfriend and I got one of each and they were so good!\n\nI haven't tried their coffee in a long time but I do know depending upon the flavor it can be strong. Look to find Starbucks nearly everywhere. Some even have drive throughs.
