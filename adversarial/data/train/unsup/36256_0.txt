I'm not unfamiliar with Asian Legend - excluding this one, I've been to three of their other locations (Vaughan, North York at Leslie\/Finch, and Scarborough). I've not the most discerning palate to distinguish between all of the different locations (unlike some of my friends), but I do know that this Markham location stands out - frankly, my experience here was the worst out of all of them.\n\nWe ordered a number of different items: a lamb dish, the Peking\/Beijing duck, mapo tofu, an eggplant dish, green beans, and some veggies. \n\nThe two meat dishes were good. The lamb was a touch salty but it was masked by the spice, so that wasn't a big deal. Unfortunately, this didn't apply to the rest of the dishes. The mapo tofu barely had any kick to it and its flavour was predominantly salt. The eggplant and green beans were so salty and oily that I was tempted to rinse it off in the tea. Again, I'm no stranger to Asian Legend or northern cuisine, I can handle food that's heavier on the sauces\/seasonings, but this location was overboard. Even some of my companions, who normally like Asian Legend, shared the same sentiments. The highlight of the meal was the dessert soup that came with the meal at the end. It was taro based and very good. \n\nService was ok, more or less standard for a Chinese restaurant. Servers all seemed to have decent mastery of the English language in case you're wondering (that's noteworthy in Markham). Food arrived fairly quickly though they did forget one of our dishes and claimed to us that all of the food had arrived when it in fact had not. The location is also very small compared to the other Asian Legends, and they are pretty busy, so if you are going to come with a large group, your best bet is to make a reservation.\n\nPrices are slightly higher than most Chinese restaurants and the portion sizes can't be considered generous. If the food quality was there, they could justify the premium, but it wasn't.
