So let me begin by saying the plethora of restaurants in Vegas can be super daunting. There are almost too many to weed through! We decided to grab a bite to eat on a Friday night - wanted something good but not too expensive. Landed here based on its Yelp rating and general price point. \n\nEH.\n\nFor starters, the atmosphere is Vegas ... Like you can see the slots from the table so that's neither pro nor con, just note worthy. \n\nThe staff was pleasant. Very efficient hostess and super friendly waitress. \n\nThe food is what lost me. For starters, I actually had a kinda tough time choosing something to order. The menu kinda has variety but at the same time has a lot of similar items so if you aren't feeling a certain vibe you may find it limiting. Our issue was it sounded good but what we saw on nearby tables didn't look as great as it read. So we started out with Calamari, the man ordered the clam linguine and I ordered some mushroom pizza ... The calamari was pretty good!! Not the best I've had but definitely solid. It came with a spicy sauce that was great! The rest of our meals were very very mediocre. For the restaurant of a household name in cuisine I was very underwhelmed. Nothing was bad ... It was all just EH ... And for a $90 dinner for two in one of the dining capitals of the world I was very unimpressed.\n\nNext trip I won't return here.\nIt isn't bad but who wants \"eh\" in Vegas?! And it is overpriced for what you get. Go elsewhere.
