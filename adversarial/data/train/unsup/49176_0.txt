I've been coming to this track for many, many years and I must say I am totally disappointed with the changes. No more trailers to shop from, now it's like going to Walmart! Outside of the track was always an adventure, food, games, drinks, all kinds of cool stuff, well that's all gone. The map makes it look like you have several choices of food and attractions but that's not the case at all! So much open unused space, what a waste. Who's idea was it to not use the trams? Buses!!!! Really guys.... Do you have any idea what a mess Sundays race will be. Good luck loading and unloading busses, I'll walk back to my camp site. The NASCAR experience is gone! I'm excited to go see the California race, I just hope they don't make the same mistake Phoenix made!\n\nAdding one more STAR!\nWell it's Saturday and I'm glad to see the outfield is a little better, not as much fun as last year but not a complete let down. \n\nGlad to see plenty of deputies, not that we need it, I've never seen to much crazy stuff happen but I'm sure it does\n\nWell Sunday came to an end, we had a good time overall. The experience was a decent one but it did not compare to previous years.  And yes the bus idea was a flop, I really can't imagine what they were thinking...
