Really good, I had the \"Big Katuna\" the classic and it was delicious. I've had poke many times in Hawaii so know how good it can be. I got the regular size and wish it had been bigger or that they weighed the tuna so I knew that I wasn't getting less than usual. Not enough for a full meal but still enjoyable.
