I'm a Phil guy (phildoeshair.com). Have been for years.   Followed him from his old west valley set up to Salon Embellish here on 7th. He does pixels and color and updos and all this crazy stuff; I just appreciate he still has time to get in a regular for a men's haircut.\n\nI really like the new digs at SE. The facility is cool, I always find parking, and the atmosphere is really positive and upbeat. Deborah, the new owner, is great too. Very friendly and doing a great job with the place. \n\nReally just can't say enough good things. A great place if you're nearby and definitely worth the trip if you're not exactly local.
