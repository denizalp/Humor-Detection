I'm terrified to fly.  After one session with Andrew, my flying experiences have been much, much less stressful and terrifying.  He's knowledgeable, patient, professional, educated, warm, trustworthy, and very understanding.  After two sessions, I learned how to calmly address my fear.  I admit, I was very skeptical before our first meeting.  However, he demystified hypnotherapy for me and brought the experience into a realm I could easily understand and to which I could relate.  And he helped give me a certain amount of power over my fears.\n\nI plan on continuing sessions with Andrew when I can.  I believe his professional support will continue to make travel easier and easier for me.  \n\nThanks, Andrew.
