Northen Dumpling Kitchen is my new fave dumpling place.  Been here 5 times in past 2 months.  Place is pretty small and they are cash only.  Price is very affordable here compare to Den Tai Feng.  10 dumpling for $3.99 !!  We also like the beef roll and onion pancake.  The Pork and Chives dumpling is the best I tried so far. The soup noodles were good as well and portion was decent. I only came here with 2 people each time and wasn't able to try a wide variety so next time I am going to invite my family along so we can get a loads of stuff.
