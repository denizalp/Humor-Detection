Stopped by for some sushi in old town at this place on the corner...had reservation at 10 pm but they sat us down at 850 pm (not at teppanyaki table) which we wanted sushi anyways. Their baseline products were very fresh and very good!! Started with their Hakushika sake which we had 3 bottles...was really really good and went well with their sushi!! Started with their soft shell crab and it was amazing!! Their salmon was fresh, beef sashimi was spicy and unbelievable!!  I would come back for that alone!! The albacore was really fresh...the uni was super fresh!!! When everything came out it was really pleasing!! I honestly will come back to bring my dad for the beef sashimi...different and amazing!!
