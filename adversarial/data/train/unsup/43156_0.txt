Went there twice last week with friends who were visiting from out of town.  The first time we went for lunch and enjoyed their lunch specials.  I had the chopped salad with the prosciutto and pear pizza.  It was amazing.  My friends tried the veggie salad and the BLT pizza (she subbed arugula for lettuce).  Everyone was raving about their meals.\n\nA few days later I came back for dinner.  We shared a couple bottles of wine and again had the chopped salad and veggie salad, this time with chicken added.  We ordered the tempura stringbeans for an appetizer and enjoyed every bite!  For dessert we indulged in the warm chocolate chip cookie with ice cream.  It was decadent.  Service was friendly and attentive.\n\nWe'll be back for sure.
