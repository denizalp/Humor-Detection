This is where I wish yelp offered half stars. Overall this venue is clean, pleasant and efficent. It's a seat yourself venue and for those ordering to go you go up to the deli counter and place your order. Works well enough. Now on to the details\n\nSelections = 5 stars!\nHoly cow do they have a ton of selections! The bakery alone is something to rejoiced about. Most importantly they carry black and white cookies!!! As a former New Yorker black and white cookies bring back some fond memories. I have not found one place here in Las Vegas that carries them. The same goes for Knishes! I didnt buy them this trip but I have every intention to do so at my next. Again Knishes are one of those that brings back some happy memories and I can never find here in Vegas.\n\nFood = 3 stars\nWhenever someone tells me this taste just like New York something, I get a little suspcious. Nothing taste like New York anything unless you're in New York, simply put its the water! Bagels are boiled in water, its the water. So, having read reviews and many new yorker transplant raving about the bagels I knew I had to try it. My thoughts? I'm okay with it. It doesn't have that chewiness of the NYC bagel. Its missing this je ne sais quoi. Is it bad? No its delicopis, but its not exciting me and making me dance. I also got the matza ball soup, okay that was good! Can we say hugs the soul? The mataz balls are light and fluffy and savory. Lastly the white and black cookie, it taste like a cake! The frosting was good, but the cookie itself needed maybe 3 minutes more in the oven. \n\nOverall, I'll definitely go back. Need to try all the other goodies.
