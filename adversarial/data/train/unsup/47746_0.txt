Crappy, slow service and mediocre food.  I'm not sure why this place receives such rave reviews.  Will most likely try again at another location, maybe I missed something.  \n\nTwo stars for ambience and location. \n\nMy side salad was on par with a $1.49 salad from Wendy's.  The fettuccine, which was my main course, was uninspiring.  The noodles were rubbery and the sauce tasted store bought. \n\nClean restrooms, plenty of parking.
