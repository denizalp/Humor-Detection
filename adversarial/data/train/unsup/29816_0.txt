If you must take a yellow cab, avoid license #4ZX297! I just got scammed by him at the airport.\n\nI had intended to take an Uber to the Greyhound station for $8, but felt sorry for the lonely cabbies, so decided to go with one of them. The rear guy opened his trunk & put my suitcases in. Then the guy in front noticed & complained bitterly to both of us. Awkward... I could see his point, but my suitcases were already locked away.\n\nThen I saw the $15 minimum sign- told the driver that I didn't want a $15 ride, and asked him to return my bags. He came back to the trunk & said \"I'll take you free\", which I agreed to. As we rode off, he told me the other driver was drunk, making his action seem heroic. A few minutes later, though, I discovered that the driver is simply a liar & a cheat. I tried to \"tip\" him $10, but only had a $20, so I asked for a $10 back. He took my $20, then told me the minimum fare is $15. His only response to my reminding him of his \"free\" offer is that \"nothing is free\".\n\nYou can be damn sure I'll take the Uber next time. I now know why the taxi industry is dying.
