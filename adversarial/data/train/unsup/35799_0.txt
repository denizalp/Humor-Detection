We just celebrated our son's 9th birthday at this location. It was so fun and worth the cost! We had a party of about 14 kids and 5 adults. The best thing about this place is the staff! Everyone was friendly and checked on us frequently. The trampolines were supervised and the staff were very friendly and playful with all the kids. Many similar places skimp on staff and are overrun with brats that need to be supervised. That was not the case here. It was a pleasant, fun time! We will be back!
