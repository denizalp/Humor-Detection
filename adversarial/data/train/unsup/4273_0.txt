BLEW MY FRIGGIN MIND AWAY !!!!! \n\nhttp:\/\/www.google.com\/images?hl=en&source=imghp&biw=1676&bih=865&q=vladimir+kush&gbv=2&aq=2&aqi=g10&aql=&oq=vladimi\n\nHad a random stroll through the miracle mile shopping center... Whilst passing something got my attention and immediately walked in.... \n\nDidn't take me long to realize how lucky I am to have decided to go for that little walk... \nVladimir's art is absolutely perfect, beautiful, imaculate and inspiring. So inspiring in fact that I've decided to get back into my art.. So inspiring that I'm thinking on going back to art school ! .... Whoooshhhh \n\nHonest though, being here reminded me of the butterflies of discovering Dali.... lol.... And Rock N Roll, but that's a whole different review? \n\n***\n\nI don't even know how much the art was going for, but that didn't matter because even if I had tons and tons of cash to splash I'd buy the whole bloody thing. Amazing. Tellin you, you would too....\n\nSo didn't buy any art, but ordered the book... Been inspired beyond words... I know I will go back and suck in those wonderful vibes and creativity every time I will be in Vegas Bloody Vegas.... \n\nPS\/ I really think that he was there.... But could be wrong... Been too shy to check myself.... lol
