So I enjoyed myself at the club the music was great and the drinks were good. No complaints about the actual club but when it was time to leave we had to take the stairs Drais is located on the roof so we had to take like  15 flights of stairs to get down to casino. Myself and Majority of the other women were dress in high heels and dresses so just imagine the pain we were in and the stairs were made of metal. (The elevator was not of service either) Not the best way to end a great night.
