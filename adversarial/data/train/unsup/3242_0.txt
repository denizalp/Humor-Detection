I'm not very familiar with timeshares but I believe WorldMark is the \"affordable\" timeshare because of the ammenities that I experienced here at Spencer Street. I have only stayed at one other timeshare (Welk Resort in Escondido, CA) and this felt like an average experience as compared to the Welk which was luxury at its finest.\n\nWhat is odd about this timeshare is that it is in the middle of a neighborhood and is next door and across the street from a few retirement communities. The parking is ample but doesn't seem very secure because anyone can come in and out of the parking lot.\n\nI felt like I was living in someone's apartment as compared to a hotel because of the layout of the rooms. You can definitely tell that this place used to be an apartment complex. The lights in the room were dim and I had no idea how to make them brighter. We got a bottom floor and were next to the street so you could hear street traffic.\n\nWhat I did like about this place was that because we didn't really particularly like the room, so we spent our entire day out doing other stuff.\n\nIt is a little bit off the strip- 15 minutes-30 minutes depending on traffic.
