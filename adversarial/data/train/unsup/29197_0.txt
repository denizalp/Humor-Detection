Maxwell's seems to be the place to be in Waxhaw on a Saturday night!!  40 minute wait at 7:30 and the crowd was steady until we left around 9. I'm so glad to see a local, small business doing well!\n\nService was attentive and friendly.  The restaurant was very clean and the food was fresh and very good. I had the Garlic Parmesan wings and they were SO good!!  I also had a Greek salad that I enjoyed very much. My husband had the pork chops and he really liked them (thick cut and super juicy!).\n\nIt was an enjoyable meal and a nice night out ...without needing to venture too far.
