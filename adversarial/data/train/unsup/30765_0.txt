These people don't deserve one star. They are over priced and the manager James sucks. His people skills is horrible. I would not ever stay here again. Most hotels allow for a late check out at no charge these people don't even though the room I reserved and paid for wasn't ready. The young woman who was in charge was great but the room had what looked like water damage. DON'T STAY HERE!
