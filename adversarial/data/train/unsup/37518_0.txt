My go to spot for sushi at any time. Working off Park road I try to visit the lunch buffet at least once a week. Girlfriend lives 2 streets away in Dilworth so I head here with her for dinner.\n\nTheir regular standard issue sushi is just average. They make up for it in having the best tempura rolls around.\n\nOn top of all that? It's cheap!
