Since Maximum Flavor, who sold really meh pizza, has closed down, there is no pizza near CMU.  It was nice out last week so I decided to take the walk up to Pizza Prima.  Had I known how much better this pizza was, I would have walked here all of the time!\n\nThe little old Italian man who runs the store doesn't beat around the bush but is friendly.  The pizza has so much cheese, and the crust is good too.  A slice of cheese pizza only set me back $1.75, and it was a big slice.  I would love to come back and try the white pizza or a pan pizza.  The specials are amazing too.\n\nThere is a single table and some counter space, but there is no air conditioning so this is really best for takeout.\n\nCash only.
