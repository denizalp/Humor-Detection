We went to a teen showcase here to expose our daughters to the arts and I was pretty disgusted. They changed the lyrics to RENT so that the song was heterosexual. If you want to be prudish and homophobic you will have a hard time preparing kids for Hollywood. They could have picked any other duet but to alter the words to \"protect modesty\" made my tea curl. \n\nThis is on top of feedback issues, really bad castings, terrible off key singing, and behind the beat dancing. One would be better off seeing some of the plays produced at the local high schools or UNLVs theater department.
