I think this place is fantastic!  I'm hearing good things about the spa treatments, but never have tried them. I only come for the brazilian wax and I luckily haven't had a bad experience.  I always make a point to tell the people how I want my wax done: AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE.  I also request someone who has been there for over a year.  Never had Danielli, the infamous Queen of Waxing, (but then I really don't remember the girls' names).  The place seems very clean to me, the rooms are warm and I've never noticed a dirty pot of wax.  I have read some scarey reviews about waxing and contracting STD's so here's a link from Snopes.com to expel that rumor.  http:\/\/www.snopes.com\/medical\/disease\/eyebrow.asp\nNot to say that other nasty things can come from unclean salons....\n\nps...on that slimming wrap thing:  My roomate did it and she did lose a good amount of WATER WEIGHT and possibly a few inches and maintained this for a week or so Bottom line is there is NO QUICK FIX for losing inches...get your butt ot the gym and watch your diet!\n\n*** Update: I recently had brazilian wax  (June 2008) and they gave me Kendra. She's great, happy and QUICK! ****
