Okay, so it's been 3 months since my last update and I gotta say there has been much improvement here. I waited to see how long it would last, but after 3 months I have to say that the staff I encounter now are MUCH better than before. They are always friendly and helpful and quick to offer assistence. I just hope it stays this way. \n\nHonestly, I believe the facilities are still 3 to 3.5 stars at best. There is only one bench for shoulders in the free weight area and even at 2pm on a Tuesday its tough to get. The squat racks are tough to get to as well. But good customer service makes up for alot in my book, so I bumped it up to 4 stars just for that reason.\n\nKudos to the manager for staying proactive and managing her team! I was considering switching to Golds or even going back to LVAC(never thought I'd see that day!) but now I am liking this place enough to put those thoughts on the shelf!\n\n4 stars
