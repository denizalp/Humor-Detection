I do not BELIEVE...I spent money on this show.  What a real waste of money and time.  No story line at all to follow, just Criss or Maestro talking during the whole entire thing.   \n\nI'm not sure why Cirque is putting their name on this show.  If this is your first Cirque show you ever see, you will be turned off forever.  Not one Cirque-esque act in here except maybe the dancing bunnies but that was still terrible.  \n\nStaged audience members are way too noticable.  Please try to be a little more subtle.  Jeez.\n\nBest thing was the lady sawed in half but even that was only 30 seconds long.  A lot of props throughout the whole show with nothing to show for it.\n\nI could write a whole lot more about how terrible it was and how uninteresting and geeky Criss Angel is as a speaker, and how I felt a little sorry on how he had to encourage the audience to give him applause, and how the short Maestro dude was the star of the show but I already wasted too much money and time on this junk and won't waste anymore.  Please do not go see this so they can replace it with something else.  Fu Fu Fu!!!  ((poof))  Your money's gone.
