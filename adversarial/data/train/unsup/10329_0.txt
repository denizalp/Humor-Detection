We came to this spot after our Thai Chi class... Starving children... We ordered around 7 PM I wanted the beef noodles but they ran out of beef so that made me very sad... I instead ordered the rib noodles spicy with black mushrooms and tomatoes the food was a little too spicy for me but could they also serve you with this soup that's supposed to cleanse your pallet as you eat your regular course it is made out of sweet bean water and sugar ...the food came out within 5 minutes not long at all ... we also ordered the dumplings which had a little too much of that soy oil stuff so was hard to grab with chopsticks but once you did oh my !!! The meat inside is just great !!! \nDress :very casual I went in sports wear
