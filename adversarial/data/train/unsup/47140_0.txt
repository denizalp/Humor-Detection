First, ordered a dish but ran out of of that meat.  Second, dinner took forever to come out. First dish came out 45 min after ordering. Second dish came another 45 mins after the first dish. Very poor management. Also, after waiting for 1.5 hours, they even asked for tip...  if you want to wait 45 mins for each dish to come out, then go here. If I went to another restaurant (great taste Chinese cuisine on 64 ave) all the dishes would come out within 10-15 mins of order.
