This is my #1 place to visit when I'm in Charlotte. My go to is the vegetarian Sonoran (southwestern style)dog or the vegetarian Joliet Jake (Chicago style) dog.  The house chips with the buttermilk ranch dip is so good, but my husband prefers the tater tots with cheese on top. He usually orders the Dirty Jerz turkey dog or the Kasekreiner sausage dog. We've heard good things about the Smoked Salmon Sliders, but I haven't had the chance to order them yet. I love that this place has its own parking lot and that is a big plus compared to many places in the neighborhood.
