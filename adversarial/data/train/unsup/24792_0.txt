The Davisville Diner opened sometime this spring, and . . . no one noticed.  \n\nThe place is completely not memorable (literally - I've been there twice and can't remember what I had either time) .  However, what is memorable is an unfortunate experience.  At brunch, my hungry friend ordered and asked if he could substitute french toast for the regular toast included with his breakfast.  The server said \"We don't do that, but I can bring you an order of French toast on the side.\"  My friend agreed, perhaps too hastily, assuming he would be charged $3-$5 for a side of French toast.  Instead, he was charge $9 (or so), meaning that his breakfast came to about $20 plus tax and tip.  I honestly thought it was a mistake and when I asked the server about it, he said that was the cost of the french toast on the menu and \"I thought you knew what I meant.\"  I explained that we obviously misunderstood, thinking the French toast would be charged the normal price of a side order.  \n\nThis was an opportunity for a brand new establishment to do the right thing and remove the item from the bill, but instead we paid up and left, very unlikely to ever go back.\n\nAlso, the place seems to be run (possibly owned by) a lady who has a terribly annoying habit of hovering over her staff constantly.  It was so obvious that it made me uncomfortable.
