My business partner and I love getting wings for lunch. That hunt for great wings led us to Armadillo Grill and has now turned into a weekly occurrence. I still have a place or two in Central Phx that I haven't tried (yet), but Armadillo Grill has hit the best wings in town, IMO. Yes, they are that good. What's even better is they are half price on \"Wing Wednesday\"! I strongly recommend the Armadillo Gold (Medium spicy), followed by the Honey Hot (Mild). Great seasoning on the wings, amazing sauce. Even their Buffalo (hot) is tasty - I just like the Armadillo Gold too much to venture away from it very often.\n\nI have NEVER had a rude experience with the staff. Minimal issues with service or food, that were always fixed right away and with a smile. \n\nAs for the atmosphere, you just have to know what you are walking into, and the place is great. What it is NOT: Chic, Upscale, Pretentious. What it IS: Really good food, down to earth, and no frills. It's not a \"Dive\", but it's not Twin Peaks, Buffalo Wild Wings, or Zipps either. It has an OTB (Off Track Betting) so finding half a dozen guys betting the ponies is to be expected. It's a \"Bar and Grill\" - not the worst place for a family, but if you bring kids, make sure you sit in the \"restaurant\" area, not at the tables within ear shot of the bar (that seems kind of logical though).\n\nThank you Brenda for giving us our regular \"Wing Wednesday\" hang-out!
