It's weird. I'm experiencing something I never have before. Towards the end of my work day I start thinking about going home. I'm not thinking about leaving work, rather actually going HOME. Fountains in the Green, I think I love you. At the very least I want to make out with you. \n\nHidden under a wild mass of green lies a unique apartment complex. The place is not new, what some might call 'historic.' The apartments are solid as hell. Not once have I been able to hear my neighbors through he walls. \n\nThe Good: \n-A wide variety of floor plans \n-The apartments are huge \n-Office\/maintenence staff rock \n-Gigantic freaking courtyards for ground level units. Really, really big \n-Utilities included (and basic cable). This saves a nice fat chunk of change during the summer \n-The surrounding neighborhood is actually quite nice. It's relaxing to take the dog on a long walk through through. \n-Did I mention a big ass courtyard? \n\nThe Not-so-Good: \n-Due to the lush landscaping there are a fair number of roaches. Now, they spray and do a great job of it, but expect to pick at least a few dead roaches up each week. I have yet to find a live bug inside. \n-Parking for residents is kind of tight, and big trucks seem to be strategically placed to make getting around corners difficult (I'm looking at you silver Titan!) \n-If you're visiting a resident you park on the street. You can request a spot inside the grounds on an as needed basis. \n\nThe Bad: \n-There is an evil ass striped cat that wears a pink collar. Don't be fooled by the collar, this cat is crazed and dogicidal. I've had this tabby terror stalk my enthusiastically stupid dog on more than one occasion. I'm a dog person, so I hate you, pink collared cat. \n\nSo yes, every day when I walk into my large apartment, a sense of peace comes over me. I'm home and I'm happy
