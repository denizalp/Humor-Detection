Great pizza, thin crust and a decent size.  Grilled Caesar salad was delicious but large crouton a bit on the stale side.\nWe did take out and by the time we got home all was good, food travelled well.  Wish they had delivery!  While waiting for the order, the staff was absolutely lovely, welcoming and a pleasure to chat with.  Will definitely go and enjoy a meal in the restaurant!
