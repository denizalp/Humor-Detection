I happened to be downtown looking for the Public Records Building and stumbled arcoss this place. It is a huge warehouse building.\nWhen you come inside, you are amazed by what they have. They have just recently opened up at this location. So they have not started to advertise yet. But, it is coming.\nWe looked through Rows and rows of fabulous stuff. \nEverything was really clean and nice looking. There is absolutly everything that you could imagine here. But, all nicely packaged and displayed so that it is easy to see and easy to find.\nSo much furniture from every Era and every type of room. Appliances, dishes, glasses, building supplies. You name it they have it.\nExcept for clothes i did not see any of that, but every other type of need. Right now they are only accepting cash, but they will be taking Credit Cards soon. They will not take checks.\nThis is a really cool place to visit. Check it out i think you will really enjoy it. We bought some book shelves and they will even help you place it in the vehicle.\nLots of Parking and easy to get to, very near Bank One Ballpark, or whatever it is called these days.  Ciao
