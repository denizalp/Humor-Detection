Best Dim Sum restuarant in Las Vegas, cheap compared to the Strip, fresh, hot dishes, and friendly staff (especially if you speak Chinese with them, well no duh).\n\nDim Sum - Chinese Breakfast, Lunch, Brunch\n\nI grew up with the Dim Sum push carts, so I love how they've kept this up so items arrive super hot versus having waiters\/waitresses carrying them on lame trays getting cold.  Push carts are very helpful if you're a newbie at Dim Sum because the ladies will always show you what they have, just point and say Ok!\n\nBBQ Pork Steamed\/Baked Bun, Char Siu Bao, Baked Char Siu Bao - must get\nChicken Feet with Black Bean, Fung-Tzow - it's red\nSpareribs in Black Bean - it's a bit oily\nSteamed Open-Faced Pork and Shrimp Dumplings, Siu Mai - usually a crowd pleaser\nShrimp Dumplings, Ha Gow - lots of shrimp wrapped in a semi-clear skin\nSteamed Pork Soup Dumplings, Xiao Long Bao - tasty, sometimes a bit mooshy\nChinese Turnip\/Radish Cakes, steamed then pan-fried, Lo Bak Goh - my favorite\nSteamed Glutinous Rice with Chicken, Shittake Mushrooms, and Chinese Sausage,\n     wrapped in leaf, Lo Mai Gai - one of the best\nRice Noodle Rolls with Shrimp, Cheong Fun - best eaten fresh and with soy sauce\nThousand Yr Old Egg Congee, Pai Dan Jok - silky goodness\nBeef Inards Stew, Gnaw Lam - one of my favorites, very tasty, relative to the menudo\nSteamed Brown Sugar Cake (sometimes with almonds), Ma Lai Goh - very very good\nTofu Pudding with Ginger Sugar Syrup, Dao Fu Fah - silky goodness x2\nHK-Style Fried Soy Sauce Egg Noodles, See Yau Wong - oodles of noodles\n\nThis is an extensive list of what's usually at my table, but it's not all of it.  Although I'm not a huge fan of trying \"new\" items, by all means Try EVERYTHING! (you won't know what you like until you try it, it's not like they bite)\n\nAlso, I don't recommend people recovering from hangovers to come here during Dim Sum hours, the noise level is very loud and they don't serve coffee.  (Coffee makes Dim Sum tastes yucky!)
