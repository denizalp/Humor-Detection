Last week was my first visit to Coco and not a very good one tbh...I got their milk series Pearl with Red bean regular sweet and it was quite disgusting. It tasted like pure syrup that they use to soak the tapioca bubbles. I was surprised since I've always had a sweet tooth and full sweet is normal for me at most bubble tea places.\nThe prices are average and what you'd expect at a chatime\/sharetea and the like ($4-6 a drink).\nI tried a bit of my friend's drink and it was okay, nothing special about them. \nWe did get to sit there for a long time without being kicked out, so it wasn't a horrible experience altogether. I wouldn't be extremely against going again.
