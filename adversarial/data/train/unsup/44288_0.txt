So glad we came in tonight for dinner. The place was packed with people waiting outside. The greeter was nice and organized. The smell of foods was everywhere. We knew we were going to have a fantastic meal. We ordered a flaming fajitas for 2, shrimps and steak. The server came out to light the flame before serving...so cool!! We only ate half of the portion and took home the rest. Definitely come back again soon.
