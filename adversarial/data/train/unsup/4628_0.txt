I am ABSOLUTELY! disgusted, I was in today and sat in a table close to the kitchen. I could hear management \"obviously the 2 men in suits\" talking about their staff in an absolute horrid way, also could hear them and the fowl way the man was yelling at his staff in the kitchen (since they seated me in the worst table in an almost empty restaurant). The service was on point obviously because there servers were walking around scared instead of happy.\nThe food was mediocre, I'm more disgusted with the management and ways they spoke about my awesome server kalie.\nIf you want a good steak I would save your time and money.  Having to listening to restaurant politics when I was just trying to relax on my day off (leave that shit in the office, came to relax not listen to b.s.) was not relaxing..... Lite your grill, save your money.This place is a joke!!!
