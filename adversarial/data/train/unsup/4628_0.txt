An A\/C that doesn't blow out cool air is a nightmare in AZ. I pulled up into the shop bc I saw on yelp they do free air conditioner inspections. They were extremely busy but made some time to squeeze me in. They diagnosed the problem within five minutes and had me up and out of there in under an hour. I'd highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a new auto shop in the area!
