Although the clothes tend to smell like bandaids, even after a few washings, this place is pretty good. The owner (I'm sorry, I don't know her name, the Indian woman) is so very helpful and knows her inventory very well. If she doesn't have it in stock, she'll order it for you and give you a call when it comes in. And... the prices are pretty decent!
