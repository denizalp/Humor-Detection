OK...I totally love Barros pizza and other menu items but this location is ridiculous. Forget about enjoying a nice cheat\/pizza meal cause you'll feel like your at a Mormon circus with the 900 kids swarming everywhere! I just order it to go now but recognize its a gathering beacon for these folks. Have nothing against Mormons at all but its just a bit overwhelming being in this Barrows location because is loud, noisey and packed full of kids.
