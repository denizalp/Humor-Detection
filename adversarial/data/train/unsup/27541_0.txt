The word incredible comes to mind when I think upon the date my fiancee and I had there.  The atmosphere is perfect.  Very zen lounge.  Music in the backround included Theivery corporation and Zero 7. (Two of our favorites).\nThe wine list was huge, and had a greta assortment.  We didn't know what to do with ourselves, so we dived right in with the 5 course tasting menu combined with wine pairings.  My God was it worth every penny.  We could not even finish the last course!  Everything was so delicious and elegantly plated.  Definately not your standard american fare. If you see something on the menu called \"Bacon and Eggs\" Don't question it. Just order it.  It was the most amazing thing ever.  They use fresh local and organics ingredients for their products.  The tasting menu was 65 a person and 30 to add on the wine.  It was superb.  I am looking for excuses to go back!\n\nAlso-- I do not agree with the \"Casual\" dress attire. I think this is a place where people should dress up a bit.
