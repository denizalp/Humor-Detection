I'm just as thrilled as the next person to find a Mexican restaurant that uses organic, non-GMO, sustainable products. I also really dig the nice interior and massive tequila selection. Their house red sangria is tasty, and the margs are strong.\n\nBut I was unexpectedly underwhelmed by the actual food. So much so that I don't clearly remember what I ate. I recall a great tableside guac. The taquitos were fine, nothing to write home about. The burrito I tried (pulled chicken, maybe?) was bland and dry. The tres leches cake was awesome, and I'm not usually a fan in the first place. I know I tried several other items, but I can't remember them.\n\nPricing is a bit high for Mexican food and for the location, but obviously the organic, non-GMO, etc ingredients cost a premium. Given all the amazing five-star reviews, I have to wonder if I came on an off night or just ordered the wrong items? Will likely end up returning to try the chile relleno and a seafood or salad dish.
