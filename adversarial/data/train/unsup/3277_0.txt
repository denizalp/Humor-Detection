I came here again for lunch with my wife. I told her how the Sinner Fries was so good, she wanted to try it. \n\nI ordered the Consequence and Spicy Sinners Fries (just can't get enough of that from last time!). I also got Cookies n Cream Milkshake. Burgers was super juicy and delicious. I didn't get any dry meat. Fries was fried perfectly, crispy and delicious!  Next time I'm getting Cookies n Cream again because I feel tastes way better than Vanilla. \n\nMy wife got the Specials, Sinner Fries and Vanilla Milkshake. She loves it!  She can't get enough of the beef patty. Triple AAA, healthy and fresh!\n\nMost definitely will come back again.
