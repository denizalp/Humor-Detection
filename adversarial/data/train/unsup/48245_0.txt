In town visiting relatives ordered on recommendations. Ordered food online pizza & garlic balls for delivery.  When order arrived it pizzas toppings were wrong. Immediately called to inform and guy on phone knew exactly which pizza was ours and what we were calling about. Apologized and sent a new one out. Impressed with service. Food was good- service was better!\nTry garlic balls-great
