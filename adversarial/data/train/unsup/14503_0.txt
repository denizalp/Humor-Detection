Tell me if you've heard this one before...\n\nThese three corporate executives have their flight delayed by almost 5 hours and get into Toronto at midnight only to be told at the Hertz Gold counter that they need to be patient because there are no cars left. \n\n\"Your management is going to hear from my CEO!\" Do you know how much business we do with Hertz annually?!\" Not a pretty sight. I feel really sorry for the guy behind the counter.\n\nI ended up get my compact clown car 45 minutes later and wasn't able to cash in my hotel room until close to 2AM. I was not a pretty sight the next morning.
