Absolutely amazing food. The SÃ£o Paulo roll was probably the best roll we've ever had. The gyoza with wagyu beef was also great. If you like sake they have a massive selection. The only negative was the noise level. The design of the restaurant makes it a bit hard to carry a conversation. Doesn't matter though because the food more than makes up for it.
