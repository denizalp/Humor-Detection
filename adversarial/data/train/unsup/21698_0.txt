I am absolutely obsessed with this place. In fact, my obsession began before I ever even walked into the restaurant when I started seeing Instagram posts. OBSESSED. This reminds me of an amazing meal from a grandmother. Well, that is, if your grandma is Russian.\n\nIt's in the middle of a shopping center, nothing fancy at all. You order at the counter. I love that they have pictures up of all the food. Makes it a lot easier to order. I usually get the Polish Platter (stuffed cabbage, kielbasa, braised cabbage, and potato and cheese pierogis). It's all amazing. I'm a huge fan of the braised cabbage. I always get it instead of mashed potatoes. My roommate loves the Polish sandwich, he usually gets that and a pierogi sampler. Our most recent visit, some friends ordered the meatball platter, Solyanka soup, pieroshkis, and Blintzes (crepes). Everything was delicious. \n\nThey have a case in the store where you can buy frozen pierogi and pelmini varieties. Babushka's also has a catering menu. Free hot coffee or tea with the purchase of a dessert.
