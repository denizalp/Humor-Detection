We came on a Saturday evening and got a buffet without protein for about $9\/ea\n\n- I can always find some kind of coupon on the internet for this place! \n- 20% off entire check expires 8\/17\/13! $7.29 Lunch expires 7\/24\/13\n- Love the broccoli salad and the wanton salad.\n- Always get the chicken noodle soup with crackers!\n- Who fills their water cup with sprite? \n- Save room for fresh corn bread and especially the the blueberry muffins!\n- It almost feels like you defeat the purpose of eating healthy bc it's ayce, but hey, it's better alternative than Feast! haha\n- This place can get real messy! Families definitely welcome!
