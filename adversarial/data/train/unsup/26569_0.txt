I will start this review off by saying that I would normally have given this place 4 stars, but for a large dog-friendly patio, and immediate water bowls the minute your dogs butt hits the ground, they get the extra star. \n\nWe went today, a Sunday, and sat down next to people that had the exact same dog that we have (a female harlequin Great Dane) and knew that it was fate.  We sat by them, because they seemed awesome and in great company, the food flourished in my eyes.  \n\nThey have a pretty decent beer selection, they had my favorite Sonoran White Chocolate ale and my boyfriend had something he loved on tap called the Bell's Two Hearted Ale (but apparently it's an amazing IPA). I knew I'd love mine, he LOVED his.\n\nWe had the Mac and Cheese, which was awesome, but not as amazing as others I've had.  So order it if your a Mac person, but don't if you're not.  \n\nWe had two sandwiches for dinner, I had the Acapulco Cheesesteak (UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!!!!!!!)  and Seann had the RB&C (an equally impressive Roast Beef concoction). Those were both devoured with great beer and great conversation with others.\n\nLastly we had the Triple Chocolate Brownie, per a recommendation from our fellow dog owner and it was delish.  VERY VERY chocolatey and too much food after an app, a sandwich and two beers, but it was definitely worth trying.\n\nOverall the food would have gotten a four, but the experience with cool people around us, and a great waitress really sealed the 5 star deal.  Now being added into the rotation.  Thank you Main Ingredient! : )
