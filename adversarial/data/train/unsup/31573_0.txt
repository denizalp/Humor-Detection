Second time in the restaurant but at another location. I still don't understand why there is always so packed. 8pm on a Thursday night yet we still had to wait for seats. And the seats are so close together, when I cross my leg, I can kick the next table. I tried the kombucha for the first time, it doesn't taste bad, like frizz tea. It is suppose to be detoxified the immune system, I don't mind drinking it everyday if it was cheaper!\n\nThis time I wanted to try something else so I got the Buddha soba bowl. What a disappointment, not worth the money at all. Nothing special - soba noodles with pieces of tofu, bean sprouts, tomato and cucumber - plain, plain, plain. I could have so easily made it myself than paying $13 for a small bowl.
