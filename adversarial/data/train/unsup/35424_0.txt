This place is a carb lover's dream come true! I don't get here often but it is so worth it. When I came in, they were out of butter croissants. I waited as I was told more would be on the way. As soon as they dropped the tray, I was all over it. I got a box and filled it up. Nothing beats fresh bread. I devoured it in the car while still in GB's parking lot. Yes, that was me stuffing my face. The rich, buttery, layers of this fresh croissant is worth the hour on the treadmill. \n\nI have purchased other breads here as they are so fresh and affordable but the croissant is what keeps me coming back. \n\nMy bf loves their coconut macaroons. They are pretty tasty. Crispy on the outside, just the way I like it. They also have chocolate dipped macaroons too. \n\nLove this place!
