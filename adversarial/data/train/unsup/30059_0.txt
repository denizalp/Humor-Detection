brilliant idea. they have all kinds of concert signs\/posters, bottled sodas, and candies from all over the place and from different decades for sale. they also have their own Rocket Fizz bottled sodas. \n\ni checked out the free soda tasting which they have every Saturday from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM and every Wednesday from 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM. There wasn't any customer for the Wednesday, maybe one right when I left, so i took my time here, looked around, and talked story with the guy there who was either the owner or relative of the owner and wished him luck. \n\nended up just trying out the Rocket Fizz jalapeno apple which was pretty good. Bought 5 different soda's that i haven't tried before. Sprecher Root Beer, Always Ask For Avery's Cola, Hank's Black Cherry Soda, Dad's and a Mexicana Cola. They have a large selection of different brands of Root Beer, Creme Soda, Cola, and sodas that taste like food. I plan to keep all soda bottles and maybe start a collection. \n\nim fine with it being close to home but i really wished they were in a different location to attach more business and closer to the strip or heavier traffic. they have something here.
