I've lived in Vegas since July and this is the best buffet I've been to so far...have been to 7 of them. I redeemed a buy one get one free dinner buffet off of the MyVegas app. It's normally $38\/person but includes beer and wine. The shrimp was awesome and already peeled which is a big deal in my book. Lots of choices overall and loved everything I had.
