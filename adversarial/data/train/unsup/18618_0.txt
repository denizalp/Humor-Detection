Went for crush festival two weeks ago. It was like a sauna inside literally hot and heavy carrying the stench of BO because there was literally no air moving in the back portion of the center. Another complaint would be the smoking area, which was pretty much inaccessible because it was a double door leading outside to a small fenced off area where people were using to escape the heat. To top it all off too the parking was horrible. The place like everyone else said is in a pretty bad spot too. There were other problems but it seemed to be the promoter's issues but I'm sure it was hard for them with what they had to work with. I'll probably skip any future events here just because I don't ever want to experience anything like that again.
