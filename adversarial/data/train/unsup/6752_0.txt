Before I start getting \"compliments\" about this review, I'm going to say this now, I get it, it's a bar, it's gonna be smokey. This place took it to a whole new level. Upon hitting the first set of double doors to enter, I could already smell cigarette smoke. \n\nAs we enter and make our way to the bar, I felt like we were two sheep entering a pack of wolves to group of construction workers playing pool. We ordered a couples drinks, $12 for 3 cocktails. \n\nNothing \"dive bar\" about this place. When I think of a dive bar, there is something that gives it it's charm. Take Champagne Cafe, the velvet wallpaper, the tacky karaoke, stories of DeNiro hanging out while filming Casino. None of that here. There is a shuffleboard and a couple pool tables, a juke box (not touch tunes) and that's about it. They don't serve food (I wouldn't take my chances, all I can picture is some guy flipping burgers with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth and the ashes about to fall in the food). McDonald's is in the same parking lot, so that's your only option. I couldn't finish my second drink, I was physically getting ill, in the time it took me to drink one cocktail, the hag next to me smoked half a pack of cigarettes. Definitely not my kinda bar.
