Pizza doesn't thril me, but this Streets of New York is better than most. The ham and pineapple thin crust was close to perfect (but canadian bacon costs twice as much as ham??). It did suffer a bit from \"underdone middle\", like so many thin crusts do. Overall, a pizza I'd eat again.\n\nAlong with the pizza, they gave us (and everybody else, apparently) some bread \"chunks\" with marinara. Each was a bite-sized piece of crust, baked and dusted with parmesan (I think). They tasted good, but I wish they had asked if we wanted it, since our basket pretty much went to waste.\n\nThe interior is nicely decorated, not too cramped and not too overly filled with pictures and wall objects selected carefully by corporate marketing specialists. The waitress was patient with our inability to decide on a pizza, and she was definitely attentive to our needs throughout the meal.
