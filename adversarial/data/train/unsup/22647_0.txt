I would just describe this pool lounge as okay. You're not going to get the crazy party atmosphere that many other Vegas pools have. \nThe waitresses were all friendly enough and it's a casual place to relax. Our first pitcher of drinks was comped and they gave us a day bed which was nice. \nThere was one worker there, didn't seem to be a waiter so I'm not really sure what he did. He assumed his job was to walk around and be unnecessarily rude. His attempt at an alpha attitude was not appreciated and I noticed guests leaving. He was fine towards us (maybe one or two comments that we ignored) but we eventually followed suit of the other patrons and left.
