On this very cold night, we decided to use our voucher to dine at this mexican place. Its been here for 6 yrs, but I've never once come across or noticed this place. Small place where seating capacity is no more than 50ppl. Not much of a Mexican feel though, no sombrero and Mexican heritage. Maybe they're fusion of some sort.\n\nStarted with some complimentary tortilla chips with salsa. Our voucher was the one app, two entree, one dessert for a set price.\n\nApp:\nShrimp Ceviche $12\nMarinated shrimp in lime juice, dressed with avocados, tomatoes, cucumber\nolives, cilantro & onions.\n- Didn't really need the olives. The plate was marinated with too much juices on the plate. The shrimp is alright. Good portion.\n\nMain:\nFajitas $18\n& choice of chicken, beef, shrimps or veggies. Served\nwith rice, beans, tortillas & topping.\n- Got the shrimp fajitas. Good portion. Didn't touch the beans.\n\nLobster Tacos $18\n3 Corn tortillas filled with Guajillo lobster,\nbell peppers & onions, served with beans &\ntoppings.\n- Good portion. Lobster meat were mainly claws. Kind of spicy dish. Didn't touch the beans.\n\nDessert:\nGot the Fried Vanilla Ice Cream. Not bad.\n\nThis place I'm not sure why its slow, but the food is alright. I'd probably try elsewhere just to compare the differences as this place didn't stand out for me.
