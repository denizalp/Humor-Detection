Unfortunately, when I was in grad school, I rented from Lobos on Kamin Street in Squirrel Hill. While the apartment was very nicely priced, (especially compared to the D.C. Metro Area pricing I am now dealing with) I experienced shocking slumlord-style management.\n\nI'm glad I can laugh about it now, because it was infuriating at the time, but being awakened by a clawing raccoon hiding in your walls made me not very happy. This went on for more than a month, and I was not given any solutions other than to sleep at friends' places. There were traps set up in my apartment room, making it impossible to inhabit while the pest control workers came in and out. Did I mention it was also the dead of winter, which is apparently why this creature was looking for shelter within the walls of the apartment building?\n\nOnce one of the workers had the idea to check to see if the \"chimney had been capped\" (which it had not, and which ended up being the ultimate issue) the problem was solved. For such a simple, silly problem, it really seemed ridiculous to put a tenant through what I had been through with barely a squeak of an apology. I lost countless hours of sleep and dealt with phone call after bothersome phone call. Try explaining to people that there are noises coming from within your walls. It has to be the most horrifying tenant experience I've had to date - knocking on wood - ever. \n\nLike I said, it's only after some time that I can write this with an objective perspective, but I think the way the problem was handled (and I didn't scratch the surface of the issues) by Lobos shows what kind of company they really are.
