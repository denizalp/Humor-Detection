I JUMPED on it when I found a CRABHOUSE actually opened up in Madison.  Such a shame, if you're going to open up a crabhouse in the middle of the Midwest and basically be the only of its kind in the area, please do it right.  I love seafood--especially king crab legs...but this was more like prince crab legs, as in smaller than my ex-boyfriend's penis (and that thing sure was small).  So disappointed.  Oysters gave me a stomachache for 2 days afterwards.  You are better off going to Sam's Club or Cub's and buying a pound of legs to boil it yourself.  Disappointing!\n\nThe only thing is the late night menu that I MIGHT come back to try. Calamari and crab cakes between hopping bars sound good.  One star for now, might add on another if the late night menu holds true.
