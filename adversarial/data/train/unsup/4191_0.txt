Manic offers coffee, teas, espresso-based drinks, baked goods, coffee beans and more in their little crowded place. Their coffee drinks and cup size options are limited and they don't have wi-fi.\n\nAfter going to Manic a couple of times, I realized that I'm not so hot about this place. The staff just rubs me the wrong way. They don't seem friendly and stare at you to see if you're even worthy of stepping into their caf√©. It seems like they have the attitude that they've pioneered the best tasting coffee in the world and have amazing coffee-brewing art ever. Reading their 'coffee conspiracy' on the wall against other coffee establishments didn't give a nice feeling either.\n\nAfter encountering unfriendly staff, a completely unorganized line and being overcharged for my large latte (which isn't that large), I realized that the latte was not really worth it. The coffee was strong, not acidy which I like, and the milk\/foam had a nice velvety texture. However, the latte was lukewarm as if it was already sitting out waiting for me 10 minutes prior. Also, I've had their overpriced loose leaf green tea- so bitter and tasted burnt!\n\nI tried to like Manic, but I don't think I'll be back here again.
