Some terrific feelings; the lights, the fountains, the shows, however, it's all being tainted. \n\nI was prompted to write this. Just spoke to a couple visiting Las Vegas, staying at nice hotel. Said they haven't been to LV in 8 years and so, \"what happened?\" The conversation ended with the Couple saying, \"It was so much nicer when the mafia ran everything.\" Frankly, that's what people living in LV feel also. Not speculation. Those that lived here back when actually say these things. \n\nStart with: The guy laying drunk and out cold in front of Bellagio's Fountain last week; crowds just stepping over him. Really?   \n\nThe homeless sleeping it off on the walkway from New York New York to the MGM, one with his pants open, another in a puddle, obviously having urinated.\n\nThe seedy Rap Music - and I like Rap to a point - street performers on mics blaring out the word Mother F'er and b=tch in front of the Bellagio, Planet Hollywood and Balley's, etc. \nTalk about an air of fear, children passing, C'mon Vegas!\n\nIn the winter, Vegas is the local destination for some of the worst local crowds the neighborhoods can divvy up; we're talking tattoos across the face, wife beater open arm pits at the craps table, nice if you want to feel insecure and unprotected. \n\nRestaurants faced with people who walk out on their bills, leaving the Server's to be responsible and foreigners who pretend they don't know we tip in America. (So you are aware, a Server tips out up to 22% on her\/his gross revenue every night. You skip the tip, she\/he pays. For sake of argument, say, $300? That's $40-60 from the Server to the house because you were brought up in a cave.) \n\nPeople chasing you with perfume packets through the malls. Okay, they have to make a living, but when you actually don't walk back the same way because you feel compelled to avoid them, that's just not right. \n\nThe three hotels least effected by the grime; Wynn, Venetian\/Palazzo need to take the lead. The two gentleman leading these hotels care deeply about the sanctity and safety of Las Vegas. (Their hotels are the safest.) Have a meeting and get to the City Council. Pick up the place. Enact some codes. Build shelters. And, please, some sort of dress code in the casinos...  Or, really, like the locals say, bring back the Mafia. \n\nPerhaps, just perhaps, I'm being facetious to make a point. But, the review is all facts. \n\nVegas has gone from the most protected street - the Strip - in the world to low class and insecure in just 15 years.
