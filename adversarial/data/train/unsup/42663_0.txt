Oh my! Let's start by sharing that EVERYONE we would ask about dinner plans would say \"you can't go wrong at Portofino\" and man was this an understatement! \n\nLocation and ambiance- beautiful! Elegant yet new.\n\nFood- I can't find words to describe the pasta here. My husband loves pasta and we have visited our share or \"authentic\" or high end places and not one compared to the food at this place. My gnocchi was like none other I've ever had. \n\nService- here is were we lost it! Upon arrival the waiter came to introduce himself. He was lovely! Then, out of nowhere Chris (who I believe to be a manager) shows up and offers assistance. My husband insisted he wanted Alfredo sauce with his meal to replace the unique sauce the dish came with. Chris then brought him a sample of the pasta with the recommended house sauce to try. I'm so glad he went beyond his way and my husband was able to try what he called \"the most amazing sauce ever\". Needless to say, Alfredo sauce was not needed.\n\nYou literally CAN NOT go wrong at Portofino.
