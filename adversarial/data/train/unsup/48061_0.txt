Sweet Box is a perfect sweet spot to come and get some dessert. I ordered the strawberry latte and it came in a nice looking cup, on a plate with a leaf on it.\n\nThe ice in the strawberry latte is like the ice from Raisin Canes. Tastes like cream and strawberries, which I both like!\n\nSeems like a great place to study. They play some good music in here so it's okay if you forget your headphones!
