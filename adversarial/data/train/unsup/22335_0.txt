I was in the area and needing a place to grab a quick bite to eat since it was a day full of errands with family. I opened up my Yelp app and Cuppa pop up. I had to try this place out since Im always up for trying out different cafes. The cool thing about this place is that there is multiple seating arrangements and a spacious outdoor patio, great for days when Vegas has mild weather.\n\nWe were greeted and promptly served by the friendly Barista. She reccomended a few items and ended up getting a few Sandwiches on croissants. They were good and fresh just needed more of a flavor but the croissants were soft and flakey. However, our drinks were ok and the espresso beans was a bit bitter probably was a bad batch. The saving grace for my visit was the Vanilla Chai Latte over Iced. This was really good and consistent flavoring with a good amount of spice and sweetness. Gonna have to come back to try them out again!\n\n2017 Yelp Review #40
