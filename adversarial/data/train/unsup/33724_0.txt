Tim was very helpful but the company he suggested to me Haggert Home Improvements left a hole between the rad pipes, laid tile that squeeked and shifted after it was laid. Also if ever considering Haggert Home Improvements do not pay by the hour. When I called Tile City hoping to get some support it was clear that this wasn't going to happen even though the person I spoke with agreed when I sent photos to the store that the job was not done correctly.
