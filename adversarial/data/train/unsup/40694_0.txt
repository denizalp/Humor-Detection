Disappointing, we were there at 10pm on a Monday and the service was lousy.  Ordered a beer got it in a decent amount of time but never saw the guy again.  Another guy came up, asked him if I could get some of the fries and without even looking at me I got an \"um sure ok\" and he walked away.  He came back 5 min later and asked what I wanted again.  Beer went dry waiting for fries, no one asked if we wanted another one or anything for that matter.  Finally got fries about 20 min later delivered by a third guy who was actually attentive and asked if we needed more drinks.  Just lousy service -fries were good, sauces were great.
