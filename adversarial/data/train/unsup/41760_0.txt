Ahh, I'm a little conflicted about what to rate this restaurant. To start, they open only for dinnertime (starting at 4 pm) but close late at 2 am, so it's perfect for a late night snack! But....this restaurant is actually very small, and they do not take reservations. So there is usually always a line up ranging from 10 minutes to an hour, which is a huge drawback for many people. \n\nAs it was my 4th time there, we walked in and surprisingly there was no wait time for a table of 2. We were seated immediately. Then, as soon as we started looking at the menu, a server came up to us and told us we took someone else's spot, as there was apparently actually someone else before us (but they went out of the restaurant). The server was hovering around our table and we felt totally awkward. She then asked us if we could get up and give up our seat. We totally wouldn't have minded but the server was being a bit rude so we hesitated. After a while she came back and just started hovering around our table again... by this time it was just an awkward ordeal so we offered to give up the table and head somewhere else. She then said it was okay for us to stay, but by then we already felt quite unwelcome. \n\nWe decided to end up staying as it was quite late already. We ordered our food, and the service for the rest of the night was pretty good. If you order skewers, they are placed on a hot plate with candles underneath to keep it warm, which was a nice touch.  If you want drinks you must go up to the front and get it yourself. Water is also not offered (I think you have to pay for it, not sure). \n\nThe food was quite good but also overpriced. For 2 people the bill came up to around $70. Overall, I would have given the food a 4 star rating but I took one star off for the price and one star off for the horrible customer service seating incident. I would go back, but there are better late night barbecue joints out there that are cheaper and less of a wait time.
