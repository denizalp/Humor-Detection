Had the lunch buffet...instant gratification. Nice selection, including bulgogi, mandu, miso, and kimchi; but my favorite was the japchae.  There was an unusual salad at the end with potatoes and apples in it...\n\n7.99, by the way. Worth a try. \n\nService was meh. Didn't get my beverage until I reminded them 10 minutes later. They did come by and check periodically. \n\nCool chairs. CNN was on the telly. Barley tea was excellent. \n\nI'd like to return and try the barbecue and\/or bibimbap some time. \n\nside note:  what is it with buffets and fat rude white people? Oy.
