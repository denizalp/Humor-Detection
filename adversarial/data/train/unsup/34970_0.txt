Ok, some items are better than others. The shrimp poboy was delish as was the fish sandwich. The bbq platter was ok and the chicken wrap was eh. However, the superstar of the entire meal was the pie. The pie!!!!! PIE!!! Tried a couple of varieties and it was very good. In fact, it was so good, that the next day we ate somewhere else and stopped by just for pie.
