Yeah ... I'm rather torn about writing this review, because my experience was mixed.\n\nI feel bad for them, as they're trying, but effort doesn't always bring repeat clients. \nThat is where I fall under ..\n\nI've had a few different services here, all in the same day: \n\nRMT - 1 hour session --\nBlah. It was okay. It was hard to relax, as I found the room a bit drafty. I also noticed it was dusty\/dirty. No point in having candles on a shelf when they're dusty. I can't help but notice these details when I enter spas. \nI had my massage with Ann. I would not return for a massage with her. \n\nManicure\/Pedicure --\nThe pedicure station was great. New and modern looking. Clean and comfortable, tucked away in the corner. My pedicure was great. Very good foot scrub, and I can honestly say it's one of the best pedi's I've had in a long long time. The girl who did my mani\/pedi also bounced on the boundary of inappropriate talk throughout our time together. I understand you're laid back, but ........ errrrrrrrrrrrrrr. Some things she said had me wincing, which I won't get into any other detail about. She just wasn't professional, and I'll leave it at that. \n\nThe manicure. Okay. This is where I knew the dust in the massage room wasn't an isolated incident, so I'm going to say it -- this area was dusty and dirty. Grungy.  A layer of dust lined the shelves, baseboards, window ledges and the fake little 'asian inspired' wall they have up. HUGE HUGE turn off. \n\nC'mon. Clean this place. DUST. PLEASE. We notice. Trust me, clients notice.   \n\nI felt like I entered a time warp in terms of the manicure area\/stations. Wicker chairs, made me feel like one of the Golden Girls.  1980's-style. Old. Dated. And not in a good way. \n\nFacial -- I have no idea where this was going. I've had a lot of facials in my lifetime, but this one left me wondering WTF was going on. The Manager, was the one that did my facial. She was very very very sweet\/nice\/engaging\/sincere. But ... yeah, i don't get it. The order of the creams, ointments, ect. Don't get it. While the conversation was great, the facial was subpar. Not at all worth the price, based on the service. Unless I'm paying for company. (which i'm not)\n\nWould i return to Camden Spa?\nNo. \n\nIn a nutshell, it's not nearly as clean as I'm used to, and the services aren't consistent, nor is the environment. The vibe is really hard to gauge. \nDefinite pass.
