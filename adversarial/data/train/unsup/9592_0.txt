Oh.... how quickly this placed lost its star rating. Let's just say we started with 4, and then on the car ride home, lost one. Then as my friend and I barely made it into our condo, 3.. Thank god we have two bathrooms. After spending an hour with stomach cramps, lets make it a 2 star rating.\n\nI flushed the other 3 stars. \n\nMaybe a little too much information, but I am Mr. Honesty. The place is adorable. I liked the look and feel. It was atypical presentation for some place on the side of 16th Ave as far as I'm concerned. The menu  is pretty extensive, and lots of pictures. I do well with pictures. I have never seen so many options for appetizers at Japanese restaurant. Sashimi salad? Yes Please. \nWe shared the dinner for two just to get a feel for some of the rolls. The Tempura wasn't oily which was nice, but it was cold :( I was even going to let that slide.\n\nBut considering I feel sick even typing this.\n\nI probably won't be going back. Dayummmmm.
