I see it is time to update my review. Why? Because I realize that in my first review I did not portray to a full effect how fabulous Pour Cleveland truly is. Oh, and they don't do Counter Culture coffee anymore. Now it's Phil & Sebastian (got to be one of the most charming names in coffee) and Sweet Bloom. From Calgary, Alberta and Lakewood, Colorado respectively. The other fact: La Marzocco Strada.\n\nI'll just say that this place has the potential to place me in a slight state of delirium. I am very dazzled by its beauty. It is simply PERFECT. It has a PERFECT mix of modern and rustic which I hadn't even realized could be so PERFECTly executed. All white backgrounds with lots of wood pieces and a few touches of greenery. It is just PERFECT. I don't know what else to call it. PERFECT. Oh, if only they wouldn't kick me out every time I try to move here! \n\nI decided on a pour-over of forgotten origin roasted by Phil & Sebastian. It was easily the best out of three pour-overs that I had in Cleveland that day. Or probably that I've ever had in CLE. It had none of the slightly unpleasant roasty or musty flavors that can be tasted even in some fairly exceptional coffees. It was a very welcome thing when I went outside in the brutal cold. \n\nMy conclusion is that Cleveland is indeed Not Poor, but actually very Rich for having a place so wonderful as Pour nestled in its downtown.
