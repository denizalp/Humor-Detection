I came here for the first time with my family. We were excited to come at first since we saw such pretty pictures. It was definitely disappointing......once you enter into the little mall you see how dirty and run down it is. It was just sad....it has so much potential. The saddest thing is that the people who work there seem like they hate it there and they treat customers like dirt. We went upstairs to look at a store they had with a bunch of little nick nacks. Next to the foot spa or whatever it is. When we went in the lady of the store kept following us around like we were gonna steal her cheap stuff. My aunt was with us and she can be in those stores for hours, so my husband and I let her look around while we explored the rest of the mall. The other stores were fine, just nick nacks, nothing really organized just all thrown in boxes. I did have a pretty good boba tea and we took a look at Diamond Bakery. The bakery does look pretty beat up but their bread looked yummy. \n\nWell back to the upstairs nick nack store. I go back in to see if my aunt was still in there. The lady of the store yelled at me!.........she fucking yelled at me and said \"OUTSIDE, OUTSIDE!\" And pointed her finger directing me to get out. She didn't say anything else...I'm pretty sure it was because I had a boba tea but it wasn't even opened and never did it say anywhere that I couldn't have a drink with me. It took everything inside of me not to walk up to her and throw my drink in her face.
