Husband and I went here for our anniversary after reading that this restaurant was one of the top 25 restaurants in the greater Charlotte area that you should eat at before you die. So bring foodies, we were eager to try a new restaurant in the town we just recently moved to. The atmosphere is good considering the location. The thing that we LOVED about this place is the farm to table sourcing of the food. All local and we love that!  The wait staff was good and very nice. The only reason I am ranking this a 3 out of 5 is that when we leave a restaurant we always rank our \"wow factor\" with each other and after we had finished our meals we were both shocked that it made a \"places to eat before you die\" list. It was good but it did not \"wow\" us and we likely won't be back just simply for that reason. Maybe we are just spoiled coming from eating at restaurants in the greater Philadelphia\/NYC area but we have eaten at places where when we left we couldn't wait to get back. This place was nice, clean, friendly and acceptable but certainly no \"wow, I'll be back\" for either of us.
