Go here maybe once a week. They started the 6 buns for $3 in response to Mashion Bakery that opened just up the street. Used to go to Furama but stopped going after they kept jacking up the prices.\nThese are simple buns, they're not gonna win any awards.\nBuns are all right but their customer service is trash. I picked 6 buns for $3 deal and the cashier told me to get another bun for $3. After a short talk I found out that one of the buns I picked doesn't qualify for the deal. No biggie. I go and grab another and ask to switch out. She ignores and rings me up for $3.50. So I tell her that I don't want the non-deal one and she gives me this dirty look, drops the bun on the tray and shoves it to my chest - motioning me to put it back. All right, so I put it back, pay up and leave; lady doesn't even look at me the whole time and utters something in Chinese as I leave. I get home and find out 2 of the buns are all squished\/crushed.\nSo she got pissed that I didn't want that $0.50 bun and proceeded to squish the buns. B-R-A-V-O Ding Dong. You're not the only bakery in town.\n\nTLDR:\n- went in for $3 for 6 buns deal\n- found out 1 bun didn't qualify\n- switched out the culprit, didn't want to pay extra\n- cashier got pissed and squashed the buns while I wasn't looking
