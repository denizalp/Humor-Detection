I have come to really dislike this Louis Vuitton location. We came here to get an agenda refill and I guess that wasn't expensive enough for the two sales rep upstairs to assist us. We walked downstairs and they didn't have it in stock. I'm not of fan of the sales staff at this LV. A lot of them need lessons in customer service.
