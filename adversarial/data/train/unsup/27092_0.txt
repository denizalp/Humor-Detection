Had the pasta bowl which was nice because you could throw in all the ingredients of the power bowl (zucchini, squash, etc.) at no upcharge.\nThe Bolognese sauce was really flavorful and the chicken was pretty good.\nI had a friend get everything served in a bread cone. That was weird. He ended up pulling everything out onto a plate anyway. But, he said the bread tasted good. It was just an apparent oddity for meatball transportation.
