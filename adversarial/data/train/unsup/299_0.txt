I've only been here once and hope to bump up my rating as I plan on coming back. Shucks is very appealing to me because its pretty close to my house, making it super convenient, AND they have a good mix of seafood as well as meat - very important factor for me because my sweetie hates seafood and I love it. Typically places that advertise seafood have either none or very few meat options. Shucks seems to have everything. Should be a match made in heaven, right? I thought so too but it did not go down that way.\nFist, they had $3 margaritas on Tuesday - yes please! Margaritas were pretty good, deliciously potent. I decided to try their crab and spinach dip appetizer and went with jambalaya as an entree. The the dip had something sprinkled on top, which I assume was crab.. there were no other signs of crab, it was basically a spinach dip. The cajun jambalaya was supposed to have cod, crawfish, and andouille sausage - it had one piece of overcooked cod, probably 3 x1 inches with tons of sausage and some crawfish. The clod looked like was a side order. I was super confused why it came in one piece on the side and why that was all the cod that was in there... The biggest problem I had with the jambalaya is that it was SUPER salty. I am a salt loving gal but this thing was all salt. I couldn't really eat it. \nMy honey, however, enjoyed his wings and fries. He is a wing snob and is very particular about his wings. He only gets wings from two spots in Vegas. Well, he like the wings here! He got them medium. His french fries was delicious too, I can attest to that :)\nThough I did not care for my food, I plan to come back and try other things off the menu to find what I like. I really have high hopes for Shucks!
