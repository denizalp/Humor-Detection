So excited that we got to finally explore High Street!! And for once a yelp event close to our house.\nSo my husband like always was my plus one .. he is always by my side at any yelp event I can a bring a plus one.\nIt was fun to see all the other yelpers and the cute awards given out. All the businesses that participated tonight were just friendly and so much fun lots of little bites,free scalp massage to the half off mani express.. \nThanks Hailey again for another amazing event and everyone who won tonight. i can't wait for another Yelpies next year.
