I purchased the love of my life from here and surprised at all the negative reviews. Yes, the prices are insane but they are some of the best looking pups around. I got a miniature Australian shepherd, tri-colored mix from here in April of this year. No kennel cough or any major issues so far. They have financing plans available if you aren't able to produce cash on hand. The staff is very helpful and friendly. They have a \"Puppy for a Lifetime\" program which I think is a waste of money; buy their products pretty much every month and if anything happens to your pup, you can get another one for free.
