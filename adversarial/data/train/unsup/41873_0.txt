Just OK - a bit underwhelming for a Marriott. The concierge breakfast is laughable. The best part are the people - very friendly. They aren't very knowledgeable about area and knew nothing about bike rentals in area. Restaurant us unimpressive as well. But again, pleasant service folks. We're here during the holidays and there are no lights - what??
