Went here tonight, and honestly loved the experience, considering what was here before, this is definitely an improvement.  Our server was AMAZING. But it was also her first shift ever, so she was eager to please, keen to help, quick with orders, quick with service, and loved talking to us.  We loved talking to her too!  \n\nFood wise, I have to say as an Italian I was disappointed by the homemade mozzarella.  It just tasted like a giant boconccini.  It was hard through the middle, and believe me, try true buffalo mozzarella and its hard on the outside soft and creamy on the inside.  To die for.  So that was a little disappointing.\n\nThe pasta was ok, I've had better homemade pasta but hell... I'm at a restaurant beside a movie theatre and a mall.  I can't expect miracles. \n\nGreat for a night out before a movie or if you just want a lax place but are sick and tired of jack Astors.\n\nTip: if you want better Italian food try grano's down the street or mondellos in Streetsville, or if your downtown, dimmi in Yorkville.  10 dollar pasta made by the mafia, you know it's authentic.
