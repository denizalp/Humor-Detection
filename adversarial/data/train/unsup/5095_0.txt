I was debating whether to buy Medifast online and do it myself or go to their local Medifast clinic on Ray Rd\/Kyrene. I decided that I wanted the support of weekly weigh-ins and counsel so I made an appt after I was told it's just $8\/week for the weekly weigh-in and appts. After meeting with them, I'm told it will take 47 weeks to lose my weight plus another year for maintenance visits for a total of 99 weeks and then they asked me to pay UPFRONT for all the weeks (at $8 each) for a total of $792. Then added on almost $400 more for intial blood work and review. It came to almost $1200. So, I decided to order food online and do my weigh-ins with a friend. I've done Medifast in the past and I like the program but I don't believe it's worth the extra money of meeting with their counselors. Their counselors are very nice, many are recent college grads from the Nutrition program at ASU but I don't think any have ever experienced a weight problem and certainly they don't have many years of professional experience which I would have personally wanted in a counselor if I were to spend the money on visits.
