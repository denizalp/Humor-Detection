Hello Wonton for me is the equivalent of pho, but done by Chinese people.  Not to say that it tastes the same, but it's the same idea - cheap and quick but tasty. It costs average $5 for a bowl which will fill you up, and you get your food pretty much instantly.\n\nThe food was excellent but I hated the smell of the restaurant - it was really really fishy.  I kept getting whiffs of stinky after I left the restaurant too...not good if you have a meeting to attend afterwards!  The food doesn't taste fishy at all though. The wontons are a good size and the beef is really tender.\n\nAs someone mentioned, it's exactly the same as Jim Chai Kee in Richmond Hill.
