The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. \n\nThe Good: they serve a mean Diet Coke. Excellent Diet Coke. Good straw too. \n\nThe Bad: Once the food was ordered, the server activated her Predator cloaking device and she disappeared. The food took 45 minutes to be served! To be fair there was another 4 people in the restaurant though. I'm sure that put a strain on the \"cook\". When it was time to pay for the bill, the Predator reemerged. \n\nThe Ugly: everything was burnt. Even the saganaki \"opah\" cheese was made to sit on the table opposite ours. I had a few minutes to just sit there and watch it burn in flames. At least 3 minutes before it occurred to her to use the lemon wedge to put out the fire. The souvlakia were all burnt to a dry crisp. The rice tasted like it was cooked in dishwater and even the potatoes smelled and tasted like the secret ingredient in the lemon sauce was rat poison. \n\nFolks,  I'm not exaggerating. This is what happens when a restaurant doesn't taste their own food. If they did,  I'm sure they would have truly burned it until it was just charred remains. This was truly the most abysmal restaurant experience in I have ever had. GARBAGE!
