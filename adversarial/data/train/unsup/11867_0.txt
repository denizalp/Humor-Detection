I prefer Bo Derek and even Beau Bridges to Bo Jangles. But that's just me.\n\nThis location of this southern franchise is just inside South Carolina outside Charlotte. This location of the massive Southern Fried Chicken Franchise is pretty typical as far as BJs go. Ahem. Their products are significantly better than Chick-fil-A and comprable to KFC. They are very bad for you but it's worth a try if you've never been to one of these before.\n\nSo give BJs a try.
