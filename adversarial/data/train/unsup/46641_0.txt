First time here in a few years, and interesting to see that nothing has changed. 2 stars are pretty much for the desserts, as service was kinda crap...\n\nConsidering the rather expensive price for things, it was pretty good food. Took 20 min for a steamed egg custard, but well worth the wait. Very flavourful and smooth! Get almond paste soup was not too sweet, and had a good consistency. Milk tea shaved ice with fruit was definitely worth trying, as you don't see that flavour often. Not my cup of tea personally, but my family did enjoy that. \n\nService was such a let down. Water got to our table rather quickly, but took forever for us to order as people came in and paid for take out. Server didn't care at all, and didn't know her products when asked about the herbal benefits of a certain drink. We asked for extra spoons, and she walked away to grab her phone... At least get me my spoons first!
