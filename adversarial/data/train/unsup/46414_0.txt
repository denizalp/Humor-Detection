I've been here twice now, and this place is pretty great! It always seems so empty, which is unfortunate since the food is better than your typical sushi place and the service is amazing. \nThe special rolls are quite large, so keep that in mind when ordering. \nThey also start you with a complimentary little appetizer and a nice orange at the end of the meal. \nPrices are good for the quantity and quality - I'll definitely be going back regularly!
