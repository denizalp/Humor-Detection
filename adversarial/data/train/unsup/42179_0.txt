Always a pleasure to eat at Wildflower but today their morning team really made me a believer in good values and great people. It was a mad house today and their shift manager, Jennifer, jumped in and rolled up her sleeves (literally) and encouraged her people to pace themselves and pull through the rush. She was courteous to patrons asking questions while she was running the kitchen and she kept a cool head for everyone. Great show of endurance under pressure...this location wins for today!
