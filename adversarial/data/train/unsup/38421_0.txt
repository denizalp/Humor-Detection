I honestly loved it a lot it was really nice I loved the whole look of the place. The only thing that I did see that was bad was the hostess. As soon as we walked we had to say hi table for two but before she did that another waiter walked up to her and gave her a whole plate of food to hide under the table . I don't think people need to see that. But beside that I loved the place and the food is great and looks amazing
