That is BS!!!!! I know what i saw .....there were no mussels involved  or trying to be applied ....one lady was holding the dog down and the other repeatedly beat the dog multiple times while it was yelping for its life. I watched the whole incident with the groomers unaware i was watching. There was no bitting by the dog , the groomer was frustrated and took 4 full swings at the innocent dog!!!!!!! I do not care how hard a dog is to groom, now-one should result to beating an innocent dog.  This place needs to pay for its actions and should be shut down. If i had a video of the actions i saw it would make national headlines.....it was that bad................your workers are obviously lying to you to cover there ass with the story of the mussel they deserve to be put in jail.....i  know what i saw and it was despicable
