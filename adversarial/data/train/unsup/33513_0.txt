The space is adorable and the ice cream delicious. The flavour is absolutely out of this world and the texture is so creamy (dare I say, dreamy?). It's better than gelato. I am however a little disappointed with the portion size for the price. Granted, I know I can grab a pint of ice cream from the grocery for this price, but it wouldn't compare to the taste or texture. I would be a more frequent customer if the portion was a bit bigger, though. That's why I'm only providing 3 stars. It's definitely worth trying.
