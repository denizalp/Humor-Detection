Located in the Hard Rock Casino\/Hotel, it's easy to find coming in from the parking garage.  It's an average size venue used not just for concerts but also conventions.  \n\nAs far as venues go, The Joint is not one of my favorites in Vegas.  The sound could be better for the entertainers.  There is a lot of background noise from the open area bar behind the seating.  Kind of distracting from the show.  \n\nAs for the seating, very uncomfortable chairs with little leg room.  The seats are cheap removable folding chairs since this venue is used for other events. I think it would almost be better to just have a general admission standing floor without the seats.  \n\nIt will have to be a really great show to want to see one here again.
