This shop is located in a nice shopping center in Scottsdale with a lot that can be hard to find parking. Met a friend after work to catch up and was glad to try someplace new. I waked in and the owner, Remzi, is as friendly and welcoming as everyone says. He was generous with the ice cream samples and conversational as well. I was expecting gelato, but I guess they stopped offering it. Lots of ice cream flavors to choose from and I enjoyed sampling the coffee and chocolate ones.\n\nI decided to order a Thai tea with boba and my friend ordered an almond chai drink. The tea tasted good, but the boba was too hard. I felt bad because I'm sure Remzi would've offered something else if I told him, so I am sharing it here instead. It definitely could've been an off batch as others have previously reviewed the boba in a positive way.\n\nI'd still come back because of the impeccable customer service and the warm vibes I got from being here. I'm glad this business is doing well and hope it continues to thrive due to great ownership!
