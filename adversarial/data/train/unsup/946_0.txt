$22 for a 15min+ session is not bad at all! I thought it was just 15 mins of breathing in oxygen, but they give you shoulder massages, neck messages, head massages, and this interesting electric shock massage. On top of that, they gave us this eucalyptus essential oil that feels really good and smells refreshing when you breathe it in. I came here after I met a stranger at EDC and said he always comes here to \"detox\" after attending a full day at EDC. I felt super refreshed and awake after the session and was very happy with the service. The workers there are super friendly and accommodating. I probably wouldnt be back here, but definitely a great experience for first timers :)
