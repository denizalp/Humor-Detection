One of those places you read great reviews about, go there, then get super disappointed!\n\nGreeted up front and seated immediately in the back by the restrooms (Strike 1)..\nNot sure if it was because we didn't look rich enough to be seated with the rest of the crowd.. Lol\n\n(Strike 2, 3, 4) Our server was Casey... He deserved maybe 1 star to be nice... NO WHERE TO BE SEEN or get a hold of especially when were all the way in the back. Came to \"check up\" on us about 3 - 4 times for a total of 1 min each time. Saw him mingling and chit chatting with the other tables but no attention to us of course. I give him 1 star for knowledge of the menu and food.\n\nWe ordered -\nNew England Fry : fried calamari with fried clams, huge calamari (I prefer my pieces to be smaller), and fiancé pointed out that batter didn't adhere to well. No big deal but we've had better.\nGarden Mule (cocktail) : strong, ginger drink, not a fan.\nSea Scallops : REALLY GOOD dish, scallops perfectly cooked, drizzled with truffle oil (my favorite!), served on a bed of cauliflower purée!\n(Strike 5) Pork Chops : dry, bland, not worth $27!\nFor sides we had Grilled Asparagus and Mac N Cheese - with kale, not too cheesy, and went well with my scallops!\nKids Chicken Breast with side of Fries and Sundae ($19)- good but over priced to be considered a \"kid's meal\".\nDesserts were a Brookie - brownie meets cookie topped with a scoop of salted caramel ice cream ; Brookie could have been more moist and warm, but the ice cream was delicious!\n\nService, seating, dry pork chop and prices killed the 30 min drive and experience to Honey Salt. \n\nAt least now I know.. ¯\\_(ツ)_\/¯
