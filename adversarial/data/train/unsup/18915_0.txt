Only giving one star because no stars are not an option. Food was horrible very bland! I have never tasted cabbage so bad! They literally just cut some cabbage up, cooked it and served it like that. Say far away from the cabbage.. Not was seasoned good at all\n\nThe staff was nice that's probably the only good thing I can say about this place! Besides the fact that a lady came outside in the rain to tell me the other lady in wanted me because she didn't charge me right! I go back in and she says I owe her .82 cent! WTF!!!!! I even tipped them a few dollars. I ordered my food to go which took forever! What a bad first impression! I will never go back to this place or recommended it. I spent $42 on two regular meals and a kids meal. I probably took 4 bites of the food!!! \nLo Lo's is wayyyy better!!!!!!!!
