I love Chipotle. Let me start with that. When they get their organization right, food quality is spot on and things move fast - it's the best kind of Chipotle experience. But this location needs some love. \n\nI don't entirely blame the staff, but they are slow and inattentive to items that are running low. This leads to slow moving lines - it's almost always backed up to the door, though not because of a fast influx of customers. \n\nManagement should take note of how other locations run their lines. CityScape and 24th Street\/Baseline locations move customers through faster than any I've seen elsewhere. They are to be applauded. \n\nDear 16th\/Camelback Chipotle - PLEASE find out what they are doing so this location can also succeed in the same way. You're killing me.\n\nAlso, please note that I've been standing in line as I wrote this review and I've moved all of 6 feet in that time. No joke.
