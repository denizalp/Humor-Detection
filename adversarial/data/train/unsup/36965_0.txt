Eggstasy is a local breakfast concept with a chic and refreshing interior, coupled by a surprisingly unique menu. The staff are young and friendly, serving an increasingly larger clientele. On the weekends, it's not uncommon to find Eggstasy customers queuing out the door, hoping to get a table inside. \n\nThis area desperately needed a local breakfast place worth going to. Now we don't have to commute south to Arcadia to find palatable breakfast cuisine \n\n\nMake sure to try the Dali Skillet if you like spicy chorizo and eggs!
