I am also disappointed, I ordered dinuguan not hardly meat in it. The dessert ginataan bilo-bilo and fresh lumpia wasn't good I mean it was sour. I could not return them because I ordered them to go. I live about 25 mins away. I tried calling several times but it was an answering machine. I ended up buying Panda  Express for dinner. I'll never going back there again. One thing was good was the server was nice.
