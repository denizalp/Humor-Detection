Katie did an amazing job on my color and my hair cut.  She was very gentle and professional.  I get so many compliments as a result. \n\nAlso got a mani and pedi from Melissa who was fantastic.  She did fun prints on my nails that I simply love. \n\nThe environment is very appealing and comfortable.  They even gave me a complimentary glass of wine.  Huzzah!
