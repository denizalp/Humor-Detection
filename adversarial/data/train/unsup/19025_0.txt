This review is for Marquee's Dayclub.\n\nFirst of all, I don't know how the world I even got in.  I don't even remember paying.\n\nThere was this group in front of mine of like 4 guys.  I swear, they looked like some foreign soccer team or something.  They might've been One Direction.  I don't know.  But they were all chiseled and crap.  Looked like freakin' Chippindales.\n\nEnough of that though.  Remember in my previous review how I said the bouncers can be overly strict?  They take it to a whole different level here, but that's probably because well... the women are wearing a lot less than they would at night.  Unless they went commando at night.  I don't know.\n\nOh yeah, now I remembered why I got in.  Our girl-guy ratio was 6 women to 2 guys.  Yeaah boiii!\n\nThe vibe here though is much more chill than say Wet Republic.  At Wet Republic I felt that it was party non-stop.  You do get that vibe here, but I just felt like lying on my pool bed and enjoying myself.\n\nIf you can get in, good club.  Still though, I much prefer the awesomeness of Marquee's nightlife.
