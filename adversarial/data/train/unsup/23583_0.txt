Highly recommend! The food here is always good. No matter what you order, you can't go wrong. Highlights: The rotisserie chicken is juicy and flavorful. The steaks are cooked so perfectly, they almost melt in your mouth. The salads are delicious; my husband likes to add the salmon with his salad. One of my favorite dishes is Mort's Pot Roast. \n\nI don't usually get dessert at restaurants, but Bonfyre has great little creamy desserts in shot glasses that are the perfect size if you're looking for a sweet treat.\n\nThis is a great place for happy hour. You can get $5 bar plates in the bar area---flat breads, tacos, fries, etc.\n\nThis is a nice place to take out of town guests.  You can make reservations, they can accommodate groups well, and you know everyone will be happy with their meal.
