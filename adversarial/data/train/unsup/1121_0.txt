I've stayed at Vdara numerous times and just yesterday was my first time actually going out to the pool. The thing that has always had me a bit apprehensive is the size of the pool! If they are high on occupancy on a hot day you better believe this pool will be PACKED! Not very fun. But thankfully enough I came at a time when barely anybody as out at the pool! This won't be your typical pool that has loud music and drunk people throwing up all over the place. Expect a bit more classy and intimate vibe, you really get a resort kind of feeling at this pool. Drinks are priced crazy just like any other pool in Las Vegas. The food was just okay nothing to write home about. For two drinks and some tacos ran me a pretty penny! Service was lacking but I will cut them some slack since it was only 106 degrees out yesterday! Will I be back? Sure!
