BACKGROUND\n\nIn full disclosure, the only reason this intersection of McClintock and Guadalupe interests me, is probably because I've lived around here for years; otherwise, I sincerely doubt I'd spend so much time here.\n\nBut I do love ice cream and I do love convenient, especially evident my my numerous check ins, so I thought I owed them a quick review.\n\nThis Baskin-Robbins has been on the Southwest corner of Guadalupe and McClintock for over 35 years, and has been owned by the current owner for 8-9 years. These numbers are very impressive for any business and especially significant for an intersection that is notorious for turnover. \n\nBASKIN-ROBBINS: THE HISTORY\n\nHonestly, although I've grown up taking Baskin-Robbins for granted, their history was groundbreaking at the time.\n\nBaskin-Robbins was founded in 1945 by brothers-in-law Burt Baskin and Irv Robbins from Glendale, California. It claims to be the world's largest chain of ice cream specialty stores, with 7,300 locations, in nearly 50 countries. \n\nThe Baskin-Robbins ice cream parlors started as separate ventures of Burt Baskin and Irv Robbins. They were the first to offer 31 flavors of ice cream in one shop, and the first to introduce ice cream cakes to the public.\n\nBaskin-Robbins was owned by its founders until it was acquired in 1967, by the United Brands Company. In 1972, the company went public.\n\nIn 2008, Baskin-Robbins launched its first full menu of better-for-you frozen treats called \"Bright Choices\" and removed all artificial trans fats from its ice cream.\n\nThe franchise model created by them is still used today. Baskin-Robbins is nearly 100% franchised, with each owner holding a stake in the business' success, while product development and merchandising are handled at Dunkin' Brands' headquarters in Canton, Massachusetts.\n\nI say all that to highlight that this location is undoubtedly a franchise, therefore, although it has the \"Baskin-Robbins\" name, it's owned by an individual, and thusly, that individual has full power to make this location as good (or as bad) as it wants.\n\nI've also stated many, many times, that I'm \"Pro Business\" and hate to bash on a business unnecessarily or for tedious reasons, but in this case, this location is coasting, not improving, and that's why I compare it to the frozen yogurt shop, Zoyo, directly across the street, which I previously reviewed (4\/5 Stars). \n\nIn that review, I described the background of the corner of Guadalupe and McClintock including the struggles and risk of owning a small franchise on a notoriously difficult corner. \n\nBaskin-Robbins struggled in the early years of the 2000's to retain business with competitors such as frozen yogurt shops.\n\nThis review is about the same corner, similar products, (ice cream vs. frozen yogurt), similar franchise model, only my experience is 180 degrees opposite.\n\nLet me explain...\n\nWalking into Baskin-Robbins, it feels old-timey, with a uniformed high school aged kids, probably overworked and underpaid, covered in sprinkles and hot fudge, frantically running the place, bringing back nostalgic memories of going out for ice cream as a special treat, after dinner with my parents. \n\nWalking into Zoyo, it feels like a new age iPhone genius bar, covered in natural wood and Sony monitors, that happens to serve frozen yogurt. \n\nAt Baskin-Robbins, you wait to be served. At Zoyo, \"you are empowered to make you own\" aka it is serve yourself. \n\nTHE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE \n\nOn my recent trip, I got what I usually get, which is a 2 scoop hot fudge sundae, with mint chocolate chip and chocolate chip ice cream, and it was delicious, and exactly what I have come to expect from Baskin-Robbins.\n\nThis location is also my go-to location for ice cream cakes for birthdays and special occasions.\n\nThe staff is always helpful, yet usually scrambling to figure out the register. On my last visit, it was no different; the cute young girl didn't know how to make the register work and eventually needed assistance.\n\nNo big deal, just indicative of their utter lack of training.\n\nCONCLUSION \n\nIn the end, I gave this location 3 stars mostly as a comparison to the new high standards that has been set by Baskin-Robbin's competition, that unfortunately is glaringly obvious, especially since the competition is now directly across the street.\n\nLuckily for this location, this is the the only place to get a Baskin-Robbins delicious hot fudge sundae. I will definitely keep coming here when I need a hot fudge sundae fix, but not in a hurry.\n\n3\/5 RECOMMEND \n\nOF NOTE\n\n*Hours: Daily: 10am-10pm \n\n*There is plenty of parking out front.\n\n*For more information: baskinrobbins.com
