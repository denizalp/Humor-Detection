I absolutely love gelato! So I have been to many places when gelato is sold. I must say that it is all quite good. This particular place is excellent, they have all my favorite flavours Mango, strawberry, and passion fruit. And the reason why there are so many flavours of gelato is to suit all taste, so will you have to try it for your self to find your favorite.  \n\nI have been here enough to know that the busiest time of year if the summer time, but they also have some desserts like cakes and coffees for those cold winter days. So it makes a visit to this place worth it at any time during the year. The Dulce de Leche Cheese cake is my favorite! I recommend this place if you have not been to it, the service is efficacious and amiable.
