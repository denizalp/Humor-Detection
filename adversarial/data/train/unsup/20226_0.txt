It's hard to complain about somewhere you go so often but Fourth Ward Bread Co started out SO strong and has slowly dwindled to an A-okayish establishment. \n\nWithin two blocks of boyfriends apartment, I was very excited to have a breakfast\/lunch coffee spot with great looking treats and good coffee. The vibe is pretty great. I thoroughly enjoy the laid back decor but the laid back wait stuff, not as much. With only one check out\/order line and a slower than usual staff, sometimes it can be a little frustrating (especially when your often only waiting for a single coffee and nothing else). \n\nNow for the treats....\nKronuts. I had dreams about these after my first one. They were so delicious and came in different flavors and you had to pray that there would be one left for you when you got to the front of the line. But alas, kronut, no more. Now, instead, they have gone from great circular flavored goodness to a croissant just rolled in cinnamon sugar. When asked about the change, they said \"they wanted it to be their own.\" Not to be sassy but no one wants their own, we want the kronuts - proven by the fact that now they only serve them a few days a week and there are aaaaalllwaaayss plenty left over. I havent had one in weeks, if that means something to any of you. \n\nEverything else is very decent. I enjoyed the cinnamon muffin, the brownie, the blondie, the egg infused croissant breakfast sandwich, and the bagels. Their bagels are huge, which I absolutely love because, who doesnt want more? My boyfriend is a big fan of their lunch options over their breakfast options. \n\nTruthfully, the place is great for a quick coffee and a comfy hangout but depending on your taste, the food is a hit or miss. Disclaimer: if the kronuts are magically round and flaky goodness again, i'll be back every single day.
