This shop is under new management, a suave looking cat, by the name of Will. I've been vaping for quite some time now and I've been to multiple shops. Even took a \"vape-cation\" just to visit Vape shops and see what another state has to offer. Will's customer service is by far the best I've ever come into interaction with. Definitely, swing by and ask for his recommendation on juices and set ups!! Ask him what kind of hair product he uses too. His hair looks amazing.
