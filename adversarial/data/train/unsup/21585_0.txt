Husband and I have been exploring Pittsburgh's unique neighborhoods, and last week it was time for Shadyside.  We visited on a whim one afternoon and ended up at Mercurio's for lunch.  My guy had been craving pizza, and I particularly like white pizza, so Mercurio's on popular Walnut Street fit the bill.\n\nI enjoyed the Neapolitan white (\"bianca\") pizza we ordered.  At $10 the price was right, though a few more slices of tomato and some more basil leaves would have been nice.  I tend to like thin crust that's more doughy than crisp, and for me there was just the right amount of crispiness and black at the edge of the crust.  Those who prefer a firmer crust would probably be disappointed to some degree, and that likely explains why my husband didn't like the pie as much as I did.\n\nA nice surprise here was the affordable wine selection.  We selected and really enjoyed a $22 bottle.\n\nCute place with a nice atmosphere, and there's seating inside and out.  Beautiful stone pizza oven with a tiled exterior.  Service was smiling, efficient, and attentive.\n\nThe area near the front door is mostly dedicated to gelato, and Mercurio's boasts quite a few flavors--at least a couple dozen, I'm sure.  After we explored Walnut Street and nearby Ellsworth Avenue we ended up back at Mercurio's so my guy could grab some gelato, which he really liked, incidentally.  I thought it was odd, however, that the gelato cups come in sizes yet customers are charged by the ounce?  This is not serve-yourself gelato, and in my opinion if sizes are offered the customer should pay by the size.  Makes me wonder if the owner\/management doesn't trust employees to scoop properly.  I don't know; it just rubbed me the wrong way a little bit, sort of like bars that have measuring guns.\n\nWould return for the pizza and wine.  Panini on the menu also caught my eye.
