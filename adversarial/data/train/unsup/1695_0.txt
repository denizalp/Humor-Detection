Thanks Groupon!  Haven't been back to the Bacchanal Buffet since a Yelp event several years ago.  4 stars!\n\nGroupon, I love you.  Thank you for blessing us with your coupon that granted the wifey and I entrance to the sin of gluttony.  VIP breakfast M-F for two at $65?  Plus I had an extra coupon to lower that price 20%?  Sign me up baby!  Not only did we get to go to the shorter 'Fast Pass' line, we saved bucks on the meal too!  Get in by 10:30 AM - skim some breakfast, stay for lunch!  Yes we did!\n\nThe buffet is truly MASSIVE.  You wouldn't believe the kind of work and planning running a shindig like this takes.  I used to run the UNLV Dining Commons and that was work.  This must be WORK.  There's almost everything imaginable to eat, and things that you didn't even know you wanted to eat!  For breakfast, then lunch, wifey and I got the true breadth of what Bacchanal has to offer.  Expand your belt, it's time to GORGE!\n\nI came hungry, and wanted to do this review right.  But damn, it's so hard to remember EVERYTHING we ate!  Luckily I took pics which I will happily include.  There was just so much I sampled.  I feel like between wifey and I we tried nearly every major item at each station!  Endless mimosas didn't help me either.  I started off slow - did you know for breakfast they offer individual carafes of fresh orange juice, carrot juice, and cucumber juice?\n\nOK, back to the feast we sampled:\n\n-Steak & Eggs\n-Pork Belly\n-Red Velvet Pancakes\n-Croissant Sandwiches\n-Fresh cut charcuterie\n-Seafood Salad (with scallops!)\n-Cheeseburger Sliders\n-3 types of sausage (Mango & Jalapeno, Spicy, and Kielbasa)\n-Slab Bacon (thick!)\n-Po Boy Sliders\n-Sushi\n-Dumplings\n-Ravioli\n-Ramen (yes!)\n-Carne Asada & Al Pastor Tacos\n-Nutella Crepe\n-Assorted dessers\n-Assorted gelatos\n-Shaved Ice!\n\nWe ate SO much!  Not because we wanted to, but because I wanted to maintain the integrity of my review.  Ok, we wanted to eat!  This being a buffet there is great variety, but of course quality is always hard to keep in check.  Most of the items we sampled were very good, I don't really have a complaint because a buffet like this is not often on my radar because of price.  My only gripe is that some of the things were either cold or old from sitting on the line too long.  The red velvet pancakes were chewy since they sat too long.  My steak & eggs were overdone from sitting under the heat lamp too long.  But these are minor complaints because it is a buffet.  Plus, just about everything else we had was darn tasty!  Quality standards are above buffets of lower caliber.  Many unique things you won't find at other buffets!  Like ramen!  And it was decent!  The street tacos were excellent because of the fresh hand made tortillas!  Exotic shaved ice to order with green tea, condensed milk, and azuki beans?  Come on!  \n\nI do have a big complaint though with regards to service.  This is why I had to take this review down a notch.  We were basically ignored throughout our entire meal by our server!  After taking our initial drink order, he only came by ONCE to check on us and refill our drinks, after I had to flag him down!  And we were there over an hour!  Horrible, horrible inattentive service!  Our busboy did majority of the work clearing our plates!  This was bad enough we had to take to talking with the assistant manager, tables around us were all being served by this guy & we were promptly being straight up IGNORED.  Assistant manager assured us this was very unusual and would have a talk with our server.  We still tipped well of course, but I hope most of it went to our busboy!\n\nIf Groupon does this deal again, will I be back?  You can bet your Arnold Schwarzenegger lovin' @$$ I will!  Great deal for a great buffet!  Hopefully next time we get a server who might actually like us!\n\nOINK OINK PIG PIG!
