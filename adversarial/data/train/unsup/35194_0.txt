I was here for dinner with my parents and my daughter (baby).  Service started out nice.  But it didn't finish very nicely.  We did AYCE, and we order two e through their iPad system.  They gave us the iPad for the second order after my father asked if we still had additional dishes coming.  (There's definitely a language barrier with the waiters).   After the second order, we were missing a bunch of items we ordered and even got a dish we didn't order.  It took a while to get the bill after I asked for it.  Then I saw I got charged 15% s.c.  I know restaurants charge gratuity fee for large groups, but this was ridiculous.  \n\nFood quality ranged from average to poor.  Beef and chicken dishes were dry.  \n\nI wouldn't come back.
