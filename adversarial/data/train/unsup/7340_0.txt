This company knocked on my door about a month after my house was broken into , so I think it's safe to assume they troll burglary victims as customers . They also rang the doorbell and were loud and yelling \"HELLO\" with another ring of the bell for good measure . What a joke . Thanks for responding , and I knew what company was knocking and ringing my door because I do have a front window in my home and eyes that work well enough to to read the logo on the vehicle . My housing community also has posted on the entrance a clear \"No soliciting \" sign.
