I was pleasantly surprised at how good this place was. A lot of restaurants trade on the name of a famous chef but don't deliver the quality. Cut, however, is one of my favorite places in Vegas so I was willing to give this place a chance, and it delivered. \n\nFirst, i would suggest a reservation as its usually pretty busy. In fact before I got in I tried to make a res on 2-3 other nights and they were fully booked. I think that has died down a bit now that its been open for a while but its still pretty busy.\n\nSecond, I thought the service was great. One small example- as a manly man I am not a big fan of \"splitting\" entrees, there are few things more emasculating than admitting to a server you can't finish the arugula Caesar salad on your own. When I went here I got talked into splitting Steak Frites with someone and as embarrassing as that could have been they brought it already divided on 2 separate plates and gave each of us a monster portion of fries that allowed me to leave with some small semblance of my dignity in tact. Its the little things. The steak was good, but the fries were amazing- I know I know how good could regular fries be? Turns out pretty good. \n\nThird, Location- its past the movie theater and close to CREAM. There isn't a lot of parking immediately around it though. Having never been to downtown Summerlin I asked a few people for directions and they were all pretty inaccurate. \n\nIf I HAD to come up with a criticism I would say that the App section is a little lackluster.
