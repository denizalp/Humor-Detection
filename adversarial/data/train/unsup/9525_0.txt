After startingmy adventures in Phoenix  @ Scottsdale community college i learned the hard way that not everything in Scottsdale is grander . I love paradise. It appears to be very clean, and the staff is definitely more patient, friendly and professional. Vie got the lay out of this place down after just. 1 week.\nThe library is big and quiet, plenty of easy to find bathrooms, lost of freebies and the teachers are all real teachers that speak normal english unlike scottsdale community college.
