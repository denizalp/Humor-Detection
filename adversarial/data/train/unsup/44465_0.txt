Love this place! I've been a regular for several months now. It's got lots of comfortable space for reading or working, and it's not too noisy. Also, if you like chocolate you have to try the chocolate italian soda! It sounded gross to me too at first, but at the encouragment of the barista\/ super sweet co-owner Erin, I tried it anyway. It's one of my favorite things! Plus their pastries are bomb (try the nutella poptart), and the baristas are all super nice! Their prices are more reasonable than other area shops, partly because they use an app called \"tabhere\" which saves regulars a bit of money. Between that and the discount they give for bringing your own reusable cup their prices are pretty unbeatable.
