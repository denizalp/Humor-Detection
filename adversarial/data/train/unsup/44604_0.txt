What we really liked at this restaurant were their black beans and their snickerdoodle cookies.  Every combo plate comes with a cookie but my family got an extra dozen more.  The food in itself was ok but what made it great was the novelty. Where else can you have combination  plates with Chinese, Mexican and Jamaican food .  From Jerk fried rice to whatever quesedilla, burrito meat and cuisine of your choice; Jade red chicken, carnitas, machaca or teriyaki chicken no problem.  There are so many different combinations you can make your way!!!
