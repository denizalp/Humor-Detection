Yes, you CAN stand up paddle board in Las Vegas! It's a drive out here, and the area doesn't have much going on besides the surrounding resorts, but call or book online to do some kayaking or SUP on a nice day. If you're not up for that much adventure, you can come and watch the dragon boat practices or contests.\n\nThe lake is fairly calm, life jackets are available, and lessons are quick. You can come in for a short group or family activity (grab a groupon!) or follow them on social media for special events like night paddles and full moon parties- everything is family friendly and the employees are helpful.\n\nPark in the garage (level 5), use the walkway to access the marina area, and it's right on the water. The surrounding area is starting to pick up, and you have a few dining, drinking, and entertainment options to make a day out of it.
