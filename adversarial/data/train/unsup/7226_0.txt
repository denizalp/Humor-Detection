5 stars for being a super star when it comes to pure perfection with every single presentation of various desserts.   It was amazing to see the chocolate fountain flowing with white, milk and dark chocolate at the Bellagio as its display but found the sculpted dragon made out of chocolate molding with pulled sugar even more amazing!  I see why people are attracted to this place.  Talk about great eye candy!  \n\nMy friend ordered the raspberry tart and the rose tea macaron.  The raspberry tart was basically a crust filled with pastry cream and a tier of raspberries.  That was not something we felt was worth almost $7.  Nothing special.  The rose tea macaron was definitely something out of the ordinary but again didn't retrieve enough of our interest to try it in the near future.  It's basically rose tea infused into cream to give it that distinctive taste.  \n\nI went back the next day to the one inside the Aria hotel and got the fruit tart.  Although it was enough to satisfy my sweet tooth, I wasn't feeling much excitement with the pastry cream nor the crust.  For paying so much for a little pastry, I had high expectations that this would be the best tart I've ever tasted.  Sadly, it just \"looked\" great.  \n\nI would probably end up going back to vegas to try their other treats.  Who knows?  I might end up with a favorite!
