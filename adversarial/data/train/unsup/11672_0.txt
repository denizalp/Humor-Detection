I don't really understand the hype about the Stampede.  If you've ever been to Capital Ex in Edmonton, it's the same thing but with Cowboy hats.  However, there are less drunk shirtless beer bellies at the Stampede - which is worth 3 stars any day!\n\nIt can be fun to walk around the grounds and hang out with friends.  The rides are overrated though and everything is overpriced.  But that's just the nature of the carnival game!\n\nIf you've never been, I recommend going so you can check it out and you can buy some pretty freaking sweet cowboy hats there!\n\nCheck it out if you can - but once is probably enough!
