If I could give this place a negative review,\nI would. I came with a Jack and Jill bachelor\/bachelorette party and bought two tables with multiple bottles. Despite the amount of money we spent for 25 guests, this place had terrible service. After multiple attempts to request ONE Rihanna song, the bouncer man-handled me away from the DJ booth (he physically picked me up and placed me in a different position- without asking if he could put his hands on me). I was neither drunk nor pushy at this time. This was after the same security guard had slighted my soon-to-be-married cousin off the stage twice while she was dancing alone with her sash and veil on, having a blast. Since our whole party was still there, I tried to cool off outside with some fresh air. After I was given a stamp, I was told to walk around to the back of the line and wait to get back in.\n\nI hated everything about this place. They were awful assholes with sub par music on a Friday night. DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY HERE.
