Stopped by Pinball Hall of Fame to check it out. I have to say, the collection is nothing short of impressive! It is also very cool that you have the opportunity to play the machines.\n\nSo why just 3 stars? \n\nOne of the machines we put coins in had a coil malfunction. We paid for 3 games at $2.00 (versus 1 game for $1.00) but the guy maintaining the machines only wanted to comp my brother 1 credit on any other machine. He was also a total grump when my brother couldn't decide fast enough and even more of a joy when we pushed him to add additional credits to comp the price we had already paid (our substitution machine was 1 game for 0.50 - we weren't going to lose $1.50 for no reason!)....the whole arena is also fairly dark and not exactly the most welcoming of spaces. We were in and out in about 30 minutes.
