The guy behind the phone was very polite and I can tell they are trying to maintain a good business reputation. My friend sees this place has cheap massage and we would like to relax. The price is very cheap, though they tried to make sure you tip the worker properly, which I understand and I had no problem with it. \nI give it a 'OK' rating because it was absolutely just 'Ok'. Nothing stands out in the massage. Again, maybe because I am judging it with a Chinese standard, or the service you can receive in LA. The guys who did our massage did not speak much English, which was a bit inconvenient to my friend. I don't think they had a wow-technique, but it's good if you just want to relax and not worry about the details. They can go really hard on your body if you prefer.
