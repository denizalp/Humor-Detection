I hadn't been to this hospital since my cousin had a baby here almost 10 years ago.  At that time there was a lot of construction going on.  I am happy to say that the construction is over.  \n\nPros:\nAmazing M.D.s and R.N.s\nclean\nmodern\nfree covered parking\nplenty of quiet places to grab a moment alone\n\nCons:\nThere are a few people working in the CVICU that have terrible attitudes and are fantastic at treating people like shit.
