After hearing rave reviews from fiends we popped in on a Friday for lunch. The first thing you see is a deli-style display counter, but there is actually quite a bit of seating. Not enough though, this place is very popular! We hit a slight lull and get a table right away. The line seems to move well as staff, although never rude or rushing anyone, do keep the plates moving and the bills arriving. We were there for over an hour and then noticed the line getting longer so we left so that others could enjoy the great food. The staff were so warm and friendly and helpful - not always the case in popular, busy places! The menu is huge! I am a vegetarian and there were so many options for me - salads, wraps, sandwiches, gourmet sandwiches, I am used to just a few \"options\" and this was so exciting! My friend eats very clean - she is a nutritionist, and she loved the menu - you can really indulge or go really healthy. Nice! Everything was delicious and I am eager to return for dinner - there evening menu looks very promising!
