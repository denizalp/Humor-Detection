We go here all the time. We have a Dalmatian mix and a shepherd (and now a chihuahua that I found) that like the dry side of the park. Plenty of people take their dogs who like to swim to the yucky side but that's their choice. I wouldn't let mine go in there. I had another dog that went in the water once and he came out brown and smelled like sewage. They do have hoses to use to wash dogs off there though. I'm giving three stars because this park needs more places for the people to sit, and because of the yuck water in the lake area, and no drinking fountain. \n\nI don't get people who complain about how dogs want to play rough sometimes with other dogs. If you don't like it don't bring your dogs. There is also a separate place for \"small timid dogs.\"  Dogs will quickly find their place among other dogs, even at the park, it's how they are. My big dogs run from the little ones I don't get it but I'm not going to go to the owner and ask them to control their dogs because that's dumb. \n\nAlso please don't bring babies\/toddlers here unless you're going to pay attention to them. I saw a lady leave her baby out in the dirt in the stroller and some dog started licking its toes and she paid it no mind. \n\nDogs will do that and dogs will chase children, so please don't be an idiot when you come to the Dog Park. \nAlso, bring water for your dog. They don't have any and hardly anyone brings their own. All the dogs in the park end up using ours. So, to re-cap, be a responsible owner, don't be an idiot, and you're welcome.
