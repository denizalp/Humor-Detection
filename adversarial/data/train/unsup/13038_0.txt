Quality Bumper installed window tinting on my truck about 7 years ago.  I was told the tint had a \"lifetime\" warranty and to bring the truck back if I had any issues.  \n\nMy window tinting is starting to bubble on two of the windows - i'm not upset about this as it has been 7 years but I wanted to get it fixed since the tint has a \"lifetime\" warranty.\n\nI called Quality Bumper today to set up an appointment to have them look at the tint and also to have purchase a new bed liner and have it installed.  The guy I spoke with indicated I probably had some brand of tint they don't install anymore (Diamond) and that my warranty was through the manufacturer so I need to call them to have it fixed \"if they are still in business.\"  I asked him if he would look up my receipt to verify this was the type of tint I had and he was unwilling to do so.  He said because I had it installed a long time ago it had to be Diamond brand tinting.\n\nI am very disappointed that the company does not stand behind its products and installation - especially when they say the product has a \"lifetime\" warranty.  I guess I misunderstood that \"lifetime\" really means the lifetime of them selling the product....I am also angry that the guy I spoke with was unwilling to type my phone number in to the computer system to verify I even had this product.  \n\nIf you are looking for a good shop that is friendly and will help you out when you have any issues this is NOT the place to go. And to think I was going to spend more money here..........
