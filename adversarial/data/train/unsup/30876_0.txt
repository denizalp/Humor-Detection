Our vet, Dr. Cruz is amazing. My sweet, shy Dulchis has been going here for her whole life of 3 years. I've gone to other vets with my friends and their pets, and I've never been tempted to change doctors. The staff are friendly, I'm able to get appointments without much wait, and the office is clean. Dr. Cruz spends about 30-45 minutes each visit literally with his hands examining my pooch, and for that, it's difficult to contest being charged for both an office visit and a physical exam (total: $ 25 each, $50 for both). Because of the lengthy visits, I'm able to make sure that I discuss every concern, and ask every question, as my ADD mind rambles a bit. Dr. Cruz listens to everything that I have to say, and is always fully present. My friends vets barely even touch their pets, and seem pressed for time. My normally shy Shih Tzu is very comfortable with the Dr. and the staff. Dr. Cruz always explains options, and why, then he leaves the room, and another staff comes in to go over how much everything will cost, and *I* choose what the treatment will be. Everything is very clearly laid out, complete with prices, and thanks to Dr. Cruz, I can make a very informed decision. For example, when Dulchis had a UTI, they suggested Xrays and some other crazy stuff to make sure that it wasn't anything more than just a UTI, but I declined, opting instead to take a wait and see approach after antibiotics, and it turned out that it was just a UTI. The staff never made me feel bad for declining, and I felt really empowered that I had a voice in the treatment of my pet, and control over my wallet. My friends vets just say, \"O.k., we are going to do this..\", and that's it, and you are the one stuck paying. Not at Camelback Animal Hospital. I really like this place, and I recommend them to everyone!
