A group of us came here for a NYE dinner. The ambiance is great! I'd definitely suggest this place for a drink before you go to dinner someplace else.\nMy experience with the food was pretty bad. Ordered the porchetta \"large plate\". First off there wasn't enough food to consider it dinner. Second off, the porchetta was all fat. Like gristle and straight up fat. I understand that porchetta isn't lean but this was inedible. The server did end up taking it off the bill, which was appreciated.  Even though, I won't be coming back for dinner again. It was a group of 8 and nobody's food looked very good. Service was painfully slow, as well.
