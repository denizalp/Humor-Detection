I have spent many minutes cursing the never-ending connecting walk from train to street car or bus at this station. \n\nI once even drunkenly yelled \"I can't go on!\" parodying the Canadian Heritage Moment commercial where the woman is walking in the snow giving birth. I was 20. Please forgive me.\n\nThis indoor commute is now a blessing and not a curse. When did this change of heart happen? When Canadian winter decided to get a facelift and go by Polar Vortex. That b. \n\nPEPPER POINTS: Gotta love 70s decor. Groovy, baby.
