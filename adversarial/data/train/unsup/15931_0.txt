The Habit - Henderson, NV\n\nI am a fan of The Habit Burger Grill.  I'm just not a huge fan of this location.  I've been here multiple times and I prefer the other locations around town over this one.  I was craving Habit's Double Char (double patty\/double cheese) and on my most recent visit, got a Triple Char (triple patty\/triple cheese).  It's a good thing that I went with the triple because the patties were a lot smaller than what I'm used to.  I also like a juicy burger, not a greasy one.  A greasy burger is what I got.  Overall, I recommend The Habit, just not this one.  I really can't complain about the service.  It was good and my burger was served quickly.
