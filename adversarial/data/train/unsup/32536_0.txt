I have been to this restaurant only twice, both for work related lunches. Both times the service has been very, very slow. The most recent visit we were there for two and a half hours and that was just to get waited on, food delivered and get our checks paid. The pizza I got was dry and not cooked all the way through. It was very thick and needed to be cooked longer. Make sure when you visit, you have plenty of time to spare.
