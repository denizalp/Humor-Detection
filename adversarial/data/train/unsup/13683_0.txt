A good quality and good service sushi joint. Small place with great sushi flavors. We have ate sushi from many different sushi places but Sin City Sushi is our favorite AYCE sushi (All you can eat) now! A must try sushi packed with flavor is the Vampire roll. There are many choices of sushi and food to be cooked but I couldnt get enough of the Unagi (eel) roll and the Vampire roll only. Also the poke and salmon collar was great as well. Lunch 22.95 Dinner 25.95. A sushi place to try out.
