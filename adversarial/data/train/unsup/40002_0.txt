I spent $42,000 in upgrades with the builder and 6 months later I was informed by someone in the sales office that I was over charged $490 for a service not needed in these upgrades. When I told them I wanted my money back they said they yes but that they would only give me back my money by \"crediting me on closing date\".\nI disagreed as they initially overcharged me and should give me back my money asap. After all, they've hung on to my $490 for 6 months now.\nUpon speaking to the so called \"customer service\" named Kristie Jovanovski, I voiced my disagreement and was hung up on mid sentence. \nI cannot believe the nerve of this builder and their employees. They admit to obtaining more money from me than they should have but will not give me back my money when I want it.\nInstead of being empathetic for their mistake and trying to correct their wrong, they hang up on their buyers who spent almost $1 million dollars on the purchase of the home.\nThis is by far the WORST of the 4 builders I have ever dealt with in my life.
