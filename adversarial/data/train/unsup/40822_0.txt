BEWARE!\n\nAdvise you to beware of Hussein amin... Sold my brother a car with $2500 down to get the loan done. Loan didn't go through because they made a mistake, he has no co signer but will not refund him his full down payment. Things got out of context when Hussein Slammed his fist on his desk yelling an myself and brother. Trying to point blame on us bcz the deposits didn't match. Idk.. For someone who has been doing this for 20 or 21 years as he made sure to let us know as he yelled at us; you would think he would double check all the stips before? Now says its our fault.. He can't give us a full refund.. Threatened to ruin my brothers credit, also to report the car stolen ... We simply took the car back bcz that's what they asked, now we have to deal with this nightmare, and out possible attorney fees...
