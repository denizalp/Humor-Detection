These tacos are the best tacos I've had in Toronto. \nCompletely satisfies your taco cravings and hits your personal, and deepest taco spot. \nMy first visit to their new brick and mortar store was during pedestrian Sunday. The lines were long, sun was bright, the orders were plentiful, flowing, and the wait time was 6-10 mins. An extreme case I assume, but even so, the tacos came out in their mound of glory; fresh and perfect. Diced tomatoes, onions, sauuuce, on top of the most crispy, battered fish. \n\nFor a flat 5 bucks, you get a decent sized, double shelled taco full of punched up flavor, and fresh condiments. I opted for the Baja fish, went back in line 4 mins later (after downing my first) for the shrimp. Both equally delicious (even better with a drag of their salsa verde). If you're a fish taco fiend, I'm telling you, look no further or anywhere else. It's right here.
