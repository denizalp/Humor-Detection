Loved this place up until my last visit 3 days ago.  Ordered 2 of their chicken shawarma specials for $7.75 (that's 4 total). I also ordered a side of garlic sauce.  \n\nNow I've been going here for years but what i saw made my stomach turn.\nI noticed when the guy came back from the kitchen with the garlic sauce, his right hand was covered with sauce!!!  I mean his whole palm, not just his fingers. The sauce on his hands smeared the take out bag completely. \n\nWhat do you think  happened here?!?!
