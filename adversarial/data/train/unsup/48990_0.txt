I highly recommend their breakfast burger. It's delicious, portion is big, and it's pretty unique in my opinion. Classic egg Benedict was good but too bland for my taste buds. Pancakes were pretty decent too. Came with a lot of fruits which helped with the presentation. Pretty pricey so keep that in mind if you are broke!!!
