I have driven by Flame Kabob countless times in the course of dropping packages off at USPS, but the timing just hadn't worked out.  Last night, we were heading out to drop off some packages and were looking for somewhere to eat afterwards.   I pulled up Restaurant.com and found a $25 off $35 for Flame Kabob - just what I was looking for!\nThe restaurant is well-lit, stands out on the corner of its building, and is spacious.  The design is...  let's use \"eclectic\".  Assorted granite tabletops and faux rock wall decor lend to a Mediterranean feel, as do the bumpin' beats laid behind sultry \"Arabic\" vocals (I barely speak Spanish) playing overhead (at an interestingly reasonable volume).  \n\nOn the large Flatscreen TV which manages to not look TOO out of place, CNN aka The Anderson Cooper Network was broadcasting news of the Libyan uprising.  It strangely juxtaposed with the music, making me wish all news were Autotuned for our enjoyment.\n\nThe help was... well, helplful if not all that personable.  He seemed a bit irritated with us although we were the only people in the store and still ended up spending $40 for 3 people (after coupon, but also after the 18% grat was added, which wasn't really a grat, but just more income for the restaurant... meh.)\n\nOn to the food:\n\nWe ordered Hummus ($2.49), Baba Ghanoush ($1.99), Tabouli ($1.99), and uhh... the yogurt and cucmber sauce\/dip (Mast-O-Khiar - $2.49) along with some extra bread ($1.99) to start .  Our \"appetizers\" came up within about 8-10 minutes and we were off to the races, stuffing our face with as much deliciousness as we could, and it was all delicious!  The hummus had great flavor, and I actually ate Baba Ghanoush and Tabouli, neither of which I normally ever touch.  Even the bread itself was notably tasty, a rare treat and much appreciated!\n\nThe main courses were (we all shared):\nGround Beef Kabob plate ($6.99)\nGround Chicken Kabob plate ($6.99)\nGround Lamb Kabob plate ($7.99)\nTenderloin Chicken Kabob plate ($8.99)\n\nALL came with a giant pita (half of a 12\"), tons of what they underwhelmingly call \"Saffron Rice\" (which is actually some of the most attractive, subtly flavorful, and well-cooked rice I've ever had... there's got to be a name for that!  \"Wicked Awesome Rice\", perhaps?)\n\nBoth chicken plates got gobbled up before anyone could discuss  how they'd be divided (Fork Wars!)  On to the beef, which was perfectly seasoned (not OVERseasoned as is alllll too common in Mediterranean places).  Everything was tender, perfectly cooked, and seriously - I can't say enough about their getting the seasoning right.  Finally, a place that doesn't think \"Brian needs another cup of salt in him!\"\n\nIt was late in the day, so I'm going light on the lamb... Yes, Lamb is gamey, but done right and perfectly fresh, it's not as gamey as what I ate (I had to eat most of it - I'm our \"garbage disposal\"... \n\nAfter fulfilling my disposal duties (the lamb wasn't THAT bad... just full of lamb-y flavor!),  on came the dessert - Baklava ($1.99).\n\nHow good was it?  We bought phyllo dough, butter, pistachios and honey before we got home after being reminded just how much Baklava can DRIP WITH DELICIOUSNESS!!!  Yes, I licked the honey out of the container - what about it!?\n\nFor our $10 tip, we didn't really get any \"service\", but this isn't that type of place... the open kitchen (awesome) was quick to let us know when our food was up (also awesome).  We considered leaving our disposable everything on the table but opted to haul it to the trash ourselved (darned morals - although we did leave a good bit of rice on the table). \n\nOn the way out, we walked past a few bags of trash which hadn't made their way to the dumpster just yet... Nothing \"shocking\", it was late, they were nearing closing, but really... you can't just take the extra steps to the dumpster when almost no one's in the restaurant?\n\nOverall, great place, good specials (not available with Restaurant.com coupon), a little in the middle of nowhere but if you're on Sunset by the \nairport, there's few places to eat and this is a reaaaally good one.  \n\nTheir full menu is on their home page (awesome, and a rare treat... I don't care about your atmosphere and blahhhh. I'm hungry!) \n\nFor those who read to the bottom, the Peach soda ($1.99 for 12oz) was great - you're welcome!
