The Paris Hotel.\n\nParis, by Hilton.  \n\nHilton, Paris.\n\nSo.. when they say, \"Everything is sexier in Paris\" I giggle like a schoolgirl.  I like this place.... it is stupid... because it *isn't* Paris.  But they pretend, so you try and pretend....\n\nand some people really believe it's Paris. They pretend they are actually there.\n\nI dunno about any of that, but I dig the quaint, PArisian theme and fun time Eiffel Tower replica and the decent restaurant.\n\nIt isn't somewhere I would stay long term or for any reason.... but it is always cute to stroll through or around.
