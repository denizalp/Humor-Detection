It's always a treat to see new restaurants open up and offer their creative food adaptations to the typical menu.  Dirty fork delivers a tasty take on European and Hawaiian fare. I've sampled their Sunrise Sammy, Dirty Fork Breakfast Special and their pastries. I can say I was not displeased at all by any of my menu suggestions. Both main dishes were very tasty and fulfilling. I could not finish either one of them. And on both occasions my server was very pleasant and observant. The costs to dine here is just as laid back as the atmosphere.  They have tables outside as well if you wanted to do some street watching. Its nice to see local businesses offer delicious food and reasonable prices. They also Hawaiian sun drinks, just FYI for all the 9th islanders. Their sodas are by the can.
