Unfortunately I have to leave a star otherwise it would have none this location has the worst customer service I do not recommend going to this location for any reason they are rude and unprofessional they will take your money after you cancel your coverage and then expect you to wait 10 to 21 days for a paper check in the mail. This is not how you run a business. I cancelled my insurance and 7 days after they took another payment this is unacceptable and should not have to happen to anyone. Six days after I cancelled they called me to make sure that I was sure I wanted to cancel and I said yes as of six days ago when I called then they went on to say they might be able to save me money in December and to call back to get a quote I replied with a no thank you why would I want to save money in December when I can save $ 140 now in April and for now on. If your looking for a manager good luck they will always be unavailable and not return your phone call.
