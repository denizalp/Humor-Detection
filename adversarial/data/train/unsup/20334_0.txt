I called in on Christmas Eve morning to see if there was a wait. The lady who answered said I could get right in with no wait. i got there 10 minutes later and the waiting room was full of puking kids and people hacking up all kinds of strange things. \nI was there for an injured foot, not really wanting to catch whatever was floating around in the air. It took almost 40 minutes for them to call me back. \nThey immediately took an X-ray and the technician was great. I sat in the exam room for about 15 minutes waiting for the doctor to tell me my results. She came in and said she likes to meet her patients before looking at their bones. I thought that was nice. \nThey filled my prescription right there, so I avoided the trip to the pharmacy. \n\nIf in need an Urgent care again I would probably head back here...but wearing a surgical mask.
