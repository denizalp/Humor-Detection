My review of the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport is not as entertaining since I arrived late night and left on the first flight out Monday morning.  When I arrived everything was closed, which was fine - because I came to see the city and not the airport. \n\nWhen we walked out it seemed like you were walking into an overly heated room, about 90 degrees. The shuttles to the rental car facility were right there as you walked out the door. \n\nMy only complaint is that when I flew out that morning and arrived at the airport at 5am, the only stores open were Cinnabon and Nathan's Hotdog and it smelled like one big Cinnamon Hot Dog. Killed my appetite until lunch later that day.
