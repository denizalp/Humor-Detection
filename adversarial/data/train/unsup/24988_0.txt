We tried making reservations but we're unable to, however there is an option to \"waitlist\" for a spot. We lucked out and scored a reservation. As others have noted, the specials are on the board while you receive the set print menu. Ambience was great - fantastic vibe with awesome music and service. Very \"East Village\" for me. My favorite!  We decided to order a bunch of things and just share. We ordered two specials - duck meatballs and the lamb tagliatelle. Both were incredible and had wonderful heat. We also ordered the tartar cause you kind of have to. It was really good and canceled out any guilt I had from ordering. We also ordered the Brussels sprouts which was one of the best flavor profiles I have had and I love my sprouts!  Lastly we tried the famous Montreal breakfast sandwich with foie gras, farm egg and local maple syrup. Just wow. Oh I forgot, we also had the chocolate pudding. All this with a few glasses of wine and beer and our bill (with tip) was about $125 American. Crazy. I would come back here anytime and would recommend it to everyone. Enjoy!
