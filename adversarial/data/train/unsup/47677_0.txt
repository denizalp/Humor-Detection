This has been the crowd favorite for buffets in Vegas. I think the Wynn and Rio buffets are the other world class buffets in Vegas. We had the Sat brunch here. I don't normally eat buffets but the group decided so there we were. The selection was great. The lines were short, and the service was great, too. I had 3 plates of food, didn't leave feeling sick from over greasy brunch food, and was happy to have my first meal consist of brekkie favs like banana\/nutella french toast, bacon, eggs benedict, chocolate hazelnut caramel mousse pie, and fresh mangoes. Bring your appetite! For about $25 an adult w\/o alcohol, it was a good deal in Vegas.
