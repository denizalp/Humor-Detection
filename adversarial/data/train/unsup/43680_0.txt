Me and my wife are real picky about the places we eat at.. so I heard about this place and decided to come check it out. The only word that comes to mind is amazing!! the food was delicious and the owner Tony was there greeting everybody! And when I say greeting everyone I mean everyone in the building!! He remembers people's names, their family members just amazing!!! If you are feeling like some great Italian food I highly recommend this place!! Thanks Tony!!!!!
