Ahhh Culver's...why must you be directly on my way home from my hot, sweaty community garden work, tempting me with your raspberry lemon ice smoothie deliciousness? And if that isn't bad enough, you have those hot, salty, fluffy inside\/crispy outside fries. You know I'm weak, so here's my wallet, just take what you need. I'll see you again in a few days, my summer love.
