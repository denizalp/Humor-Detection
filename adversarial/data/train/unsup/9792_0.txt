My friend Di roots around in the flotsam of the world and pulls out gems like no other.  Never did I benefit more from her treasure-finding prowess than when I went to visit her in Vegas.  We're quirky chicks who are more underbelly than big casino, and she treated me to some of the most wonderful times of my life.   We hung out with Sinatra's drummer at a 50's-era dive, found petroglyphs at Red Rock, drank ass-juice at the Double Down (well, I did anyway!), and climbed down into a beautiful shrine in the middle of desert nowhere. \n\nIt's no surprise that my able guide knew about the bizarre and incredible Gaudi Bar, located (hidden,really-it's off the beaten \"Vegas Strip\" path) inside the Sunset Station casino.  Story has it that they originally were going to build an entire casino in tribute to the legendary Spanish architect Antoni Gaudi, and began with the bar.  Hugely underestimating the cost of designing an entire building in this crazy elaborate style, they scrapped those plans and built a simpler casino around its already finished bar.   \n\nSure, it's a bastardized version of Gaudi's design style.  You won't care-It's AMAZING!!   No pics I've seen online do it justice.  You feel like you've walked into the belly of some Technicolor, Giger-meets-Wonka style sea beast!  The centerpiece of this wild space is a 6,000 square foot, twelve ton mosaic glass ceiling, and all railings and pillars are curved and bonelike.  Gorgeous sea anemone-like mosaic shapes abound, and lit from behind the effect is spacy, colorful, and surreal.  You feel like a little minnow in a giant reef of exotic life, a reef that's open 24 hours and serves up delicious martinis as you bask in this beautiful, dreamlike place.
