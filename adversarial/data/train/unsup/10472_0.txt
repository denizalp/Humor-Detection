@menchiesyogurt \n\nMenchies is where a mench goes when they have the munchies. Menchies is where menches go when they want to see other menches munching munchies. You may find menches mumbling while munching Menchies munches many many times. My main munch for this mench at Menchies was chocolate hazelnut and red velvet and peanut butter. With some pecans on top. A small portion, thank you. \n\nSincerely, \n\nMenchies Munching Mench Man \n\nZay gezunt \n\nps \nplease consult an online urban dictionary or Yiddish dictionary for definitions of words in this review.
