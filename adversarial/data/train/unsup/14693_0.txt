I do not like you either.\n\nI mean its obvious you must not like me, serving shredded chicken in a burrito that tastes CANNED!\n\nYou call that salsa? That is hot sauce in a cup. Come on. I like spicy food, but give a guy some options here.\n\nNo bar area either...thats kind of lame.\n\nSo yeah, we won't ever be friends. I'll be down the street at Pancho's instead.
