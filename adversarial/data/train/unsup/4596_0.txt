City Works is the definition of go big or go home. The bar\/restaurant is HUGE - probably the most spacious of any bar I've been to downtown. The walls are lined with flat screens so you can catch all your games here while downing one of their 90 beers on tap. \n\nI stopped in for lunch one afternoon with a group of others. You could still smell the fresh wood! Our server greeted us quickly and was very friendly throughout the visit. I could not say that all the servers were having as good of a day because I heard multiple plates or glasses being dropped and shattered.The training squad has some work to do, I guess. \n\nWe started our meal with some calamari and cheese curds for appetizers. Fried cheese really isn't my thing, so although I wasn't a fan, that's probably a purely an issue of preference.They offer multiple vegetarian options and it is clearly labeled on the menu. I tweaked the salad order a bit to make it vegetarian and add in the veggie patty as protein. It took a couple tries for our server to get it right, but they were very friendly and prompt when I had to send it back, so that was greatly appreciated. The salad was delicious! The veggie patty initially threw me off with its vibrant red color, however, it tastes a LOT better than it looks. Super crispy on the outside, but when you cut into it, there's that that soft bean texture in the center. It paired really well with the salad. The portion was also very hearty, so you will not leave hungry.\n\nEveryone in my party was enjoying their food, until one person actually bit down on a plastic spear in his food. You know, one of those spears that should be going THROUGH your burger and not placed INSIDE of it. Don't people usually sue for this? Either way, it was pretty dangerous and definitely a choking hazard. I understand they're a new restaurant and working out some kinks, buuuut this should be unacceptable. Chew carefully, everyone!
