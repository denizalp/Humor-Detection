I work near this place so come here a couple times a week for blueberry bagels and coffee. I prefer their bagels over other chains like Einsteins. I've only had a breakfast bagel sandwich once (The Benedict) and it was very good and hit the spot. This place is normally busy so you can expect a short wait since the staff is pretty quick and they are also very nice.\n\nTheir dark roast and hazelnut coffees are good, and during the fall they have a pumpkin one that rocks. Although I prefer to mix the flavored ones with the dark roast so the flavor doesn't punch me in the face.
