I never spent time in real flower shops before finding AZ Florist. I live nearby and drive past the building every day and after a few months, noticed the big signs in the window and stopped in. What a lucky day! They have the most beautiful flowers and they last forever. I literally bought 2 bunches of carnations that just started to brown during the 3rd week I had them. Amazing. I stop in nearly every week. The staff is always awesome and friendly and they have a nice selection and super reasonable prices. Highly recommended!
