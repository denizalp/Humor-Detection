Yep, still 5 stars. Even when it's so late no other good restaurant is open, the Pink Box kitchen is still crafting donuts to appease your appetite. Access to fresh donuts at this hour, or any hour in the case of their 24\/7 status, is both a blessing and a curse\n\nAfter trying and liking a plain old cake donut from here, I returned during a late night food run with high expectations for their specialty donuts. Needless to say, expectations were met. I mean, just look at those cross section pics\n\nThe Fat Elvis is a monster with the best flavor combo known to mankind- PB, banana, and chocolate. Imagine your favorite childhood sandwich in a more decadent donut form, and this is it.    This creation has a lot of potential but the flavor can be still be improved upon by lowering the sweetness of the chocolate icing and increasing the sweetness of the PB filling just a tad. Also found the filling to be too oily as well, and weak on PB flavor. The carmelized banana slice was a nice touch\n\nThe raspberry filled is a glorified jelly donut, made with real fruit jam for a more gourmet feel. I found the filling to be too sweet however. The soft fluffy fried dough combined with the sugar coating reminded me of a malasada\n\nI remember right after trying a first Beiler's donut for the first time over a year ago (and after going on a Beiler's diet for a few days), I swore I would never enjoy another donut the same again. Still haven't met a worthy opponent, but Pink Box donuts come in close. Not a perfect donut, but so dang satisfying.
