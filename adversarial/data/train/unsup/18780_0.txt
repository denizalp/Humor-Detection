Specializing in figure competition suits, I first found Saleyla online and ordered my suit from them, unaware that they are actually a local company.  Their website is well-organized and the suits come in various colors and prices.  I chose one on the lower price end since I am a novice to competing and didn't want to spend too much on a suit that I might only wear once.  There were explicit instructions on how to get measured for a suit on the site, complete with a YouTube video, and my friend who helped me out in this area did well.  It only took about a week and a half for completion and when I inquired about when I'd get the suit is when I found out that they were in town. Petia, the office manager, e-mailed me and invited me to try on my suit there. I visited their offices, tried on my suit, and was very pleased that the big ingredient of my show fit well and looked fabulous. They also have many accessories that are needed for shows at their offices:  shoes, jewelry, and the all-important Bikini Bite, which keeps the suit in place in areas that you need it to stay put.  Thanks to Petia and co. for all of your help!\nwww.saleyla.com
