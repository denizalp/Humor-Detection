I'm so sorry to hear about the dog that escaped and was killed on the freeway. Such a tragedy! Many years ago we had a dog who was an escape artist run out our front door in a split second and get hit by a car in spite of our family's tremendous efforts to prevent it.\n\nI have no doubt that \"At Your Service\" will improve procedures, training and security to stop this from ever happening again. I have had my dog and grand-dog groomed there for ages without a problem.
