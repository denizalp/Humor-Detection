The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it's not a \"great bargain\" place. He is fairly priced for the current market, which most means everything in there is:\nA: original- no re-issues here\nB: interesting- this is not a what're house style record store and it's packed to the ceiling so the owner is very selective of what he brings in, which is great because you don't have to flip through the same old shit you see @ every other record store.\nC: $40 and up. Nothing is priced- so the negotiations begin when you bring your albums from whatever nook or cranny you found them in to the owner who sits in the front. He will flip through and make some comments like \"ah, that's an expensive one\" or \"not so much\" then he'll probably make you a price and explain why it is $240 for 6 albums because you just happened to pick up the first album of such and such and this one alone is worth over $100. Then you negotiate a little bit, and pay and walk away happy.\n\nYou see, that's the thing about wax trax- it's not random. It's all good- I've been buying records on a casual basis for years and I would like to have all of Curtis Mayfield's albums- and it got to the point that I would always see the same ones over and over again- but once I found the well organized R+B section here and I found that Curtis mayfield had his own section and ALL of the albums in it were ones that I not only didn't have but many I didn't even know existed! So, while I was used to paying 10-$15 for an album , here I was willing to pay 3 to 4 times the price because as an old vintage car parts seller once said to me \"it's not expensive, it's available.\" And that pertains here as well.\nSo- know what your looking for, be friendly and strike up a conversation about what your looking for (he will ask as soon as you walk in!) and have an idea before hand of what it's worth to you and you'll LOVE this record store.
