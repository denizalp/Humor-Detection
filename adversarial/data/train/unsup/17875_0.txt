My nails have been seriously slayed thanks to Elysa (I hope I'm spelling that right)\n\nA good friend of mine recommended her and I hasn't had a set on in a good two weeks so I was going through MAJOR withdrawals.\n\nThis place is literally right down the street from where I stay and I instantly liked her. You want to have a good relationship with the woman your trusting your nails with!\n\nI showed her a picture and literally she was able to exactly duplicate what I wanted I almost feel like mine are even more amazing then what I had originally wanted. Beautiful set, beautifully done coffin, perfect length and incredible design.\n\nI cannot wait to see what she does for me in two weeks!
