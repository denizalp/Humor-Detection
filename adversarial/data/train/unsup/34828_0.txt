A friend came over with 5 pastries the other night. Sorry to say that only one of the pieces was edible. The other 4 were so stale i was embarrassed. I have shopped there in the past and know they are not cheap but they have to learn to throw things out!!!! The portion size was big but what good is it if you cant eat it?
