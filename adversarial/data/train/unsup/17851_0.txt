Me wife n I went to Best Wok noonish to take advantage of the lunch special. ($5.25). We were the only customers at the time. The booth seats are very far from the table so we had to sit on the front edge of the seat. Get a table. I got the Mongolian beef, the better half chose the broccoli beef. They come with an egg roll or crab puff and steamed or fried rice. Well, for $5.25 you can't really expect too much but holy cow cut back on the sauce. Both our meals were drenched in this cloyingly sweet sauce and unable to taste the food. Think next time, if any, we'll ask for it on the side. We made a half hearted effort to eat as not to offend them and asked for doggie bags after awhile.\nThe following day we decided to eat it for our lunch. Actually it was a little better cuz the sauce had thinned and drained to the bottom. Oh well, for $10.50 plus $3.00 tip it still wasn't worth it. I had to ask one of the family for our check. They seem to be doing a brisk take out business so apparently people like it. Prob not going back though.\nThe egg rolls were very good. Seemed house made and some how avoided the sauce.
