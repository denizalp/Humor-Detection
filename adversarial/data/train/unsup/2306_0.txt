Decent Mexican fast food (Chipotle like) on the Carnegie Mellon University campus. It's cheap and quick. \n\nI don't expect much from Gallo when I come here to pick up lunch occasionally. I have a standard order, which I get every time and that sort of works out for me. A bowl with brown rice, black beans, corn, regular chicken, mild and hot salsa, mushrooms, onions, lettuce, cheese, and sour cream. That's it. It's a lot of food, usually about a meal and a half for me. And that costs $7. \n\nThe service is fairly slow, and there is no proper seating area. But, I would've brought the food to eat somewhere else anyways, so no complaints.
