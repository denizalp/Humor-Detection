This place is awesome! Very small, and I've only ever seen one woman working, but she is AMAZING. Only costs $6 to thread your eyebrows and they are perfect. Takes her like three minutes if even that. Don't wear eye makeup if you plan on going on with your day afterwards though, she asks you to pull your eyelids down so that you don't get your lashes caught, which makes your make up smear. She has a punch card as well which is great. I've never had any other services there, but the threading is great!
