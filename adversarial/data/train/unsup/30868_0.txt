I come here often and get the Berry Good bowl with Açaí. I'm obsessed with anything açaí, so I know I couldn't go wrong with this place. The customer service is fine and they're pretty quick with my order. Their bowls are more on the smoothie side (really blended) I'm more of a fan of thicker consistency.. but still very good and they give you a pretty good amount of it.
