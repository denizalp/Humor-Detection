I will NEVER return to this location again! I tried out their demo program. Admittedly I returned the rackets a few weeks late, I explained how I was out of town helping take care of my grandfather who was recently diagnosed with terminal cancer and that I actually didn't even get to play with the rackets. The old man, presumably the owner, just looked at me and very rudely said \"no one else was able to play with them either.\" They also, without any warning charged me $300 for the rackets. They did tell me it would be a $5 daily late fee which would have been $100, I knew that and was willing to pay. While the money was returned, he did charge me for another demo program without warning. I was ready to purchase 2 new rackets until I ran into this guy. \n\nAs a business owner and someone who has been playing tennis for over 15 years I can say that I will never go back here again, and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. If I treated my clients in this manner I would be out of business in no time.
