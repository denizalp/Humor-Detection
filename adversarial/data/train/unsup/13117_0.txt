My wife needed to visit Lake Milton, Ohio for a seminar, so while she was working, I was sweating.  My favorite thing about PF is that is seems like there is one within miles of all of humanity.\n\nThis one has a lot going for it with a few downsides.  First, it is pretty big, with lots of machines and a good area for weights.  Second, most of the machines have towels and cleaner on them.  It was a bit odd at first, but once I became acclimated to it, I liked being able to wipe it down conveniently before and after.  Third, the locker rooms is a nice size.  The two major qualms I have with the place is that first, it doesn't have wifi.  It boggles my mind that something that is relatively cheap and adds so much to the experience would be missing.  The second, is the jenky setup in the showers for your shampoo and soap.  The have a little carrier thing attached to the wall and the shower with a suction cup.  My soap and shampoo fell from there at least three times.  I finally just let them lie on the ground, while I finished my shower.\n\nOverall, this was a pleasant experience and if in the area I would definitely return.  It is a solid PF.
