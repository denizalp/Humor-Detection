Went in for dinner on recent business trip. Tried the \"Taco night special\", was informed it was a minimum of 4, so ordered although it didn't say that on menu. \nTacos were small, very scant on filling, and pretty much flavorless.  Asked for hot sauce, Tabasco was only one available. Decided to try a cup of chili, as tacos weren't even close to filling. Chile tasted of green peppers and tabasco, no other flavors evident, near no meat either. \n\nAlthough door staff and waiter were very nice, I wouldn't recommend this place at all.
