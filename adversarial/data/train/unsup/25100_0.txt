Stopped here on our way home back to Texas. We usually eat at this restaurant during our visits to the casinos in Oklahoma. I found out that the southern style food is not the same and that not all the chain restaurants offer the same menu items. I'm used to good ol' southern fried food and this place just doesn't have that southern change I was missing. I wouldn't eat here again.
