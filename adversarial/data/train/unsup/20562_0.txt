We have had a unit here since 2006 and during that time things have really gone down hill. So many rules have been implemented by the HOA that it finally made living there unbearable. The security guards are not helpful and it seems like they make it a point to aggravate the homeowners out of sheer boredom. You can no longer have large dogs. You are no longer allowed to bring trailers on property unless you notify the HOA well in advance, even though they have an over abundance of parking. The HOA applies selective enforcement to items on the balconies. I just can't say enough bad things about them, and it seems like the condo board gets worse with each election. It seems like everyone on the board develops a \"little Hitler\" complex after they get elected. \n\nAs far as the condos themselves: The walls are thin, insulation poor, the water heaters are all $2500.00+ gas blower units that need to be replaced every 4 years because of the water. The garbage chute is in a room that is never cleaned, the elevators smell terrible 50% of the time and the hallways smell like they are rarely cleaned. \n\nWe sold our unit at a huge loss just so we would be rid of the HOA. Life is so much better now. It was the best decision we ever made!
