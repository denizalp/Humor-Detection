So I ordered a 2 liter soda, fries, wings, pasta, and a pizza. I got the order in 2 pizza boxes and a bag. I had my boyfriend check the order because I had to catch up on laundry (yay). He told me there was 2 pizzas and a salad. So I let my hangriness take over and called the restaurant. The guy who answered (I believe the owner or manager) asked if I opened the boxes and I said yes because I assumed my boyfriend did. Long story short... My boyfriend didn't open the boxes... The fries, wings, and pizza were in the large pizza box. But no soda to be found :( The person who answered the phone at Lucky's said he would add an extra 2 liter next time. I feel like a complete idiot and felt like I owed a 5 star review to Lucky's pizza for still being patient with me and ending the call on a good note (: \n\nOh and I made my boyfriend go to the store and get soda for making me look crazy lol ;)
