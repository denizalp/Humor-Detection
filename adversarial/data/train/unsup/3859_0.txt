The good was just OK. Being from NY I'm very particular about certain cuisines but was open to giving this place a chance. I was in rush for lunch so I ordered a beef patty and shrimp quesadilla to try something way different. The seasoning in the beef party was lacking. I don't think it was made fresh. Also the quesadilla was just not good in its execution or flavors. But I guess that was my fault getting a quesadilla at a Caribbean restaurant. I'm open to trying the food again since I didn't get the full experience but it won't be anytime soon.
