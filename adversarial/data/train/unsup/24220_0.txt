The best option for dog-sitting in the Lake Norman area. I have been bringing Lulu here for two years and she loves it. Every time I approach in the car, her tail starts thumping. \n\nAs you can see from the picture, they have a pool, which most of the dogs love. If you're worried about a small dog getting hurt or anything like that, don't worry, the dogs are separated by size in different play groups. \n\nThere are also different play areas. If I'm not mistaken, this is one of the largest Pet Paradise locations in the country. Your dog will have plenty of room to roam. \n\nThe prices here are fair, the staff is exceptional, the place is clean, and it's convenient. They will watch your dog (or cat) day or night. \n\nHighly recommended.
