Heard about Ichiza from my roommate on her last trip to Vegas, and decided to check it out with the family on our annual Vegas trip. I have to give this place extra props because my parents actually liked it. \n\nWhat was I doing bringing my totally unhip Vietnamese parents to a pretty hipster izakaya in Vegas? Well, they don't like sushi, and wanted to taste other Japanese food. And because I'm such an accomodating daughter, I figured this would be a good opportunity. But it didn't occur to me that the place had pretty much all bar food and young patrons. So when we stepped in, I felt so uncool at first, but with my mom being so cute and my dad being so genteel to the waitresses, I was reminded that they have been in this country long enough to know how to deal with non-viet-traditional people. \n\nMy mom ordered a TOFU STEAK (I guess that sounded appetizing to her), and out came a huge square of lightly marinated tofu on a bed of boiled bean sprouts. My parents pretty much devoured that whole dish, bean sprouts and all. Dad ordered the ika-yaki (grilled squid) and loved how it was seasoned. I was happy he ordered it because I got to eat it, too. I got the soft shell crab and sis got the soba noodles. We had a few more dishes (chicken gizzard, more tofu, etc.) and all them were pretty tasty. \n\nAll the food came out fresh and light. We all felt full enough with our 10 or so dishes and no one had indigestion or that gross feeling of super grease afterward. \n\nMy parents, being so polite, thanked the manager and the waitresses in their accented English and said that they hope to see them again. And for a moment I felt that my parents were pretty hip...
