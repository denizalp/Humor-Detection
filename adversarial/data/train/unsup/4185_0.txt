Very hipster environment. Food is good, but small. Paid $3 for a tablespoon for cottage cheese. The English muffin sandwich was very tasty.  It was very crowded and loud, which I don't care for. They have a market that sold a lot up non food items (Think hipster urban outfitters with some food items). The food was good and I try it again when I have the chance.
