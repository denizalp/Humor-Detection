This is probably the only indoor mall that I love! They have great (but expensive) shops, and even some fairly affordable one's.  I would've given it 5 stars, but it gets crowded sometimes and there are a lot of gawkers looking at all the decorations and scenery.\n\nPros:  nice ambiance, tons of stores\n\nCons: Hoards of  tourists stopping and looking at the scenery with their jaws dropped (they really get in your way!), you might get lost in it :)\n\nBEWARE OF THE GELATO: Seriously guys, be careful- there is a delicious looking gelato stand inside. The flavors look amazing and there is tons of decoration and stuff.  I was there with my brother and we had a taste of the gelato, which was delicious....BUT, I ordered a kid's size and my bro ordered a medium. At the register the lady said, \"That comes to 24 dollars please.\"  I thought she didn't ring it up right so I said, \"We just had two gelatos--a kid's and a medium.\"  She said, \"Yes mam, that comes to 24 dollars.\" My jaw dropped! You gotta be fucking kidding me! 24 bucks for two fucking ice creams! WOW. I know that Vegas is expensive, but c'mon!! For $24 a midget better magically appear and sing a song and do dance for me, or something!\n\nOther than that, it's all good :)
