As a Hawai'i transplant, discovering The Beef Jerky Store brought absolute joy to my heart! It reminded me of the mom-and-pop crack seed stores that my mom would bring me to as a kid back home in Hawai'i.\n\nTucked away in an alley near the Fremont Street Experience, this heaven on earth has all of the munchies you could possibly imagine! There is an entire wall dedicated to all things li hing mui and my mouth is watering just thinking about it. \n\nI was so pleased when I saw a bunch of familiar brands such as Hawaiian Sun and NOH! There is even a freezer with food items that you definitely wouldn't be able to find at your local neighborhood market. Keoki's Kalua Brand Pork, lau lau, Portuguese sausage, and my fav mochi ice cream!\n\nThey carry an endless variety of jerky. If you're looking for something different, I would recommend the Original Crispy Beef Jerky. It's unique and a little addicting. Don't say I didn't warn you!\n\nThe Beef Jerky Store will now be a mandatory stop whenever I'm in the area. I would never turn down some li hing mui or Asian snacks! I love knowing that whenever I have a craving, I can just make the drive instead of asking someone in Hawai'i to send me a box of goods!
