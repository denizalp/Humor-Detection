Really good and cheap Mexican food fast! Love their enchiladas, green chile burritos and tamales....all for under $5 each! Their salsa is hot and their tortillas are homemade and so yummy!\n\nAnd although I love the Mohave location, this one is much closer to my neighborhood and it is much easier to park here. Plus it is larger which makes the \"survival of the fittest\" vibe a little less pronounced!\n\nYummy!
