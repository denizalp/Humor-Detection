Please do NOT get ripped off by this guy.  He came over to our place (just to re-key some locks) and spent more time talking than working.  He then 'claimed' to have lost the pin for the lock on our front door, which meant that we couldn't lock it from the inside!  If there was a fire, we would have been locked in.  He tried to sell us a new lock.  Of course, weeks later, when we were ready to replace the actual locks we \"found\" the pin sitting inside the lock.  Not sure if he did it on purpose.  But it was a huge inconvenience.
