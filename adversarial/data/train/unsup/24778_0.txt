Spinato's how do I love thee? Let me count the ways. First, your delicious sauce. It's sweet goodness at its finest. In fact, the sauce is so delicious, we always ask for extra sauce on our order! Second, your soft and chewy crust, just perfectly cooked. Third, the toppings, especially the sweet sausage that goes perfectly with the sweet sauce. \n\nAs you can tell, I simply love Spinato's. It's one of my top go-to pizza parlors for either dine in or take out. This location is homey and very friendly. It reminds me of a family pizza parlor during my childhood days. The staff is welcoming, the service is top notch and the food, well the food is simply supreme. They also have a bar with some tvs, in case you want even more casual dining and the takeout is perfect. The takeout is fast and they keep your food warm in a heater while they wait for you to pick it up.
