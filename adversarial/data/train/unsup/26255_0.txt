I love Dao Kitchen! The service could be slightly improved, but the food is always amazing! The portions are better than average and always fill me up. I would recommend to DINE IN. The food is amazing when served fresh and hot! The prices are average when compared to others and you get a great value. I recommend the orange chicken!
