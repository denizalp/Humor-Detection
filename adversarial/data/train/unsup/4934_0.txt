I came to Dosa Palace on the advice of yelpers, but I wasn't blown away like others with the Masala Dosa offering. Though Dosa Palace is not bad, there are about 50 of these types of restaurants in Scarborough. Maybe Mississauga just needs more options where Sri Lankan food is concerned. \n\nThe dosa itself was well made, crispy and just slightly greasy like I like 'em. The rasam was lukewarm, not hot and the chutney and masala was extremely, unbearably spicy. \n\nThe restaurant itself is in a seedy part of Mississauga and service is a little off through staff is generally pleasant; you might have to repeat requests once or twice.
