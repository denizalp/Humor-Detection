Some of you newbies and lurkers who don't know me might get the sad impression that I am a sot... a drunkard... a misbegotten carouser...\n\nLet me tell you all (*raises a finger authoritatively*) I am not drunk all the time. I do other things that are not alcohol-related.\n\nFor example, during my last trip to Las Vegas I decided to check out the Tram. \n\nThe Tram (for the uninitiated) is actually a couple of monorails that travel between Mandalay Bay and Excalibur. There's the express side (which runs between the two main hotel\/casinos) and the \"local\" side (which stops at Luxor along the way).\n\nIn the desert heat, this public transportation is a boon. \n\nOn this recent trip to Vegas, the Tram was down, so I had to walk from the Excalibur to The Mandalay and - Heavens to Mergatroid - I was so dehydrated that I got a Charlie Horse that night as I slept.\n\nLuckily, the Tram got fixed afterwards. I'd hate to think of what would've happened to me if I had to walk to get my next G-and-T.
