I went here on a THURSDAY night to get dinner with my boyfriend. We dressed casual on a weekday night. We got inside and  the hostess just look at us with a additutte face. The first thing she said was do y'all want to sit outside because there's no tank top allow. Are you serious? It's was 8 at night! I'm just trying to sit down and have dinner, I don't want to sit outside! It's was humid and rainy.\n\nI didn't know this place was that \"high end\" where you have to dress up for oyster bar, y'all only have $$ on yelp! \n\nWill never returns!!!!!!!
