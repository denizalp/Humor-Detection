My girlfriends and I have been in the Old Town Scottsdale area all weekend, having various subpar food experiences, until we showed up at Cafe Monarch! \nThis place is amazing!!! From the adorable outdoor courtyard dining area, to the extremely attentive wait staff, CM really set the tone to provide a truly amazing doing experience. We were hopeful the food and wine would also be incredible. And it was!!\nThe chef changes the menu each week, but I cannot believe there would ever be a bad meal at this place. We each did the wine pairing with our meals - so much fun and so great to try wines we normally wouldn't have ordered without the pairing. We tried three of the four entree options and all of them were phenomenal! \nThis was by far the most expensive dining experience we had while in Scottsdale, but totally worth it! We had spent enough on other meals that ended up being fairly terrible that I think we would have paid anything to eat fabulous food like this!\nIf you have a special occasion to celebrate or just enjoy a true five stars dining experience, you should definitely check this place out when in Old Town!
