What an experience. I took my lunch group and even though I never eat breaded chicken, I did and it was delicious. Licking my fingers. Biscuits were wonderful. I had the Blue plate special just because it was a smaller dish and the fried green tomatoes. Rich and yummy. Everything. Service was excellent and boy was it busy! I will go again!
