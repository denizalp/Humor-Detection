This is for Thrifty car rental at the airport.\nWe rented an SUV for three days and declined Insurance. After we returned the car, our final price was doubled because they slipped in LD insurance into the contract. We went back to the counter, and talk to the manager, see picture attached. He told us the contract was closed and could not be changed. \nThis will be our last time to rent from Thrifty\/Dollar.
