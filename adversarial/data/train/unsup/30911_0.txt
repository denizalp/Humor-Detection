Here is where my rating of 2 stars come into play. \n\nFirst, the cups there are too big. Although it may be helpful for newcomers as they may make a mess serving themselves, it is an obvious marketing scheme to get you to fill up the cup and pay more than what you thought.\n\nNext, they have a limited arrangement of toppings. For example they do not have any hot toppings. No hot fudge?! Although the fruit is fresh, they do not offer enough toppings. And it is kind of tricky to put toppings on because of how big their spoons are.\n\nThird, the yogurt does not taste as creamy and premium at other places such as golden spoon. For example, their version of peanut butter is more of an aftertaste when compared to golden spoon every bite of froyo has the perfect amount of peanut butter.\n\nNext, the one employee there did not make the shop welcome and inviting. It looked like she did not want to be there and it took her a full 2 minutes to ring up my order after I was done.\n\nLastly, you are bound to OVERPAY everytime. I am a golden spoon customer but I figured I might try out yogurtland for a change. What would've been $5.19 at golden spoon, the same proportion cost me $7.62! That means I could've bought a quart of froyo at golden spoon,  rather than their version of a regular.\n\nAfter my visit, I will stick with golden spoon who have awesome employees who professionally makes my yogurt with premium froyo at an affordable price.
