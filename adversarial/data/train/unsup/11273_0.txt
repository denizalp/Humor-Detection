I love trying the hospitality group restaurants when I am in town. I have been to 3 of them now, but this is by far my least favorite. My husband and I stopped in for lunch. The service was great, but the food was mediocre. And my glass had lipstick on it that was NOT MINE. Meaning my cup was DIRTY. DISGUSTING. (And no, they didn't comp the drink even, which I think would be the polite thing to do.)\n\nI had the Tenderloin Oscar- twin medallions with lump crab, b√©arnaise sauce and whipped potatoes. It was pretty bland, which is a bummer, because it was the thing on the menu I was most excited about. (See my review of Ruth's Chris in Indianapolis if you want to try this dish done right.)\n\nMy husband had a lunch trio of chicken and corn chowder (his fave of the meal), a wedge salad with WAY too much dressing, and a BBQ swordfish sandwich that didn't taste like anything but bbq. Not great, but it wasn't too expensive.\n\nLet's put it this way: we could have spent our $50 in a better way, but if it were half the price we would have still not been impressed.\n\nSuch a bummer!
