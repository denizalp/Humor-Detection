How can you get made at a store who's only purpose in life is to provide toys to kids?! I remember spending hours in a Toys R Us as a kid. I would wait until a special occasion when my parents let me wonder the aisles and pick out a small toy. The store was like an everyday Disneyland. Fast forward several years and unfortunately, when becoming an adult, some of Toys R US magic disappeared with my childhood, but I can still appreciate this store for children. However most importantly is the fact that this store has been my saving grace when it comes to buying gifts for my two nephews. Toys R Us has every toy imaginable and at very competitive prices. I especially love that they have a card and gift wrapping aisle where you can grab tissue paper, bags and wrapping paper before leaving. It's a great one stop shop.
