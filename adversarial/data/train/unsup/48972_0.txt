This place tried to put me in the hospital. I called and orders food and specifically told the young lady on the phone that I was allergic to peanuts. She assured me no problem we deal with that all the time. I received my food and proceeded to eat not realizing that they put peanuts in my food. I called and she got mad at me and then hung up on me. I had to go to quick care and get a shot. They have no respect for their customers! Horrible people!
