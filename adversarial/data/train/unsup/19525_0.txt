I recently changed jobs and wound up working right next to this magnificent diner. It was already one of my favourite places to eat in the city, and then they put me right next door to it?!?!  This must be the universes way of telling me I need to eat here more. Fine universe! You win this time.\n\nI can get a simple vegan BLT on brown bread, with some tasty mayo and a side of fries for only $6 (plus tax\/tip). That's incredible! Also, very delicious and quite filling. Recently they started serving a vegan mac n' cheese that's honestly so good it might make you a little confused, sexually. It's not on the menu for some reason though, so you gotta ask for it.\n\nI've noticed that everyone seems to think this is a brunch place, but I'll have you know that it's a great spot for dinner as well. There is a slightly different menu for lunch\/dinner and if you haven't been you should check it out. I thought they were even supposed to be expanding their dinner menu but I haven't seen any changes yet, so hopefully that will happen soon. Then they'll be the perfect place for brunch, lunch and dinner!
