I usually ignore the bad customer service here, pizza is cheap and fast. I called and made a specific order which I had to repeat 3 separate times because the lady taking my order just wasn't listening. I got my food home and it was cold and completely wrong. So I called back to get it handled and once again had to repeat my order 3 separate times. I talked to manager, Erica, who thought interrupting me mid sentence was how to handle things. She had said my food was ready. I got there not even 5 minutes later and had to wait for them to re make my order. I get that it's busy, but if you mess up someone's order, and make them drive all the way back just to wait again, decent customer service is expected at the least.
