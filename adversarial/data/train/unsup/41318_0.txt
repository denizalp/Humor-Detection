This is my second time visiting this restaurant. Ambience could be better. It feels more like a fast-food restaurant than an actual dine-in restaurant. The guacamole is very good. Chips are freshly fried. I had the shrimp tacos which had great flavour. My friend had the chicken burrito and she liked it a lot too. Service was a bit lacking. The restaurant was full (Sunday afternoon) and they had one server. She was a good server unfortunately she was overworked which caused her to forget a few things. Overall, it was satisfactory.
