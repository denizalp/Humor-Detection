On my maiden voyage to Fez, I was completely grumpy and out of sorts. All I can say is that the pomegranate margarita and my boyfriend's niceness turned that around. We stayed for a drink and were on our merry way. I was lamenting the fact that I no longer work across the street and couldn't make this my go-to place. I want to stop in again and stay awhile longer for dinner. Liked the vibe here a lot.
