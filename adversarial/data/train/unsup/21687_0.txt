After a long wait and passing by a \"coming soon\" sign for months, this place finally opened. I had a good first sandwich and the selection was great. Quality ingredients, great bread, and a clean, modern space. It's small, but it's all the space you need. I got a huge sandwich stuffed with an awesome chicken salad, pancetta, arugula and sun dried tomatoes. A delicious play on a chicken BLT and it was huge! I was stuffed!\n\nThis is another great addition to Mount Dennis. It starts with an Indie Coffee Shop with cute tattooed baristas with purple hair and nerd glasses, then you get a vegan restaurant, then a cool sandwich shop.... Boom... There goes the neighborhood!\n\nThanks for moving in, Neighbour!
