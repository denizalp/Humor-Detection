As good as it can get! Love coming here every year for our pet rabbit, Truffles. The staff here has been so wonderful to us at every visit, WE LOVE IT! \n\nAs for our vet, Dr. McCready is awesome! She really knows her exotics. If you love and care for your rabbits, go to her. She gives her full attention to our rabbit every time to study his history, examine and address as many concerns we might have for as long as it takes--the longest we were able to have her undivided attention was probably a good hour. And with prey animals you would think they would run a muck, but ours is always so calm under her care. \n\nWould I recommend you take your exotics here? YES! Very sanitary, (pet) friendly and hospitable! *2 thumbs up*
