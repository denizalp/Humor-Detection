The Beauty Supply Outlet is my special haven when it comes to primping and prepping my appearance for special occasions or day-to-day basic styling.\n\nBefore I discovered this store a few years back, I would purchase hair products, straightening irons, nail polishes and everything else at prices that were sky high.\n\nOnce I started to shop at this outlet, it all changed!\n\nI purchased my very first Chi ceramic straightening iron at this store almost 2 years back and it only cost $70 with a case and everything!\n\nThis Chi iron purchase made me very happy and impressed because the price was low and the quality of my iron has not changed since my first use.\n\nAside from that, I purchase all of my OPI nail polishes there for $9 per bottle, lower if it is a blow-out sale.\n\nIf you want to keep yourself looking good but don't have so much money to spend, visit the Beauty Supply Outlet!\n\nThere are several locations all over the GTA and you are always able to find the latest and greatest in beauty products that are both high quality and won't hurt your wallet.
