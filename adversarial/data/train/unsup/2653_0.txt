Sigh...It really takes a lot of effort (or should I say lack thereof) from a business to warrant just a single star, as even if a business makes any sort of attempt at something, anything, they can get themselves up to at least two stars if for nothing more than effort, but there is a place for one star reviews and unfortunately these guys earned it and then some due to their lack of communication and follow up with a prospective customer (me).\n\nContacted them a couple of weeks ago to get an estimate on some plumbing work needed at my home and things started off fine as they took my information and scheduled someone to come out no problem.  The guy came out and spent a good thirty minutes looking over the work to be done so that he could create an estimate for me and he was solid and everything was going fine, so I know you are thinking...why in the heck are these guys getting only one star?   \n\nWell...the guy took down my information and verified my email and told me he would send me the estimate by 5pm that day no problem.  5pm comes and goes, no estimate.  Not a huge deal, as I understand things happen...Sat...Sun...Mon...Tues...Wed...no estimate....hmmmm...I follow up with an email...no response...I follow up with a phone call and again things started off just fine, they say no problem they will figure out what's up and after being on hold and then transferred, they tell me they are on top of it and will give me a call back in a few minutes to let me know what was going on....that was 2 days ago....\n\nFor the life of me, I will never understand why some companies can't seem to understand the importance of communication.  Even if they would have followed up to say \"hey, we screwed up, we lost the estimate, the guy was fired, the guy lost your email, the guy hit his head and got amnesia, something anything, other than nothing...\"   \n\nTime to wrap this up, as I think I have actually spent more time on this review than they did on follow up, but guess that really wouldn't be that hard since the time they spent on follow up with me was actually nonexistent.  Welcome to the one star club guys....
