Went there last night and oh boy they have redeemed themselves. All thanks to Tyler, our wonderful server., I brought a friend there whose is also a chef. He went when Futo was first open. Of course I'm sure at that time, they're trying to work out their kinks.. so he decided to give Futo a 2nd chance and I'm glad he did. \nStep into a place which jammed pack and cozy. We promptly seated. Tyler introduced himself pleasantly.. I mentioned that my friend came here when it was first open and he wasn't impressed. I on the other hand will just order the same old thing like i usually do which is the Miso Hungry (habit for me). Tyler asked my friend if he's willing to trust him., and if he like heat in his ramen. The response. Yea with the heat but it has to be flavorful heat. Not just heat thrown in there! Understandable. His ramen was even listed. Perfect. \nRamen has a chicken dashi broth, spiced ground pork, duck confit and pickled daikon. And he loves it. Tyler made him a fan now. And I'm truly impressed. We will now come back and he will alway ask him for something off the menu from now on!
