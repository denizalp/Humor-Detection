Let me start by saying that I'm used to paying $30-$40 for Brazilian laser hair removal sessions (often with $10 add ons underarms or anus) so when I got back to Canada from Australia and was quoted $170 per session I was like \"wait I'm sorry what the actual duck?\" - and yes I auto corrected on purpose for all your pretty little eyes. Then I found YS on Groupon which works out to around $40 for a medium area session ($200-$220 for the Groupon then tax is paid at the salon). Even without the Groupon, their prices are very reasonable and it's right by Lawrence train station so it's pretty convenient. Yuliya is super sweet and you immediately feel comfortable with her even though she's about to put a machine into your bits and pieces. She includes the anus with the Brazilian which is another bonus...am I allowed to say anus this many times in a review? The salon itself has a boutique feel to it, it's not like something you'd find at a 5 Star hotel or anything but it's comfortable and priced accordingly. I've only had one session but her machines seem good. It hurt a little more than Australia but only while it was happening, there's no pain after.
