Can't comment on whether it is Montreal style, Toronto style or what have you but the place is really cool and the bagels are really tasty.  It may be \"bready\" but it is not heavy and felt really light to eat despite the size.  The staff are nice, and the coffee if you choose to purchase is twenty times better than Tim's.\nI want to go back for sure.
