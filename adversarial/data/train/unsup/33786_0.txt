We needed to rent our home in Las Vegas and had never used an agency before.  We contacted Renters Warehouse and received an immediate response.  Sarah was our rental agent and she was terrific.  Efficient, personable and responsive to everything that we were concerned about. The paperwork was easy to get through and since we live in California, it was especially nice to be able to sigh everything online.\n\nIn less than a week, Sarah had potential tenants for us.  She asked that each tenant write a personal statement so that we could get an idea of what they were like.  She found us tenants that we think will truly love and appreciate our home.  She handled the move-in, made sure to document the condition of the house and did anything she could to make this entire process seamless and painless.  \n\nThe other service they offer is they will manage the property (i.e., collect rent, receive calls regarding any repairs needed, etc.) and the charge for this service is very reasonable.  We feel that our home and our tenants are in very capable hands.\n\nI can't say enough good things about Sarah and Renters Warehouse.  I don't think that we will ever consider using any other agency if we ever have to find another tenant.  They are first class all the way.
