If you are an animal lover, this is well worth the money.\n\nThe dolphin habitat was nice, filled with coral, etc.  And the dolphins don't do shows although one trainer was out when we were leaving and asked him to wave.  They tell you up front, they are conservationists not performers.  You may happen to be there when a trainer appears, but there are no shows.\n\nIt was indeed nice to see the animals frolicking around on their own.\n\nThe cats.  Ahhhh, the cats.  They looked so happy and healthy.  They were really active when we were there.  A small word of warning, the males are un-neutered so they spray - a lot.  This wouldn't have deterred me I didn't see any humans get sprayed.\n\nThe white tigers were amazing, the lions were rolling around on their backs.  The habitats were nice and they don't live there all the time, or so I gathered from talking to someone there.\n\nThen as you're hitting your apex of cuteness with the tigers, there are a herd of alpaca's on the way out.\n\nI was thoroughly impressed with the Secret Garden, which made me feel like I wasn't in Las Vegas for a few minutes.  I was just sad that we went at 5 pm, it was closing time so we only got a half hour but if you go in earlier you can stay as long as you want.
