Enjoyed the beautiful weather sitting on the terrace at the Wynn but our service was horrendous.  \"I'll be right back\" translated into \"I'll be back in 15 minutes\".  Same as \"your order will be right out\" meaning \"I have not even put your order into the kitchen yet.\"  It took 35 minutes to get our food after we ordered it and the food was not that impressive.  My omelette was subpar, the hashbrowns were inedible and the french toast tasted almost burnt.  However, the black angus burger was delicious and after tasting my husband's burger I knew I made a mistake in ordering.  Don't go here if you are in a hurry and sit outside if the weather is nice so that at least the atmosphere will make up for the crappy service and mediocre food.
