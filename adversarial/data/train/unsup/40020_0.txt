Third time back! Ate way too much food and feel sick now, but I honestly think it was worth it! Had the vegetarian Indian tacos (again!) and the crispy buffalo cauliflower to start! Only complaint was that the service was weird... as in our server was nice, but strange. I asked for a glass of wine, she asked to see my I.D., to which I obviously obliged. Then, however, she looked at it for over a minute, looked at me and said \"So... you're underage?\" When I am 19 years old... as it says on my license! Great food - but maybe train staff a little more on checking I.D.s?
