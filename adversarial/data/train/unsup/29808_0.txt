we heard great things about this restaurant...and we had a great experience at the steakhouse at the mirage, so we were pretty excited.  the place was nice and quiet...romantic.  we had some prosecco and the antipasti platter to start.  the meats were good, but the cheeses were not.  we were served 4 cheese and 2 of them were really gross.  i'm pretty open to foods, but they were so stinky and just really foul.  \n\nwe ordered the sea bass and the gnocchi.  the sea bass was good.  my man was happy.  i ordered the gnocchi and what a huge dissappointment.  for an italian restaurant i would expect the gnocchi to be hand made fresh, and these were not.  they were so tasteless and tough, it was really the worst gnocchi i ever had.  will not go here again.
