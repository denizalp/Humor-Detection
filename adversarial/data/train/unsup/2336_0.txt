I've seen some of Great Lakes brews on tap in both Cleveland and western Pennsylvania.  After I visited the West Side Market I got hungry, and realized the brewery was just around the corner, so it seemed like a good place to get some lunch.\n\nI was by myself, and both the hostess and server were gracious and didn't make me feel awkward, which is always a plus.  The patio is great, with a nice fountain and plenty of shade.  My server had really helpful beer recommendations, and steered me toward a great IPA (the Session IPA-- very drinkable).  For food, I ordered the fish and chips.  The fish was one large piece which was a little tricky to eat, but the beer batter was great and the fish was flaky and delicious.  The cole slaw was all right, but the best part was the fries-- they're the thick-cut pub-style and covered in sea salt or parmesan or crack or something, but they were some of the best fries I've ever had.\n\nI didn't go on the tour, although it seemed like a nice space (after living in Colorado I've been on my fair share of brewery tours), but I'd love to try more of the beers sometime when I'm not driving, and I'd definitely consider a repeat visit next time I'm in Cleveland.
