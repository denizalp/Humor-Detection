Ordered food 2 1\/2 half hours ago and it just got here. It's not correct at all. They didn't get anything right. And the food is awful. Does it really take 2 hours to cook eggs and sausage? Uhm no. Food is really cold. Not warm at all. Drinks are wrong and taste so watered down and warm also. This place is just awful. I've tried it so many different times and each time I've been let down. Called and asked for our free drinks that they got incorrect the day before and she said \"we don't deliver to your address\" You've delivered atleast 10 times to this house are you stupid? I'm sorry but this is a horrible business. I don't know why they are still running. Very rude. Then only says I'll do it this one time since we owe you something. Okay, who the hell talks to a customer that way when you're horrible restaurant got the order incorrectly then says no worries tomorrow you guys can get them for free tomorrow.
