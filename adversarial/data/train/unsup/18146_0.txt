Completely ruined my iPhone 5s. Only offers 14day warrantee, replaced my screen and all sorts of problems occurred including speaker malfunctions, phone not vibrating, camera not working, etc. After 3 weeks, the screen started to peel off from the side and was only able to be fixed by installing another screen, which I had to do at another repair shop. Turns out that when the repair man opened up my iphone, this guy that had originally replaced my screen had torn many wires out, broke many parts (explains camera not working, the wire was loose). I have no idea how this guy is in business, do not under any circumstances come to him to repair your phone. This guy will brake your phone more than it already was in the first place.
