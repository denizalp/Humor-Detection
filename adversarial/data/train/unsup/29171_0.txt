Ordered a Croque Madame off the seasonal menu, such a disappointment!  That's a first, but that's how it goes sometimes. This sandwich needs help.  The bread, while nicely toasted, was way to thick for the ingredients.  First Watch has wonderful ham, which could barely be found, or tasted.  The gruyere cheese was all but invisible, and could not be tasted.  The béchamel sauce was so skimpy I was obliged to ask for more, and I am not a sauce person.  The additional béchamel did help a bit.  The best part of this sandwich was 2 perfectly prepared over easy eggs.  Additionally, this sandwich comes with no accompaniment of any sort, no fruit, mixed greens or potatoes, just very thick bread and a jumble of ingredients.  Service, as usual, was good - hence the 2 star rating.
