300 East is a lovely little spot with massive front windows, letting in copious amounts of light into this front-room dining room of an old house. Along the walls are tall wood-backed booths, and a small yet cozily dark bar is set in the middle toward the back. How perfect to sit on a sunny day for brunch!\n\nMy man had his heart set on the French Onion soup, based on his many past visits here when he lived in Charlotte. And it did not disappoint: a thick coverlet of bubbly brown-edged cheese guarded a perfectly flavorful broth and a layer of soaked bread and ribbons of satiny onions. We shared a couple of other dishes: the Fall Salad and the Avocado BLT. The Fall Salad arrives with a pancetta dressing: perfectly salty with a hint of light vinegar and pepper, for drizzling over nice fluffy dollops of goat cheese, port-soaked cherries, pine nuts, and nice spring mix. The BLT was standard issue but with fresh, simple ingredients: huge slices of avocado, crispy bacon, and toasted golden bread.\n\nOh, and mimosas....If you're in a group, do as an observed table did and order your bottle of Prosecco and a pitcher of orange juice to mix as you choose. \n\nAll in all, a good meal: fresh, simple, bright, and a few nice community touches like information about local dog rescues taped up in the entry. Speaking of dogs, let's just say the restroom door gender identifiers involve two wooden St. Bernards: the female is in profile, and so is the male. With additional equipment....Takes a minute to figure it out, and might be a great way to initiate certain conversations with your kids. Or not....\n\nIf I had the option, this would be a three-and-a-half star review (maybe dinner and slightly more intense and creative ingredients would up that to four). If you're looking for fresh, seasonal food in Charlotte and want a slightly upscale yet comfortable atmosphere with a varied and not-too-heavy menu, 300 East is your place to go! And return to, apparently....
