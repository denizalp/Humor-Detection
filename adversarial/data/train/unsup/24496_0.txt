Oh man, this was a great Forever 21. GIGANTIC. Not for the faint of heart, the weak of legs, or the indecisive of choosing. \n\nI really loved this store not just because it was huge, but also because it was well-organized and the employees were super helpful and friendly. I feel like sometimes with the giant Forever 21's, service goes by way of Old Yeller because there's so many more people and just more stress for employees. But they've got a super solid team at this location to be sure. \n\nI came in here a bit down about not being able to buy anything at Topshop (help me I'm poor!). But I instantly perked up when I saw all of the cute choices. They had a GIGANTIC plus size section, which made me happy because apparently  Forever 21 thinks I'm built like the Hulk and my shoulders don't fit into their regular size jackets, no matter how much weight I've lost since college. I got the most adorable sweat\/jacket\/hood thing there, as well as some going out shorts and an adorable wine colored suede tank top. \n\nWill definitely return to this mall on my next Vegas trip. WAY WAY better than  Cesar's Palace mall.
