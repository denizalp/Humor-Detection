A lot has changed at this place in the 18 months since my first visit when I loved this place.  The sexy costumes are GONE,   the PBR on ice is GONE,  the \"A Team\" of cute and entertaining waitresses is gone.  \n\nThe last two times I went there for lunch I was greeted with grenades and boring beers.  Not worth the extra cost and calories anymore.   For what ever reason this place has lost its MOJO.
