I live right around the corner from this place so I make it a point to try to come as much as I can. I absolutely LOVE it here. It's rather small, and it's best to come 1-4 people. It's loud and noisy also. The portions are big and the flavor is even bigger! I recommend the jalapeño cheese bagel with  regular cream cheese or the jalapeño cream cheese. Yummy with a spicy kick. All of their bagels and spreads are homemade too! They also serve breakfast, lunch, & I think dinner.  Their steak & egg breakfast is so yummy. As is their club sandwich. They also have a bakery section where they have all kinds of treats to choose from. Tiramisu, cookies, cakes, brownies, ginormous cinnamon rolls, muffins, pies, and lots of other things.\n\nIt's a very cute mom & pop setting with amazing food, service, and a great atmosphere. Not a good place if you want peace & quiet but it's a good place if you want a good hearty meal!
