This place is great! \n\nThe food is fantastic, good menu selection and everything is always consistently tasty. The Pad See Ew, Pad Kapow, Pla Moo and Masaman Curry are all great choices. The waitstaff is cordial (enough), but if you go for dinner... be prepared to be a little patient, as you may have to wait a bit to get serviced. Although in my opinion, it's a good thing when a restaurant is busy like this. One of my fave spots for Thai!!
