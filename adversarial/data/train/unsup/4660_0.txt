You would think that after all the negative reviews posted the staff would up their game and make nice to the customers. Not the case, and if possible the woman who does the consignment intake is even more sour than the past.  Even the poodle is mean spirited (don't try and pet that cur if you like your fingers). \nI've finally learned my lesson and will stop taking clothing to this store for consignment. I just don't have skin thick enough to bear the scalding comments coming from the intake women about the style or state of my clothes. Keep in mind she is dressed like mardi gras on steroids. \nI must have gone through a masochistic phase to have brought clothing here several times. The process reminded me of the Seinfeld \"soup Nazi\" episode-you stepped up for your turn to have your clothes evaluated and braced yourself for the abuse. Therapy and Ebay have cured my need for this sort of treatment.
