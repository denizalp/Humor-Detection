I worked at a company that was one of the worst, if not THE worst company to work for. Quite in fact, after working there any sane person would gladly work in an Indonesian sweatshop with a smile on his\/her face, thankful for the upgrade and better treatment. It really is no surprise to me, with a company that pitiful, that it chose the WORST insurance provider it could: Aetna.\n\nOne day, I felt really sick and was looking for a specialist on Aetna's online provider list. I called five doctors, each listing with either a disconnected number or a doctor who no longer was with the clinic. I called Aetna in hopes they would have a, you know, UP-TO-DATE LIST! After a marathon trip through the voice recognition system, which ironically doesn't recognize anything you say, I finally spoke with a snarky call center rep, who looked at her list and recited the exact same doctors I just tried to call. I told her I tried, then quite rudely she told me I could go online and look for myself. Uh... that's why I called you! In the end, I had to cold call facilities and luckily, someone referred me to a place.\n\nSome time later, I had to go to the doctor because of a stomach problem that wasn't going away. She thought I could have a food allergy, so she ordered a blood test. Several months later, I got a bill from the lab for over $400. Aetna apparently thought I got an expensive test for shits-and-giggles. I called them, sat through another epic and frustrating voice recognition system session, then filed an appeal. The rep first got annoyed with me for \"waiting until the last minute\" to file an appeal, though the bill didn't come until six months later, but she said I had time and filed it. She assured me I would hear from them within 30 days. Three months later... you guessed it! I still haven't heard from them! \n\nIf you can avoid using this monkey house of insurance companies, do yourself a favor and go with another provider.
