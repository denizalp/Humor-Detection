This business is run my a smooth salesman named Jamie Thorley.  He quoted a job an did not complete it as described in his own writing. This person has NO BUSINESS laying fresh landscape.  I asked for NATURAL DESERT, he laid green slate rock (it is pretty but no choices were given and its nothing you would find in the desert) then tried to get me to lay grass and plant palm trees. The drip system has failed and all most of the plants are dead. He also said he would lay fabric but according to him I'm an idiot because he claims he told me he wasn't laying it all over the yard which I was under the impression he was. \n\nTOTAL FAIL!\n\nUNLISCENSED and UNREGISTERED as well, BEWARE!
