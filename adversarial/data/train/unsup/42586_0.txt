It appears that there is a trend of 1 star reviews. As others have stated, if I could have left a zero, that would surely be a more accurate score. Fortunately for me, I did not purchase the CARS extended service plan; we own a garage and in all efforts to help out our customers, we have worked with this company a few times too many. Unfortunately there comes a time where it is way more work for us than it is worth. The company looks for every single reason to NOT cover a repair. They are not there for the customer. CARS does not cover diagnosis (even if it is a covered repair), they will only pay $70 towards labor, and they use Rock Auto as their parts supplier, which means they will only pay Rock Auto parts prices; and we all know that the prices you get from Rock Auto are less than \"our cost\" from the local suppliers. Needless to say, it is nothing but a hassle for everyone involved. We will no longer do business with this extended service plan. Best of luck to any and all of you that work with this company.
