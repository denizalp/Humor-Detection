My mother sent me a gift certificate for Fern - having read that they serve vegetarian\/ vegan fare... So I took a friend there for lunch and OMG! The sweet little patio is so inviting and the FOOD!!!! We had the Brussels sprouts glazed in maple syrup and I had the vegan Reuben... seems like an oxymoron but it was THE BEST!  My new fav vegan\/vegetarian restaurant in CLT!
