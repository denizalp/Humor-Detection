I purchased a voucher for an oxygen facial. At my appointment, I waited 40 minutes with no apology or polite \"Hello\", just repeated questions about who I was and why I was there. After I filled out a bunch of forms exempting them from any liability and being told how much tax to pay, I was finally led into a treatment room. A terry hair wrap was tied around my face to keep my hair away from my face. The rough velcro closure scraped the skin on my forehead and I said \"ow\".  The woman didn't apologize, just aggressively said it's necessary for the facial to work. She left. Another woman came in. She checked my hair wrap and noticed it was twisted at the back which was why it hurt me. She fixed it and it was fine. An exfoliant was applied to my face. It's supposed to dry and then get rubbed off by hand. I've had a lot of facials and exfoliations in my day but none like this. The rubbing was so fast and hard it hurt and I could feel my skin being stretched in all directions. I complained that it was uncomfortable and please stop. The woman snapped that the facial won't work without this step. I said \"this can't be good for the skin\" and she barked \"I am the aesthetician! Don't you think I know what I'm doing?!\" I was upset at this point and insisted that the step be skipped. After she left, the other girl comforted me: \"She's the boss so I can't say anything\". She put a clear plastic dome over my face with a small hole and tube for the oxygen mist to enter. The entire edge of the dome was jagged, like it had been cut by a child with bad scissors. It didn't fit properly and wasn't very secure. It fell off during the treatment and I re-positioned it, vowing never to return. They claim that oxygen facials are popular with Hollywood stars. I doubt any Hollywood actresses are getting treatments like these. I've seen better deals at better places so I cannot recommend this place, unfortunately.
