I was treated to lunch here as an early birthday lunch from a friend in February. We were excited to come here because we had been to the Tucson location a few years back and loved it. \n\nWell I was very disappointed. \nThe wait times for the restaurant during lunch seemed unacceptable to me. There were tables open while we were waiting. That usually means the restaurant was not properly staffed, which translates into poor management. \nThe food needs a lot of work. The burgers were so \"juicy\", and not in a good way, the bottom roll was soaked to the point where picking up the burger was impossible and the nice flavor I remember from the Tucson location was nowhere to be found. The food also came out to lukewarm. Maybe sat in the window far too long? \nBest thing were the zucchini fries, we loved those.\nThe restaurant has a very nice appearance and they did a great job decorating , I hope they can fix the other issues soon.
