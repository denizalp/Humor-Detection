Zero Degrees has opened up in Vegas right before we hit our sizzling summer season- perfect timing! I came in for their soft opening and then again during grand opening weekend BOGO specials. They've been promoting their opening all over social media so it has been predictably busy.\n\nDRINKS:\nThe Spicy Watermelon is my favorite so far, less sweet than their much-hyped Mangonada, both available with add-on mango twist and tamarind straw. They also do milk teas (like sea salt green tea) and fusion drinks (like their strawberry horchata) in a few different variations, with regular boba and crystal boba available as add-ons. I also really liked their Ube Shake, which isn't especially sweet but still definitely a dessert and decorated to look like a unicorn with a toasted marshmallow and candy belt. Their major marketing hack is that their drinks are so photogenic, they barely have to promote themselves because social media does it for 'em. I was pleased to find the drinks were tasty as well!\n\nFOOD: \nLike most tea shops, there are a few snacks on the menu here, from the classic popcorn chicken and fries to a few different dishes of elote and chicharrones. The chicken was better quality than what I'm used to at this sort of spot (opt for the bbq flavor). I also tried the hot Cheetos elote, and despite not being much of a fan of hot Cheetos, this crispy, flavor-packed version was addictive and I ate way more than I planned. \n\nThere's a special place in hell reserved for those leaving a new business 1-star reviews for typical opening kinks. Service was polite but given that they were busy for opening weekend (expected), orders were a bit slow to come out but wait times were not unreasonable. Things will likely get quicker as the staff get more familiar and the hype dies down a bit. I'll be back to get my sip on this summer!
