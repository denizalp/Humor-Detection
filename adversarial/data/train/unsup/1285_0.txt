Patronized this restaurant on 07\/31\/2017.\n\nVery quiet at lunch time - only 3 tables.  But Chinese customers were loud - their chit chat sounded like yelling across the Grand Canyon.\n\nTypical old style interior decorations.  Menu is thick and full of colorful pictures but the food we ordered is TOTALLY DISAPPOINTMENT!!!\n\n1.  Wine chicken is blend;  it tastes like wine was put in after you ordered.\n\n2.  Shanghai style smoked fish is horrible.  It is simply roasted to char.  100% not authentic Shanghai style smoked fish; and 100% different look than on the menu.\n\n3.  Stir fry Shanghai noodles is blend and oily;  no stir fry taste at all.  It seems like they just mix the noodles, veggies and meat together.\n\n4.  Eel in the noodles soup is absolutely tasteless!\n\n5.  Shanghai pork buns is the only dish that is a little bit below par.  The rest of the dishes are way below par.\n\n6.  Service is courteous & friendly but the major thing is food, restaurant owner!!!
