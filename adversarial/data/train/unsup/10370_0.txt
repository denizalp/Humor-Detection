A great assortment of artifacts and memorabilia ruined by an owner who couldn't care less.  \n\nThe small museum is home to amazing and interesting items but comes off as incredibly insulting to anyone of the wiccan faith mostly because the space is also decorated with cheap hacky Halloween decorations.  Notice in one of the pictures I posted the glass display case of artifacts that also houses a Lisa Simpson figure and Troll doll in Halloween witch outfits.  Be sure not to miss the dollar store witch mask!\n\nThe worst and most insulting is the owner himself.  At some point during the \"tour\"  (the most exciting part was that once the owner drove down a dead end road and emailed someone at a hotmail account!)  the owner told us that \"This stuff is cool but I'm not really superstitious.  I mean, most wiccans I've met can't really keep it together, y'know?\"   My wife and I left immediately after such a flippant insult.\n\nIn the end this is a great selection of artifacts wasted by a rude and insulting person just trying to make a quick buck.
