We just had a good happy hour experience.  We dined here just after opening and were not impressed. Years later we decided to return. It was a good thing. Since it was happy hour, my wife and I took advantage of the $5 menu. The flatbread was not very good but the lettuce wraps, calimari and potstickers definitely we're worth the order. Unfortunately, we ordered too much. These are generous portions.  I took the easy route and had wine.  My wife had water.  This is a good deal. I think we need to come back for the regular menu: prices seem reasonable and there are several interesting choices.
