Now that we have bought out the lease less than 6 months after dealing with Right Toyota, we can not get a refund for our gap insurance that we bought through them. \n\nWe are being told from Right that we have to go through the bank, and the bank is telling us we have to go through Right Toyota. \n\nThis is a big mess. Dont buy from them.
