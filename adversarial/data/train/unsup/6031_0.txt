I don't think I've ever been to a Claim Jumper, aka \"CJ\". We don't have any in Hawaii.  It seems to be a chain restaurant.  This one is located inside of the Golden Nugget Hotel and Casino. It's open 24\/7. \n\nThe interior is dim with muted, earthy tones. The music is soft rock\/pop. It seemed clean and well maintained. \n\nWe had to order breakfast only because we arrived before 11am. I ordered the Full House: eggs, choice of meat, pancakes, and hash browns. My \"crispy bacon\" came out as good as it could since it was a thicker cut.  The hash browns were seasoned well - crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. The pancakes were filling and fluffy. The eggs were fine. \n\nService was quite good,  especially since we had a large group of 8. We had to ask for a few minor things,  but overall, the staff had teamwork! \n\nI'd go back again for the convenient location and hours of operation. Maybe I'd go back and try dinner or lunch!
