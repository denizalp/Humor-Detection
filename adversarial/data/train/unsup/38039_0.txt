I have been here quite a few times for happy hour. This place at first glance is very much a dive pub. Small TVs that need to be badly upgraded take up most of the wall space. The reason for this which you will figure out real quick once inside is that Armadillo Grill is an offsite track betting place as well. \n\n75% of the TVs (during non-sporting events) will be focused on races across the country and you can go place a bet with a bookie up front as if you were at the track. Kinda cool...but betting on horses is not really my thing. \n\nDrinks here are your typical bar drinks with a limited selection on happy hour but enough to find something. The Happy hour menu (munchies) has quite a few things on there which are good however the reason to come here are the \"Golden Delicious\" wings. These are what put this place on my radar....those wings are VERY good that it is hard to order anything else anytime I come here. \n\nAs far as non-happy hour....they have your typical pub cold and hot sandwiches like buffalo chicken sandwich and Philly cheesesteak. Nothing is too expensive, but the happy hour is where this place shines. \n\n\nGive this place a shot if you are ever in the Biltmore area.
