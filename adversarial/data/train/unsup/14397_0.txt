RT O'Sullivan's was decent, but forgettable.  I can't even remember what I ate there.  I do remember that the service was decent, but I DID have to wait a little too long for my beer and food.  I didn't have much time before my class started so I was getting a bit anxious.  Overall, it was okay.  I probably wouldn't go back there again.  I only went there the one time because of the hype it receives.\n\nMeh, Hype is over-rated...
