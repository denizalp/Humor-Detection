The food is delicious. My only complaint is that they've hired an elderly homeless man that harasses customers as soon as they park. He claims to work the lot yet has no uniform, and knocks on your window demanding to know what business you have. The manager was polite about the issue, and his intentions are good. However, using a belligerent homeless man to harass and scare off customers is bad business. Plenty of other restaurants nearby.
