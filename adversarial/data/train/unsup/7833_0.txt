I visit Pittsburgh frequently and had been looking forward to trying out this place after having read the reviews.\nWow... The guy really knows his trade. The food is on par if not better than the majority of well known\/respected vietnamese places in Los Angeles. \nBTW, the owner is hilarious. Someone mentioned in another review he was a mind reader... I totally get it. Lol.\nSince it was our first time there, we had no clue on what to get, we were stumbling over ourselves when the owner comes over and says \"YOU. Get this.\" And points at the menu. \"You will like with your wine\" holy smokes was he right :) loved the food!\nBtw. Did I mention BYOB??? No corkage fee either. Score.\n\nOne and only thing to keep in mind is the establishment is CASH ONLY.
