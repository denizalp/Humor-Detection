Love love love location on this place. After reading all the reviews I was actually worried\n\nValet needs work. White gentleman was rude\nFelt extremely welcomed and love that every time I called they mentioned me by last name and party.\nLove that they have happy hour\n\nCalled to see if we could have two joint rooms with two queens no go. But Blake accommodated us best he could. Even sent us a special gift for the birthday girl\n\nBedrooms and bathrooms were clean. Nothing to boast about other than comfy bed that I didn't get to utilize -_- curse those clubs hehe.\n\nRequested 2 additional cots, 1 per room which they were kind enough to roll in\n\nWhenever I needed something and they weren't sure they'd double check.\nRazors? Yes\nBandages? Yes. Though they're hulk purple lol.\n\nStaff here was very professional and courteous. \n\nLove that they give option to wave a cleaning fee. $5 credit towards membership or to restaurants. I have to check if they gave me the credit though.\n\nWonderful experience,  would do it again for a Vegas trip. Price is just right.\n\nIf I want to go all out this isn't the place though. \n\nBut if you're on a budget and don't care about sleeping on the strip this is it.
