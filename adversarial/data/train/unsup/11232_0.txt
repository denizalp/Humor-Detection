Secret?\n\nWell it's not so secret anymore if MC knows about it!!!\n\nLuckily there was no line when we arrived. I ended up ordering a White Pizza slice and a Combo slice. Both totaled $11. Damn, $11 for 1 slices of pizza?! This place better be worth it!\n\nThe white slice just had too much ricotta cheese for me - as in piles. The crust was thin and was super crunchy, which I enjoyed very much!\n\nThe combo was good although my crust was already soggy. BOO! \n\nThe slices were filling, but you may just wait to share a pie with someone else. There are only a handful of chairs, a couple of video games and a couple of standing tables. You can bring your slices out to the lobby area to eat, as many people did. \n\nDon't forget to check out the pics along the walls! Interesting!!!
