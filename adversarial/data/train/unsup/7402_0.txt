I didn't believe in God until he put a Barro's Pizza near my home.  In fact I thought he was in with the Devil just to torture me with the crappy pizza we have!  So now I pray every night and thank my lucky stars that I can have Barro's pizza delivered to my home at any given time....so I have to support them as much as possible.  That wont be hard since the pizza is so good and such a good value, you can stop in for the lunch specials which I normally pick up either 2 slices and a drink for $4 or a slice, drink, & salad bar for $4.25!  Ar you kidding?  Such a good price for such good food, I dare you to go across the way to 1 Brothers Pizza....you too will be thanking the Barro Pizza Gods!
