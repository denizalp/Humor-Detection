I went back to see if my experience would be different. Yes, I'm a sucker for giving a place the benefit of the doubt. This time I ordered the 2nd smallest size, I think it's 1\/2 lb, of ahi limu. I also ordered a spicy mayo ahi bowl for my husband.\n\nNo doubt, the Poké here taste fresh. The cut are a little too chunky for my liking, possibly why I only got a few pieces last time. But since I did get a bigger size this time, of course there were more lol. \n\nAnyway, I wasn't going to update this review, but since I said I would just go to Island Sushi for my Poké in my last review..... Uh.... I had island sushi Poké today and it was so fishy to me. I've had it before and it was always hit or miss. After having the fresher tasting Poké here at Hawaiian, I take back what I said in my last review lol.
