So I came here during my lunch and is usually my spot once or twice a week. I know for a fact that other Subways provide you a receipt that has a survey and if you complete the survey you get a code that will give you a free cookie. This location in particular would avoid giving you a receipt so they can avoid others trying to claim their cookies. I one day went to another location and asked if they have a receipt policy and they said it is a franchise policy that the receipt must be provided or at least offered. So I thought this was a one-off situation and maybe they forgot to give me a receipt so I tried another day and then another day... no luck on the receipt. One day I asked for the receipt and they said they don't give receipts. The only receipt they will give is the debit\/credit card receipt which is not the purchase receipt. \n\nSo what did i do? I contacted head office about this in hopes that they will get down to the bottom of this. It's only a cookie.. i get that but it's the rudeness and attempt to con the franchise\/customers that gets to me. \"C is for cookie\"... not \"Con\".\n\nOther then this issue, the restaurant is clean, service is quick and seating is comfortable. Plaza location is small and is located in a deserted location. No people = no line. That's how I see it.\n\nOne thing i did like about this location is they were the only location that held onto the Creamy Sriracha sauce longer then it needed to. I was disappointed when the other locations took it away.
