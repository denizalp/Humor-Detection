Zio has been on my Bookmarks for a while now, and all I can say is I hate that I didn't get there earlier. We arrived for an early dinner, around 6:30, and got one of the last tables on the outside patio. Upon being seated we were greeted by our waiter, who was very friendly, and offered water and fresh bread, made at Nova's bakery. As we checked out the menu we observed a women working in their outside garden, where they grow herbs and vegetables, now that is fresh!\n\nWe started with the arugula salad, which was light and extremely fresh with arugula, asparagus and candied almonds. And, after seeing the other Yelp photos we decided to check out the classic cheese pie and a side of meatballs. The pizza, or pie as they call it, was amazing! The dough was cooked to perfection, with a light and fluffy crust, topped with just the right amount of cheese and herbs. As for the meatballs, OMG, they reminded me of my Italian grandmother's, served it a great marinara sauce. \nThe service was great, and although the restaurant is definitely old school it is a hidden gem with amazing Italian traditions. Cannot wait to get back and check out some of the entrees!
