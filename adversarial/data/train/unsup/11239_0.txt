OK, being new to Phoenix, used Yelp, when colleagues and clients had no good IM Docs  for me to start with.  I have to say that this Doc did literally the exact opposite of the prior [happy] review.  I thought he might have had an off day on my 1st visit, but 2nd and 3rd only got far worse, which were spread out over 6 months.\n\nHe is the first doctor in my 25+ years who seems to genuinely **not care** about me getting better and helping me become a better patient.\n\nHaving been married to an ER doc and being involved with docs for many years, from social circles, this is not a stellar patient advocate, nor educator, either.\n\nAll attempts to ask questions resulted in one word replies and generally rushed out of the office.  \n\nTake a look at my other reviews, it is the first 1-star -- ever.\nUnfortunately, it seems the bar is pretty low here in Phoenix, as compared to Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, and Detroit.
