Ugh I absolutely LOVE this place. I live fairly close to markville mall and this is my hands down go to cafe in the area. Their staff is welcoming, their drinks are always made to perfection (my favorite is the cappuccino) and their breakfast options are great ! I don't have to think twice about ever coming here - to catch up with a friend, for brunch, or even to read. Best cafe in the neighborhood.
