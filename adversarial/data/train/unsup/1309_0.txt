This place is located inside the Orleans casino.  Its part of their food court. Small compared to the normal Fuddruckers layout but the food is still the same.  The quality varies based on crew working at the time.  Burgers are their specialty and they make a good sandwich. Hungry? You can have a quarter, half or three quarter pound burger.  That's a lot of beef.  Cooked to order.  At Fuddruckers you add your own lettuce, tomatoes, onions and other toppings.  That area is with all the goodies is really small here.  Downside is their expensive menu. Burger, fries and shake will set you back a pretty penny.  Seating is limited but when its crowded you can always go sit down in front of the pizza, ice cream or sandwich shop.\n\nThe burgers are tasty.  The shakes are delicious.  And the fries are fat.
