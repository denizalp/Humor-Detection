First off, quite pricey for what you get. The fries were not good and the pickle was wilted. As for the sandwich, I had a mushroom sandwich, but I don't remember the name. The juices soaked the bread, making the sandwich fall apart. It was fine, but nothing that much better than you average bar food. Overall, I was quite unimpressed.
