Beer Bar with 99 beers on tap!  I'm so there.\n\nThis hotel is really beautiful.  I was very impressed.  The architecture alone is very impressive, but the overall design of the place is like WOW and I swear, all the girl cocktail waitresses have GINORMOUS boobs. Nice.\n\nI didn't stay here, but spent quite a while gambling and hitting up that beer bar.  I can't wait to come back.  This hotel blows green valley ranch out of the water (local competition).\n\nOnly downside... no club.  NO CLUB?! What The Hell?!
