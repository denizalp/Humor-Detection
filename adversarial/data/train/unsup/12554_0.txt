OMG!!! When is the LA\/Sawtelle location going to open!?!?!?!?! I can't just conveniently drive to Las Vegas whenever I'm craving The Miyagi every week. \nYou guys are my top 3 for burgers. \n\nFor Asian foodies or foodies that like Asian food and\/or burgers, then Bachi is a must try!! The hype doesn't die down here. Everything is good, every burger is a different flavor profile, and you can even create your own burger!\n\nThe Miyagi is my favorite. I love fried egg anything, furikake has amazing sweet & salty flavors, and the crunchy texture from the onion rings makes it a winner every single time! Plus the wagyu beef patty. ooooooooooomahgaaaaaaaawd!!!! drooling & FEIGNING FOR IT RIGHT NOW! Paired with truffle fries, or ox tail fries, or plain fries...perfectly crispy every time. I'm hungry.
