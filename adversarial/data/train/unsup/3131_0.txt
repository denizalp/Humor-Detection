Chatime is a Taiwanese teahouse chain that is found all over the world.  The menu has a variety of fruit teas, milk teas, mousses, juices, smoothies, freshly-brewed teas, and coffee beverages.  There are also a variety of toppings, such as bubbles, jellies, etc.  I am absolutely in love with their Banana Milk Tea - it was the perfect amount of milkiness with a lovely taste of bananas - if you're a fan of those Korean banana drinks, you'll love this even more!  I just requested mine naked (without any toppings), with little ice, and 30% sweetness - it was a perfect amount of sweetness from the bananas while still tasting the freshly-brewed tea.  The hubs had the Passion Fruit Green Tea, and this was also pretty refreshing and tasty.  The employee in there was friendly and drinks were made efficiently, but with care.  The place has some tables in the back as well as one in the front and free wi-fi, so you can do some work, study, or just relax a bit before you go on your way.  Love this place!\n\n+Banana Milk Tea :D :D :D\n+freshly-brewed tea beverages\n+free wi-fi
