You can not trust this company.  They suck!!\n\nI purchased a vehicle on Ebay based, in part, upon a written quote from DAS.  They were the low bid.  After the auction was complete, I called them to book the move and they refused to move it for anything near the original quote.\n\nOriginal quote: $726.  First time I called to book: refused for less than $1400.  Second time I attempted to book on same quote: refused for less than $1600.\n\nThis company has pathetic customer service.  They are surly as a pirate without having the charm of a parrot or a peg leg.  Their idea of customer service is to give you the run around until you give up because it isn't worth the energy.\n\nIf you have any other options (including giving a heroin addict $50 to move your vehicle), you should probably pursue those options before you give DAS a try.  \n\nDid I mention that They suck!!
