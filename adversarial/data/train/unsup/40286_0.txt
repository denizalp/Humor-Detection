Servers were nice but very disorganized and confused. Order took an extremely long time to come out. We went for the fun milkshakes with a slice of cake. They looked nowhere near as pretty as the photos. The milkshake itself was awful and the cake was dense and dry. All for $16 per shake. We will never go back.
