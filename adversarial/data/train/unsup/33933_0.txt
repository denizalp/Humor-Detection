Such a late review! BUT I stopped by this Louboutin store after stopping by the one in Caesars Palace ( they had terrible! customer service). \n\nAs soon as I walked in to this store I was greeted and asked if I needed help. I knew which pair I wanted already but they didn't have my size =\/. I wish I remembered my sales womans name she was a sweetheart she helped me decided my next choice and ended up walking out with my first pair of Christian Louboutins! it was a great way to end my experience in Vegas.\n\nI'll be coming back again to this one for my next pair!
