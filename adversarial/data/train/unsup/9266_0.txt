I've been here a few times in the past but last night was the worst..If it wasn't for their tea selection I wouldn't have gone but here's a review:                                  Very large selection of tea although wait staff is very rude, the waitress messed up my order (barley tea) 3 times and made me pay for the teas that were brought to my table when I clearly didn't order them. I waited close to 45 mins to get what I ordered. They seriously need to reevaluate their wait staff and the girl making the tea behind the counter has a nasty attitude. Just because I don't look Chinese you think you can swear at me lol I understood everything you said. Your establishment is a joke and I hope dirty dining shuts your doors for good!
