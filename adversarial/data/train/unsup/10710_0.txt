Comparing this to the other two Babystacks...it weighs a little less on the quality side.\n\nI know it's hard for chains to be so consistent, but other chains do succeed...\n\nThe main things are - \nThe food seems to be a bit overcooked. If you look through a lot of the pictures, especially the pancakes, a lot of them are cooked or even burnt. \nWhat boggles my mind is - why would the cook even serve them? Then, why would the waiter think those are okay to serve? Shesh...it's so bizarre to me. \nWe ordered the carrot cake pancakes and they were overcooked, but still edible. Yes, we ate them. I will praise them on one thing, the cheesecake icing is delightful.\n\nOn top of that, we had the Mexican Skillet and the Spinach Benedict. \n\nBoth were okay. Biggest thing for both of us were both dishes were very soggy. Everything, from the potatoes to the english muffin. It makes it to where the dish is not very enjoyable. I don't know if they were just sitting in the window for awhile or what. \n\nThe service was good - we went in past 12, so it wasn't very busy. Easy to get a seat and the server was pretty attentive. \n\nTo round it up - you have a lot of options to choose for brunch or breakfast in the Centennial area. If you're feeling a little risky, do try.
