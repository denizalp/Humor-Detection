I was here two months ago. I can't remember the name of the male that was \"helping\" me, but I am not ratting anyone out just yet. \n\nI was in just browsing around; looking to find more information about the car company and to actually have a look of the interior and exterior. \n\nI am not familiar with the brand so I hardly know anything about Honda's than my knowledge towards other automobile companies. \n\nHe was so rude about everything. Was it because he didn't make the sale? Or persuade me enough? He would roll his eyes, and talk over me while I would be asking a question or making a comment. He almost sounded like he was raising his voice, but then again it could've just been the way he talks. RUDE.\n\nBuying or leasing a car obviously does not take the first twenty minute visit to the dealership, but it takes a lot of thinking to do. He was just in a hurry to get rid of me as if there were other people around to help. Which there wasn't. \n\nHe was useless. Other workers weren't really helpful either. \n\nEither the sales person woke up on the wrong side of his bed or he just has poor customer service skills like everyone else employed at that location.
