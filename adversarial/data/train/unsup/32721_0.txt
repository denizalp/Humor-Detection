Pros:\n* Fast, friendly service\n* Good eats\n* Not too far from home\n* Dinner, with leftovers, for a family of 4 for a reasonable price\n\nCons: \n* They're a bit hidden in a strip mall. Just look for the Sinclair gas station on the corner and turn in there. It'll be obvious once you're in the lot.\n\nDetails on food:\nAkropolis fries - hot and crunchy w\/lots of feta\nTraditional Greek salad - fresh and crisp and generously portioned\nGreek salad with chicken - same as the Greek salad with the addition of nicely seasoned chicken\nChicken gyro - hubby said it was very good\nSpanikopita - flaky on the outside, hot and flavorful inside - my daughter is not a veggie person and she ate an entire triangle\nRice pudding - cool and slightly sweet with a dash of cinnamon on top\n\nWe live in the general area, so we will definitely be back
