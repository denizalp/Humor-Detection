This place is a ZERO star place.  Stay away.\n\nIf you like butter and cream sauce to saturate everything on your plate than this is your place.  I ordered the crispy Parmesan Chicken and expected something along the line of the crispy chicken Parmesan tradition.  Instead I got two really fatty soggy chicken breasts soaked beyond belief in a thick untasty cream sauce.  Both my dining associate and myself got salads and mine was decent size but he got the junior edition with maybe 4 bits of leaf in it.  It was laughable. \n\nI spent the next hour on the toilet.\n\nThis place was terrible beyond belief, and very expensive as well.\n\nI took my son here who ordered a very expensive dinner of trout, shrimp and lobster.  When they served it his plate had a small filet of trout on it.  I asked the waitress where were the shrimp and lobster.  She said the filet was stuffed with them.  That's not what the menu said.  The menu said it had Trout, Shrimp and Lobster and gave it a $18 price.  So to get a small piece of fish and no shrimp, no lobster was a bit of a lie.\n\nI will never go to Longhorn again and tell everyone to stay away.
