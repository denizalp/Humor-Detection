I was excited to try this place based on all the positive reviews.  I thought this Mexican seafood restaurant would bring me back to my favorite seafood restaurant in Playa del Carmen.  Unfortunately, this is just bad seafood, not matter the type.\n\nI ordered the seafood ceviche and it was not fresh at all. Several of the seafood items  were soft from spoilage (as opposed to tender) and smelled fishy.  I decided to stop after a few bites because I didn't want risk getting sick since I was about to get on a plane.  I may have been fine finishing the dish but I didn't see the need to play seafood roulette.
