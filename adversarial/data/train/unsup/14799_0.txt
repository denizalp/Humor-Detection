Initially I was not satisfied at all with the way Data Doctors had handled my situation.  My computer had a serious virus, and after dealing with Data Doctors, I threw in the towel and ended up just buying a new computer. In fact, I was unhappy enough to write a fairly negative review here on Yelp, giving them 1 star.   Fast forward 9 months and I get an email though Yelp from the Director of Operations at Data Doctors.  Seeing my negative review, he apologized and wanted to make the situation right.  Although I already had a new computer, I was interested in donating my old computer to charity, but still needed the viruses removed and the computer reformatted to remove all my personal information.  He made arrangements to have that taken care of at no cost to me, which I really appreciate.  Although it started out as a bad situation, in the long run I am glad to see that they take customer satisfaction seriously.
