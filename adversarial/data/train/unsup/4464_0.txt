This show was fantastic! I went with a group of 21 year old's with mostly couples, and although we were the youngest group there, it was an awesome experience for all of us! These girls were hot, sexy, professional, and just WOW!\n\nThe dance performances were on point. Jennifer Romas is amazing, but all of the other girls are just as incredible. We want to give a shout out to Bri and Amelia who we thought were smokin hot. \n\nMy group had VIP seats that we thought were well worth it. Lastly, this was a fun first Burlesque experience that I'd highly suggest anyone to see!
