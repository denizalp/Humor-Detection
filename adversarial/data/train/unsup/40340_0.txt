I've been a patient here for years and was a patient at their old office too.  This is the best dentist I've ever had, my insurance changed earlier this year and my copays increased but I couldn't fathom the idea of changing dentists.\n\nToday was a great example of why I will continue to recommend and be a patient at this office.  I broke an old filling while on vacation last week. I called and Terry fit me right in on the schedule. I arrived on time for my appointment and they promptly called me back. I am 6 months pregnant and getting dental work is a scary thought. They were entirely prepared and up to date on my chart, I was given also extra protection during x-ray and they explained risk associated with pregnancy and dental work.\n\nStart to finish, forty minutes and two fillings later I was on my way home. I felt no pain or discomfort in the initial exam, novocaine injection, or drilling\/filling.  Five hours later I am still pain free. Dr. McAdams and his awesome staff makes visiting the dentist a joy, I could fall asleep in his dental chair. My troublesome tooth feels great and my bite is perfect. I had no wait or delay in treatment and no pain at all. Not sure what would make a dental experience any better.
