I enjoyed living here.  The location is great and it has a younger vibe than where I currently live. I did find that upon move out, they charged me quite a lot for \"damages.\"  It wasn't my fault that the carpet didn't stay adhered to the tacks!  Also holes in the wall from nails for hanging pictures should NOT have been charged as a repair.  However, I will say they did provide a receipt showing that they actually did replace\/repair what needed to be repaired.  My current apartment did not do that.
