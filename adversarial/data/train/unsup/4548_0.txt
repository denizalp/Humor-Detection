Had lunch here with the fam on a Friday and it was really slow but they seem to do a killer takeout business.  Server was awesome and place is cool looking.  3 stars because Big Red and I spent 60....yes SITXY dollars on 2 tiny pizzas, 2 beers and some random cocktail thing.  The pizzas were no bigger than a Tottinos.  They were on cauliflower crust and good but at 15.00 a piece I say F that.  For 12.00 I could get 2 frozen pizzas and a sixer of Zima and have my own party...
