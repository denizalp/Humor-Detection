The food here is absolutely delicious. The flavors are just outstanding. I've been here only twice (I don't know why...I need to come more often) but both times the service was great and the food out of this world. My favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh (yes better than Meat & Potatoes). Highly recommend. Prices aren't cheap but it's totally worth it.
