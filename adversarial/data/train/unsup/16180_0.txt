First off I want to say that there are a few good trainers here (Eddy & Liz). I've been a member since the place opened and have probably brought or recommended 15-20 people there some of witch are now members. I have been paying 49.99 per month since joining and was told that rate was locked in by Martin the so called owner. Today after checking my bank statement i discover that im now being charged 69.99 per month. After calling to see why this occurred the girl stated its posted in the studio so you should have been aware! Now why I understand that rates do change from time to time this almost always applies to new members that join up not existing members who like myself are directly responsible for the parking lot being full and creating a buzz about the gym in the first place. I think this was a very shady thing to do and I'm not at all happy about it. Its the principal not the money that aggravates me so I decided to cancel my membership but was told i would be overcharged not only this month but also next month as the rude lady told me was customary for you month to month people. Someone needs to explain to Martin and his entourage of Yogies that when you kill the roots the tree will surely die. One thing about las vegas is there's plenty of gyms in town and ill be seeking my entertainment elsewhere so trufusion can Namaste to my backside!
