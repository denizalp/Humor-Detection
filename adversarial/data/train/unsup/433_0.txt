Old school downtown bar.  Dark wood, green lampshades.  Reminds me of what the world looked like when I was growing up in the '70s and early '80s. Good R+B jukebox, good corned beef sandwiches (corned beef seems to be really big in Cleveland).  White-run bar with a black clientele.\nDownsides?  My buddy was shocked that an old-school bartender would serve a Jack and Coke in a rocks glass. While we drank a lot of great brews in Cleveland (including those we had at Great Lakes Brewery), he complained that he never got a properly mixed drink in the whole town.  Also, I imagine this place may get a little crazier later at night, what with a lot of people going back and forth to the street and a notice, unenforced in the earlier portion of the evening, that the bathrooms were locked and you had to be buzzed in by the bartender.
