Clean place. Friendly staff! As rookies of a kabob place we each got a wrap with a side salad. My hubs got a Chicken wrap and gave it two thumbs up!  I got the Filet wrap which I would also give two thumbs up for. They have a great selection and a menu with weekday specials that we can not wait to return to try!
