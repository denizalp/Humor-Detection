Visiting from Cali where there is a sushi place on every corner with all the good reviews was eager to try this place. There was nobody at this place. Paid $9 for an awful California roll and some edamame . I ate ONE piece and couldn't bring myself to eat another. Good thing I ordered edamame otherwise it would've been a complete waste. Never coming back.
