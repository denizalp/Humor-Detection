I was born in Russia while communism was in full effect.  We were fortunate enough to escape as refugees to the US.  \nThe Restaurant Depot is run just like the communist grocery stores back in the old country.  It's dirty, the lines are long, and you feel like you owe them for the  privilege of shopping there.  Mike, a disgruntled employee in the fish department, is the absolute worst.  Not only is he rude, he's shady as hell.  You can ask him for a certain weight of something, and every single time he will go heavy.  \nI hope the Russians call it quits here in the states and bring their store back home.
