Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the Disneyland of gelato and pastries - literally! I was so impressed when I walked into this cute little patisserie. The gelatos are definitely eye-catching and picture-worthy, as they are draped with toppings in a very presentable way. The pastries are all packed with color and look beautifully placed side-by-side each other. If I didn't have to board the airplane that day and actually lived in Las Vegas, I would have totally bought a bunch of these little cuties. They also make your standard coffee drinks here. \n\nHowever, the crepes have DEFINITELY won my heart here at Jean Philippe Patisserie. My friend ordered a Chocolate Souffle crepe. Basically, they poured the fresh crepe batter on to the sizzling stovetop, moved it to a clear plastic plate, and added custard to the insides of the crepe. Then, they drizzled it in chocolate syrup, chopped brownies, and powdered sugar. Um, YUM! One bite of this crepe and I was addicted! I never had custard inside of my crepe before, and that was what definitely stuck out to me about this crepe! The portion size is definitely shareable, unless you love your sweets all to yourself, heh.\n\nI also ordered a Iced Caramel Latte here, which tasted like your average drink. However, I would highly recommend ordering the crepes here at Jean Philippe Patisserie! I cannot wait to be back!
