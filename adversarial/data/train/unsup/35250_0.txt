In a town where there is a boba tea shop on practically every corner, well at least on the west side of town that's true, a place has to be outstanding to justify driving the extra distance to go there. Luckily this place is worth the extra effort in getting there. The quality and selection of beverages is fantastic. They also serve ramen and snacks. I had the Volcano Ramen, which was very tasty and well presented. The service was friendly and quick. I only see a few negatives. Located on Jones and Spring Mountain, it's not in the most trendy part of Chinatown, but that does contribute to the many parking spaces that are available. The decor is on the plain side, but the low prices make up for it. My large taro smoothy, about 20 ounces, cost $3.15 plus tax. If you're in the mood for more than a snack, I recommend going to eat at one of the many restaurants in the immediate area then come here for dessert. If boba teas are not your idea of dessert, then have one of the shaved ice or snow (fluffy) ice desserts.\n\nBTW, there is a $5 minimum credit card purchase amount.
