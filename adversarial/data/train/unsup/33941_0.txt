Unbelievable the customer service I received from Dana. She was not helpful and was not willing to call and verify my upgrade. Mind you I was in my rental car about to leave the lot and showing her my license. She made me reverse and go back to the desk to verify my upgrade. Zero customer service skills. As an Avis Preferred member this was just so ridiculous, the agent upgraded me and did not communicate this to the other agent checking out customers at the window. I had to make an illegal reverse when other cars were behind me and Dana didn't help or even step out of her little box. When I went inside Maurice admitted to the the mistake and apologized. He printed and me a new rental agreement and changed it so I could bring it back with an empty tank. How simple would it have been for Dana to make a phone call and verify with someone instead of having me go all the way back inside. If they upgrade you complimentary make sure this is communicated to others as well.
