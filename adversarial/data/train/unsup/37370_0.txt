Five stars for excellent service and client service. I spoke with Jeff back in November to set up a table for New Years Eve at Club HAZE in Aria since LMFAO was performing there. I asked him 100's of questions and he was honest and was never impatient with all the questions I was asking. I even sent e-mails to other individual host and it took them a few weeks before they even got back to me. It took Red Carpet VIP probably 24 hrs or so to get back to me. Even the host at the clubs took a while or didn't' get back to me when I was asking questions. I'll be using them again when I return to get bottle service at any club or to avoid the lines and get in.
