Calling this place Secret Pizza is right on the money. I would not have found this place without my friends.\n\nThe $5 pepperoni slice sure hit the spot after a night of Bacardi 151, Everclear and Maker's Mark.\n\nThe ingredients were simple but something about them made this place stand above most other pizza places I've been to. Gooey cheese, giant pepperoni slices, robust tomato sauce and crunchy hand-tossed crust. The crust was crunchy on the outside and just slightly chewy on the inside. Definitely a treat, whether you're going out drinking, coming back from a night of boozing, or just taking a short break.\n\nIf it wasn't so greasy, I would have gave it 5 stars. Had to use a napkin to soak up some of the oil.
