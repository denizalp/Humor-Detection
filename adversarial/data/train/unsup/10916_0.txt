This place is a right of passage for any foodie in Phoenix.\n\nUntil recent months, I frequented their Tuesday Ramen nights, but duty calls, and I can't go as often.  By far Posh's Ramen is the BEST in PHoenix.  There is no mistaking that.  If you like Ramen, don't be intimidated by the gourmet reputation that comes with POSH.  A standard bowl of Ramen is reasonably priced at ~$12.  \n\n4 nights a week, though, POSH is an improvisational food destination.  I've had 3 improvisational dinner services.  My last experience was absolutely fantastic.  I could not believe the food experience (notice I call it an experience) that I had.  \n\nFortunately, most of the staff remembers me (I kind of stand out), so my experiences here are always pleasant and wonderful.  I love to sit at the counter of the open air kitchen and watch the chef and his staff at work.  I also make a reservation most of the time, even when it's not necessary.\n\nI love this place. \n\nReturn Factor: 100%
