This Goodwill location is fairly new to the area. I've been to many other Goodwill locations throughout the Vegas valley and sometimes it's \"hit & miss\" on what kind of service you get and how clean the store looks inside. This location is very clean and the customer service is very good! \n\nThe clothes and other miscellaneous items ranging from ironing boards and kids toys were all in good shape. Goodwill takes good pride in what they do. I like that fact that they hire vets and people that may challenges  finding a job, it could be real tough! \n\nI got a few items here and when I checked out the checker was super nice and cool! You could feel her good vibe as she smiled and made sure I found everything I needed in the store that day. I'll definitely be back to this store whether it be to shop some or donate.
