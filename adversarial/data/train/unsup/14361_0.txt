There is nothing more enjoyable than getting hairs plucked from your eyebrows it is such a pleasing experience. With that said I was really pleased with my service at the European Wax Center. \n\nI went in with a disaster from a waxing\/plucking from Dolce and my stylist fixed me up. We discussed how we were going to get those sister back to normal. She did a slight grooming and opted to let them grow. It was a rough month but I did it and when I went back we touched them up and now they're back to normal. \n\nThe waxing is delicate and not harsh and no over plucking!  We discussed what I wanted and what shape I desired.  Jackie gave me her input and I listened. \n\nAs a new customer my first service was free and I has a coupon for my second visit. The $18 after that is well worth it and reasonable. Eyebrows are very important in a woman's life and should not be messed with carelessly.
