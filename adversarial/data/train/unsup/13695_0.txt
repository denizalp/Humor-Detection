I don't get the hype over 5th and Wine... I've come here a few times with friends for a glass of wine and an app. Service hasn't ever been great, food is bland and their wine list is mediocre at best. The inside of the bar doesn't remind me at all of a wine bar. They really need to re-do their menus and d√©cor a bit and add some wow factor. I don't think I will be returning any time soon
