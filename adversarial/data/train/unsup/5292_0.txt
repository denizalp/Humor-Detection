I stayed here for my friend's 22nd birthday and it took us a good hour or more from the minute we arrived, to the moment we found parking.  You need to park in the same structure as Miracle Mile shops so it's a bit confusing.  They need to put up more signs!  I don't know how valet was full so we had to drive around and around and when we finally found a car that was leaving I got so excited I screamed, \"YESSS!\" so happily that my friend asked me if I jizzed in my pants hahaha.\n\nThe one convenient thing is that it is attached to Miracle Mile Shops so there is no reason to leave the hotel at all.  The only downfall to that is every restaurant sucks!  We tried different italian and seafood restaurants each day and every time was a big fail.  But if eating crappy food means that I don't need to go outside in 115deg weather, then I'm okay with that.  The pool area is nice, there is just one decent sized pool.  It actually felt really good to be in the water while it was scorching hot outside but I could not endure it for too long.  \n\nThe room itself is nice, the window shades are remote-controlled so for nocturnal sleepers like me, I need darkness while I sleep when the sun is up.  The biggest problem that I had was that... there's no MIRROR!  There is one well lighted mirror in the bathroom but sharing that with 4 girls was not the business...  I cannot believe that there are no other mirrors in the entire room, let alone a full length mirror!  I was very frustrated all weekend.
