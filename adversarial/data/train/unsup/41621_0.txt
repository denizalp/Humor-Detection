Best shrimp wonton in Toronto and GTA. The filling is filled with huge shrimps, and just shrimps. They don't fill half of it with veggies, or pork, or dough, it's just shrimp. \n\nSuper cheap and quick service. You can be out of there in 15 minutes. \n\nYou can also purcahse pre-made wonton to bring it home and cook it yourself. That's how you know the quality is good. \n\nThey close pretty early compared to other restaurants in the area.
