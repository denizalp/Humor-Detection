Great food and ambiance. Restaurant is small but trendy with nice dim lighting and some music but not so loud that you can't talk. Cocktails are truly unique with an interesting spin and delicious. I had the grilled octopus and seared steak kale salad. Portions were a good size, prices good compared to other restaurants and the service was excellent. This is one that I will add to my when in Las Vegas  restaurant list for sure.
