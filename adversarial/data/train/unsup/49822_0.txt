We came here for a work team dinner the other night, as I read about it's good reviews. We were here on a Tuesday night, it was pretty slow and only a few tables in the restaurant were filled. We had made a reservation on OpenTable but didn't seem like we needed one for a Tuesday!\n\nFor dinner, we heard about the 4 course family meal but one person wasn't wanting that much so we decided to order individual entrees. They did allow us to get the appetizer from the group meal which was ceviche. It was pretty good, and they made a bigger portion of it so we could share. The bread \/ toast was sooo hard though, it was really hard to bite into and was cutting the roof of our mouths so we just opted to eat the ceviche plain. \n\nFor dinner I had the ravioli. It was alright, I didn't care for it that much to be honest, but it wasn't bad. Not sure that helps, but I wish I had had the fish or seafood bowl thing (can't remember the name). \n\nWe skipped dessert as we were all full, but sounded like they had good stuff.\n\nOverall it was a good experience, I'd be willing to go back to try something different and hopefully more appetizing.
