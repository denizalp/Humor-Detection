My little one was terrified to go get his first filling. The dental asst., Jessica, was amazing! She put my son at ease and he actually came out smiling!  I was so thankful for her calming nature and great personality. I cannot thank Yelp enough for their services. They have not let our family down yet. Dr. Bui is fantastic with kids. And here in LV, I feel that healthcare in general is lacking. So I applaud Dr. Bui and his staff for making a difference in the community. Thanks again, Jessica.
