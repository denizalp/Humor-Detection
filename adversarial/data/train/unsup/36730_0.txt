Jabz has truly been life changing for me. I've never liked working out and nothing has ever \"clicked\" with me. I would start something and then quit a few weeks later. Jabz is a supportive, enthusiastic group where each class is small and the trainer is able to pay attention to everyone. I've lost eight pounds in a month (I'm 5 ft, so that's great for me) and am seeing a huge difference in the trimming of my body. I can't say enough good things and I've been preaching the word of Jabz to anyone who will listen! The only thing I need is a later class on Friday so I can make it for ab day!
