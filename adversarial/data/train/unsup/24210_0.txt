Love, love, love. Got my face all prettified here before a night out... they were actually having a special event for the introduction of their new collection, A Tartan Tale. There was a violinist and a 15-foot girl (crazy high heels and even crazier high hair!) and a friggin' satyr (half man\/half goat.... awesome costume, obvio). I seriously don't know of anywhere else I can get false eyelashes put on while a satyr is testing the Lipglass out next to me. As busy as it was, I received a great amount of attention from my MAC artist... she was actually from Miami and had been flown out for the event, how sick is that?? She introduced me to the best primer EVER... I have such oily skin that my makeup ends up sliding off of my face, but thanks to this cute little blondie, I have that Kardashian face alllllllll day (in my mind, I do... shut up).\nIf you get the chance to, seriously hit up this MAC store. You'll be in girly heaven.
