I was worried after reading the negative comments on here. But the price for the room, less than 100 a night, was right on for the room. It is a unique hotel that reminds you that you are in Vegas. The staff is really friendly, especially Terra at the front desk, and the hotel was clean and modern.   Thank you for a nice stay at a reasonable price!
