First bite of a shrimp salad, I felt as if I were in a cafe somewhere in France. \n\nI came here per recommendation from a fellow Yelper and after I finished my dinner, now I know why they left five star review.\n\nIf you come between 3pm and 6pm, they have happy hour everyday and any wines on their menu is $6 per glass. While their wine list may not be extensive, their list has a wide variety. I can tell they were carefully selected and I am sure you can pick at least one to satisfy your wine needs. I picked Spanish red wine and it tasted like what Spanish wine should taste. \n\nFor dinner, I enjoyed both shrimp salad and classic pizza. Shrimp salad is made of avocado, shrimp and red grapefruit. Who would thought these three will create such a perfect harmony, I enjoyed each ingredients texture and flavor separately and all mixed together. The sauce they used to mix three ingredients was so delicate, I sometimes think how they are made as I eat, but I just stopped thinking and focused on enjoying every bite of the salad. \n\nClassic pizza was excellent as well. The pizza sauce was somehow similar to what I had in Japan. The sauce, dough, cheese, ham and mushrooms, each of them were not insisting its own identity, rather each of them enhanced what each ingredient should taste without losing their own taste. Simple and pleasant are my thought as I enjoyed this pizza.\n\nService was very friendly and attentive. She was very pleasant to talk to with full knowledge of the each menu items. Nice decor both inside and outside, they put so much though into each decor and furniture. They are located at the same mall as the Herkins theater Shea. Parking could be difficult to find.\n\nI surely enjoyed my early dinner. I would definitely come back
