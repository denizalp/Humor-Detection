The best way I can describe this place is that it's a Chinese\/Thai\/Vietnamese fusion type of restaurant. You can get Chow Mein, Pad Thai, or Pho. \n\nMy wife shared a bowl of beef pho with my youngest son. My oldest son got the pork vermicelli bowl. I got the lunch special which came with hot or iced tea, eggflower soup, an eggroll, fried rice, and entr√©e of your choice from a list. I chose sweet n sour pork. \n\nThe beef pho was good. Since we ordered it plain, for my youngest, it was just like chicken noodle soup but with beef instead. The vermicelli was ok. Nothing to rave about. Now my lunch special was pretty good. They give you a nice bowl of eggflower soup. I chose iced tea for my drink. I think it was jasmine. It was very strong. If you refer to my pic, the fried rice that came with my sweet n sour pork was very good. The eggroll I think was a combination pork and vegetable. I would say it was a good deal for 6 bucks.\n\nService was ok. We were taken care of by one server. Even though the place was a bit busy, we got our food in a timely manner. It just took a while to get our refills a couple times.\n\nSome random info: 2 free eggrolls on check in. Free wifi. Password is express7. Lunch specials are everyday from 11 am to 4 pm. Don't forget about the various boba drinks you can order. Apparently a lot of people come here just for those drinks! When we were eating our meal, at least 4 people came in just for those drinks alone! So it must be good. Next time we will try one.\n\nYelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #75
