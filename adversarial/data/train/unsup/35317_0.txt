Misleading terms - car reserved was not available, claimed that buying insurance was required. The location is not at the airport but is actually off-site, making it difficult to use another rental company if you decide not to use them. Representative falsely claimed that our reservation was already finalized even though we did not sign the agreements yet. Ended up walking away.
