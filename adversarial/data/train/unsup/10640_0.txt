Hello all,\n\nI'm sure I'm going to sound like a shill but I don't agree with these other reviews.  I stopped in yesterday and told them about how my 10+ year old Alpine with Amp and Sub wasn't producing sound.  They asked that I come back today, and I did (at store open.)  Talked with the tech today and ended up buying a nicer, newer Alpine with AUX, USB and BT!  Install took a little over an hour and was professionally done (new kit was required as my old one was busted).  Dustin is a straight up dude and I will be giving them more business in the future.  Not sure if there was a change in people or management but I had a different experience from the other (harsh IMO) reviews here.  -Gary
