I got a Easter basket delivered today, first I thought cool.  When I read the card I saw that the sender paid for a \"basket of assorted fresh fruits\". Now there are 2 apples and an orange so maybe it's technically a basket of assorted fresh fruit?  But this isn't what i think of when I hear, basket of assorted fresh fruit.  But even when I dug through the candy, I found that the orange and the red apple were pretty mushy. The green apple seemed fine, but I tossed it seeing what the other fruit had gone through. I didn't pay for this order, but that's no reason to take advantage.  I took a picture so you can judge for yourself, it's not what I would want when someone sends you a  fruit basket. I would have rated it a bit higher, but seeing how I couldn't even eat the fruit, I don't think they deserved any higher.
