Parked my car with valet, while wet willies was fine. My car was gone through by one of the valets and things were stolen AMERIPARK will do nothing about this because I did not search my car before I left. If you want to go here I suggest you expect one of there valets to dig through the stuff in your car and take what they like AMERIPARK will do nothing they clearly support the drug addict thieves they have working for them. I will not go back.
