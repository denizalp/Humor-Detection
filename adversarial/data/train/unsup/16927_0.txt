Shhh.....Don't Tell Mama - but in this case, I am. This place is too damn awesome to NOT tell!\n\nI absolutely love visiting DTM in New York and nearly peed my pants when I heard there was one in Vegas. It's definitely a cooler, hipper vibe, but it's every bit as impressive. \n\nFirst - this is a super small place so arrive early if you want a table. We waited about an hour just to grab a couple of seats at the bar. Don't Tell Mama always has the friendliest crowds, probably because everyone's drunk thanks to the affordable drinks - thank God no $15 drinks here. I believe my rum and cokes were around $6 or $7 (can't remember) - a rarity these days!\n\nThe girls behind the bar were extremely talented and they are the star of the show along with the witty,  fabulously hysterical piano player. One girl in particular, Dre, is the bomb-diggity - Damn she was good. I would go to DTM just to watch her perform. And some of her lyrics can be downright raunchy so it's not for the prudish!\n\nPatrons can sign up to sing, but please don't unless you're good. This isn't your average karaoke joint. If you sing like shit, please go to Calico Jack's.
