I used to work for this store needless to say the management is the worst ever they don't care! I used to work for them and even spent money on furniture from them which they delivered smashed then they wouldn't give me a refund oh what a nightmare do not work for these people.!! Do not buy from her !!.. Furniture falls apart the market pieces are old and it's been sitting around in homes for staging not worth it go to IKEA
