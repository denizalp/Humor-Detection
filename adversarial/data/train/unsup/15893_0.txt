My wife was craving Banh Mi so after a day of zip lining we decided to give Banh Mi & Ti a try.  We were so hungry!  We luckily found street parking right in front of the restaurant.  I say luckily because the sky just opened up and a big thunder storm started as we ran in.\n\n     We have had Banh Mi before and have made it at home.  Carrie saw good reviews on this place so we had high expectations and they were met!\n\n     We looked over the menu at the counter and ordered.  We both ordered Pork Bahn Mi's and a side order of Shrimp Summer Spring Rolls to share.\n\n     We went to sit down and our food came to us within 5 minutes.  Just perfect since we were so hungry.  Our sandwiches were excellent.  The summer rolls were delicious too.  If you have never had a Banh Mi before it's hard to explain.  It's just a lot of great flavors exploding in your mouth.  Cilantro, pickled vegetables, Jalapeno's and so much more.  One sandwich each and summer rolls were plenty and we were full after.\n\n     You might say it tasted really good because we were so hungry.  My brother and his wife came along with us.  They aren't foodie people and don't eat different food that much.  They still came because we highly recommended trying a sandwich.  They didn't know what to order but they ordered the Summer rolls and a Banh Mi.  They loved it too.  They were pleasantly surprised and I think they are Banh Mi fans now!\n\nWe will be back to this great little Bahn Mi shop!
