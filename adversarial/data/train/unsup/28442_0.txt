Coldest Beer in town and the best wings ever!!  Have you ever heard of or tried \"dill pickle wings?\"  Just 2 words can describe them  Fan-Tastic!!!\nAs for the rest of the food, the prices are good and the taste is even better. Sure its just the usual fare you would find at most pubs but there is something special about mug shotz food. Yum Yum.\n\nThe patrons at the bar are mostly middle aged blue collar workers with very little problems ever occuring. They just want to drink, talk and laugh.\n\nStaff at mug shotz are terrific and very attentive. Your not sitting there with an empty glass or bottle for long, if ever.\n\nBooze prices are really decent, $2.75 happy hour on domestic beer and on friday $3.25 coronas!!  You just can't beat these prices now-a-days!!!I'm not sure about the price on hi-balls or cocktails cause I don't really drink them.\n\nThe atmosphere is very pleasant but the one minor concern I have is it can be a little dark, which is fine in the evening but during lunch it can be a little hard to read the menu.\n\nOverall, Mug Shotz is a great place you should try and you will probably keep go back. I know I do.
