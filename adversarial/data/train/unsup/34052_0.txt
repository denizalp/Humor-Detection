They didn't have what I went in for. The tea was very good and fair price. The grill was closed but the hours on the wall said it should of been opened. I loved the shaded area up front but we couldn't use it because the grill area was closed. The butcher was alone working on a busy Saturday and I know this because she said she was by herself today with no help. It was green hatch chili week and they had non! I won't go back to this particular location. I wish they made one in queen creek or Gilbert.
