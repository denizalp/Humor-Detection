We were amazed by the nice and clean decoration. Location is good and parking is easy to find. Food was good, price was good as well.\nHowever, the reason behind 3 star is the lack of good service. I saw one hostess just standing there, while we were waiting to be seated. We had to wait a lot to place the order, get the food, and pay the bill. Otherwise, nice place to visit.\nNote: this is mixed Thai\/Chinese, don't be surprised!
