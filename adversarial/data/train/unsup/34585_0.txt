If I could give no stars I would there was a long wait time which was expected considering it's a Saturday night that's not a problem we finally got seated down and we waited like a good 10 mins before we were serviced and we waited 20 mins before our appetizers finally came there was only one good item out of the 5 that were ordered. Our main entrees were very bland  and had very little portions. Also the oil for frying is very old and burnt . My mother ordered fried shrimp and it tasted like old burnt oil ,we complained to the manager and she was the only helpful person in the whole place and she fixed our bill and made the situation better .WILL NEVER RETURN AGAIN
