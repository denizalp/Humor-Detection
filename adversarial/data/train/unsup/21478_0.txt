This place has such a datey datey vibe. It'll totally motivate you to find someone so you can take him\/her here out on a date. It's on the rooftop of a hotel and overlooks the city of Montreal. If you're seated at a table facing the West, you have this gorgeous view of the sunset also. They also have an extensive choice of mojitos and selection of cocktails. Their cheeseboards look pretty damn awesome too. Whether it's a fun get together with friends or a romantic date, this place hits the jackpot when it comes to ambiance. \n\nAnother side note: there's a DJ. Bonus!\n\nMy only complaint would probably be the amount of bugs this place attracts. It can be distracting sometimes but it cracked up a few jokes also.
