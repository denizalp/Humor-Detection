I had no idea this was a Johnny Rockets. I was over looking the receipt and saw the name on the bottom, I was surprised. Besides that, the restaurant was very clean & looked good. The burgers definitely had a good taste of them, but the fries were a bit salty. The drink station was pretty cool, there were about eight different flavors to enhance your drinks. Overall, next time I want a burger and I'm in the area I will probably stop here versus anywhere else. Great job JR aka Johnny rocket
