I've been here are couple of times. Food is good and service is kind of disorganized. There are so many tables and not enough staff. They aren't really attentive when you need the check. \n\nAlso I stopped going after an incident in the bathroom. One of the waitresses came out of the stall while I was heading in and she didn't even wash her hands! Talk about disgusting. And yes, she used the bathroom, flushed the toilet, but did not wash her hands before leaving.... Never went back. It's been about 4 or 5 months since I've eating there.
