Brought two bikes in for repair.  One because I had broken three spokes and the other because the fork had to be reinstalled.  I also had both tuned up and asked for Julian to point out other necessary repairs.  I'm remarkably impressed with the quality of Julian's work and how much better both bikes ride.  The parts were reasonably priced and he spent much more time on the bikes to ensure they were up to his standards.  I will be using Cranky Monkey again and have no qualms in recommending this shop.
