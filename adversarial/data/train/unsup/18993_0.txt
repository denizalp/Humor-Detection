I've been to Frank and Lupe's twice now. The first time was part of the Scottsdale walking tour and we were able to sit down for about 20-30 minutes and enjoy some sopaipillas. The sopaipillas were very tasty and had a little bit of kick to them. I wish I had more when I left, even after I was able to eat half of my wifes.\n\nLast night, I went with my wife and another couple for Happy Hour.  Happy hour is 4-6 pm and half price appetizers and margaritas. \nAWESOME! \n\nWe enjoyed our food and drinks on the cool patio area. \n\nThe margaritas were very good and went down easy. As for the food, we went with the mini tacos, cheese crisp and mini chimicangas. The cheese crisp and chimichangas served with salsa, guacamole were good. I was a bit disappointed by the mini tacos. They were okay, but not great. Seemed like something you got at Costco, dropped in the fryer and served. Not much behind them.\n\nThe service was really good. Our drinks came out quickly after each order. The food took longer though. Given the food was just appetizers, I thought the food should arrive quicker. The food took upwards of 20 minutes.  \n\nOverall, 3.5 stars.\n\nI plan to head back and have an actual dinner next time.
