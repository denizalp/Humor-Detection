This place certainly deserves 5 SOLID stars.  \n\nWhy?  Well, besides having far more choices in rock than Lowe's or Home Depot, the place is DIRT CHEAP (or, should I say, they have ROCK bottom prices)!\n\nCost for 1\/4 ton decorative rock, one tarp and 6 flagstone pavers: Just under $20!\n\nHere's how our visit went:\n - picked out the rock we liked, \n - drove onto the scale, \n - loaded our trunk up with the rock, \n - drove back onto the scale, \n - loaded our pavers, \n - drove back onto the scale,\n - went inside to pay.  \nEasy peasy!\n\nEven easier?  They offer delivery for a pittance... or free if you purchase 8 tons or more!\n\nThey have boulders for .08\/.09 per pound!  I will definitely be stopping back to purchase two giant boulders, possibly as early as next week.  I am so very happy to have found this place!
