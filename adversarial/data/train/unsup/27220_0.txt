I came here for dim sum on a hoilday, it was packed to a point everywhere was filled with people. It was almost impossible for you to walk over to the hostess stand since everyone crowds over the stand even after they have gotten a waiting number. Suggest everyone that goes on a weekend and especially holiday to make a reservation (especially table of 4 or more) because even with a reservation, you still have to wait! \n****They're waiting system is SUPER UNORGANIZED, where you see people without reservations and numbers get a table as soon as they walk in just because they know people inside working there.\n\nThey give you a sheet of dim sum paper as you sit down and you just mark off what you want to eat. They will also ask what type of tea you would want to drink, typically you can choose 2 because they serve 2 pots. On the sheet there will be a S, M, L, XL written beside each dim sum representing what prices they are charged at.\n\nOnce you have given your sheet to the server, they will come back with a printed list of what you have ordered. As they come place your dim sum on the table, they scratch out the ones they have placed at the table, keeping track you have received all your food.\n\nThey're food is average, nothing in particular that was super good or something I would order twice. But for the prices they charge and the food quality, I think it WASN'T so worth my money! You can basically walk in ANY other restaurants in the same area and find the SAME QUALITY food but for a CHEAPER cost.\n\nService is considered fast since they have plenty of staff working.\n\n*** But I WOULDN'T come back to this location for dim sum or recommend any of my friends of family to this place, there's BETTER choices around this area!!
