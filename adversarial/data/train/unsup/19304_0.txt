I'm in a bad mood, so let's write a bad review.\n\nPete's is awful. It's the same, terrible fried fish you can get at the grocery store, except the price is marked up, and you can't use your credit card. Seriously, this joint has a ridiculous \"cash only\" policy.\n\nBut the food... it's just so freaking bad. The fish sucks. The shrimp sucks. The fries suck. The sandwiches suck. It all just sucks. Like, I can't even find one redeeming quality here. Even when I was drunk, I could tell it was terrible. I didn't think it was possible to make fish and chips this bad. Pete's, you have blown me away with this newfound level of ineptitude.\n\nAnd the icing on the cake is the \"Pete's Sauce\". This sauce is garbage. It's worse than ketchup, and I do not say that lightly. You are better off getting a jar of cocktail sauce from the grocery store. How can it be that bad? And how can they charge you for it? Only at Pete's Fish & Chips.\n\nLook, I get that Pete's is a \"historic\" eating establishment, having done its thing since the 1940s. But Pete has definitely overstayed his welcome. This fish shack should swim away into the abyss.\n\nYou know what, this is kind of a bittersweet moment. I haven't encountered a restaurant this deserving of a one star rating in quite a long time. It's incredible to know that a place this ghastly can still exist today. This is truly an inept establishment with zero positive attributes.\n\nPete's Fish & Chips, you suck.
