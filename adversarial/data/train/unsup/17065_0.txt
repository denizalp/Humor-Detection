I had my car detailed here before selling it and I was so disappointed....that I didn't get it done sooner!\n\nMy car had light tan leather seats that turned into a dingy gray from years of a rambunctious pug climbing all over everything. Dog hair everywhere! Mystery smells galore!!Everything was sticky with coffee and soda and (sorry, I'm gross) chewed gum residue. \n\nMy friends and boyfriend were always chastising me about my bad car habits. If cleanliness is next to godliness, I was somewhere between Satan and Guy Fieri.\n\nI couldn't believe my eyes when I picked up my car after getting it detailed!! The leather seats looked brand new and everything was spotless inside and out. It even smelled good! It was truly worth every penny!!\n\nI ended up selling my car and the buyer commented on how well I took care of it over the years. LOL!!! \n\nBeyond the great job they did, the people at Extreme couldn't have been nicer or easier to work with. Highly recommended.
