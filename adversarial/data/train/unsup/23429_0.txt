Congratulations!\n\nYou had the absolute best vegan sandwich in town and then you went and ruined it by changing the type of vegan cheese you use. \n\nWhy? Because your chef thinks it's better? \nLast time I checked the chef wasn't the one supporting your business, and he's probably not vegan anyway.\n\nIf it ain't broke, don't fix it!\n\nI have nothing against Daiya , but it does not work on \"You're so keen\" AT ALL. \n\nIn fact, \"You're so mean\" for not listening to your customers requests.\n\nPlease go back to using Follow Your Heart.\nSo I can go back to following mine and continue dining with you.
