This is definitely my favorite comic book store and one of my favorite places in downtown Glendale. For the amount of space there is an awesome selection of comics and good pickings in the dollar box.  I really like the atmosphere -  Nice layout - comfortable lighting. What really makes this place stand out is the service.  Friendly and knowledgeable. Even walking in for the first time I was treated like an old customer.
