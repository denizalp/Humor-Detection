Good: my friend and I got a pedicure. They did a great job. The girls who did them were very nice. \n\nBad: got a full set of acrylics. Ruined my entire experience. The shape was not exactly what I asked for and was uneven. I tipped before they applied the polish (25% tip, mind you). Asked the guy to trim my cuticles first and he did a very subpar job and managed to make me bleed. It would not stop bleeding and he tries to apply polish to that nail anyway. Every nail was so thick with polish, and I tried pointing it out halfway through. The gentleman completely ignores me, and just continues to pile more on. I'm guessing it would have taken 3-4 hours for it to dry and I'm not exaggerating. Finally the manager noticed how oissed off I was and had somebody else take off the polish and start over but that didn't change the fact that the cuticles looked bad, my finger was bleeding, and the shape was uneven. I was just disappointed because it seemed everyone around me had better looking nails than I. I spent $90 there and walked out pretty displeased. \n\nWouldn't return again.
