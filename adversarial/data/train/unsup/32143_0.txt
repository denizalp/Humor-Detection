Our 1yr old puppy came in sick and seriously low on vitals with no explanation. This group took her in immediately and met with 3 doctors within the first hour of our visit, WITH our dog so that we were not in the dark. They ended up keeping her over night with tests, fluid IV, heated blankets, etc. and walked us through the hospital so that we could see her living quarters and their operation. Top-notch care; clean facility; doctors who know what they're doing; and wonderful communication as they kept us in the loop every step of the way. From entering to discharge, we felt VERY comfortable, and could tell our dog was well taken care of. Cost was initially paid up front because it was an over-night, which seemed reasonable, and we were refunded the difference since it was less care than anticipated. Great group; I highly recommend this for anyone. For us, they turned lemons into lemonade.
