I was visiting AZ for a couple of days and did some research on what places I wanted to try while I was here. Little Miss BBQ was one such place.\n\nI did my homework, studied Yelp reviews and executed my plan. I learned that they run out of food often. Well, I didn't want that to happen to me. They open @ 11 am, I was there @ 9:45 am. After that, there was another half an hour wait after the doors are opened. Fine. Then, I was rewarded with the best BBQ I have had in my life! All of the meats melted in my mouth!!! Very tender! Good sides, too. They put a great number of BBQ restaurants in Chicago to shame (Sorry, John B.)! They do it the conventional way (Sorry again, John B.).\n\n\"If you play your cards right, everything is gonna be alright...\" (Alicia Myers).\n\nI did just that and got exactly what I wanted :-)
