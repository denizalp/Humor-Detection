Don't get me wrong, I had SOME fun at this place, but not a lot. \n\nFirst off, the food. The food's not very good, to be honest. There's a lot of VERY pushy sales-people. (Lady, I don't want your goddamned Philly Cheesesteak for the 5th time... I GET sandwiches from a sub shop that specializes in them.) \n\nA lot of the food is left sitting in the sun for hours. This scares me from a health\/safety standpoint. Most of the fare is carnival food, with a few exceptions. The pizza was very dry and unpleasant looking. The only positive point was my funnel cake that I had. \n\n--\n\nSecond - The booths. There's a LOT of garbage being peddled here. Also on the way in, they tried to loop us into a scam, saying we had won a free trip by giving us a swipe card etc. I swiped the card, and put in my first and last name, then it was saying \"I agree to allow X company (I think Wyndham) to contact me\" and then started asking for my phone number. I quickly canceled out and discarded the card, then took my friend away from the pushy salesperson telling her they were giving her a trip to Mexico or whatever at no obligation... (riiiiight, and I have a bridge in San Francisco to sell you)\n\n--\n\nFinally, the carnival. I'm sorry, but $1 per ticket, and like $3-6 dollars per person, per ride? Can I PLEASE have some of whatever drugs you're on, if you think that's an acceptable price? \n\nAlso, please try putting in some fun carnival games. I don't feel like seeing 8... (yes EIGHT) booths of Balloon Pop... 2-3 shooting gallery games, and NO Skee-Ball. Ya wonder why no one's playing the games? Maybe because they've seen 7 other booths with them in less than a football field's distance? Just a thought. \n\n--\n\nAll in all, I got in free because of some passes, but realistically? Other than the company I had, I didn't enjoy it that much. Really guys, you could do better.
