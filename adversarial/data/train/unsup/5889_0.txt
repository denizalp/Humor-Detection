C'mon folks. Anyone going more than 3 stars here is being silly.\n\nThis is about on par with Filibertos except in a much dirtier environment. Dusty non air conditioned dining area with super uncomfortable seating. This is a very LDS style hodge podge of a dining area. Whatever could be found at the Thrift store if I had to guess.\n\nNice people working there though. Don't expect a conversation however if you are from out of town. People in this part of AZ are very very dry.
