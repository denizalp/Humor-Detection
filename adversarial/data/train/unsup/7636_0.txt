The wait staff is clumsy and had difficulties serving our party of sixteen. Plates were mistakenly placed. There was a significant lapse of time between appetizers and main courses. But what was really appalling was the kitchen forgetting someone's riserva steak. When I say \"forget,\" I don't just mean they sent it out a few minutes late. I mean we all finished eating by the time it came out. And then during dessert, they forgot that same person's coffee! \n\nMy entr√©e was made up of two sides: Scallops A La Piastra and Italian Broccoli. The scallops had good presentation, but were cold. The broccoli was something just thrown into the dish, hanging out the side, etc. \n\nThe service, plating, and food are not worth $$$$.
