This Menchie's is AMAZING! The fro yo was delicious (and I'm really picky about my fro yo) and the staff were super efficient and friendly. Try the cake batter and fluffy marshmallow flavors, they are magical ^_^ I'm so glad this place opened, I'll be back weekly for sure!!! \n\nPs: you must get the popping boba as a topping. Trust me.
