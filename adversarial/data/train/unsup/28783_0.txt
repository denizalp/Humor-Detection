UPDATE:  Management reached out to us to \"correct\" and \"investigate\" the poor service we received our first time in.  We decided to give Olive & Ivy another chance and tried out their Brunch today without telling them.  The hostess station greeted us and arranged to seat us without any delay.  Good so far.  \nTony, our waiter, arrived thereafter and introduced himself asking if we had been here before, sharing the soup of the day and answering our menu questions.  Again, good so far, but it only got better.  Tony took our orders and returned with fresh bread and pesto sauce on the side.  We ordered.  My Eggs Benedict were not only superb but the Coffee Mocha was excellent!!  My wife enjoyed her eggs, bacon, and potatoes as well.  Tony continued to check on us.\n\nHere's what I learned as I looked around.  The service and food should not only be \"good\", but it looked as if \"excellent\" was the expectation, the bar.  People were happy, the different food looked great - and the wait staff was very attentive.\n\nWe have become fans.  Thank you to Tony and the management.
