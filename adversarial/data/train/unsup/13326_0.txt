The old Five Guys spot is now a Japanese place!\n\nClassic Ramen: Ramen noodles were more cooked than I prefer and thicker too, almost the circumference of spaghetti noodles.  The broth was very plain chicken broth and lacked \"umami\" but the big spoonful (not an artful drizzle) of teriyaki sauce helped the broth once mixed in.  The chicken was fine, plain and not too dry.  I appreciated that they included a small whole egg in the price, though it's hard boiled.  Near the end of the bowl the sweetness was getting to me though.  2\/5 for the weak broth (I wish they'd use shrimp, fish, or even pork broth instead of chicken), too much teriyaki sauce on top the chicken (try a drizzle next time), and overcooked noodles (they need a better chew).  $7.75.\n\nCrab cheese won ton roll: My first impression was that these were very tiny, and the nori is wrapped around the crab mixture with rice then surrounding that.  However, the taste was definitely above the imitation crab used in grocery store sushi!  You actually taste the crab!  They actually had a good texture too, and the tiny bit of won ton strips on top helped add a bit of crunch that was nice.  Despite the smaller portion, this was really good.  4\/5.  $4.50.\n\nThe music was meh (Little Richard, really?) but at a decent subtle volume.  It was beautiful weather on the patio, and I had a nice sunset view and great breeze, but it is still just a parking lot sidewalk seat.  I was not greeted or acknowledged right away, but the employees were friendly enough after that.  It's definitely chain food fare, but at least it's something different.  3\/5 stars seems about right.
