Did the President Obama came to this place?  Yes he did. This place has damn good dumplings. Sorry mom, this place makes better than you. I still love you though!\n\nWe ordered hot and sour soup, pork and shrimp dumplings and celery and pork dumplings. The food came lightning fast!  Man oh man, the dumplings are so good here!  Why can't they have another location near where I live?!  My and I really enjoy this place. Warms us up since it was chilly today. \n\nWith all of my restaurant review, I always ask will I come back with my wife?  The answer is quite simply yes!!!\n\nFood:  5\/5\nAmbience:  3\/5\nService:  4\/5\nCleanliness:  4\/5
