The place is really nice, my tenderloin was small but really good.  I liked it, you would to (if you like really nice kinda fancy places)... \n\nBut I don't know ... I guess it's the kind of place that married men take their girlfriends.  Or the place you take your wife (the one you still like) the day after her Mom died.  Or in my case ... if you just want to feel like the second youngest person in the room (my date Jacqui J won first place, hands down).\n\nNothing is wrong with this place, it's just ... well it's not bar food and there was no jukebox with Johnny Cash in it.  Not only that, when I asked for a can of Blatz they looked at my like I was an alien.  And not a spork in the house!  And get this, they took cloth and made it into napkins!  Weird stuff!\n\nBut seriously  ... the place is cozy (almost to much) ... the food is in small portions (at least mine was) and kinda pricy.  It was just what I expected.  No more, no less.  A solid 4 no doubt.  And any restaurant that tries to make a go of it on 7th Freeway\/Street ... God Bless 'em!
