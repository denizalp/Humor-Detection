This store staff & management were horrendous!! I went in with a few things to switch sizes. That's all just get a different size. Char kept trying to get me to purchase other jeans... My items were gifts & I just needed smaller\/bigger sizes. Left without anything changed & an hour wasted in my day!! Won't shop there ever again!!
