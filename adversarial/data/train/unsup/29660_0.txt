We had reservations after a show and were seated promptly upon arrival. The chucumber cocktail is fabulous, as were all of our apps and rolls. The salt and pepper squid was incredible! All of the rolls we ordered were fresh and delicious. Service, however, was lacking. Our waiter was clearly overwhelmed and totally scattered. It took forever to get the check and pay the bill, and we had to flag him down for everything. He never came by to check on us once. I have been to Sushi Samba in NYC and Miami as well and always had good service. Service fell flat at this location.
