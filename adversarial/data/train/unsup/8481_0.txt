A very nice airport to have a layover unlike some other places I know. Very clean loo's for 1's and 2's, there is even a bathroom attendant. How fancy! \n\nAnd who doesn't love rocking chairs and free wireless! It rocks! \n\nBut I have to say, they really, REALLY love their Nascar here. If you're into that (then you probably aren't reading this) you got your Nascar shop and your Nascar restaurant and bar! Woo doggy!
