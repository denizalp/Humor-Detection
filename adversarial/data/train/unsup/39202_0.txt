Recently purchased a ham here. The ham was outstanding as was the young ladies customer service that rung up our purchase. What grossed me out was the group of young employees just standing behind the counter and one young man was touching and braiding another employees hair. This went on for some time. Seriously, you touch our food and other peoples hair? Didn't make me feel very confident in the cleanliness and adherence to sanitary standards in the store. Probably won't use this store in the future
