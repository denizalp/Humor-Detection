This was my first visit for dinner using a $14 Living Social coupon.  It was located on S Pecos Rd\/E Sunset Rd in Las Vegas.  There were no diners there on a Monday night.\n\nMy friend ordered the Steak Bowl.  There was a whole cup of beef on top of seasoned rice and salad.  I saw her measure it.\n\nI ordered the Falafel Bowl.  The gal fried up 7 small balls of falafel and placed them on top of a layer of seasoned rice and salad.  There was no hot pita bread, scoop of hummus or spicy carrots like Shawn F described and saw photos on Yelp.  \n\nWe ordered the food to go, so the falafel were not as crisp had we dined there.  The flavor of everything was good.  The portions were hearty.  I would come back if I were in the area.
