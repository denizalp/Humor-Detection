I've heard that this is one of the best buffets in Downtown Vegas and I don't disagree! The buffet here is cheap and even cheaper if you have a player's card with the hotel's casino! (You can easily obtain it for free.) On weekends, they have a brunch buffet, which consists of a build-your-own omelet station, Portuguese sausages and other breakfast items. There is also all-you-can-drink mimosas! It was a pretty solid and delicious brunch.\n\nI came here again recently for lunch on a Monday and again, found the food to be delicious. The grilled pork chops and rice pilaf stood out to me. They also had an Italian section with pasta, pizza and garlic bread. The seafood ravioli was delicious! There was also a Mexican food section and Hawaiian food section. However, I was so full from the grilled pork chops and ravioli that I did not get the chance but it honestly did not look as appetizing anyways. This is a buffet that I will definitely return to!\n\nParking is convenient in the structure or lot for Main Street Hotel. You have to pay to park but I've heard you can get reimbursed at the casino if you show your dining receipt from the buffet.
