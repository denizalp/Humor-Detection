Is the food awesome? No. But this place is the only 24 hour Chinese restaurant and it serves both dim sum and full course dinner meals. It's been around for decades and the quality has not changed one bit. The prices almost seem static too. Usually come once or twice a year to eat their Peking duck dinner combo which is always good. Staff are friendly but hard to get their attention as they are always a full house.
