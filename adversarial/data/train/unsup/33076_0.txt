Took our RAV4 there for an oil change. The team noticed our alignment was off and offered to fix the alignment as well has fixing us with a $20 coupon. We got our engine cleaned, oil changed, and our alignment fixed under $170. The staff was super helpful and friendly. We are definitely coming back here for future car visits. Thanks guys for the excellent service!
