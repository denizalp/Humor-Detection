La Mirage Mediterranean occupies a wierd pad in NoPho's Bell Canyon Pavillions Shoppping Center, at I-17 north of Bell -- the room's kind of shaped like a big wedge of cheese.  But it's fresh and tidy inside, with twangy M.E. music and an owner-looking guy with slicked back hair sitting in a back office while a couple of women were out front serving customers.  \n\nCompared with other M.E. places I've been, the food was really good, but a good , tasty, quality stand-ard, not stand-out.  Considering that other nearby choices start with \"Native New...\",   \"Hometown...\",   \"Apple...\",   \"Hoot...\", et al., this is really a great option to have available.\n\nI also had the Lunch Special::: sammie, side, and drink for $5.99.  You choose any pita-wrapped sandwich, from among about a dozen different meaty or veggie selections, including chicken or beef shawarma, tika, kabob, falafel, hummous, etc.  You can have a soup, house salad or fries, or for a $buck extra get a Tabhouli Salad, that I found really tasty, lemony and not too oily, larger than expected, with lots of tomato bits mixed in, and bulgar wheat bits that were closer to soggy grape nuts than chewy couscous.  After a few initial weird bites, I eventually decided the texture was really nice, and I'm a fan of it now, over the more common pasta-y bits.  Mixed it into my Falafel sandwich, which was really good, but not the best I've had, just really good (there will never be another *ORIGINAL* Yusef's, which is my gold standard, well, really they were green!)\n\nThey have a stage and do entertainment here as well, with a website to consult for special event dates.  I've driven past this place pretty late on a Saturday and seen it hopping.  \nFor some reason they have a DJ'd Latin Dance night once a week, I think every Tuesday.(?!?) \n\nOverall really nice place I'll be back to, for sure.  Maybe not for the live music, but mos def for the awesome Lunch Special.
