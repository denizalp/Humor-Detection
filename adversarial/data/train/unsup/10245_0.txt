I struggled with how many stars I wanted to rate the Bliss Spa @ the W Hotel in Scottsdale.   Ultimately I decided to give the 3 -stars based on experience only.   The service was great and for the record, I am a HUGE fan of Bliss products overall.\n\nThe reason I rated my experience 3 stars is because the Spa didn't match my expectations.   There was no place to really hang out and relax either before or after the service.  The furniture was for looks only - not comfort.   If you wanted to go with a bunch of girlfriends, as I so often do, I don't think think the \"lounge\" is really conducive to kibitzing with the girls.\n\nMy services were fabulous.  And I have no complaints.   I used a Living Social Deal which gave me $200 worth of services for $100.  Nice! Right?\n\nIn short, I think the Bliss Spa is more like a Day Spa experience that you might find at Dolce Spa.  I prefer a Resort Spa experience which gives me a relaxing lounge, access to the pool, and the prices are comparable.\n\nBut, if you have never used Bliss products, you really should visit .  I love their Lemon Sage Body Butter and their facial foaming cleanser.
