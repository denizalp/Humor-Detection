Been here several times now for lunch and once for dinner. Found this place while driving in the area. Doesn't look like much from outside but believe me, this place still got me grinning from ear to ear!..\n\nRecommendations:\n\nItalian Bread with butter (included) - Always fresh and a nice starter every time..\n\nSpaghetti Bolognese Pork: Fresh Pasta (made in house), little chunks of sausage, little chopped cubes of carrots and their red sauce.. The pasta was Incredible, sauce was like butter with some aromatic and delicious olive oil  and an excellent balance of tomato sweetness and tart that was sure to more than satisfy!.. \n\nSpaghetti Zucchini Pomodoro: Fresh Pasta, thick slices of zucchini, herbs, red sauce.... 99% of the time, I order pasta with some type of meat (meatballs, sausage, beef, chicken..), this time I decided to go meatless.. WOW!!!!! Seriously, this was Beyond Anything I expected.. One of The Best Pasta Anything I've Ever Ate!  \n\nMeat Lasagna: Fresh slices of pasta in between layers of meat, sauce, ricotta.. Rich in flavor, got that creaminess to it and definitely filling. Should fill up 2 hungry people and have leftovers.. \n\nRum Cake: Definitely had that rum liqour  fragrance, moistness and taste that will send you off to dessert bliss! Nothing too Fancy, Just Rumtastic!\n\nThe first time I dined here, I was so impressed that I almost stayed to have dinner right after a late lunch.. Like Back to Back Meals!! Every night, the chef comes in and decides what will be on the menu for that particular night. So next time, So and so dish might not show up again or at least for a while.. \n\nThe service was great every visit, lunch prices awesome, dinner prices average and the ambiance very comforting and a tad elegant the same time. Aside from the typical bench, table\/chair dining, they also got couches\/coffee table seating as well. *Most importantly*, Both Spaghetti entrees mentioned above deserve Much More than a 5 Star Praise!!!!! They Really Set A New Standard In My Book: On How Pasta Should Taste Like!!!!!
