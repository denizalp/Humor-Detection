HORRIBLE service!!! I just left after having a difficult time finding this location and the lady who is there right now has the WORST customer service! Didn't greet me and as soon as I finish my order she replies with a mean look on her face \"well just to let you know it's going to be a while till you get your order\" and I was trying to get this on my way to work so I ask how long. A while in my head is over 10 minutes and being told this in an attitude tone by this lady makes it even WORSE. I understand that she was alone but seriously it does not take a \"while\" to make smoothies and to nuke a wrap. Needles to say I left without any smoothie or wrap hungry and super disappointed in her customer service. \n\nWhoever is in charge of this location seriously needs to talk to the morning staff and get them up to date on BASIC customer service skills.
