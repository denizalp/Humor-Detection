Second visit and brought out of towner friends.  We had the 4 course and they had the 5 course Chef Tasting menu.  A-MAZ-ING!  Excellent service on July 3 - knowledgable, and witty.   Food was beautifully prepared and staff knew spot on wine\/beverage pairings for each course.  Remember to provide menu selection and let them know of any food allergies when making a reservation.  We live in Chandler and wish we were much closer to this restaurant.  We will be back during our next Scottsdale staycation.
