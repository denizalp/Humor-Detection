I have never thought to write a review for medical professionals and dentists in particular.  although the more work I have had over the years I have realized how helpful it could be to others who may be in a similar situation. \n\nI have had so much dental work done by less than scrupulous dentists in the past so when I came to deer valley smiles I was skeptical.  Dr Van is AMAZING.  as is the entire staff, I felt so taken care of.  I need to have some major bridge work done Dr Van explained that we didn't have to do ASAP and could keep an eye on it and wait if needed, that means so much.  If he just wanted to money he could have told me this was urgent I would not have a clue after all I am not a dentist.  The girls in the front office, cant remember their names, called my ins and were able to get me massive amounts of saved $$$ so I will be having my work done very soon.  The Dental assist was great as well he was kind enough to get a few bridge flosses for me as I haven't been able to find them at any stores recently\n\nI just wanted to share how I was treated, I would not hesitate to call this office and set up an appt.  I know it can be scary and is sometimes easier to hide from dental problems, but its not smart and trust me Dr Van will take care of you.  I almost hesitate sharing this as I don't want everyone calling and taking up all his appts.  \n\nOne last thing, yes their office isn't a spa like atmosphere but seriously its not a spa.  I want my spa at the W to be a Spa and my dentists to be a dentist.  I don't think having aromatherapy will make me want to go to you more, I would rather know my Dr is update on technology and education rather then the latest  facial techniques.
