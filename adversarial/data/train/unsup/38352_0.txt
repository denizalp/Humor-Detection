Juan's has the most amazing potato taco's I have ever had in my entire life.  Most of their food is downright spectacular.  Juan's is known as a hidden gem for local's.  The restaurant does not look like much, but inside grandmothers are making tortilla's, and everyone is happy to see you and serve you some of their authentic fare.  The ambiance makes you feel like you are in rural mexico.  The food makes you feel like you are in heaven.
