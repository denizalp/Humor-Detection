The Conservatory is a wonderful place to come and admire the handiwork of the botanical geniuses at the Bellagio.  A real Las Vegas gem that has nothing to do with gambling (other that it's inside a casino), I love to come here and see the themed flower displays as they change with whatever season or holiday is occurring.  Right now, the Conservatory is decorated for Chinese New Year.  A free offering for visitors and residents, the garden is fabulous for people-watching, too; folks from near and far ooh and ahh in the same language.
