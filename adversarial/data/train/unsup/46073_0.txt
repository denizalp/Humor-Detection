Awesome ramen!! Flavorful broth with beef and handpulled noodles that they make right in front of you! Only a couple of menu items where you choose the shape and size of your noodles. Service is quick and courteous. Great prices--$11.95 for a large bowl--I couldn't finish it!\nOnly negative is that it is stifling--no air movement which is very uncomfortable when you're eating hot soup.\nDefinitely will be back!
