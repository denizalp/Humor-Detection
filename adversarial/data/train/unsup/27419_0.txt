Would not recommend.  They towed my car after an accident and made it difficult and stressful to have it picked up by the company we wanted to fix it.  They demanded payment of over $600 before they would release the car even though we have car insurance and the insurance company would pay.  They dragged this out for days.  In addition to making this stressful event more stressful, they were extremely RUDE!  Won't be calling this company for their services and if the local police recommend or use them for situations like mine - reconsider because you are not doing a public service.
