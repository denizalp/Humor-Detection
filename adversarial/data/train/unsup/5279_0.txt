My first impression of the Aria Spa?  It felt like a glorified 24 Hour Fitness locker room. This impression was especially magnified after checking in, paying my entrance dues, and walking past the *enormous* glass-enclosed gym facility.\n\nMost of the apprehension melted away once I reached the spa itself, which is contemporary and airy -- in keeping with the general aesthetic of the Aria itself.  After entering and changing into a cozy robe and sandals, I had lots of space all to myself.  \n\nThe common areas of the Aria Spa have all the usual accoutrements.  Hot tubs?  Check.  Sauna?  Check.  Steam room?  Of course.  And let's not forget the abundant water bottles, juices, fresh fruit, and other goodies.\n\nNone of it was particularly soothing.  Unlike other Vegas spas, the wet areas of the Aria Spa feel very spare and utilitarian (again, more like a gym).  It also bothered me that it was very bright in there, which wasn't relaxing at all. \n\nOf course, the real reason I was there was to enjoy a 50-minute \"signature therapeutic massage\".  I'm not much of a massage connoisseur, but I really enjoyed this one.  The pressure was intense, but not uncomfortably so.  I felt like a nicely tenderized piece of meat when it was done, and I wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nA unique aspect of the Aria Spa is the coed outdoor patio and hot tub, with a panorama overlooking the sprawling Aria pool areas.  If the near-silence of the spa interior is just too much sensory deprivation for you to handle, just hop outside and enjoy the ooontz-ooontz-ooontz of Liquid Dayclub from a safe distance.  Don't forget your swimsuit, though, since the coed spaces -- unlike the interior areas of the spa -- are definitely *not* clothing-optional.\n\nAll in all, it was a fairly enjoyable few hours spent here!
