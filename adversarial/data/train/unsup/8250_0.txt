Comfort food, great service!\n\nFood:\nI ordered the Spinach and Feta pie, which is essentially a square Spanakopita. The flavor was great, the crust tasty and flaky. The only criticism would be the bottom crust was a bit tough, difficult to cut even with a sharp knife.\n\nI also ordered a side of Tomato Basil soup, and the portion was huge.  It was really creamy and nice, and tasted great! It was tomato-y as you'd expect, and the surprise was a strong peppery taste. I was disappointed that it was very salty though.\n\nCost:\nQuite reasonable: my pie and soup were only $10.79 with tax.\n\nService: \nThe owner, Steven, and his Mom were fantastic! Very friendly and eager to explain the menu.\n\nAtmosphere:\nClean, tidy, and small. Very small!\n\nOverall:\nSquarz has a really interesting menu. I'll definitely be back to try other things, but will try to avoid the salty choices.
