3.5 stars\n\nI read Pauline C.'s review about this place and I had to go to Studio B to check it out. \n\n$26 seafood dinner = awesome deal! \nPlus, guests may also enjoy beer and wine selections at no additional cost!! well there arent that many selections...they had 3 choices of wines and 2 choices of beers.\n\nThe food was okay. A lot of the fish was over cooked. The snow crab legs were a too salty, but i'm okay w\/ it..but for those who don't like salty food, you have been warned. They do have warm crab legs, so that's a plus, as well as asian style crab legs (sauteed w\/ ginger).\n\nThe oysters, scared me.. did not look appetizing at all. Didn't taste fresh either.\n\nThe cocktail shrimps - no thanks. not crunchy and they were smaller in since. \n\nSalmon - dried..overcooked\n\nBlack Cod was good\n\nClams were good and there were a lot of different styles of clams.\n\nSeafood selection where abundant but it can do better. However for the price that you're paying, can't complain!\n\nThe prime ribs were alright. \n\nDesserts were good! I also like their coffee bar - your choice of espresso, cappucino, lattes you can even have it w\/ a shot of Kahlua, bailey's, etc. \n\nAtmosphere, it was okay nothing special.. it's trendy. \n\nOh and yes, do prepare for long waits. \n\nThe only thing this place got it going for is that they offer free beer \/ wines. And if you sign up for their reward card, you can get $2 off of the buffet price each time you dine here. \n\nI'm not sure if I'll go out of my way and drive out here for their buffet.. i'd only come back to this buffet if i'm on my way driving into the strip or driving back home to LA..
