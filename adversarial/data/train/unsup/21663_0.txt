I love Sophi and her magic hands!  She is amazing!  She has such a positive attitude that you feel right away. She asks detailed questions to help get a better understanding of how she can better help you and he can adjust her routine to suit your massage needs.  I always feel nice and relaxed after a session with her.  She lets me know what exercise I can do at home to further help my back issues.  Her massage room is such a comfortable room - mood music, pillows, even an eye mask to fully relax.   Currently she only works 2 days a week and she has another RMT there to cover the rest of the days (I have never used the other RMT so I can't comment on that, however if Sophi picked her then I know she must be good).  I can't wait for my next appointment!
