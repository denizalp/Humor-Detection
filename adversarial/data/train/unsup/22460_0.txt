I first came here on a referral from my PCP for some questionable skin spots.  I became a regular because of the esthetician.  I wanted to give up going to salons for skin treatments because I had heard of a few horror stories so I was in search of a med spa, luckily Arizona Dermatology has an esthetician on staff.  This location is convenient for me, the pricing is reasonable, the staff is friendly and the office is clean.  No complaints = 5 stars!
