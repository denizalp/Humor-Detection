Kay, her brother, and I passed on Blue Grotto during  our Carson Street Pizza Gauntlet late last year due to absent-mindedness and from being just too damn stuffed from the other pies we consumed. Tonight, after arriving in South Side early to catch New Wave of British Heavy Metal legends (and primary influence on Metallica) Diamond Head in concert at Diesel across the street, I had time to kill and therefore an opportunity to tie up a loose culinary end. \n\nI ordered 2 slices of pizza; A Neopolitan (their 'New York' style pie) and a Bianca (their 'white' pizza). \n\nBoth cuts were mammoth in size, each possessing a hearty, chewy, exquisitely baked artisanal crust. The Neopolitan wins the duel however. The Bianca had terrific texture but was weak in flavor. The Neopolitan's cheese\/ sauce tandem was Hetfield and Ulrich; brilliance. The mozzarella was stretchy, oily, angelic, and the scarlet tomato gravy was absolute bloody luxury; attendants of God and Satan on a crust. \n\nAs far as the pricing goes, my 2 huge slices (one would have been plenty) and an orange Boylan soda cost me only $9!\n\nP.S. I shall return to sample their meatball and steak hoagies as they sound interesting. \n\nP.P.S. What an odd name for a pizza parlor. It ievokes the title of an imaginary old monster film: The Beast From The Blue Grotto. Roooar! Scary.
