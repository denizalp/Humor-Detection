It's hard to be a record store when most of us can just download what we want with a credit card and a few swipes on our smartphone. This is why Zia's newest location brings more cool merch than ever. \n\nUsed DVDs: Around $4 each, and a very good selection of movies you might have missed 5-10 years ago. \n\nVideo Games: For classic and current consoles. The selection *is* a bit weak for PS3, however, but you might find great deals on the used selection. \n\nVinyl: Very large aisle. I totally approve. \n\nMisc: Customizable T-Shirts pressed in-store!? Oh gosh, I can't wait to come back and use it. Looks awesome!\n\nOkay, the music selection isn't that shabby. I can't think of any bands that I wasn't able to find. They even had more obscure indie bands like Winter Gloves. I fully trust they know what they're doing. \n\nOf course, expect the usual awkward security experience...bags get handed to you at the door, and some 140-lb kid in an oversized security outfit will glare everyone down.
