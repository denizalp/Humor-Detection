Started off with the Beer Flight, which is a good value at $6.25, my fianc√© had a margarita that had no alcohol in it, so that received a ZERO VALUE for the $10.50 asking price.  She ordered a chopped salad and I ordered a Kobe beef hamburger. Both meals were very good, although the fries were served cold (well slightly warm but not hot) Our server was very good personable, helpful and attentive. I ordered a 20oz beer about halfway into the meal and it was about 2 oz under poured.  This is a personal pet peeve. Some will say \"its suppose to have that much head\" more than a half an inch for me is too much but that's just me.  Over all not a bad meal but not worth the $68 total price (including tip) So here is the breakdown \nIce tea - Ok\nMargarita - Crap\nFlight - good\nChopped Salad - Good\nKobe Burger - Good \nFries - Cold\n20 oz beer - under poured\n\nHappy hour prices were not honored on the patio. \n\nOver all.... Meh. We probably will not go back.
