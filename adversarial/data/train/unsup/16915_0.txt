Okay, where do Hawaii people go to as soon as they land in Vegas?  You guessed it, In-N-Out.  We ordered animal style on the burgers and fries and talk about yummy, this was a meal that totally satisfied our burger and fry craving.  My wife felt guilty after eating here saying, next meal, we need to eat some fresh green salad.  I told her, that's why we are on vacation right?  Forget the salad and eat on!
