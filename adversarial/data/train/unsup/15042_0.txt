This place is nice and clean, but it is not as described. It is not a foot massage place!  I went here last night for an intense foot massage. I scheduled my visit ahead of time and indicated I wanted an hour long foot massage. Well I received a 10 minute foot massage that was not intense along with some weird back rub. The rub really did nothing for me. I was so disappointed that I didn't want to tip, but did so because I felt it was the right thing to do. Therefore, if you want a good foot massage go elsewhere. If you just want an Asian to touch you go here.
