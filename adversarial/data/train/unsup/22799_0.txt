No joke...I'm addicted to the combo platter. The heaping portion of gyro meat and chopped grilled chicken is very satisfying to your hunger pains. Mix on the the rice, lettuce, diced tomato, and the Halal guys famous white sauce. Two packs of white sauce with half a packet of the TASTE BUD SEARING red sauce. Careful use sparingly or you will pay the price later.  \n\nThe falafel platter is amazing also. Beautiful crunch on the outside and a light green hue on the inside. YUM!  We had an order of fries which were fresh and made to order and seasoned proper.  \n\nThe seating area is somewhat small with 25 seats max. The line moves pretty fast during peak business so don't be discouraged if you have to wait a short while.\n\nEnjoy!
