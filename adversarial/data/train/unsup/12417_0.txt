Big nice room, BIG bathroom for a standard hotel room....had a huge seperate tub and then a seperate walk in shower....woo! Wear comfy shoes because the place is HUGE....walked my stupid feet off in high heel wedges...came home with blisters...but I was cute, right??\n\nCasino is pretty clean considering, it'sa casino and everyone smokes....but it wasn't terribly smoky. Lots of slots, my favorite being the Sex in the City machine! Won $500 on $20.....but then like everyone else does, my stupid ass put it back in the machine throughout the next 2 days and lost is all.\n\nSeveral nice restaurants and shops.....the conservatory garden is beautiful! Stop by the largest chocolate fountain.\n\nThe biggest attraction at the Bellagio is the fountains...gorgeous choreographed sprays to music...and its free to all. The 2nd attraction is in their theatre...the Cirque Du Soleil show \"O\". I have never seen anything so stunning...amazing music, acrobats, all in WATER!! I've seen a few other Cirque shows, but this one was the best by far.....and 7 rows from the front I had an amazing view of it all....yep, beeee jealous!!\n\nI can't tell you anymore about my experience because you know what they say about Vegas..........
