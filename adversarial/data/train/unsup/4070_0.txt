The remodeling was beautifully done. Five stars for ambiance and decor. Pittsburgh industrial mixed with new-Lawrenceville charm. They have a few bar stools on the sidewalk, which I always enjoy. I did not get a chance to experience the food, but the menu looks delicious! \n\nThe drink menu was expansively filled with delicious sounding drinks. However, I wouldn't know because the bartender decided to serve me only non-alcoholic beverages (without telling me, mind you) as he thought I was too drunk. It was my first bar of the night, and I was perfectly fine! So a. worst bartender ever and b. good luck having a bar survive that doesn't serve moderately drunk twenty-something year olds. \n\nBye, Roasted. I'll be across the street at Round Corner with the rest of the city.
