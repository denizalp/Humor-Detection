The restaurant was worth the 30 minute wait! But then again I went on a Tuesday when it wasn't insanely busy!\n\nI ordered a bacon cheeseburger with fries and it tasted pretty good but the portions were super huge I literally had to take the fries home with me because I couldn't finish it! My date ordered a burger on sourdough bread. He liked the burger but again like me he had to carry his leftovers home because it was super big!\n\nI ordered the red velvet cheesecake there and it tasted like heaven! It wasn't too sweet but it was very rich and tasty and like my entr√©e I had to take part of the cheesecake home because I found it really big on the average dessert but it still tasted good and I'm happy that I did have leftovers :)\n\n\nNevertheless I would come back for the cheesecake definitely I would like to try the other flavours eventually and maybe dine there again once it's not super busy :)
