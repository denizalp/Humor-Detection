I've been here twice, both times with groups. One time when we were the only people in the place.\n\nPros:\n- they're very accommodating about seating for groups and will happily move tables if you have more people. They're also great about splitting bills - everyone pays at the cash, easy!\n- the lentil soup is amazing (don't eat the crackers though - super stale)\n- the appetizers and desserts are a good price\n- good variety of vegan desserts (from sweets from the earth)\n- injera bread was good\n\nCons:\n- service is slooooow, which I don't understand as I'm pretty positive the food is all pre-made\n- I personally feel that the entrees are a bit overpriced for what you're getting. $7 instead of $10 would have been way more realistic, and given that the place is on dufferin and what it looks like inside (see next point), $5-6 would have been even more realistic\n- decor - ew. shabby looking place, lots of empty shelves everywhere, very very dimly lit (personally I HATE dim lighting), plastic table clothes with flyers underneath, overall just ugly and cheap looking.\n- vegan \"chicken\" was SUPER salty - ew\n\nPersonally, I will not return. I felt that maybe I just don't like ethiopian food, but my friend who is big into this cuisine assured me it was much much better at other restaurants. So, i'll give ethiopian one more chance, but at a different restaurant for sure.
