More like 3.5 stars.\n\nThings I liked:\nDecor\nRetro atmosphere\nCool round tables with nice seating\nScrambled eggs\n\nThings that did not impress me:\nThe pancakes.  Now granted, I ordered just plain pancakes, but I have had some amazing plain pancakes in my time, and these were not.  Flat and overcooked.  The flavor was pretty good, but they were not fluffy buttermilk, yummy pancakes.  I know they have all the fancy options with a bunch of toppings, but if you can't get the plain ones to be outstanding, then you are not winning me over.\n\nThe hash brown cake.  It looked adorable, but I did not care for it.  I like my ratio of fried to not fried a little higher.  Soft in the the middle, not crispy.  Did not care for the flavor\/seasoning on them either.  Just not my thing.\n\nThey did a nice job with customer service.  It was extremely busy and loud, but I expected that based on other reviews.\n\nIt's a cute place, but I think I will try other breakfast options that can make more impressive plain pancakes.
