I honestly haven't taken this flight but just passing by to see the ratings and why were there so many incidents or complaints with the Allegiant Airlines as well as all over the news spreading bout their delays, malfunction, and mechanical issues. I personally want to advise that you really pay what you get for. And you should save yourself headaches. I hate to say that if you rather risk your health flying this airline just to save a couple bucks then as might as well don't book the flight altogether. You should always want to book the flight at airlines that can provide you all the service you paid for. The one star I gave of course is the yelp rule but I still can see the good in this airline can maybe provide me. Which would be the only time I'll book this flight for someone (I don't really like) through misery flying this airline. Childish but hey this airline can make my day for a good comeback on a person I dislike.
