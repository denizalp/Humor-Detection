While the original Flower Child at 44th Street and Camelback is a regular in my restaurant rotation, I just recently made my way to this Scottsdale location...\n\nIt was just after 1pm and my friend and I had worked up an appetite at a mid-day yoga class.  We decided on Flower Child due to the location and the fact that we were both wanting something light and healthy... \n\nWe walked in to a pretty big line, but it moved fast, and we were able to order, get some iced tea \/ lemonade (one of my favorite things about this and every Flower Child) and have a seat within 10 minutes.\n\nOur food was delivered shortly after that, and it was as fresh and delicious as always... I had the Chopped Vegetable Salad (+ salmon), my friend had the Thai Cashew Quinoa Bowl.  We also shared a side of asparagus because who doesn't love asparagus?!\n\nYes... this Flower Child has the same menu as the others and yes, it's pretty pricey.  But, you get high quality, healthy food in a clean, casual environment, and all of the delicious iced-tea \/ lemonade refills you can handle!  Needless to say, I'm a big Flower Child fan!\n\nIf you haven't already, try their family style meals and kids meals too... They are a great healthy option compared to what you would usually order elsewhere when you don't feel like cooking!
