Rude management, rude corporate, dirty carpets and roaches & various bugs!!!\n\nOk so I had an unfortunate issue with the management staff before moving in.  Read my previous review for details. I moved in and there was chunks of dirt as well as grey carpet stains everywhere. I called Rachel the customer service representative who admitted to forgetting to call me back about my customer service issue the previous week, then to cover up her mistake she said customer service at the San Portella location isn't her priority because they are opening a new location. She transferred me to Priscilla who was much more on top of things and helpful.  Apparently Kenny, on the management team, never gave us a form for us to fill out regarding preexisting damages so we don't get charged when we move out.  \n\nWhen we moved in there was chunks of dirt, grey stains all over the carpet. We made several appointments with maintenance who never came. We have found cockroaches and crickets everywhere. Dirty tile, and sticky cabinets and countertops. \n\nHopefully, after talking to Priscilla she will follow through with pest control and carpet cleaning and not forget to call me back like the other customer service representative, Rachel.
