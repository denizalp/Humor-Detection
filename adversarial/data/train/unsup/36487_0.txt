I love there carne asada tacos and alpastor tacos. They are the best for this side of town and there prices are reasonable I believe they have a sale on Wednesday's too. Also good costumer service the lady there already recognizes us she super friendly. It's a nice little restaurant next to a gas station kind of an odd place but big enough has tables and chairs. Recommend the tacos  they also have tortas and burritos
