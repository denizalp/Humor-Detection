I never was a fan of breakfast sandwiches until I ate at Eggslut!\n\nFOOD: The Slut is a egg and potato puree dip with slices of bread. I honestly love it more than I thought I would. Their egg sandwiches are to die for because the egg literally melts in your mouth. I like to get my sandwiches with cheese and bacon! \n\nDRINK: They don't give out water cups, but you can buy their amazing fresh orange juice!\n\nATMOSPHERE: I absolutely love anything that The Cosmopolitan has to offer. It is great that they decided to have Eggslut in their casino. It is open at midnight on weekends and makes a perfect quick meal when you're out late. There is only high-top bar seating here and they run out of seats quickly so you can expect to stand and eat sometimes. The staff is always upbeat and kind. The chefs are extremely great at their jobs and I never see them make a sandwich without a smile on their face :)
