Let's pull this band-aid quickly: Cardinal Rule is gross and overpriced. Despite being a fairly dingy diner with unappetizing decor and staff, this restaurant could still be a worthy neighbourhood spot--if only the food wasn't essentially bullshit and totally overpriced. Don't even tell me about deep-frying macaroni and cheese and calling it a maki-and-cheese, or baking meatloaf in muffin tins and calling them... yes, meat muffins. Basically this restaurant is the food equivalent of white-girl dreadlocks in a jester's hat. Wouldn't we say the 2 cardinal rules of restaurants are: quality food at a fair price? This grimy gouger disobeys both.
