Wesley was the best mortgage broker my husband and I have ever dealt with. He was always there with us every step of the way. He showed patience and perseverance. He always  responded to every little detail of our inquiries and always communicated with us and always made himself available despite his busy schedule. Given a chance, we are looking forward to doing business with him again and will gladly recommend him to friends and relatives. People like WES deserves a highest rating among brokers.
