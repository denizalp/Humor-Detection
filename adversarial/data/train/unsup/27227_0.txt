I placed my order and observed the cook put down his phone and began to prepare my meal WITHOUT washing his hands and WITHOUT putting on gloves. The woman who took my order and received my payment at the register went into the kitchen, she DID NOT wash her hands DID NOT PUT ON GLOVES and proceeded to use her bare hands pat down the chicken to make it fit into the container. This same woman then scratched her head and continue to pour sweet and sour sauce into a container and place the spring roll with her bare hand into the container.  I informed the woman that I would like to speak to a manager, she demanded to know why and I stated my observations on their hygiene. The woman came up to me and put her hands in front of my face and asked me to smell them, that her hands are clean and that I paid with a card and not cash so her hands were clean. I asked for my money back and she refused, she said she was the manager and that the food was \"as is\" and if I did not want it then I could throw it away. I walked out of that establishment without the food or my money back. I will not return to this restaurant.
