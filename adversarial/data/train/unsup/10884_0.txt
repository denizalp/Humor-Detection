BOOOOO! They ruined my dogs hair. Scalped him and he wasn't even matted. So unhappy I cant even tell you. The first time I went there it wasn't bad but the second time I went - well, let me put it to you this way, someone thought my dog was a poodle and he is a havanese. He was so pissed off because he knew his hair looked horrible. They were NOT even close!!!!!!! Don't go here and it smells. Plus, it is expensive.
