Prices are deceiving at Midas and they always try and ridiculously up-sell you.  I had a similar experience with the coupon at Midas as Jeff Y.  I should have listened to the reviews and not gone to this location, but it was on my way to work.  \n\nI ended up spending more on an oil change than I ever have before.  I even had a coupon; my dealership is even cheaper than them!  I know most places always add on disposal charges, but they added on about 5 more charges making the oil change cost $14 more than the coupon I brought in.  They told me it was because I need premium products...uhhh, I drive a freaking domestic made, Jeep with a V6 engine WTF!\n\nThe only reason they received 2 stars was because my car wasn't sabotaged, I guess they did their job (as far as I know), and the customer service was alright (meaning the guy at the desk was semi-pleasant, but mostly had many excuses).  \n\nTo make things worse, they were out of coffee in the waiting area, so I had to sit there and watch Kendra on TV without coffee for an hour this morning.  Maybe this was all just a bad nightmare!\n\nAvoid this place like the plague.
