That might be the last time I use the YELP search to try and satisfy my sweet tooth... No ring pops or bottle caps here folks!!! But since I was already there I decided to stop in and much to my surprise there was a solid vending machine next to the restrooms.. The $5 cover seemed a little steep just to peruse the vending machine selection... The young ladies working  the establishment seemed to be enjoying the surroundings.. A dimly lit ambiance in which to enjoy a \"Big Hunk.\" Music bumping, fists pumping, and scantily clad women swinging around the red vines flashing their skittles around freely for the taking. Decided to leave a short time afterwards, before I was tempted to get a Milky Way. Top notch establishment, will visit again! Probably going to need another dentist visit after satisfying that sweet tooth.
