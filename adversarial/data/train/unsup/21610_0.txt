Just ask for Brian M! \n\nToday was day #1 of my new car search. Ryan and I stopped by few (3) dealerships in the Phoenix \/ Scottsdale area. By far, Brian(Audi Scottsdale) was the best.\n\nQuite frankly, I had my mind set on a Volvo XC60, which we test drove earlier in the day. When we stopped in at Audi afterwards, we were blown away by the customer service from Brian! He's amazing and we will send people here just to get the same service!\n\nBrian was wonderful at explaining advantages and disadvantages of the Audi Q5 vs other Audi models as well as other makes. He was very easy to talk to and we did not feel pressured at all. Brian also told us  what he likes and dislikes about competing makes. He seemed very genuine and sincere in his effort to help us. He's the opposite of what everyone hates about car sales people! He's awesome! \n\nAfter our test drive, we stopped by Lexus(across the street) and did not receive nearly as good service! Although this decision has to come down to the suv that's best for me, Brian has made a huge impact in the decision making process!\n\nIn the rare chance that I do not decide to go with the Audi Q5, I'd still recommend Brian and Audi Scottsdale to everyone we know!\n\nBrian has been here for 14+ years! You can't ask for more expertise without sacrificing service!
