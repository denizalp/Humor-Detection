Just another new breakfast \/ lunch spot in the Vegas Valley. Of course, it's close to my old condo so i had to give it a try. \n\nAte there twice for breakfast while i was making the move - place was hoppin' ( it's in an industrial park area - most of the customers were workers in the area ) \n\ndecent $2.95 breakfast - the usual 2 eggs, potatoes toast, bacon\/sausage\/ham. Also tried their version of the grand slam - cost $5.95. \n\nif in the area and need a quick bite at reasonable prices, i recommend. Go out of your way for a special breakfast\/lunch ? not the place. \n\nhappy eating !
