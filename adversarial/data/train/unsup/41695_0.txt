First time today. It was great atmoshpere , color and decor was great very appealing. Seating was great it had high back chairs low seating chairs tables inside and outside in patio. Little and large water falls made you sense of calm. Music was cool pop music nothing that made your hair stand up. Even had area for lap top! Coffee very excellent! I'm taking my friend and show her!
