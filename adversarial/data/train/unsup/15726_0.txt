Ok, so if you are coming here for service with a smile, a warm hug and an inviting atmosphere...keep on driving. If you are coming here for excellent Mexican food at a reasonable price with huge portions - this is the place! We don't live in Gilbert, in fact we don't even live close to Gilbert - we are in the very far north valley and will drive 45 minutes to eat this delicious food!\n\nThe services leaves a little to be desired and the store front is very basic and small, but there is plenty of outdoor seating. The burritos are excellent, enchiladas delicious (plenty of cheese), both red and green are good, stuffed sopaipilla was out of this world. My two year olds quesadilla was one of the best I have ever had. Oh and the cinnamon sugar chips....mmmmmazing. Sure, your blood sugar might go into the high 300s, but they are totally worth it - warm, crispy, sweet goodness. All four of us ate with drinks and desert for less than $30 - you just can't beat it.
