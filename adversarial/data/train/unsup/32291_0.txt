I have celiac. Having celiac makes it difficult to eat out. When I found out about this place I had to try it. So glad I did. The staff was extra friendly and the food was great. So nice to be able to have fried chicken wings and hoagies again. The cleanest pizza shop I have ever been to. Even the bathrooms were clean! We will be going back.
