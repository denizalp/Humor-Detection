Ok, this place is great! It's clean, quiet and located in a nice area. The place is small but I like the feel of it. It doesn't feel too commercialized like those other foot spas on Spring Mountain. The best part, Brian, my masseuse was just awesome! He gave enough pressure where needed (my back) and gentler on other areas (neck). Love the hot stone and how he put it on the middle of my back. \n\nMy husband and I got the deluxe package and it was totally worth it.  He forgot to ask his masseuse's name but he said he liked his massage too as she was able to work on the kinks on his back. \n\nWe will definitely be back! BTW, they gave us water and snacks too; a definite plus!
