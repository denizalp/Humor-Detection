I rate this 5 instead of 4 because it's just a fun experience. I came here to look at some fun novelty sodas for my nieces (because I am the COOLEST AUNT EVER) and left with multiple cases of soda to try, many just for us. The store itself is just fun and quirky. The tin signs on the wall are amusing, the flavors of soda are overwhelming (who knew how many types of root beer were available, and chicken wing? really?) The candy selection is fun, but not really the center focus. I would also like to note that the staff was seriously nice. Very helpful, super friendly, and inviting. A great little stop every so often to release the inner kid in you without making the trip to Disneyland.
