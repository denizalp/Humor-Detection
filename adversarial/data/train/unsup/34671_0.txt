This place has a really unique idea with the way they make their icecream\/frozen yogurt. I really enjoyed all of the options they had. The girl who made our ice cream explained everything well and the ice cream came out great. I love all their options and the employee favorites board had some great ideas for combinations. I already have a few different ideas for next time. I'm not sure about other reviews mentioning that the place was dirty or service not great as our experience was completely opposite. I would say that the texture of the ice cream is different but I enjoyed it. I'm sure this has more to do with the freezing process then anything else. It's definitely worth a stop by.
