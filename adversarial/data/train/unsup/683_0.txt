***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 79\/100***\n\nTo me, it's always exciting when empty lots are converted to make shift fun areas be it in a form of state fairs or all sorts of festivals throughout the year. Stu Millers Pumpkin patch is no exception to this. There's something about pumpkins that just makes you smile, whatever your reasons may be. It might be because it signals the beginning of the holidays or maybe because it makes you think about Cinderella and it whisks you to a magical fantasy world. There are tons of them here, and they come in varying sizes and priced accordingly.\n\nThey also offer a petting zoo, bungee jump, mechanical rides, games and of course those giant inflatable slides that are oh so fun and brings out the child in you. It is free to get in, you just need to purchase tickets for the various activities inside. Tickets are $1 each, a pack of 20 for $19 and a pack of 40 for $37 most activities require between 1 to 3 tickets with the exception of bungee jump which asks for 9. I believe they offer food and drinks as well but I didn't see any signs of the menu, we brought our boba drinks with us so I didn't even bother. \n\nThey're open 7 days a week. The employees are really nice, personable and very engaging towards the kids which is refreshing to see. We were also told tickets don't expire so that's a plus! Though it is not loaded with bells and whistles, it is a great place to spend a couple of hours with your family and let the kids run amok. In a world full of technology and frivolous activities, it's nice to see places like this that's simple and basic yet invokes happiness and warms you all over.
