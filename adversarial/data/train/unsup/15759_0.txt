Why, O why, would anyone fall for the \"specials\" and \"deals\" that are not so special and really not a deal? I'm asking this rhetorically, but will answer anyway...\n\nWait! Better yet! I will tell you the alternative that will save you aggravation, time, and money. Go down the street to Best Buy and get a much better deal on a phone and then go back ( but to another location ) and get or continue service. Viola!\n\nService is lacksadasical at best, ho hum most of the time, and non-existent the rest of the time. I really do like the wtf, deer-in-the-headlight look when you tell them exactly what you are looking for and there is no wiggle room for upsell. Can you hear me now?
