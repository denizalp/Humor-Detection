A very homey place. The chef came out and personally recommended some dishes, and told us that they could cook anything not on the menu for you if you brought the ingredients or ordered in advanced. \n\nWe ordered the meat pies that were highly reviewed, the potstickers, and the beef stew noodles. The meat pies were on the salty and oily side. The potstickers had a savory filling, but the outside was not pan fried long enough so there was no crunch. The beef stew noodles featured a very rich broth with hints of star anise. \n\nI personally would skip the meat pies\/potstickers and order dumplings with beef noodles next time. I'd recommend this place if you're looking for authentic northern Asian food in Tempe!
