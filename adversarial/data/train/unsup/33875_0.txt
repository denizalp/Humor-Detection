I've been here many times over the past few years.  I've consistently been satisfied with their hamburgers and appetizers, especially the hamburger.  Today I had a NY strip steak meal. It was really good.  Good cut of steak, cooked to perfection and nicely seasoned.  I've always enjoyed the staff here.  And I love the music they play and watching the music videos on big screen.  A fun place to visit overall.  Keep in mind that it's not 5-star dining but food is tasty and a fun experience.  Oh, if you go during a dead time, like during working hours, you can park right behind the cafe and take shuttle in front of Hard Rock Cafe or Hard Rock Hotel to the strip if you want---very convenient. AND IF YOU CHECK-IN ON YELP, A COUPON FOR 20% off food only will appear on your phone and show it to your waiter.  So my meal was really $22-ish instead of $27.  I added a side-salad for $3.50 --- healthy portions.
