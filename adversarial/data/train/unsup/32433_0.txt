I feel bad for the people who work here because the lights flicker creepily every few minutes...spaced out just long enough to forget.  It really gives this place a haunted mansion vibe and think I would probably go insane if I had to spend more than 2 hours here. I am genuinely confused by the 1 foot tall shelf\/floor space used to store vinegar, sriracha, and other sauces -seems kind of gross but maybe I'm just too picky??? The best part about this place was our waiter.  Imagine if Stinky from Hey Arnold grew up as a real human being and has the deepest voice ever. I'm talking about like whatever the opposite of a dog whistle is deep- the kind of low pitched sound that will make you crap your pants if you aren't careful.  Great service is the only reason this isn't a 1 star review. He was polite, attentive, and helped explain the difference between the \"holiday mule\" and \"apple pie mule\" (the holiday mule has a sugar rim).  I had an IPA that was pretty good.
