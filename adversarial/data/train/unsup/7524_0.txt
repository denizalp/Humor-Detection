I've been coming up to this site for many, many years - back when Pacific Mall was still Cullen Barns. How many of you remember that? Over the years P-Mall has essentially stayed the same. It's a booth-style mall specializing in all things \"Asian.\" Although most shops take credit cards now, it is wise to bring cash. Most times you can bargain a bit and pay the \"sticker price\" (i.e. no tax) if you pay cash.\n\nDO NOT come early as none of the independently owned shops open before noon, and most close up around 8pm. If you come on a weekend be prepared to fight with some feisty Asian woman driving a Honda Civic with stuffed animals lined up in her rear windshield for a parking spot! It gets really crowded really fast.\n\nWalk along the west side for electronics, games & consoles and DVD's, lots of clothing and accessories stores in the middle - and if the items start to look similar after a while it's because most of them own each other. I found this out by trying to pay with a credit card at one store, and they sent me down a couple of booths to their sister store to use their credit card machine! There are lots of places for good take-out bubble tea and there are lots of food options upstairs.\n\nCanada Computers is a good place to check out if you are looking for computer parts, cables, etc.  My favourite thing in this mall is Mosaic jewelery store, since I can't fit into Asian sized clothes or shoes (*sigh*), I don't buy bootleg bags, DVD's or toys (yes, there are bootleg toys...Kello Hitty anyone?). \n\ni've recently learned that there is a Beard Papa location in this mall, so I may just have to pop buy sometime soon!
