Linda W speaks the truth!  Friendly faces greet you as you walk in the door.  First sign of a good business.  Second sign of a good business.  Good food and drink!  I received both tonight.  Cha ching!\n\nI asked our new BFF, Bartender Rich, what his favorite dish was.  \"Everything\" was the answer.  You've been trained well, Rich.  I finally got it out of him that he REALLY dug the Shepard's Pie.  I'm not one to go for that choice, but I figured, let's through caution to the wind!\n\nI guess from not having a Shepard's Pie that much I figured it would be like a Stouffer's chicken pot pie out of the fridge.  Don't hold it against me, I didn't know!  What I received was a hearty bowl full of rich short rib meat, carrots and the most delectable topping of potato's I've ever tasted.  I scrapped that top clean like it was my job!  It was really incredible!  It really would have been big enough to share between two people.  But if I was sharing with you, I would have stolen the potato topping, so beware!\n\nThe atmosphere is really cozy, with all wooden furniture and bar.  I like places that have a nice sectioned off dinning area to sit down and enjoy a meal.  Then you cross over to the bar side and can grab a drink with friends and maybe drop it down low if you need to dance it out!\n\nI checked on their FB page and it says they'll be having a DJ Friday and Saturday night, which I think would add that great dance party mix to the place.  But my fav news is they'll be serving a Sunday Champagne brunch.  Who doesn't love a good Sunday brunch....or champagne!?  I'll be back to indulge in both!
