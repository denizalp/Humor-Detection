I really wanted to have one of these five star experiences, but I didn't and that's disappointing. The whole point of hiring professionals is to avoid broken and missing things but we got it anyways. The broken stuff I've fixed and gotten over, but I still don't have the glass top to my table. How do you lose that? I've called three times and no one knows and they'll \"figure it out\" but it's been two months and nothing. So, does anyone know of a great place to get replacement glass for a round table top?\n\n\n\nMarilee, you have been the only nice and helpful person I've spoken to there, and out of all the times I've called, I've only spoken with you once. The movers did call me about the missing glass, but only said \"I dunno what to do I'll have her call you back\", then I've heard nothing. We also STILL have you guy's moving blankets at our house too, which I also told the guys on the phone. I really don't appreciate you saying I'm bullying your business when I've tried to be patient and fair. Perhaps YOU are the only one striving for the five star experience.\n\nSee, you truly are so nice and helpful!!! Wish everyone there was as amazing as you! We will be in touch!
