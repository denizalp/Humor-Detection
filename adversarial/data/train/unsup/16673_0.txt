Ha! Luxury my butt. So I came here with my mom for a little pampering... I started out soaking, before my pedicure in lukewarm water. Ok lame but whatever, I'm not a complainer(usually) while my toes were being painted a lady was attempting to do my nails. I had to hold my arms out across my body for her to reach, it was so uncomfortable and not relaxing in the least. she did a crap job. Uneven lengths, not strait, messy polish. I was pissed. I said nicely \"could you please fix this\" she acted like she didn't knew what I was talking about. I pointed out all the spots that were messed up and asked nicely. She then started arguing with me. Hell no! I held my ground and the manager came over, acknowledged the crap job and ushered me to a proper seat where he \"fixed\" my manicure. His attempt was admirable, I was just ready to go at this point. As I was finished i hear my mom \"you've got to be kidding me\" I walk over to find nail polish all smeared up her arm. She was getting a gel mani and the guy forgot to dry her last coat before the hand massage. Ha! What can you do but laugh. This place is a joke. Save your time and money.
