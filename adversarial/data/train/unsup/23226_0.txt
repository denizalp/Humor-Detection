I think my review might be biased.\n\nI used to adore Mint Cafe and while High Thai'd is very much like Mint Cafe, I feel something is missing.  The decor is similar, the tables are all in the same places, the workers are the same, the food is even ALMOST the same. Yet, I wasn't in love. My old regular, Pineapple Chicken, was a little soupier, rather than having a thick sauce, but it was still tasty. The service was still great. \n\nMy main issue is the name. I don't mean to sound awful or critical, but the name is a bit cheesy. And by a bit cheesy, I mean that apostrophe is totally inappropriate! A large portion of this complaint is in jest, but, for real: it bothers me.
