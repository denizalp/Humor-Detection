Kitchen drain stopped up at 2 pm on a Saturday afternoon. Struggled with it for a few hours. Called three plumbers, no help until Monday. Called Access, they said: \"I'll check on the status of the on-call plumber.\" Ten minutes later Tyson called and said: \"I'll be there after I finish dinner.\" After half an hour Tyson showed up, snaked the kitchen drain, reassembled the pipes better than they were originally and was gone. Excellent service, great technician. We'll be using Access Group in the future.
