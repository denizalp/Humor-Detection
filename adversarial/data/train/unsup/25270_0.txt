Last week,I visited and appreciated this small art museum's excellent collection of Late Medieval,Renaissance,and Baroque period paintings.I saw fine Italian paintings by Bernardo Daddi,Giovanni Di Paolo,Rainaldo di Rainuccio da Spoleto(great use of silver leaf by 13th Century painter),Francesco Melzi,Luca Giordano,Francesco di Vannuccio(\"Saint Catherine\"),among others.I saw fine Northern European paintings by Jan Steen,Peter Paul Rubens,Jean Demarne(\"Seine at Saint Cloud\"-my favorite),Hubert Robert,and Maurice Quentin de la Tour,among others.I also liked its special exhibit of drawings by Jacque Callot..Admission to this art museum is free,but donations help this museum maintain its high standards.
