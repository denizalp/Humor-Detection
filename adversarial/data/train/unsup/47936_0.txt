Just went hear today! \n\nBoth Summer and hygienist were super friendly, helpful, professional. Quick to show you the break down of payments, quick to assess your teeth and gum health. \n\nI had gone for a cleaning but will go back for that, I had a need for removing of bacteria around the gums and not only was the operation done swiftly but it was explained very well so I knew what was happening every step of the way.\n\nI look forward to my cleaning, and to walk into one of the most state of the art, and clean offices I've seen. \n\nI would highly recommend Imagine Dental to everyone and anyone who is in need of some dental services!
