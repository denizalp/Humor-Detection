One of the few fast food options in this area- open until at least midnight, quick fix for a grilled or crispy chicken salad in the late hours, which is all I use it for. Staff is young and competent but barely.\n\nHave never had an issue with the freshness of the produce in my salads here, nor the freshness of the crispy chicken atop. Sometimes I'll cancel out the healthiness of my salad by ordering whatever their featured fry is- bacon ranch, buffalo bleu, it changes with their promoted burgers and they're usually oversalted but that doesn't deter me.\n\nMy last visit, the cashier disappeared with my card to the back of the store to run it, which I was not particularly comfortable with, nor was I given a reason as to why. I was also not given any receipt of any sort. Bank statement reflects correct charge, but considering how prevalent CC theft is in food service, I'm not coming here again.
