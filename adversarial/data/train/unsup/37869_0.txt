Had such a positive experience at this Noodles & Co. today. Holidays got me exhausted and I really just wanted someone else to cook a meal for me. I placed my order for myself and my wife and daughter for takeout, got the bag, and when I walked out to my car and opened up the car door my bag ripped and I lost everything to the ground. The bag rip was user error (I wasn't holding it from the bottom line I should have been and the top of the bag tore away). I went back in with the remnants, not really knowing what the staff could do for me... not only did they rush a new order for me, but I didn't have to pay for the new order. I am so grateful for the staff at this Noodles & Co. for their understanding and generosity. I'm sure this may have furrowed a few brows behind the counter - understandably so - but they were very nice to me and provided me with a great meal. Thank you!
