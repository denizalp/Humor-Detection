Thirsbusters Make Me Thirsty\nBy The Rue\n\nUltra Star or Ultra Lux, \nThe attire here is casual,\nBut you can wear a tux.\n\nI saw my movie in the DBox,\nI really wish I could say,\nThat the experience rocked.\n\nMotion seats were kind of cool,\nThe price is way to high,\nIf I did it again I'd be a fool. \n\nHere you can adjust your seat,\nTurn it on or turn it off,\nDon't get caught beating your meat.\n\nI got a bag of butter popcorn,\nThe top quarter was fresh,\nDon't come expecting to see porn.\n\nLike simliar theaters there is a cafe,\nYou can get food, wine and beer,\nBut for $7.50 a beer it ruined my day.\n\nIf you have to be drunk to watch a flick,\nBring a 40 oz. malt liquor with you,\nAnd down it in the parking lot real quick.\n\nAlchy
