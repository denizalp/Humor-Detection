The beer is good. The food is ok. I went to have a drink with a friend. We sat in the bar and started playing table shuffleboard-again in the bar. Two little kids came over from the restaurant side and wanted to play. We told them no and that kids aren't allowed in the bet area. They came back again and we told them no again at which point they went back to their mother and said we were mean and she started yelling. At this point there are so many things wrong with this situation. First ITS A BAR! you shouldn't want your kids playing with \"mean people\" in bars or in a bar period. The worst part is that at no time did a manager come over or anyone to rectify the situation. One of the waitresses told the kids it was ok for them to play , the bartender said no an argument ensued with no manager in sight and no offer to make things right. What the hell? If you want to drink and relax like an adult go somewhere else
