Back in 2011 I was working for the US Forest Service at the Tanker Base out at Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport and had to find a place to stay.  A few of my fellow aerial firefighters suggested this hotel.  I was glad I did.  The rooms were great, everything that I needed to shop was nearby, and the staff was great.  I stayed there for three months.
