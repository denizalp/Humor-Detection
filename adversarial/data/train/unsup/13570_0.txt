Do you like feeling claustrophobic? Do you enjoy waiting  35 minutes in line to get a drink at the bar? Do you get a thrill being surrounded by cigarette smoke? Do you love overpaying for bad drinks? If so, Omnia is your place. \nI'm not into clubs whatsoever.  I've passed my expiration date with all of them, however- because I have a moderate to severe obsession with Calvin Harris, I had to jump on the opportunity to see him DJ. Was it worth it to see him perform? Yes! Especially because he was so close to us and because he kills it with his music. \n\nNow, for the commentary on the club....you know it's bad when you are compacted into one designated area and you can smell the breath of the person on your right and you can feel the sweat of the person to your left. It was so bad just trying to maneuver our way through the lines (just to use the bathroom) that people were fighting and screaming \"hunger games.\" We were so confined that I squished a guy that was 5'2 into the wall. Considering I'm 5'9, he's lucky that he still had a pulse. Let's put it this way, if there was any type of disaster at this club, everyone would be royally screwed. The only positive thing that I will say about our visit is that there were a lot more couples than single people running around. This was probably because of Calvin Harris (he works miracles). Any other night, I'm sure it's filled with thirsty men and women just waiting to catch an STD. \n\nWe were lucky to have a table, but if you don't have one, my suggestion is to go elsewhere or wear body armor.\nWould I go back to this club or any other club again? Only for Calvin Harris.....Only for Calvin Harris.\nP.S. Mr. Harris went on stage around 1:00 AM.
