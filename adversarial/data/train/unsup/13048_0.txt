The one on sunset is was better than this one. I used to come here a lot because the juices were decent and very cheap. But they're hardware is a tad overpriced compared to other shops.\n\nThe first time I walked into here, there was a girl that helped me out and she was so nice. This was before the FDA regulation and they made the juice in front of you. I ordered a juice I forget which one but it was supposed to be a fruity one. Well I don't think she rinsed out the syringe cause the juice literally tasted like cinnamon and butterscotch and I hate custard juices and thats what it tasted like lol. But its okay cause she was nice.\n\nSo I go in a couple weeks ago and they had the music BLASTED super loud and it was some heavy metal shit and the kid turns it down and I said \"oh you didn't have to turn it down.\" And this stupid punk stoner kid said \"I know I didn't have to.\" Um. Okay. Bitch. So I just stopped going to this location. And stuck with the sunset one(Fitz? Chris? Sorry forgot your name buddy, but you're the only reason why I still give this shop a chance. Thank you for being so nice. On the other hand. Please check your employees at the Maryland location and order a background and IQ test before hiring imbeciles).\n\nPS-pink elephant is my favorite flavor from here. Tastes like a pink starburst but just a tad sweeter. My all time favorite. Juice sizes only come in 50ml or 100ml. And they range from $12.99-$18.99.
