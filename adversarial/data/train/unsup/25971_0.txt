I've been to a few reception halls for weddings but this location seems a bit congested\/busy - with three ongoing weddings during the time (on 2 floors) of my attendance. The walls were thin -so we could hear the music overpowering from the other rooms. Lighting was not ideal for pictures because of a neon glare and dim light. Located in St- Leonard, the venue had plenty of private parking -although there was construction ongoing in the area.  I appreciated they had an elevator accessible for people in need.
