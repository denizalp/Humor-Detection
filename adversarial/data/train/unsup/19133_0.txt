I don't get why this place gets such high marks. \n\nQuick and to the point. The location in the Gramercy is nice, but just the fact that it in a very nice and well put together style courtyard with plenty of outside seating and lighting. The actual dining room looks like a mess with tacky graffiti on the walls, a chain link fence in the middle of the dining room for no reason, and a ridiculous looking fake taco truck that really is just taking up space. The food is also nothing to really drive me back to this place. I tried the roasted vegetable burrito, only to have it be 80% filled with coleslaw. I have also tried the tacos and although they aren't horrible, i have certainly have had better on the side of the road out of a taco stand for half the price. I felt like i wasted my money eating here.
