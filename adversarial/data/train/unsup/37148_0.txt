I have never worked with a more disrespectful and unprofessional company than this company. The contractor showed up and could not find anything wrong with out unit even though it was leaking water all over the floor. After we pointed out the problem to him, he wrote up a work order that was very vague.  Before he left my house, I was told that someone would get back to me within a couple of days with updates on what will be fixed. I just heard back today after almost two weeks. I called to ask for an update, only to be told that calling would slow down the process and that I should refrain from doing so. Maybe if they had communicated effectively this issue would not have happened. I am still without a working air conditioner and am going to request services elsewhere.
