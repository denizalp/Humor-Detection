I have been a customer at AAA Alarm for 6 years. My alarm system works off my home phone landline. About 6 months ago, I called to have my system upgraded to a wireless service. The secretary told me that I would receive a call back the next day for the upgrade. No one ever called. Recently AAA Alarm changed their monitoring service. Even though I have set off my alarm accidentally several times, NO ONE FROM THE MONITORING SERVICE HAS EVER CALLED ME OR THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. When I have had conversations with the monitoring company, representatives have been extremely RUDE. I called AAA Alarm and complained as well.\n\nNever sign a contract with this company. Their contracts automatically renew and they will not let you out of the contract. Auto renew contracts have been banned in numerous states just because of situations like this. Because I am unhappy with the monitoring company and AAA Alarm, they will not allow me out of their contract. I am being forced to pay for 9 months of service that I will not use. I have already switched to another company. There's only one thing that I can say about this company.....avoid it.
