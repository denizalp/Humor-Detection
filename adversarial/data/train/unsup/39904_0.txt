The service is fair to good (more toward fair), but the ambiance and cute, unique menu options make this place a keeper.  Try to avoid going when they're busy because the place is small and it can be tough to find a place to sit plus it gets quite loud.  Prices are decent for what you get.  Don't get the skinny drinks - they're terrible.  Either drink club soda or stick to just one of the real thing.
