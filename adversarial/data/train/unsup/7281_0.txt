Having tried just about every dim sum place in town, there's no doubt I had to try this place out. I did hold some type of expectation for this place as this is a sister restaurant of the one on Jones (but this location serves dim sum). \n\nOverall, I would say this place has potential. \n\nSERVICE; 4\/5\nCame in on a late Monday afternoon, after the lunch rush. Not packed, but not empty either. We did run into a problem with not being asked what tea we wanted (one of the first things they ask you when you are seated), and we notified them after sitting around. They were sincerely apologetic, and I was surprised because most dim sum places wouldn't think twice about it. The ladies pushing the cart were also friendly. Didn't give us that \"whatever\" attitude. At one point, we finished all our food and no more carts were pushed out. Again, sat around then flagged someone down. Service was great as they were also apologetic, and the guy offered to bring over the dishes we wanted. \n\nENVIRONMENT; 2\/5\nI definitely think they could work on how the place looks. Maybe they are still in the process of decorating since they are new? I felt like I was eating in a prison room as there were nothing on the walls at all. Oh well...I am here for the food.\n\nFOOD; 3.5\/5\nUnfortunately, I realized that I did not get to try more of what they had to offer which is why I'm docking off stars. Maybe because we came after peak lunch hours, but still disappointing. They should've been prepared.  I heard good things about their flowing custard bun (lau sa bao), but they said they were out. Wanted to try as it is one of my favorites, and good ones are nonexistent in Vegas. They apparently have soup dumplings too (xiao long bao) but none were available.\n\nShrimp dumplings (ha gow), rice noodle roll (cheung fan), and egg tarts (dan tat) were very good. Shrimp dumplings were juicy and loved the soy sauce they use for their rice noodle roll though I'll admit that noodle was not as silky as I would have wanted it. I would say that their egg tarts are more true to Hong Kong style aka flaky crust!
