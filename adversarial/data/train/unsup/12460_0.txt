Lets see where to start... So I was going to purchase a Camry for my elderly parents who still live in the Cleveland area and came here to look at cars. My parents seemed to like the standard 2013 camry model so I went online and looked up the true value of the car, and what a good price would be. There was also a website or app that allowed you to input your information and then other dealerships in the area would call you if you liked the price. So I did that and knew what price I wanted to pay so I started haggling with the sales guy regarding the price. He kept telling me that he would not give it to me for $21,000.00 even though I had a print out from another dealership that was maybe 20 minutes away that did have it. He told me to go there and if they sold it that I should get it and acted like a complete pompous you know what when talking down to me. I believe his exact words were \"yeah if you can get that car I will personally eat my clipboard\".  He looked at the price and said the other dealership's MSRP was messed up and they wouoldnt sell it to me.\n\nI went to the other dealership and they gave it to me for even cheaper after some bargaining, and it was the same exact model and color and brand new. I actually called the original sales guy from the Toyota of Bedford place and told him I got the car, and said I was driving down there to watch him eat his clip board and could show him my invoice.\n\nBottom Line: Avoid this dealership like the plague, I went to another dealership in Cleveland Heights and not only got a better deal but was not treated like garbage.
