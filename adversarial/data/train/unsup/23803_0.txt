They treat customers as garbage!!!! They don't take any responsibilities at all!! \n\nAll their chefs are temporarily trained! It directly leads to the extremely unstable food issues. I had been ordered food from them twice, and the soup was very salty. When they found food quality issues, they did nothing but to post \"Sorry\" on Wechat. Once, they posted \"sorry about today's food\" again, I couldn't help myself to reply to the post. Then they replied to me rudely that they couldn't find any past orders from me so that they believed that I am a indiscriminate person! How could they possibly not find the history orders if they really managed history orders well?! They did send one message to me privately right after they replied to me on the post, they asked when I ordered, however, before I could have replied to them, they added me to the BLACK LIST!!
