Used to be my go-to place for sushi but I've had so many bad experiences, especially at dinner that I just cant' stand it anymore.  I always gave them a pass because they were so close to my house.\n\nHere's my list of gripes:\n\n-Sushi is not the freshest in town in comparison to other AYCE.  I had some  Spanish mackerel that literally I had to spit out.\n-Service is horrendous, especially for dinner when they are swamped with customers.\n-Most of the non-fish dishes are greasy and badly cooked.\n\nI suppose they are good because they are so huge they have a lot of variety.  But who cares when it doesn't taste good.
