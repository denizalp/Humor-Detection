I really cool and hip looking place in Scottsdale that attracts a lively after work crowd that piles in for happy hour.  There are some good offerings on the HH menu, but portions are quite small (korean tacos were teeny tiny) and the \"real crab\" California roll tasted rather odd.  For some reason, I expected the dishes to be a little more creative and geared towards the foodie crowd, but the Mexican Asian fusion wasn't bad, it just didn't offer anything unique or spectacular.  Cocktails are definitely their highlight with the Spicy Peach being the standout. So if you're wanting to hang out in a restaurant that has an energetic vibe, ready to spend a little more $$ for smaller portions and want to be a part of a happening social scene, this place is just for you.
