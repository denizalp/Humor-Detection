This is a pretty cool little store if you're looking for that hard-to-find soda (like KISS or Jones) or candy or you just want to check out novelty sodas (like bacon flavored). I went hoping that it would offer soda fountain drinks (like Fiz, Pops, Splash, and Swig), but everything they offer is shelf stable.\n\nSadly, they didn't have Kinder Bueno (as shown on one of the Yelp pictures) when I was there.
