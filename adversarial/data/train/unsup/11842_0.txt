In a recent divorce decree, I was awarded the joint account my ex and I have with this company.  From October 2012 to February 2013, I tried to get this joint account switched into my name, but hurdle after hurdle was placed in front of me by the brokerage.  Finally, they told me that they would comply with the court decree when my ex-husband signed a release form.  As this was an unpleasant divorce, I have concerns the ex will not comply until I spend more money with my attorney and take him to court to get him to comply with the decree which states he shall cooperate with the transfer.  In addition, the brokerage told me that upon reading the decree, they could not find where the decree gives me the account.  The decree was marked with a large arrow on the paragraph pertaining to this award.\n\nI fear that TradeKing is near insolvency to practice business in this manner.  In any case, it appears I will be out more attorney fees because of their business practices just to retrieve the money that I put into this account initially from my own funds.  \n\nI have filed a complaint with Federal Trade Commission and with the Attorney General of the state of Washington.  I sincerely hope that this line of loud public internet complaint will at least result in me retrieving my money without further delay.\n\nTradeKing, you will never ever receive my business again or receive a positive review or referral from me.  I hope others will speak up as well.  I'm sure their behavior is consistent.\n\nThank you Yelp, for providing a place to air my grievance.
