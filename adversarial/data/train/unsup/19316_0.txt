Been going to the joint for a few yrs now. I have to say the first time I had it I immediately fell in love with Persian food. I've tried the chicken, steak and koobideh kebab. The koobideh is by far my fav always juicy, fresh, flavourful meat. The dinner comes with salad, rice and 2 skewers of the koobideh. This is enough for me for 2 meals and it's so cheap! I love the free side they give sometimes (tadeek). If you haven't tried this place you should definitely give it a try!!! There's not much seating so take out is best here and I would recommend that you order a head as the wait time is a little long as they cook the kebabs fresh when ordered on the flame grill.
