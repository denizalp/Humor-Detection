They are CLOSED SUNDAYS! I know this doesn't make sense since they list Sunday hours. If they didn't show Sunday hours you might save you time and NOT walk there since they won't be open and then you wouldn't have wasted your time. However, that's asking a lot. You can't spend money here on Sundays because no one is here to take it even though they list Sunday operating hours.
