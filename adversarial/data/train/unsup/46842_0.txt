This place is definitely a three and half to four star sports bar.  Plenty of high-def screens and friendly staff.  I had the prime rib special - I am not sure why.  The last time I ordered prime rib in a bar I swore I would never do it again.  But this was pretty good.  Not something that is going to put Ruth's Chris out of business, but for $15 the prime rib and veggies were good (and a good deal).  The chicken philly and sweet potato fries also looked good.  Only a few beers on Tap, but Guinness and Kilt Lifter should be enough for anyone.
