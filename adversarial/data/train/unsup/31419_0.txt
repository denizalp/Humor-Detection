I came here for my friends wedding reception in Lake Las Vegas and the food here was amazing. For starters, they served a romaine salad with avocado. It was simple yet so tasty. For my main course I had the filet mignon in a delicious peppercorn sauce cooked perfectly medium rare with mashed potatoes. And for dessert, creme brûlée and cake. I'd definitely like to come back and try the regular menu.
