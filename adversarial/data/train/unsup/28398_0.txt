I love Clean Car Express. I brought my car there this morning and since it was \"Ladies Day\" I was able to get the VIP Wash for the price of the Choice Wash. A banging $3 savings. The employee there are specially hosed down the front of my car since it was covered with bugs prior to going through the car wash. My car was super clean after! I will definitely be coming back.
