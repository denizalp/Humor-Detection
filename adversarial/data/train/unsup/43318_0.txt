I thought it was an OK casino.  I'm not a huge gambler, but like to take a crack at it here and there.  I was disappointed that the only roulette they had was digital!  That's no fun!  They have a few blackjack tables and a small poker room, but this seems to mainly be a slot casino.  We had drinks at the center bar, and the prices weren't too steep for a casino.
