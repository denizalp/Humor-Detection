Awesome Turkish\/Hawaiian fusion place. We had Breakfast Sammie (croissant with bacon and egg) and Special Breakfast (Hawaiian French toast with scrambled egg in a hole and fried chicken topped with syrup). Both were excellent and felt light even though the description doesn't necessarily suggest that. The latte was perfect - medium roast well ground coffee without much bitterness and perfectly frothed milk on top with lightly sweet tasting foam. Dessert... This was the best part of the morning. Tiramisu is easy top 3 I ever had. Firm bottom cake not too coffee and not too wet. Topped with a very firm cream\/custard and cocoa powder, all made in house. Canoli - not overly sweet with firm outer shell and soft and delicious cream filling with chocolate bits. Macaroons were dense outer shell and soft filling, chocolate and strawberry (one of each).\n\nHead chef Fathi (SP?) Is Turkish, a very cool guy and very personable. His wife is Hawaiian hence the fusion. He promised to have a more fully featured Turkish menu for dinner over the coming weeks. \n\nWe will definitely be back for more!
