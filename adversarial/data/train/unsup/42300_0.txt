Pedicure was perfect and the personalities there are awesome!\n\n I'm not too sure about my full set.. My cuticles were trimmed but not pushed in, so I think just regular skin was cut which is why there are some cuts, and the nails aren't completely painted.. However some of my skin is painted? I did try to explain this at the end and see if she could file off some of the painted skin but she didn't understand and I didn't want to come off as rude (as it sounds like they'd had some rude customers today). \n Definitely would return for quick  pedicure! \nand again.. everyone is extremely nice.
