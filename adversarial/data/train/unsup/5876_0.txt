i am giving them one star because that is the lowest i can give them.  my doctor was out of town i gave them my insurance card and told me i was covered fas forward 6 months today i got a bill for guess what not being covered and a letter saying they are sending me to collections for non payment.  \ni called them and said you told me i was covered thier response sorry.  Please note i was charged 250 dollars for the office visit because i had insurance, please note if i did not have insurance it would of cost 150 dollars.  in what galaxy does that make sense.  Attn US Citizens this is what is wrong with healthcare.\nPerhaps they should give out free rectal exams .
