Stopped in for a SUnday brunch whilst visiting in Pitt and were treated to a tasty meal.  I opted for the sweet with Cinnamon Sugar french toast that was supposed to be a cinn-bun spin but didn't quite deliver.  They oversold the \"icing\" which didn't really exist and played it off with \"it's on the outside\" referring to the crust.  No, that is not icing, that's a glaze.  Still, it was tasty and the bacon was really nice. The husband got the potato benny with poached egg,  hollandaise, and salmon (our friend got the corned beef on his) and it was delicious.  I would TOTALLY order that again.  In fact, i might make that for breakfast tomorrow....  =)  All meals came with a fruit salad that was an odd mix of fruits with a flavor that did not blend and i, and avid fruit and veggie lover, did not care for the flavor.\n\nThis could have been a 5-er...  So close, yet so far.  The big knock down came when i read on the menu \"maple syrup\" and what they had was not in fact REAL maple syrup but flavored corn syrup.  Sorry, i'm a real maple syrup girl and if you don't know the difference...  It's just weird, but i'm an upstate NY gal.  That aside, it was a delightful meal for a decent price.
