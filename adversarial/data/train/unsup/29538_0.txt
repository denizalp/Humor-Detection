Came here on a Friday night after work and managed to get seated without a wait. Ordered the pork belly buns and we each had ramen. The buns came out after the ramen as the server informed us they had burned the batch (such a waste!) but what they brought out to us was delicious. I had the seasonal butternut miso ramen which was good, but the smoked cauliflower seemed to overwhelm the other flavors. Overall it was a nice dining experience - in and out really quick.
