I thought the food tasted great. The staff was attentive and I am excited to have a good wine bar and have the large variety of Craft Beer.  My Turkey Panini was delicious, Ahi and Chicken entr√©e was enjoyed by others at my table.  \n\nSince we were there during the soft opening, I wanted to give feedback:\n-Maybe more varieties for bruschetta. We didn't get to try any, when we ordered ,we were told they ran out. \n-The Mac and Cheese had great flavor but hardly any noodles.  2 people at my table ordered it and were disappointed given the price.\n\nWe only intend to give feedback, not complain, because we know Unwined will be great, and the neighborhood needed a nice wine bar. We plan to visit often.
