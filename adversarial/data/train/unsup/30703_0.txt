We came here for some take-out dessert after dinner at FMP. The menu is expansive and offers a wide variety just like Sugar Marmalade without the long wait in line for a table. The aesthetics resembles a more traditional Asian place. This is a pretty solid spot with efficient service.\n\nEnded up ordered a mango sago pudding and when we had it later in the night, it tasted as much as you would expect. It had ripe mango squares and the mango puree with the little white sago pearls gave it a good texture.
