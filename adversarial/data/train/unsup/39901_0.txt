We went to Felice for dinner on a Friday night and the food was pretty good, but the service could use some improvement.\n\nThe atmosphere is nice - in a lovely renovated old house with several small dining rooms on the first floor and a bar on the second floor.  It's cozy enough, and it was somewhat busy on a Friday night but not completely full.  \n\nOn the food.  We ordered the grilled green beans to start, which were good, but really small; we got about ten beans total.  For entrees, the skirt steak was actually amazing (it came with tasty rice and beans, tomatillo sauce and some shredded carrots that didn't really add anything but were fine), grilled walleye, mac and cheese with chorizo (also amazing) and taquitos.  \n\nFor dessert we went up to the bar and had drinks and the molten lava chocolate cake, creme brulee and some sort of apple crisp, all of which were pretty good.  \n\nTheir happy hour menu was pretty good, and they have a late night happy hour beginning at 10, so we had \"avocado with house-made tortilla chips\" for a snack, which was pretty much a light guac with some yummy chips for $3.  Not bad!\n\nIn general, the service was somewhat friendly, but extremely slow and unapologetic.  I think this restaurant would be much improved if they would just have better service.\n\nI hear their patio is fantastic in the summer, so we'll have to go back to try that.  Overall, the best option for dinner right now on Larchmere.
