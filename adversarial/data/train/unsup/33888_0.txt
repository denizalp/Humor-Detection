In general, the food taste good. I like the red lentil soup. But the Iskender is not as authentic as it should be. The syrup made the bottom part of the dessert Baklava soft and not crisp enough. I assume it is because they made a lot and put them there, but the dishes are not gone fast. The service is extremely slow. And there were flies inside the restaurant, and it is very annoying when they fly around.
