Joe Filter provides a service for me that is much appreciated. Owning a home away from home requires me to have someone else make sure that I have a new filter every month, plus I sign up for the smoke detector battery replacement. Before Joe Filter I remember coming to my home away from home one late evening and listening to the \"beep\" of a smoke detector battery that was low. Not having a tall enough ladder, I put some items together to get me the height I needed to change the battery. Very unsafe, so in comes Joe Filter and there are no more worries! Their technicians are dressed very professional, wear booties over their shoes when they come in, have professional looking equipment to bring in the new filter and to dispose of the old. Whenever I return to my home away from home, I know that the things I have Joe Filter taking care of will be done! Customer Service, billing and all communications from Joe Filter are very professional and courteous. Thanks Joe!
