If you like bubble tea, Bubbleology is a must try! I managed to make it in during the grand opening and was all around impressed. Staff is friendly and efficient, atmosphere is energetic, and, most importantly, the fruit teas and waffles are incredible! I ordered the passion fruit tea with boba and the fudge-alicious waffle. Both items definitely delivered... Quality ingredients with tons of flavor. \n\nIf you're in the area, give this place a shot. You won't be disappointed!
