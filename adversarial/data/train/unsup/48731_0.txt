The food was good. Kind of bummed they didnt have garlic noodles. The waitress was really nice and attentive. The shrimp by the pound didn't look like a pound to me, but I guess I just wanted more? lol   We also ordered oysters for $1 each since it was happy hour. The oysters were small.  The spicy is not that spicy, if I go back i will get the hottest.  Also didn't really like their corn it tasted funny to me.  There is a stench when you walk to the restrooms, I think its the lobster machine.  If you can catch a lobster for $2, they will cook it for you. I do not recommend doing that... the lobsters look old and thats probably why it stinks so bad around there.
