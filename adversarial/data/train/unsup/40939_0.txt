3.5 stars.  Been here throughout the years and the quality seems to have gone downhill.  Place is always busy so I guess that is why.  Fish is okay quality but not the freshest.  I usually stick to the maki rolls here.  The Party tray is the best deal.  The plaza can be tricky to park but they do have an underground parking.  Service is okay here not much to rave about.
