Now I know TI isn't Wynn or Bellagio (which had GREAT buffets btw) so I didn't walk in expecting top of the line fine dining here but I was expecting a bit more for my $22(+tax) dinner buffet @ Treasure Island than what I got.\n\nWhile the staff is helpful enough, the place just seems kind of on the cheapish side and it has very little selections despite it offering \"Asian\/American\/Italian\/Mexican\" fare. Most of the food was cooled down to room temp already or just tasted off. I can find a bigger selection at my local buffet back home for less. The dessert was good, probably the best they had to offer out of the whole place. I would either save my money and walk on over to one of the malls for a quick cheap bite to eat or spend just a bit more money and time to get on the line for the buffets at the better resorts.
