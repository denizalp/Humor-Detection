I'm definitely a fan! I had their Ripen Mango Arepas and the Mexican Spiced latte...both made to delight my taste palette. You have to go and see for yourself. The food was so fresh and so delish. The mango arepas go well with a side balsamic sauce the server handed me like it as a secret for my taste buds only kind of thing. I'm sure he's given it away to many before me, but hey don't harsh my mellow. Haha. The coffee was very subtle and creamy. Everyone there was so welcoming and attentive. I would definitely go back especially knowing its 10 mins away from my work!!!
