If you are looking for a QUICK Chinese buffet, then check out ZEN. If you are expecting fancy, gourmet Chinese food, then go to PF Changs.\n\nThey transformed the former Bill Johnson's building into a lovely nine-station Chinese Buffet restaurant with SUPER friendly service. The staff (and customers I kept bumping into) were all very nice and cordial.\n\nThe food is not authentic Chinese...I would say more American-Chinese tasting. Zen is your typical, average Chinese buffet place. \n\n There is a variety of the more popular Chinese dishes, a dessert station, all fruit station, sushi station, and soups, etc... There are MANY fried foods too.\n\nI'm very leery about eating at Buffets (esp Chinese Buffets). It was pretty busy during a weekday lunch hour and the foods were at their proper temperatures. Clean restroom (a good sign).
