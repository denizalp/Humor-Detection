I'm going to have to agree with Erin about the clothes here. Sometimes there are GREAT designs that fit perfectly, and other times it's crap that makes you wonder what drugs the designers take to think that this looks good.\n\nThat said, accessories are amaaaazing and super cheap (especially when it gets down to clearance time), their shoes are actually gorgeous and moderately comfortable, and, yes, their underwear is phenomenal. Some of my favourite bras are from here and I paid under $10 for most of them. Compared to the $60+ I've spent at Victoria's Secret, I'll take Joe Fresh any day.\n\nOne thing-- they don't take Amex which is kind of annoying for me.
