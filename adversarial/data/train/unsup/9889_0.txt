This review is just for Gina, should of done this review long time ago! I got a cut by her last summer, went from long to short, but she chopped off an extra inch or two from the photo I showed her.. And guess what? Gina was talking to the korean owner(one of the older lady at the counter) and she grabbed all my hair that was cut off(like a pony tail) Thank god, I know some korean and can pick up some words while they were chit chatting behind me, so I asked Gina why she took my hair? She told me she is using it for extensions cuz she's attending for her son's wedding soon.. Excuse me?!?! So Gina cut off an extra inch for the owner to use as an extension.. All this without my permission! Or at the very least tell me before hand and maybe say thank you? No wonder they were excited when I told them I'm cutting it all off... And the owner came to check the quality of my hair before Gina started chopping it.
