This place was really gross.  There was no one around when we went in, but we were starving.\n\nThe food wasn't fresh, the dishes were dirty, and I felt like I was going through Pan's Labyrinth to get to the bathroom, which was pretty far away, seemingly in another dimension.  It was almost an adventure.\n\nThere was old black slimy greens in my salad, but at least the watermelon in the salad was good!  I'll give them that!  The olives were even disgusting--how do you mess up olives?  The spanokopita was limp and oily and devoid of much phyllo.  And there were copious bugs flying around our food the whole time we dined.  \n\nWhen we paid, the cashier asked how much of a tip we wanted to leave, and added it directly to the bill  instead of giving us the opportunity to leave our own tip or write it on the restaurant receipt.  The bill was way too high.\n\nIf you really hate someone, you should take them to this restaurant.
