With over 400+ reviews, this coffee shop needs no introductions. \n\nAll I'm gonna say is: THE FLYNN. Double shot of espresso, vanilla cream and caramel. I ordered it iced, small sized. I think their small is like 16 oz.....pretty good amount. \nThe Flynn will def give you a pep in your step! Smooth, delicious, creamy and not too sweet. Gets you alert...a good kind of hyper...not one of those my-heart-is-beating-out-my-chest caffeine overload. \n\nI don't live in this area but if I'm ever around, you betcha I'm coming here for my coffee fix! (There's a Madhouse Coffee close by, skip it and come here instead....I promise you won't be disappointed).
