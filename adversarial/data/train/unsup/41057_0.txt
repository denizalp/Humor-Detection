Totally hooked on this place and I've never ordered anything other than the Nishikawa Black. It was so flavorful and delicious that I don't see why I would order anything else. (Luckily my husband likes to vary in what he orders so I do get to sample other things). Appetizers are good too and you get a lot for your money, so why not sample! Make sure you specify soft egg when you order, hard boiled egg is just weird in ramen in my opinion.
