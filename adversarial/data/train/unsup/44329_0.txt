Service and food was great!! Husband and I went for dinner on a Wednesday night before seeing Penn and Teller. We made a reservation through Open Table (I recommend making a reservation). We were seated right away. Hubs got a beer ($6), and I got a drink called Heaven ($11) it was amazing! We passed on an app, but I got the Blue Burger and my husband got the Prime Rib. Both were cooked to perfection, and our waiter even brought out some \"real\" horseradish for my husband to go along with his dinner which was awesome! Our total bill for dinner and drinks was about $70. Well worth it! I will for sure be back next time I'm in town!!
