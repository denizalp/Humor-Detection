Was dropping oldest daughter off at work and about to go hit the trails to go hiking but was starving and wanted a breakfast burrito, went by one of my fav places by my house and it was closed until 8, it was 7:20 and I didn't want to wait so I drove down the road to another place placed my order then told me that they couldn't use debit at this time, the machine was down, so I having no cash left, and then I remembered driving by Amados plenty of times coming home from work, so I headed over there and thought eh why not, when I walked I saw on the board Amados special which was a burrito with eggs, ham, potatoes, bell peppers, onions and cheese for $3.70, Yep that's exactly what I wanted! So I order me up on and it was just what I was craving! I am going to have to remember this place for a great breakfast burrito!
