I don't care if it's not the same as the one in Berkely because the service was extra guuuud! Everyone was so welcoming and so sweet. This guy, forgot his name, warmed my cookies for me even though the line was long. The place is brand new and super clean. In a nice, family friendly area and has seating inside. I recommend to just try it out.
