We brought our four-year-old and two-year-old boys hoping for a few hours of fun, and we got it in some areas but not others.\n\nRight off the bat, the children's play area is incredible. There are musical instruments, a dancing stage, a supermarket, a house that can be built on with foam bricks, among many other play stations.  There is a special infant\/toddler space, a nursing area and a family restroom right there too.  My boys got the most fun out of this area.  \n\nGiven their ages, we knew our kids wouldn't be interested in everything the science centre has to offer, so we selected a few of the more interesting levels to visit so we wouldn't lose their attention.\n\nMy oldest wanted to see the space exhibit, so we headed there first but couldn't find a station that really grabbed him. Everything seemed to be over his head, so we translated as much as we could into language that he'd understand and then moved onto the next thing...\n\nThe boys really liked the human sciences level that showed skeletons and had more hands-on activities.  They enjoyed the rainforest exhibit as well.  Looking back (as this visit was a week ago) I have a hard time remembering which exhibits that I recall were from the science centre and which were from ROM, because they had some exhibits that were very similar, so I do apologize for not being more specific about the particular exhibits.  \n\nLong story short, we breezed through a bunch of the levels because our kids were just too young and had too short of attention spans to really get much learning or excitement out of this place, but if you have older children, this is a must-see attraction.  With longer attention spans, there are many hours of knowledge for older children within these walls!
