I love the laid-back atmosphere of this restaurant I felt immediately upon entering as our waiter told us to sit wherever we'd like.\n\nBeing one of two vegan restaurants in Calgary I was very pleased with the choices for food. The actual food itself tasted amazing and was filled with flavourful ingredients.\nMy favourite part of this visit was when our waitress asked me if I'd like cheese with my sandwich. I told her no I'm vegan and she asked me if nutritional yeast was all right. I said yes of course, and in my head I was thinking omg, they know me so well!\n\nCan't wait to go back again! But I'll have to wait until my budget will allow it as the food is not cheap. Only because the food is made with the best ingredients though.
