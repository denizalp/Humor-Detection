One would think a restaurant\/bar on the water would be a really cool place to hang out on a sunny, warm and breezy day.  The open air bar on the river had all the ingredients of a fun afternoon spent gazing at the boats with a drink in hand, shooting the breeze.  It could have been....but the bartenders apparently weren't interested in actually tending bar.  Both young chicks stood with their backs to the long, long bar and never looked to see if customers needed anything.  We had to flag them down to get our first drink.   She was busy talking to the other bartender so it took a while for her to mosey over.  We ordered drinks.  Eh....nothing to write home about.  The first drink was the last one....wasn't worth the effort or our time.\n\nAwful view.  The occasional boats that went by were the only respite from the wasteland on the shore across the water.   Hopefully some day the view AND the service will improve!
