Ahhhh a breath of fresh air in Summerlin.  You are greeted by a happy, life loving staff who is always willing to help you out.  I don't tend to visit TJ very often but every time I do, I ask myself \"why don't I come here more often\".  They have certain items that I can only find at their stores and I'm happy to drive there to get them.  I wish I had a TJ right outside of my neighborhood because I sure would shop there more often.
