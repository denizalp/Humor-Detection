Yeah.... this place. Awful. I can see why they have high reviews as a general rule; management will contact those who leave negative reviews, as happened with mine when I first reviewed this horrendous restaurant a couple months ago, and offer a gift card to make up for how terrible this place is. I removed my initial review because the gesture was gracious and of course the contact was friendly & polite, but a couple more tries here and... well, fool me once, shame on you. Fool me multiple times, and I'm an idiot. \n\nWe have given this place multiple tries. The food is awful, the service is even worse. None of the staff knows the menu, they're consistently out of EVERY beer on their menu, and everything takes forever to actually come from the kitchen to the table.... that is, if your server remembers to ring your food in. That seems to be a recurring issue. \n\nSeriously. Save your money. Go elsewhere.
