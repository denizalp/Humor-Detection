Que Chingado?!? The salsa was terrible. Just about zero Vegan options except for the $14 small side of guacamole. You get a small bottle of diet coke for $5... my friends are flesh eaters so they ordered food that was equally overpriced. The service was slow along with the kitchen... everything took forever along with the guacamole to the getting of our checks. By the end of the night we made it across the courtyard and got some burritos at another establishment. It's too bad that we lost the Corner to this hot overpriced mess. Chico Malo lives up to the name, it's all No Bueno y Vale Madre!
