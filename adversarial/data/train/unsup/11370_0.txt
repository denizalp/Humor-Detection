No joke. We were kicked out by a very annoyed server\/bully because we left a 10% tip. He held the door open and told us \"DON'T COME BACK\" while he waited for us to leave. Who does that? Wow, touchy! Seriously buddy suck it up, take a breath & use it as a learning experience. No need to blow a fuse. Bravo, you just showed you deserved even less than 10%. \n\nAfter leaving 10% he asked us why & we said it's because he insisted we ordered 4 meatballs & not 3.  He then insisted again we ordered 4. Wow, stubborn AND pushy. Customer is always ... WRONG!! Not cool to have to insist to send food back. \n\nWhy all the fuss? This waiter needs to work on his softer side and be less confrontational and stubborn. The food was very good and the 5$ lunch special is great. The Thai meatballs were especially good. Our friend works 2 blocks away and comes all the time but you have technically banished him. Thanks. I hope your pride was worth it. \n\nFor the clients - be careful about leaving 10% or disagreeing with your server.
