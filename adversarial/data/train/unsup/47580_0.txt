Today went here on a whim for lunch. The atmosphere is relaxed and modern. The staff is really friendly. I had the chicken and quoina soup, which I recommend their soup all fresh and homemade. Get their bread that they make. I also had the tuna sandwich. This place really love to add olives in their dishes. It was a little pricy but well worth it for the quality.
