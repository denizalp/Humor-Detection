Go here if you want the sleeeeezy, shady used sales man experience. New respect for anyone who managed to buy a Kia. \n\nSo many things wrong: \n- if your a lady prepared to be ignored, all attention goes to the guys in your party, doesn't matter if you are the purchaser, they're not even interested in shaking your hand to greet you\n- no cars in the showroom? seriously what kind of car dealer is this? Some \"special\" event was happening that they replace all cars in the show room for cheap cafeteria tables. eh ok. \n- want to see a car? sure, fill in this application... you want my name, address, SIN, mortgage amount owing, just to SEE a car?!!! Considering they just left a random person's driver licence on the public table next to us. Yeah, sure I trust you with that. S-H-A-D-Y.
