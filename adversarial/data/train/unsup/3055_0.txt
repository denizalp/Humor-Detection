The best part of these rolled ice cream shops is watching them make the rolls. It's like teppanyaki but for ice cream, where showmanship is on full display. And those workers that are making the rolls must get a decent arm workout for reals!\n\nCame here for the grand opening, and I was pleasantly surprised by how good their rolled ice cream was, especially after my sub-par experience at Rolled Ice Cream. The ice cream at Rolled Ice Cream is way too sweet, like they're handing out diabetes or somethin. \n\nTried the Gold Digger (Thai tea topped with lychee) and the Matcha topped with red bean and mochi. Both were fantastic! The lychee was a nice complement to the Thai tea, and the matcha flavor in the matcha rolled ice cream was strong which I enjoyed. I also loved how creamy the ice cream was and how appropriately sweet they were.  \n\nNow I know where to come for my rolled ice cream fix.
