I'm giving this place a 5 star mostly because of the service we got this last time. Baile was our waitress this time and she was the most pleasant server I've ever encountered. Very attentive and detailed with everything. We didn't feel rushed like we normally do when we come here by other servers. She made recommendations and did the whole service to her standards. Which really shows. She's great and some of the other servers could take a few lessons from her honestly. As long as she's working I'll definitely be back for that A+ service and great food!
