The door man sucks ass!  I don't know where he gets off thinking he is so special, but he was being a total douche to my friend.  My friend had an Indiana driver's license and asked him what year he graduated high school, if he had any other ID, etc.  It was like the Spanish Inquistion.  He had no problem letting me in and I have a CA ID.  Didn't understand that.  Oh wait, I'm a girl, so I guess the tits let me get into bars with ease.  I should tell my friend to work on getting boobs, then he won't have to deal with asshole door men.  The only reason this place gets a star at all if because of the bartender who profusely apologized about the door man.  Other than that, this place is a total douche fest.  But we're in Vegas, so I guess that's to be expected.
