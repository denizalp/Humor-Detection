Eh?  A little too hipster for me.........2.5 stars! \n\nI had been to Pane Bianco about a dozen or so times, and had never walked next door to Lux.  The other day, I decided to check it out.  I needed some caffeine and an iced coffee sounded good.  \n\nI walked next door, got in line and placed my order for an iced coffee.  My total was $4.50.  Meh.  A bit small of an iced coffee for $4.50.  I know its \"higher quality\" made by an \"artisan\", but I much prefer my Dunkin Donuts iced coffee for under $2.00.  They give you your cup, and then you have to cream and sugar it yourself at their little table.  The coffee was pretty tasty, but it was skimp.  I took about 5 or 6 good strawfuls, and it was pretty much gone.  \n\nThe service was friendly enough, and the joint is ALWAYS packed.  It's a bit too fancy\/hipster for my liking though and I don't think I am coming back.
