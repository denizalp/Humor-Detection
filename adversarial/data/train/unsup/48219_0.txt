A new Walmart?? Yay I only have to drive 4 miles instead of 9 miles to the nearest Walmart!\n\nI like newly built stores because they are usually clean and freshly stocked, and the weirdos haven't started shopping here yet. Its pretty much planned out like your typical Walmart. Nothing innovative or new added. Not even a large Natural Foods section or bigger hot deli with extensive menu. Its simply another Walmart built to suck the customer base out of the nearby Smiths and Albertsons.
