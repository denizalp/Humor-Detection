I began seeing Diana about two years ago to help with my allergies and over-all energy. Between acupuncture, custom blended aromatherapy and the whole food herbs and supplements she has prescribed, I am back on track and feeling better than ever! I am thrilled to have found Diana; her wealth of knowledge, experience and natural intuition is exactly what I had been seeking for years!
