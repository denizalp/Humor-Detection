The owners of Corbin's really know how to treat their customers. It truly feels like your neighborhood bar and grill...\"where everybody knows your name... and they're always glad you came...\" \n\nThe minute my friend and I walked into Corbin's, we felt welcomed and charmed not only by the pleasant atmosphere, but also by the staff.  It was pretty packed, but we were quickly offered either a tall table or a large booth.  We opted for the tall table.  But, just as we were about to be seated, the host (who I think was the owner) noticed a soon to be available smaller booth.  He told us we could sit there if we could wait a few minutes while he cleared the table. We waited about 60 seconds before he apologized for \"the wait\" and seated us. After being seated, our waiter came by, but the man who seated us told him that he'd be taking care of us. And for the rest of the meal, he did just that.\n\nOh, and, of course the food. The food! It was great! Their menu is pretty extensive, will all your typical sports bar grub, but with enough twist to it to make it interesting. After contemplating all their menu items, I decided on the pork tenderloin sandwich. It was deliciously messy and very filling (I couldn't even finish it all). And, the french fries were crispy and seasoned just right. All in all, it was a great meal experience! \n\nI can honestly say I've never experienced this kind of high level custom service anywhere else I've dined. It is one of those places you think doesn't really exist, until you actually experience it... and then you're floored by it! I'm so glad I finally decided to give them a try. I'll definitely be returning many, many times!
