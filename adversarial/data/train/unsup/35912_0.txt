If you go here, sit outside and enjoy the beautiful view of Pittsburgh! We came here for drinks but the food looked good. Wednesday is their $1 beer special and $5.50 martini night. The martinis are good. The sangria was.... Eh......tasted flat and syrupy. Not what I expected from a sangria for $10.
