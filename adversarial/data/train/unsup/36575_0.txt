I want to sincerely thanks Shane for his skillful and meticulous driving instructions. His attitude, accommodation and patient are nonpareil. I've passed my G2 on March 15th from the first attempt with Shane. \n\nI strongly recommend Shane for future drivers as he instills confidence, excellent technical advice, and self-esteem in the students he works with.\n\nRegards,\nM.
