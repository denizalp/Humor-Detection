Had a very good meal here tonight. We ordered their combos 3 (pho + drink) and combo 5 (pho + spring roll + drink). The pho was great! Soup base was delish but my complaint is the portion size...definitely small. The spring rolls, according to my hubs, was good too...not the generic ones. Apparently it's made with 13 ingredients (as per the owner). Our drinks were thai iced tea and the peach iced tea. Both were very good! The best part of the night was the gelato. We ordered pistachio and coconut. Pistachio flavour was so good!!!! Their coconut flavour had coconut meat in it. They'll let you try the flavours if you can't decide. \n\nWe had a little chat with the owners at the end of the night and you can tell how much passion they have for what they're doing. They told us everything in their store is made fresh with authentic Vietnamese flavours. They bake their own baguettes each day for the bahn mi and pho is their homemade recipe. They've opened for only 6 weeks and are still playing around with their menu. So don't let the limoted options stop you from visiting. \n\nWill we be back? Definitely!
