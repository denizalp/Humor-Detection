My food wasn't too hot or too cold, it was just right.  Goldilocks would be happy.  \n\nI had a good lunch experience at Black Bear.  I realize it's a chain but it was my first time dining at their establishment.  We were greeted and seated immediately.  The dining area is a plentiful area.  Of course you're met with the decor of a log cabin.  \n\nI chose to indulge in the Chicken Avocado Club with fries.  This triple stack sandwich had a great balance of chicken, avocado, cheese and blt. It was a very tasty sandwich and too much for me to eat in one sitting.  That only means I have dinner for later.  :-)  The French fries are good but not great.  \n\nFor dessert my friend and I split the Cinnamon Apple Cream Pie.  It was ok.  I will say it is more than enough for two to split.  \n\nService here is ok.  I think our waiter could have been a little friendlier.  Once he dropped off our bill he didn't want to make eye contact with us.  We had to flag him down to get dessert.   \n\nI'm sure I'll be back to try out another meal.  Hopefully the service is improved.
