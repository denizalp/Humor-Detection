I am a total fan of PV Mall-- something about it.  Maybe it's the nostalgic feeling I get from being in 8th grade and going to the movie with my friends and walking around the mall acting cool.  Years later (many)- I still walk around feeling cool but not because I bought a belt at Units (it's a skirt, it's a belt, it's a shirt- you remember that one?) or got a new skirt from Wet Seal-- I feel cool because I just scored the best deal at Macy's on work pants and can't wait to wear them the next day.  There are malls with better shopping options but PV Mall does have some decent stores still:  Macy's, Bath & Body Works, Body Shop, Gap, Ann Taylor, JC Penny (um btw, JCP has some really great stuff in there, you just gotta look), Hallmark.  There are more but I am tired from thinking of them all. OH and Costco is new to it!\n\nIt's not really all that busy here, so that is more my speed when I just want to wander in and out of stores that I may or may not buy something from on a Sunday.  I'm a fan of PV Mall.
