My first trip to Vegas and we're staying at a giant glass pyramid topped by a beam of light you can quite literally see from space.  Ahhh, this is going to be interesting.\n\nI knew I was in la-la land when the directions to our room included passing two separate full-size Starbuck's shops.  Yes, to get to my room I had to take a right at the first one and a left at the second.  \n\nBut I digress.  The West Tower rooms were decent sized and the bathroom was huge.  I won't comment on the beds as my time in one was...limited...by our strenuous bachelorette outings.  \n\nI will, however, mention the towel situation.  When I arrive at an establishment designed to house me for a short duration I hope that the towels will be slightly larger than a dishtowel and of a mildly more pleasing consistency than sandpaper.   The Luxor's towels look as if they have been stolen from the recycle bin at Motel 6.
