Another shoutout about the rewards program! Planning a getaway with my rewards VIP phone line, I booked my complimentary fountain view Terrace suite with the additional night below the rack rate, passes to the Wicked Spoon buffet, and on the list for the Marquee nightclub. \n\nTwo nights with perks all for $200 at The Cosmopolitan? Crazy!
