Small gym with good classes!\n\nThis is a mini-gym. They have a small group exercise room for Zumba and Yoga etc on the main level and then upstairs they have cardio, stretch and weight equipment plus men and women's locker rooms.\n\nActually quite well set up for the size. If you are looking for tons of machines or a lap pool, this is not your gym, but if you want a quick work out with less hassle getting in and out - this might be the location for you.\n\nI live right here, so i have no excuse not to go here. The Zumba class is the most fun. The only downside is that parking in front is limited - so you might have to use the deck - but i would try the off hours...  10am - noon and 1pm to 430pm and 8-closing..  less people.
