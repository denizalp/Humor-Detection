I was skeptical of this place from the start. But my gut feeling was right. Mostly because I loved Flattop grill. Sadly, its has closed now. Naturally I was comparing this place to Flattop so I may have some bias. The waitress wasn't too clear with the instructions (even though it wasn't hard to figure out) she didn't offer waters either. Now the most important part, the food. The only good part of HuHot is that they have a lot of toppings..the toppings didn't exactly make too much sense. It had like corn and black beans, jalape√±os...etc. The meat (chicken, beef, etc) were all thin and frozen. I was used to fresh chicken and meat so it was off putting. You also had to lather up your bowl with sauce or you don't have any flavor to the food. The chefs had real skill which was interesting to watch but over all I would never come here again. It wasn't quality food, wasn't adequate wait staff, not a good experience. I wouldn't waste your time or money here.\n\nAs an update, my stomach hurts now, which leads me to believe the food wasn't cooked correctly.. Again the chicken was frozen when you pick it out.
