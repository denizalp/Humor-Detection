Great lunchtime deals happening here. We got the pizza salad and dessert lunch deal but couldn't even eat the dessert because we were so full. The salad was yummy with rocket, pear, walnut and gorgeous oily dressing, not to mention the most incredible oils on the side to dip crunchy bread in. \nThe pizza was margarita and we watched the kitchen staff through the glass wall pull it out of the pizza oven, fresh ingredients and great big slices!\nThey serve fancy cocktails and I'm ok with that.
