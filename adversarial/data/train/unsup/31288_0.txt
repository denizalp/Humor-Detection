Had an event Saturday evening and errands wanted get a coffee or tea. It was only 10pm and every place was closed so looked up the newest Starbucks and open til midnight. This was nice to find out as cinemark theatre is across from them. I had a green tea and dave had Carmel Macchiato. Plenty of tables and sitting areas and was nice to see so many people just hanging out enjoying their coffee. I look forward to sitting on patio when weather warms up.im just thrilled to find out the hours!!
