This place has potential, but for now it's a bit disappointing.\n\nBros & Bettys is tucked away in a strip mall. I drove past it at first without noticing it. The shop itself is pretty small, but they've fit about 8 racks of men's and women's clothes and accessories.\n\nAccording to their website, they only carry \"the most popular name brands,\" but the majority of their items are from Goodwill. You can tell by the black or silver Sharpie letters on the tags. I found a few items at very reasonable prices--including a pair of DKNY jeans and an Ann Taylor top--but for the most part it's second-hand castoffs in average condition. I heard another shopper comment, \"There's just nothing I'm really excited about, you know?\"\n\nOnce they have more trade-ins, their selection may improve. For now, Bros & Bettys isn't worth seeking out.
