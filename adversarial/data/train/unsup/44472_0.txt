Sometimes the drive thru is not the fastest, but often times I am the only car so it's a fifty fifty shot. So if you like to gamble this is the drive thru for you! \nThe same thing has to be said for the cafe... Sometimes they have it together, while other days they don't even know you exists! One day I waited 10 minutes for a Venti 10 pump chai latte and they weren't even busy! I was beginning to think the barista forgot to write my cup out! Come on guys, chai lattes don't get any easier! You don't even have to pull any shots! 10 minutes was a bit ridiculous! \nI was in there just last night and the young blond barista didn't even acknowledge me with a hello or even a smilie, although she looked at me about three times as I was waiting for someone to come to the counter. I get that she was busy, but all she had to do was acknowledge my presence, not act like her life as a barista was so ruff! \n95% of the time I only order a Grande Pike Place anyway, so it's not like I am putting them out, which is their job by the way! \nCustomer service is a MUST with me. I can forgive slow but not rude and thus the three stars.
