it is like some trashy old homo went into my brain and put all my favorite things in one building.\n\nA dive bar with cheap drinks, porn, karaoke, and Haus of Haunt.\n\nI went here every night during my vacation in Pittsburgh for the premiere of Season 4 of RuPaul's Drag Race. Every night was a different event, but  all were simply delightful.
