I've tried this buffet a few times many many years ago....vague memory.\n\nRecently I used the MyVegas '2 for 1' discount to try this place out again (we were starving...so had to look for a nearby buffet).  \n\nPretty wide selection of cultural food, however I think overall they had way too much carbohydrate dishes.  The flavors of each dish per culture were all fairly similar too...not much flavor distinction.  The physical look of the buffet seems a bit outdated as well.  The dessert station wasn't up to par, compared to other nearby buffets.\n\nOverall, this buffet has everything you want if you are starving! However, if it weren't for the MyVegas deal that I claimed, the quality of food here would not be worth $37\/person.  There are other Vegas buffets on the strip that offer much better quality for about the same price.
