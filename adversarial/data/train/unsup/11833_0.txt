Living in California, I am spoiled with amazing Mexican food.  I rarely have the need for Mexican food when I'm traveling (unless I'm in Mexico, obviously, ha!), so when some friends suggested we eat at Gallo Blanco, we were fine with the suggestion but knew Californian Mexican food would surely beat this Arizonan Mexican variety.\n\nNow I'm not so sure who would win that throw down. \n\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant was lively without going too far into a bar feel.  No chips are automatically brought to the table, which is probably the smart way to go,  but something I like when eating at my usual Mexican spots.\n\nWe had a party of seven so ordered a few bowls of chips and guacamole.  The guacamole was really good.  It had some big chunks of avocado, which is so much better than guacamole that is mashed\/mixed up into an overly creamy mess.\n\nThe food and drinks here are cheaper than in LA.  Not saying much, I suppose, since a pressed juice can start at $10 in Atwater Village, but still.\n\nI'm not a beer girl, but they even had cans of Tecate for $2!  A few in the party had that, and if you're on a budget, it's nice to have $2 beers!  My boyfriend had the Dragoon IPA, which he enjoyed and at only $7, it was a good deal.  \n\nThere was a lot of food ordered, but some standouts for me and my group:\n\n* chicharron de queso - this was amazing!  I may dream of it tonight.  A HUGE fried chichuahua and manchego cheese crisp, served with an aji aioli dipping sauce.  (Is recommend ordering this early on, sharing it, and adding bits of it to any salads or sides). \n\n* elote callejero - your standard Mexican grilled corn served with the mayo, cotija cheese, chile and smoked paprika.  The servers offer to shave the corn off the don for you, which is nice and helps make sure you don't look like a messy pig within a few bites.  I can't recall if it came with lime wedges or not, but if not...ask for them.  Mexican corn always needs a squeeze of fresh lime juice!\n\n* de la casa salad - romaine, avocado, cherry tomatoes, pepitas, jicama, cucumber, cotija...very fresh and delicious.  Would have been enhanced had I crumbled some of my cheese crisp on there!!\n\n* Tacos - the big hits with our group was the al pastor and the campechano (this is a mix of longaniza, al pastor and carne asada) \n\n\nI almost want to plan another trip to Phoenix just for the fried cheese.  Is that weird??
