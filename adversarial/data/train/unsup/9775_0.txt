I have a different company, but we came here with Babygirl when she had an unfortunate incident involving the back of someone else's car. \n\nI had no idea they had their own claim center like this. What a revelation! You make an appointment, bring in your car, and they make all the arrangements for you and even take care of the paperwork. (All this whilst your parents help themselves to the thoughtfully stocked mini fridge and array of tasty packaged snacks). They even smile patiently when your father picks up the life-sized cut out of Flo and stands behind it, singing \"Happy Birthday\" to you).\n\nThen, a few weeks later, when yet another unfortunate mishap befalls you (this time involving a security gate that closed unexpectedly), they trot out and rub out the scratches for you with no paperwork involved! Hallelujah!\n\nI haven't had to file a claim since the mid 80's when my car was stolen and damaged, and I still sweat a little just thinking about the knock down, drag out fights I had with AAA to get it settled. Are all insurance companies run like Progressive now? If not, they should be!
