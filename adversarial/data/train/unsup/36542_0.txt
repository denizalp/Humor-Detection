We stumbled into Casanova for breakfast after a few of \"those\" nights in Vegas.  The restaurant is cute, and has great food at non-Vegas prices!  Seriously - I could get breakfast and coffee for under $10!\n\nWhat makes the place even better is how wonderful the staff are.  They seemed to sense how fragile we were feeling, and made sure to load us up with all the spicy condiments and glasses of ice-water we needed.  \n\nWhen my meal came and I looked longingly at the fruit that one of my girlfriends had brought, they came back with a surprise plate of fruit for me!  What's even more amazing is they didn't charge me for it!  What wonderful staff!\n\nNeedless to say, we continued to eat there each day that we staggered out of our rooms, wearing sweat pants and covered in yesterday's makeup.  Hopefully we didn't scare away any other guests.
