The food was good but the service was very poor and odd at times.  This was our first visit to Red Robin.  Since we live less than a 1\/2 mile away, this was a chance to try one of the newer food places in Downtown Summerlin.  You never get a second chance to make a first impression. \n\nWe were semi-greeted when we walked in when an employee reached below the podium and got two sets of menus and finally gestured us to follow him.  I don't recall him saying a word to us.\n\nOur server came to the table promptly and seeing his name tag, I said good afternoon *name*.  He responded with, \"Hi, I'm *name* and I'm going to be your server.  He was trained to introduce himself and give his name and by damn he was going to do it even though I had already spoken to him by name.  Odd.\n\nHe took our drink orders and soon brought two iced teas to the table.  We asked for time to study the menu more and when he came back we were ready to order.  He had also given me a card to text a word to a number to join Red Robin's reward program.  (He has seen me using my iPhone as I was checking into Yelp).\n\nMy wife ordered the soup and sandwich combo.  She got a cup of Red's Chili Chili and a BLTA croissant.  I ordered a cup of chicken tortilla soup and a Burnin' Love burger.  *name* asked me if I wanted my soup with my burger or before.  I answered before.  After not too long, I was surprised when two dinners were brought and I had received no soup.  Oh well, to err is human and I forget a lot, too.  No big deal.\n\nMy wife enjoyed her sandwich and really liked the chili.  My burger was topped with a grilled jalape単o that was very good and was a hot one.  There were \"jalape単o coins\" and the burger was on a jalape単o kaiser roll.  There was also chipotle aioli on the burger.  With all this talk about peppers and burnin' love, the only spicy thing was the actual grilled jalape単o.  The burger was good and I liked the fries.  Since they were bottomless steak fries, I wanted to get some more and to get an iced tea refill.  *name* never came back to see how things were.  I finally flagged him down and asked for more fries and iced tea.  Since there were people at three other tables, *name* could be forgiven for being overwhelmed with the work.\n\nI finished my burger before my extra fries were brought and I had moved my plate to the center of the table to make room for the fries.  When they were brought, *name* removed the two plates from the center taking with him my fork I was going to use with my fries.  Instead, I used one of our large toothpicks to eat some fries until they cooled enough to pick up with my fingers and eat.\n\nBefore we were finished with our meal, *name* stopped by to see if we wanted to dessert.  I said back off in a nice manner.  When finished, *name* came back and we ordered the mountain high mudd pie.  The dessert was quite good but once again *name* had a way of irritating me.  *name* brought our check while we were enjoying dessert and rather than just folding the two sides closed and leaving it on the side of the table with the no hurry message, *name* insisted on leaving the check holder unfolded and almost forced it under my right elbow as I was eating dessert.  I picked it up, slapped the two sides together, and put it to my left out of the way.  Before we were finished, *name* came back to pick up the check.  I waved him off.  When we were finished, I looked at the check and sure enough, charged for soup I didn't get.  I pointed this out to *name* and told him he never brought the soup.  He just stared at the check and then walked away never saying sorry I forgot or anything else.  He brought the check back and he once again insisted on pushing the opened check holder under my right elbow.  *name* just doesn't learn.\n\nI paid the check and we left.  My rating for Red Robin would have been a three.  The food is not bad and I enjoyed it.  Service is what brought it down.  *name* needs some retraining.  You've been open long enough to have this correct.  One thing, they won't have to worry about a free burger on my birthday.  I won't be redeeming that reward.  A second chance to make a first impression--of course not!  A second chance at having decent service along with decent food--maybe!
