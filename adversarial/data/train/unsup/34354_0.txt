I am a security supervisor for a gated community in Gold Canyon.  A technician named John comes in on a weekly basis to service resident 's home.  John always comes in with a smile on his face and he shows such professionalism and even can make you laugh every time with his great sense of humor.\nI hear nothing but positive feedback from the residents that John has for customers. I just want to say thanks to John for standing out with excellent customer service skills. To Critter Getter, you have one great employee working for you!\nThank you!
