This place is.....pretty awful, but it is one of the few 24 hour clinics that accepts my insurance. I will say that the nurses & doctors are very friendly & helpful though! They really listen to your problem & do their best to access it. That being said, the actual service here is ridiculous! Came as a walk in around 10:30pm and was given an estimated 45 minute wait. I didn't get seen until almost 1am! Later to find out that there was no PA or NP there- only ONE doctor on duty. Aside from that, the waiting room is freezing! Now, I've heard of doctors offices being cold, but this was ridiculous-thermostat was set at a low 69 degrees! Multiple people waiting to be seen asked for blankets. If you want a good doctor for (somewhat) immediate care, then yeah, I would suggest this place. But if youre not that sick & can wait until the next morning for an actual appointment at a regular clinic, that is highly recommended.
