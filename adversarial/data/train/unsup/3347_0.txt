Great location in downtown. This stadium is surrounded by some great restaurants and bars. It is probably a good idea to grab some food\/drinks prior to the game, unless you enjoy spending $8 for a drink and $5 for a hot dog.\n\nThey are located right next to Quicken Loans arena. \nIt was a great experience at the ball game. I got free tickets from management at work and we had seats in the clubhouse, apparently all the food was on the house, I'll take that. Hot dogs were delicious, pizza was far from good, they need a new pizza vendor. Overall it was a great experience and I would definitely go, hopefully when my SF Giants come to town.....
