Tom has painted for us for many years. I have and will continue to recommend his and his Company to every one of my friends. With Tom, quality is the thing that he and his guys exceed at. I'm sure there are cheaper painters out there, but if you want it done right the first time...Paint Arizona is the way to go. He has painted interior and exterior for us, plus did a great job on our cabinets ! Thanks for a job well done
