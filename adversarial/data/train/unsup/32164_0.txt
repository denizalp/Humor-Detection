Got dragged here with the rest of our group after leaving the Cosmopolitan, but I guess they're aren't too many great choices to grab some cheap eats on the way back to our hotel.  I don't regularly eat at Chipotle even back in San Jose, but I was exhausted and hungry after a raging afternoon.  \n\nI asked my other friends about what they usually order and decided to try the Burrito Bowl which I hadn't tried before.  Choose whatever you want in it, just like you do with the usual Burritos or Tacos.  The bowl was a decent size, but only tasted good during the first 5 minutes of eating it.  I'd get kind of sick of the taste of this food if I came here on a regular basis.  \n\nThat aside, the place was pretty damn busy with all types of Vegas weirdos coming through to eat.  There is a freaking Panda in the same space as Chipotle!  The tables were kinda small and we had to split our group up.  Had a pretty fun time eating here and coming off our afternoon drunkenness.
