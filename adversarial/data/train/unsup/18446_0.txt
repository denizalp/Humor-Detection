I wish I lived closer to this YUMMY!  Poke Express is located on the left side of the store (the north end) and it's narrow.  But what I like to do is to go in and order malasadas right away then walk straight for my main target: poke!  \n\nHow do you put that accent over letters?  This isn't poke like in poking people on facebook, this is pO'ke like.. uhh Pokemon, blah I don't know but this is delicious!  I'll always walk away with 2 lbs of delicious poke when I come here.  The couple that runs this is so nice and humble, even with the long line the person behind the poke counter apologizes for the wait and thanks you for waiting.  \n\nOn this particular day, I ordered my tuna shoyu and another poke and ate some of it right there while watching the remainder of a basketball game.  I wasn't rushed to go, I wasn't asked to move on, I was asked if I wanted something to drink.  I said no but the people here are really friendly.  And not only that but the poke is delicious!  I had to tell the guys (newbs) behind me that the guy actually makes them fresh for you and the empty container you see doesn't mean it's sold out.  The portions are perfect, the taste is fresh, and this comes really close to the type of poke you find in Hawaii.  Perfect 5 star experience whenever I come in, don't be shy too - just walk in and ask anyone on the left side for some help and they'll be happy to guide you and let you taste some poke to help you choose!
