I have been getting my Xtreme Lashes, lash extensions done by Stephanie at Body By Steph, since March. I Absolutely love them. They are so beautiful and I'm constantly getting compliments on how fabulous they look. Even at Church, and when I say that they are extensions they say Wow, I thought they were yours, they look so natural. I then say they are, I bought them. Lol, At Body by Steph,she has a full facility, including tanning, permanent makeup, facials, body wraps, you name it, she can do it. A major talent in the beauty industry. I've been a beautynista, (new word) a long time, and I'm impressed.
