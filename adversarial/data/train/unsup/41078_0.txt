When my computer crashed all I could think to do was go out, buy a new one, and lose all my documents, pictures, and data I had saved over the years.  But, I didn't do that.  I called Chris at SpeakGeek.  Chris was not only able to fix the crashed part but was also able to recover all my stuff. All of the pictures of my now 3 year old since birth.
