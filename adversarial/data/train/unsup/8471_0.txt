My hubby and I were staying downtown for one of our usual weekend getaways and when Sunday morning came around, we knew it was time to look for a cool brunch spot.   \n\nThis particular time we found a place we had book marked a couple of weeks prior in our Yelp account of course!  It was easy to find.  I've probably driven by there so many times, probably on our way to another brunch spot and didn't even realize it was there.  So glad I do now!!\n\nWe started with amazing cocktails.  After all, what is brunch without Mimosas and Bloody Marys??  They were just how we like them.  They were exactly what we always look for, actual flavor, not watered down sugar water.  So goooood!!!!\n\nThe food was perfection! You know me and my steak it was like I was being presented with a gift.  I loved the presentation.  My meal was so good, I use it as one of my photos in my Yelp profile.  Our server was super nice.  The atmosphere was super trendy for a Sunday morning, although you could see every age group covered.  Love the cool music. The outside patio was great for the families and their kids.  I can also see a birthday party happening there, especially with the great weather AZ has, it is an awesome spot all around!\n\nWe highly recommend Ocotillo.
