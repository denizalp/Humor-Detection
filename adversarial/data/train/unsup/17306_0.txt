Dined here last night.  Was informed after seated that an article in the local paper had brought in a crowd of business resulting in a shortage of supplies, exhausted kitchen staff and long waits.  We should have left right then.\nSo....long wait, small portions, and bad service.  The order we put in came out wrong but at that point we were so hungry, anything was good enough.  Won't be back.  2 stars for no food poisoning.
