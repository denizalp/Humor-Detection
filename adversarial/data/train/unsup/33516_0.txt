This place has great atmosphere for sports. There are tv's at every angle, even tv's in the restroom; never miss a play. Service is still really good despite the fact this place is popping with customers. The customers are respectful of each other...as in, I don't think the place will get so rowdy that a fight would ensue. I give it a 4.5\n\nThe food is decent. They have good appetizer and drink deals. I give it a 3.\n\nSo if watching a game with a beer with the guys is your m.o. Hit this place. If food is your priority, I'd say eat here but don't expect to be blown away with flavor.
