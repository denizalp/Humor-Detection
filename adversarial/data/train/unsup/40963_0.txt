So I read all of these reviews on Katsu before I went here with 4 friends and contrary to what other Yelpers say, I found this place pretty good but I do have some complaints, very few.\n\nPros:\n- Affordable price for AYCE Lunch, cheaper than most places\n- Staff was tentative and helpful\n- Food came out within 5 minutes\n- Sushi was fresh, good filling to rice ratio (there was more filling than rice so IDK what other people were complaining about TOO much rice)\n- Good selection of food (A la carte menu) and drinks\n- Takeout price for remaining food was good. $8 takeout for 15 pieces of uneaten sushi and deep fried items is fairly good \n\nCons:\n- Drinks did take too long to come out, the place was like 25% full\n- Limited selection of menu items (AYCE menu) \n- A menu item was sent to our table when we clearly didn't order it\n- Did get very loud near the middle of our meal when the Greektown parade goers came flooding, made it difficult to request\/ask stuff to the waiters.\n\nOverall experience was really good, would recommend this place to others if we wanted cheap affordable AYCE sushi. Downtown is good too but some places are expensive.
