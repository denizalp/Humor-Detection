I just broke my iPod touch 4gen by dropping it.  The screen cracked into a million pieces and we brought it over to them.  We dropped it of (and they were very friendly) and then went to eat. When we came back 30 minutes later, my broken, 5% battery IPod turned into an iPod with brand new glass (that was better than the one Apple supplies) and fully charged. The part that impresses me is that they had enough time to fix it and have it charged. Overall this is chapest, best place to get your product fixed!
