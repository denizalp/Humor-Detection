Daisy here is amazing! I have lived in Az since 1999 and never visited a nail salon that took care of my feet as good as Daisy! I am NOT an easy client and not only is the salon nicely decorated, they have good background music, the staff was very courteous and attentive. I highly recommend Daisy though, she is caring and extremely good at what she does. She has made a client for life as long as she will take me :-)
