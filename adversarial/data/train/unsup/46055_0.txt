First time visit and it won't be the last! Had the lox and cream cheese omelet which was a surprise since I wasn't expecting all the extras in it, capers, spinach, onion and I had avocado instead of potatoes which has never been an option in any breakfast spot I've gone to unless you pay extra for it. You'll have to try the cinnamon roll instead of toast, it has a cup of the frosting on the side to dip it in after its pulled apart out of a tea cup that it's baked in, a yummy pre breakfast treat!! The decor is cheery as there are umbrellas in the ceiling that spin and the wait staff wears pajamas.
