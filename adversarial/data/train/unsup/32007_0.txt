Water leaking from upstairs bathroom to kitchen ceiling. Entire ceiling bubbled. Jeremy came out and through process of elimination determined the cause and repaired it. This company was 33% less than another quote I received on the phone. Also, much less than I anticipated paying. I will use them for all future plumbing needs. I can't recommend them enough.
