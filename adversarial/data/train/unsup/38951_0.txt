So this was a special night. We drove 36 minutes because it was the only restaurant open this hour (wife and I both work overnights and rarely get the same night off).\n\nFirst wife ordered a BYO burger with a veggie patty and avacados as one of the toppings. They were out of avacados... OK np. Then waitress MacKenzie (whom herself was wonderful although quietly spoken) comes back and says they are out of veggie patties... ok awkward now.\n\nSo then she orders French Toast Slam. Wifes french toast was grossly undercooked. Her hash browns were undercooked. Her scrambled eggs were OVER cooked.\n\nI ordered double cheeseburger with nothing on it except cheese but added bacon. Cook forgot the bacon. OK np, by then we were already blech so it was kind of a \"that figures\" moment, so didn't make a tiff just asked it be taken off the check. \n\nAlso my fries were way overcooked. I barely ate half and if u knew me ud know I never only eat half my fries, even when they aren't great.\n\nMy double cheese burger, although missing bacon, was REALLY good otherwise. \n\nObviously they took the wife's food off the bill but MacKenzie also gave us an additional discount for everything else being crappy. Which wasn't her fault, not really sure what happened in the kitchen tonight though.\n\nThe burger itself and MacKenzie are the only things that got them any stars. Everything else was pretty disappointing. At least the 40 minute drive home gave me time to write my first Yelp review. Just wish it was under better circumstances (no I'm not driving).
