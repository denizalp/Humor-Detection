I was thoroughly let down with Vida.  I had high expectations going in and I just don't think an \"American\" Mexican restaurant can cut it.  I'm way fonder of the various chain Mexican restaurants in the area.\n\nI first attempted to come here this past Saturday around 9:00 PM.  Walking up the place looked really nice and the patio only had about two tables seated.  There was a bouncer with a rope, before the door, at the base of the steps that asked if we had reservations.  I didn't, he says there is about a 35 minute wait.  I'm thinking, ok how is the patio empty and the place still has a wait?  Needless to say they did not get my business that night.\n\nI came in on the following Tuesday night, the place was fairly empty and luckily no bouncer waiting to tell us about a fictitious wait time.  I came to watch football with some friends, I know its not really a spot to do that, but the bar is ok and had a couple decent sized TV's.\n\nService was pretty good, I'm guessing on account of being very slow and empty.  Talk about over priced drinks!  $9 for a shot of vodka, get real.  Its not a night club.\n\nFood, my lord, how can a place attempting to be a high line Mexican joint be so bleh.  Plain, no flavor, PLAIN PLAIN PLAIN!  I ordered the shrimp tacos, a friend of mine ordered fish tacos.  We exchanged one taco each to try them.  The fish supposedly came with a chipotle sauce, didn't taste it.  The shrimp tasted like run of the mill shrimp.  If you ask for the grilled corn with queso, dont get the queso.  No flavor, kind of gross actually.  Corn was not sweet at all either, don't even know how to describe it.  Guacamole dip was actually pretty good just as everyone says, but the chips are way WAY over salted.\n\nAll in all I did come in with high expectations.  I expected great Mexican food and Vida just did not deliver.  I'll stick with the trailers sitting on corners for good Mexican food!
