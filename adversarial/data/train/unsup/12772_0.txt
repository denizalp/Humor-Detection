Went here for a mani\/pedi before my foot surgery. First thing that should have tipped me off to the caliber of this place was getting my manicure at the same time as my pedicure and having to hold my right arm stretched out across my chest so the guy could do my right hand (God forbid he get up and go to the other side!) I like to relax when getting a manicure and this surely was not! I guess they are in a hurry so my feet hardly soaked initially at all! Which explains the horrible way my feet looked when I got to the car. I used my ped egg on my heels the next morning before the surgery and it did the trick. If I would have known the results would be this bad I could have just used the ped egg and saved $40!!
