Chodang serves the kind of food that you can only find in Los Angeles.  Not only is their food delicious, they're open 24\/7!    The decor of the place is really nice and it's a nice clean place.  I recommend the tofu soup here but I would pass on the bibim bap. Despite being served in a hot stone bowl, the rice is pretty soggy and never crisps up. \n\nDefinitely give this place a try if your on this side of town. 3.5 stars!
