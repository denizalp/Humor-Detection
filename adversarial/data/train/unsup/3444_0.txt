I had to stop betting on football because you would have done better flipping a coin or throwing darts at a sports magazine than how I was doing with my NFL stuff.  But if you like this sort of game, the Wynn is a really nice place to do it.  It's close to the parking garage and all the seats are big and comfy leather.  There's a great deli next door.  They've got big screens.  Everything's just gorgeous and nice and the experience that you expect the best casino in the world to be.  You can walk a few hundred feet next door to Encore and see the new \"Sinatra\" and \"Botero\" restaurants.  Classy.\n\nBut the sports betting is a tough game - you can say I should wear a tin foil hat, and be watching JFK murder conspiracy movies.  But the Detroit Lions, first team to go 0-16 in the NFL ever, a really awful team, were playing at Green Bay today.  A pretty good team  to bet against, eh?  They're awful.  Away.  You might say, hey, I'm not a big bettor, but this is a giveaway, I'll take the Packers at -10.5.  You would have lost by half a point.  Here's the point spreads:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.covers.com\/sports\/nfl\/nfl_lines.aspx\n\nSure, the record bad lowly Lions lost the game, but a bet on them would have won, they covered the point spread by the slimmest of margins.  It's fixed my friend.  Go play roulette.
