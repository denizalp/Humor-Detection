So I've been traveling often to Phoenix and frequent the Sky Harbor Airport.  Overall, it's a pretty efficient airport, filled with good shopping, restaurants and a pretty decent American Airlines terminal.  Why then only 3 stars?  My gripe is the rental car setup.  I have been using Uber for all my transportation needs when in Phoenix, but my last trip required me to have a rental car.  It took a good 20-25mins for the shuttle to get me from the terminal to the rental car center and although there is a beautiful new state of the art rental center housing all the rental car companies, I found the transportation time needed to get your car extremely time consuming due to it's distance from the terminal.  When departing, I had to allocate a lot of extra time to sufficiently return my car and get to the terminal without missing my flight.  I realize this all takes planning and time management but I cant help but think if my schedule ever gets thrown off where I'm delayed or I'm in a rush I'd be screwed.
