Why are we all being considerate about pricing in our review? What ? Money grow on tree for you? \n\nPad sea eew = $16\nWonton Noodle Soup = $12\nHaw Gaow dim sum= $5.50\nSeew Mai dim sum= $5.50\nTea =$5.50\/person\n\nWe came here for lunch after last night of debauchery LOL. The server greeted us. Here in LA tea is free but not in Aria. These tea are grabbed from snow-capped mountain in ChingChongPoo, China. Tea pickers have to climb 15,000 feet with nothing but ropes to pick these tea leaves. This is the story they like you to believe to justified for the tea pricing. It's rare and taste divine! So they tell me. \n\nThe server said,\" We have these special jasmine tea for $25!\" And at the same time and at the same motion my friend and I pulled back and said \"EASYYYY!!!\" It was pretty funny when we realized we said it at the same time and pulled our head at the same time.\n\n We looked at each other and laugh! What's in a tea? Tea leaves and water! Go fuck yourself with the scam! Sorry I don't know what got into me today. It's weekday and work carries over hahhahaha Oh I know I've been watching Gordon Ramsey \"F\" word show and he cusses alot sorry Love. You should see how he bitch slaps his \"Commie\" (staff). Funny stuff. Yeap I was at the wrong end of that bitch slap before and it made me a stronger person. What can I say sometimes it's good to take it in the chin. It toughen oneself.\n\nFood was ok, but it's pad see eew how hard is that?\nNice dining area.\nFriendly waitress\nRidiculous price for pan fried noodles\n\n$60 total for two people, getting gang bang by Aria priceless.
