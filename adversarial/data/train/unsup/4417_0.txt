We came here for a reiki session and I was okay with mine but the other halfs session was weak. \n\nWe came in and they had us share a room together and I had asked them to balance our chakras first. \nIf you haven't had reiki before I'd suggest you read up\nOn it and the benefits of it. \nWe went through our session and at the end of the session they asked how we felt and I felt better but the hubby did not.\nThey didn't come out and openly share what was going on during the session and I had asked them. \nMy person was spot on and he explained everything that I had felt during the session to a tee.\nMy husbands therapist said that his chakras were all good from the beginning which wasn't necessarily true as he was unbalanced and she didn't elaborate on the true points of where he was having issues. So that was disappointing.\nI almost think that energy was taken from him instead of given but only those two would know this.
