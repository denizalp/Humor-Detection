Harrah's have ran it's course. Perhaps it's time to bring in the TNT. Other than location and convenience I don't see any benefits of staying at the Harrah's. The hotel is very outdated. You can see and smell the age of the Harrah's. The lobby and rooms reek of cigarettes even in the non-smoking rooms.  \n\nThe other frustration is the malfunctioning self check machine. I get it, you're trying to be innovative by adding touch screen junk to your lobby. It certainly isn't useful when Aunt May haven't caught up with latest technology yet. Hell, it was even frustrating me, a male in his mid 20s. It kept saying my driver license was unreadable. I look to my left then my right and both patrons was having the same issue. That's the downside of adding new technology.   \n\nThe only reason I'll stop by Harrah's next time is for Hash House and maybe drop a couple dollars in the slot machine.
