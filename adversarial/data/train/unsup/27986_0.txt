Inside the amazing New York New York lies this wondrous restaurant. Very great atmosphere and dining decor. Food was great. We had brunch and lunch. Our server was nice and efficient. There was, however, an awkward moment when what looked to be the owner or manager yelled at an employee in the middle of the restaurant. Come on, take that into the office, please.
