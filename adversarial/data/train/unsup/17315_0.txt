Stepped in for an early lunch. After browsing the extensive menu I went for the Mad Caesar salad, extra Mad Spice. I had tried some of this salad at the Yelp event at the Hilton Village location and had to have it again! It was prepared to order, and the salad maker was very considerate in making sure I had all the toppings, amount of dressing, and spice that I wanted for the salad. The salad itself had a nice balance of romaine, tomato, crouton, dressing, and cheese. The slow cooked chicken in it was very tender and went well with the salad. As always, I'm loving the Maine Root soda fountain.\n\nThe only real negative was that there were a few large chunks of romaine stem in the salad which were very hard and not very edible to me. I ate all of my salad except for those hard chunks.\n\nDefinitely a great spot for fresh salad and tasty drinks.
