After Happy Hour last Friday the J-Man and I found ourselves not in the mood to go home, but in the mood to continue our fun out in downtown Phoenix. After meeting with 2 of the most bad ass Yelpers at our place- Stevey P and Mr. K- we headed out to Hanny's to meet with more of Yelp's best- Bonnie G., Erica O., and Lauren V. Hanny's proved to be a fun and interesting place for us to relax. \n\nWe didn't try any of the food since we had eaten earlier but we sampled the drinks and explored the space. I ordered up a mojito, which came with an unexpected dark rum float on the top. It was strong on the liquor but not on the mint. Perhaps next time I'll try a mai tai. After that I sampled a drink brought over from AZ88, the Moscow Mule, which was very nice and refreshing. The bar area is nice and large, the bartenders friendly. The prosciutto slicer in the middle is, um, well its odd. \n\nThe space is incredible. There are so many areas to explore, nooks and crannies to find. Some are cool (room of light and mirrors, white room, upstairs balcony, front part of the upstairs that overlooks Adams) some are creepy (the elevator shaft freaked me out, the stairs up to who knows where√¢) However, its clear that the space was a department store. The central bar on the main floor was obviously the cosmetics counter and my husband kept getting whiffs of a floral smell, which I have to assume was the ghost of a crazy perfume lady past. \n\nI think Hanny's has great potential...there are no other places like it downtown. It just needs people. So please, everyone go there. When do you hear me say that in a Yelp review? Never. But Hanny's is within walking distance of my place and could be a great destination downtown when one wants to enjoy a night at a nice lounge.
