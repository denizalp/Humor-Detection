i didn't stay at the cosmo but had friends who did so we spent a lot of time in their rooms before going out.. \n\nrooms: good sized rooms, comfy beds, big bathroom, and balcony.. \n\nfood: ate at holsteins and wicked spoon.. yumm.. didn't get a chance to try the \"secret\" pizzeria so i'll have to do that next time\n\nchandelier: so amazing to see in person\n\nmarquee: hmm, still on the fence on this one.. smaller than expected and those stairs! ouchh.. \n\nthis hotel is very modern and sleek.. i wouldn't mind staying here on my next trip..
