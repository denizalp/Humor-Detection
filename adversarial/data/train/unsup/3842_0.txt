A yummy dining experience, thanks Gordon!\n\nHubby and I are not big turkey fans, so in recent years, we have taken to searching out non-traditional Thanksgiving locales.  Being a fan of Gordon Ramsay (a bit of a crush?!), his shows on t.v. and last visit loving Gordon Ramsay Burgr, hubby made dinner reservations with Open Table and we showed up at the appointed time.  Our half booth\/chair table was ready and we were sat almost immediately.\n\nThe decor and general vibe is a bit loud, a bit fun, large open area looking out into casino, with a mix of slightly different appointed areas of lighting, seating and various artwork.  The table settings were unique, including the flatware.  Service was efficient and friendly and our waiter would come back with answers to our questions without being prompted to.  \n\nAppetizer:  4 stars for English style Nachos, delicious hot freshly cooked kettle chips with a terrific sharp English cheddar, a delicious English TP sauce and corned beef bits and tender short rib.  This could have been a 5 star contender but the chef was stingy on the meats.\n\nMain Courses:  4 stars for Fish & Chips and 4 stars for Steak & Ale Pie. High end ingredients in both, tasty, tasty tasty. I opted out on the chips for chive truffle oil mashed potatoes and that was delicious.  The reason the 2 main courses didnt receive 5 stars are due to the fish batter could have been crispier and the steak & ale pie was a tad on the small size for a main course.\n\nDid you save up room in your tummy?  I hope so because below was the only true worthy five stars!\n\nDessert:  5 stars for Potted Chocolate Trifle, perfection and a must for chocoholics!
