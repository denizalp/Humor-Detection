Good God, what a nice buffet. I remember coming here two times this past year and both times were great. Three plates and dessert is usually the limit for me.\n\nThe setting in which you eat is actually quite elegant. There were a lot of floral designs and flowing curtains, if you're into that kind of stuff. The servers were pretty attentive and brought back refills and bussed plates pretty quickly.\n\nI found out that sodas and teas didn't cost extra. All this time I was torturing myself with water because I thought anything else would cost extra.\n\nI did notice that a lot of the food is Asian oriented. Could this be because most of the people who gamble are Asian?? Is Mr. Wynn really Mr. Nguyen?
