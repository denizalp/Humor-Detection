me and my friend went there for lunch for the first time, waitress had no idea what she was doing, the chef had to step up and answered simple questions over the menu\n\nMe: hello chef what are your specialties here? \n\nChef: oh im korean and i make great short ribs! \n\nMe: ............... I literally just paused \n\nDont get me wrong, With all due respect I love korean short ribs but when I am at a sushi restaurant and I would like to eat some fresh sushi but he decided to offer me short ribs? \n\nI mean I could have gone to a Korean bbq place for that lol
