Come here for the talera or the sweet breads (reminiscent of bakeries in LA), but maybe look elsewhere for wedding cookies, tres leches cake, and other specialties. Freshness is inconsistent, not clear whether they bake fresh on-site daily. Availability of coffee is infrequent but pairs well with most options. This isn't a fancy bakery caf√©, more like going to your friend's grandma's kitchen after school and asking for a snack. Super low prices, but they have a high card minimum ($10?), ATM available at the taco shop next door.
