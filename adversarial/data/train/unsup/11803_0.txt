I didn't know what was ordered for me, or why it took 30 minutes to arrive, but what I received was absolutely ridiculous.\n\nNow I was pretty hungry, it had been a night out that reminded me of my youth, however on this day, I was a graying 30 year old, who needed some late night food.\n\nI was not prepared for what I received.  I was under the impression I was getting a steak and cheese sandwich, what I received however, was a delicious endless abomination.  It was a gyro chicken tender and french fry sandwich, with a mozzarella stick packed in its behind for good measure.  What is this monstrosity?  I took one bite head on without modification, and nearly collapsed from the enormity of it.\n\nEventually I slowly deconstructed this mammoth, first removing most of the french fries, after realizing the contents of the sandwich I decided to cull a few chicken tenders off the top, those had left me full enough to where the rest of the sandwich - which looked like a delicacy a few moments ago - was making me sick from how full I was.\n\nI debated packing the remaing 80% of it up and eating it for the next few days, or perhaps shipping it off to Africa where it could surely keep a small village going for 2-3 weeks.  However it unfortunately ended up in an empty bag of Doritos and then in to the trash.\n\nFat Sandwich - I don't know what you think you're doing, but please carry on.
