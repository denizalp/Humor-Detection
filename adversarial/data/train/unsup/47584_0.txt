Came here because of a jajangmyun craving and I heard it was the best place in the area, and I completely agree!\n\nA regular bowl of jajangmyun was only 6.99 but some of the other types (seafood, fried) were 8.99 which is still extremely cheap. The bowl was pretty big even for the regular one, and I had to pack home half of it. Usually I don't like how leftover jajangmyun tastes but it was still awesome!\n\nMy friend had the jjampong, which I'm not usually a fan of but it was actually pretty good here too. It was also really cheap ($8.99). They have other items on the menu like Korean sweet and sour pork, which has a small option at $13.99 (I think) which I will definitely come back to try.\n\nThe service was pretty slow, but I'm not sure if it's because we had an awkward seating spot that was a bit hidden. It's hard to complain when it's so cheap and yummy though!
