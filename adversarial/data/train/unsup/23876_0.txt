I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE CLOSING DOWN ON ME!!!!\n\nCall me crazy but I planned an ENTIRE Vegas trip just to get one last opportunity to see The Phantom of the Opera at the Venetian before they close....\n\nI don't know what it was this time around but I liked it even more this time...I appreciated the auditorium, the sets, costumes, music, performances and overall production even more and was so moved, I was brought to tears during the closing scene...\n\nWell like they say, all good things must come to an end and that unfortunately includes The Phantom of the Opera at the Venetian...I hope whatever replaces Phantom is just as breathtaking and beautiful (although I heard from someone at the Grazie desk that they're trying to get Shania Twain to fill the spot...wish I was kidding....)\n\nFAREWELL PHANTOM!!!!!!!!!
