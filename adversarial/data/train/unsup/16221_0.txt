This place is so bipolar. It is a sushi restaurant wanting desperately to be a trendy lounge. The people watching is very entertaining. Women who were past their due date but proudly display the silicone and gingerly step in 6 inch heels supported by matchstick stems. Men who were overtly comfortable with showing of their fashion palate. Couples who owned the room next to ones who seem more timid than bambi in a forest fire. \n\nAnyways, still just an exciting atmosphere. The place is split into a long bar, backlit pink and a long set of dining tables seating 2-4. The sakitini menu is impressive and worth a try despite the obvious mark-up.\n\nFoodwise, you're really expecting much? Okay. As for the famed ebi shooter that EVERYONE seems to rave about? OVERRATED. I can see it being novel for some people who don't dine much but seriously, it is an oversized hand-roll with shrimp, tempura bits and a soy wrap shell. If this is their signature piece, they need a new gimmick. Bottomline, avoid it and if you really want, lie and tell people you had it.\n\nTheir food is bipolar as well. The hot plates were extremely mediocre. Everything is salted to the hilt. Perhaps the top fell off the shaker? We tried the black cod which was very tender, but nearly salt-infused. The egglant shrimp plate was even worse. Not edible.\n\nAhh.....but the good stuff. Their nigri is fresh and their maki ($13\/roll) are well constructed and flavorful. Especially their orange and black and hotate tuna rolls. Very nice...saved the night.\n\nOverall, this place has its warts. But then again, the atmosphere is definitely impressive, people watch, knock back some overpriced sake and order the maki.  Three stars this time, but I could make it four next time.
