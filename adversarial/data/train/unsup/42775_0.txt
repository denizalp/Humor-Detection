I normally go to the Marc's on 306 and Mentor Ave, eventhough this one is only a mile away from home. Today I went in and I was reminded why I don't shop here anymore. It is dirty. Certain things I touched were sticky, like the meat section and the OJ section. Their refrigirated section is discusting. It has not been cleaned in eons. And their employees have got to be the most unhappy people in all of Mentor. Needless to say, I won't be going here anytime soon. There's a Giant Eagle in the same area. I ask myself why I didn't go there?
