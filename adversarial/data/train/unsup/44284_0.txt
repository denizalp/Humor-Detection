I used them about a week ago on my day off. I scheduled a appointment in the shop because the last at home service we had was horrible. Decided to give another shot. The initial arrival was good, got in and out in 1 hour. Then after being home for about 2 hours went to run some errands and saw the trim on the window looked as if it was lifting or not glued correct. Drive back to shop and the tech says \"it's just cosmetic should be fine\". Cosmetic or not it still was not correct and I live in Az I couldn't risk my trim \"melting\" off. After speaking with a manager she ended up scheduling a at home service that same day. On the way home from all that, my rear view mirror fell off mid travel. Needless to say someone showed up and said the entire trim couldn't be removed with out taking whole window out?! So after another hour and a half the guy finished. I Wasted way too much time handling what should of taken an hour in my day.
