My experience with their care was fine but their billing is a horrible mess. I had appointments back in January\/February\/March  and my Insurance company still has not received appropriate billing information. I have invested hours and hours of my time over the last 3 months to try to work with them to get this resolved and there is no sense of urgency on their end to get this corrected. This has cost me well over $1000 out of pocket. Based upon my experience, I would recommend you go elsewhere as this organization doesn't care enough about their patients to try to get their billing correct.
