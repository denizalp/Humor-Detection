This little bakery has some AMAZING baked goods and ice cream. We've had the lemon tart, turtle tart, earl grey and peaches ice cream. I recently ordered an 8\" turtle tart for a birthday and everyone raved about how delicious it was. Service has always been very friendly and the employees look like they really enjoy being there. Whenever I leave this place, I've already planned my next visit!
