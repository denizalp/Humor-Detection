I have always wanted hair extensions but felt my hair may be too thin. I contacted Connie at Bella Mi and she set me up with a consultation and the next day I was getting them put in. It's been about 3 weeks, I love my hair! It does take some getting used to for all the newbies thinking about doing it and some practice styling and putting it up so nothing shows. I am glad I did it though! Connie is super friendly and willing to work with you if you feel any discomfort. I do have some itching that I read is pretty normal though. She guarantees her work. I will be seeing her for my touch up next week and she can assess how often I will need the maintenance. I hope the hair last a year as quoted. I received a lot of compliments and people I haven't seen for a long time do not even notice I have extensions. The color match is perfect! The only negative sides to my experience was 2 long waits after my scheduled appointment time and I thought the Brazilian blowout would have left my hair straighter. It did remove the frizz but I still have a wave if I do not blow dry it. Since my hair is naturally wavy it was recommended to do the blowout first since the extensions I picked are straight. Other then that all went good as expected and I would recommend Connie as she has many years experience with extensions.
