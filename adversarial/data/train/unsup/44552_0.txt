Bait and switch.  \n\nThey seemed like nice guys when they first came and quoted me a price for some work.  But then they didn't show up when they said they would.  Eventually they came and did the work but since they came late in the day they could not finish that same day, resulting in me being without gas service for an additional day.  In the end they told me that the job was \"way harder\" and they were going to charge me triple (yes, TRIPLE) the quoted amount.  I paid them the quoted amount.  I will never use them again.
