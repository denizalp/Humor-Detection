Another stop on my tasting tour of the day  Sweet thangs awaited us inside, sweet decor, sweet staff and sweet cakes Oh Boy, I could have gone into a total sugar shock. \n\nI decided to try a few cupcakes, carrot , red velvet and a coconut \n(see pics) all artfully decorated. \nI loved those marshmallow petals atop the red velvet, they made for an interesting flavor and texture. Each cake was filled with a cream and lightly topped with very sweet spread of frosting and edible adornments.\n\nNot wanting to over do the sugar factor I also ordered a tuna sandwich to share with my guest. (see pics)\nTuna was made with cilantro, red onion and lemon juice offered on  a croissant. \nI asked if they had any other bread because although I like croissants they are quite fattening and I had already eaten enough pastries for the day. Unfortunately the only other bread offered was Iron Kids White?? Really!\n\nThe sandwich was good though, it definitely cut down the sugar high.\n\nAlong with some lunch items they also serve a few breakfast items, other cakes, bars, cookies, pies, muffins and scones as well as coffee and teas.\n\nI'm giving 4 stars for being more of a cafe and serving real food, and although on the sweet side, the cupcakes were good, not the best though.
