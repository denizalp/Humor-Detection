What a hidden gem!  Coming back from Boulder city we simply lucked out and found this place for lunch.   While we enjoyed a place almost to ourselves, I fully expect it to be packed next time we come to visit.  And we'll definitely come back!   We had Cesar salad, shrimps Po-boy sandwich and chicken wings.  Everything was delicious, and chicken wings were \"awesome\" according to our 11 y.o.- and that's high praise coming from him :)
