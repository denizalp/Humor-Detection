I was so craving some New York style pizza with the thin crust and huge slices!!  This place has just that...We went in evening and it was candle lite and nice ambiance music.  We got a Vinnys special and could pick 5 toppings...ricotta cheese, meatballs, smoked mozzarella, green peppers and mushrooms....Delish!\n\nAnd the bruschetta as an app was very good also!\nmy sister works here so, go ask for the Texan that works there ad be nice and tip well...lol
