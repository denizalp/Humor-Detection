As this was my 1st experience of All You Can Eat sushi, there are a number of words that I want to use to describe to you how I felt at the end of this meal. \n\nWords like \"disgusting\", \"bloated\", \"obese\" and mainly \"self loathing\" were the ones I was tossing around as I wondered how I would write this review. But you know what word REALLY sums up surprisingly delicious sushi in quantities that would shock a Sumo wrestler?\n\nGlorious.
