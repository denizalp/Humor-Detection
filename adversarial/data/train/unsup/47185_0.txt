Originally, my son and I took his bicycle to Marty's in Avon Lake for a repair. The gears somehow got stripped, almost as if it was cut. I was told by one of the employees that, because it isn't a very good bike in the first place, it isn't worth repairing and there was really nothing they could do.\n\nWe then took it to Century Cycles in Rocky River, where they were happy to install the $18 part his bike needed. In the opinion of the guy who helped meat CC, it's a perfectly good kid's bike. Excellent customer service and not a hint of \"bicycle elitism\"!
