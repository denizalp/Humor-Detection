Stumbled upon this place because it looked so ma and pa.. you sit yourself by the way.\n\nI RARELY eat fish and chips and I felt adventurous today, so I went ahead and ordered- whoo. Besides, the rest of the menu was breakfast items and I wanted to get something different!\n\nThe Crispy, hot, flat pieces of fried fish over a bed of fries and cool bowl of coleslaw made my day. It was comfort food that hit the spot. The server especially caught my attention because she was on top of everything and made seafood recommendations to me as I went up to pay. She didn't seem like a waitress that hated her job.\n\nThey close at 7pm on the weekend- what's that all about? :(
