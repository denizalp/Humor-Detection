Here is an update:\n\nI have lost 15 pounds through DeRosa medical.  The staff has been so supportive.  I have weekly weigh in's and every time I arrive, everyone is pleasant and polite.  Nancy is whom I had seen for my most recent visit, she went over options and discussed my weight loss, including what to expect and next steps.  I have between 10-15 pounds to go and I truly believe that with their support I will attain my goal and maintain it.\n\nIf you are looking for a medical practice that tends to your needs, I would recommend an office like DeRosa- they care and have my health in their best interest.  Additionally they always tend to my needs and listen-truly listen...not the eyes wandering off and not paying attention, but listening to what I am sharing regarding my health.
