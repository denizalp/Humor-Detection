Very nice! Carpet looks good and close to new again after a while with just regular weekend cleaning. Pricing is reasonable and as-is with no surprises plus Rick and Lynn's touch of personalized service... They also came within the appointment timeframe agreed. All those combined with their quick and prompt service. I'll use them again when the need arises next time around.. Thanks again guys!
