Terrible company - purchasing the car was fine (although getting to the deal was hard - they kept trying to move fees around - I get it they are trying to make a profit).  The finance guy was high pressure and rude and would not stop trying to push gap insurance on my husband and I - we explained we get it from our insurance company and he pretty much called us stupid).  Since then the company calls me no less than once a month after I have asked repeatedly for them not to - I just bought a car I don't need another one and I don't want them calling - the latest call came in today - it was the straw that broke my back - I refuse to ever do business with this Company - I will never buy another car due to their inability to follow a simple instruction not to call me.
