Yes, this place is \"really cool\" - if you're a college student or on the lower end of the socio-economic scale. (Would Vision Quest last a day if they were in North Scottsdale? I think not. I'm just sayin'....) I think it's incredible tacky, not to mention unethical, for retail stores to do readings in full view of other customers. You're browsing the books, minding your own business, and you have to hear other people talking about their divorce and other personal stuff. Do I really need to hear that? Some of the customers evidently have no shame (and would probably YouTube their doctor's appointments, too, if they could), but some of the readers should know better. Long story short: If \"New Age\" for you is all about spending $$$ on expensive workshops and seminars and buying crystals and books and CD's, like that Cake song \"How Do You Afford That Rock'n'Roll Lifestyle,\" but only \"How Do Afford That New Age Lifestyle?,\" you'll love the place. If, on the other hand, you're mature enough to realize there's nothing \"spiritual\" or \"new\" about any of it, it will leave you feeling a little cold and short-changed. It's too bad this place is the measure against which other metaphysical retailers are judged.
