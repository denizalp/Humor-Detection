I wish they had more choices for non meat eaters but the green eggs n ham was a hit. i opted out of the ham, and was in love with the pesto and waffle. i wish it were even bigger because it was very tasty. i could eat 3 of them. they have beer too which is great but at $7 for basic beer, i would just wait.
