Five Guys Burgers...  It's alright.  The food tastes good, and they pour the fries right into the paper bag your burger comes in.  I guess this is supposed to be \"awesome\" but when you get right down to it, it's rather obnoxious.  There are many things I like more that ripping open my greasy paper bag in a specific way, so as the fries don't spill everywhere.  For example, I like being able to take a container of fries out of my bag, and then take the burger out, and proceed to eat in an orderly fashion.\n\nEnd of the day, the basic Five Guys burger tastes just like a Whopper.  That's it.  That's all it is.  Except rather than being 2 dollars on Wednesday, it costs a fortune.
