Im surprised that people say this gym is clean. Unless I completely missed it, there is no cleaning supplies to wipe down the machines after use. One of the treadmills I was on was caked in dog hair and not once have I ever seen a staff member cleaning. The machines were all dirty and gross. \nWhile working out (with headphones on, in a full jog) one of their trainers interrupted my workout to talk about training. Ok fine, whatever.... but then when he said \"well youre not fat but you have some weight to lose and I see you carry it all in your stomach, I was like...... gee thanks!\" haven't been back since and will be cancelling. The cardio equipment is squished in and hard to move around, weight area is nice. Staff is every unprofessional. Never got that \" I cant wait to work out\" vibe from this place. Sucks too, because its in the perfect location for me!
