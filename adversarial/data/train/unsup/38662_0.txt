Went there during restaurant week and it was incredible! The rolls were amazing. There were a variety of kinds, all delicious. We had a three course meal for $30. For our appetizer we had salmon tartare. It was exceptional. I had the salmon and my boyfriend had the duck. My salmon was okay, but my bf loved his duck. We had the spoon bar to share as well as a fruity dessert. The menu is quite pricey, better to go during restaurant week. Overall, we loved our meal. We would definitely go back during restaurant week. Atmosphere is very upscale, and the restaurant looks very elegant.
