Great food an excellent pricing. Great service, prompt & pleasant.\nVery accommodating as our group of 5 arrived at 9:30 pm and there was no rushing to get out! BBQ ribs were as good as the best i have eaten. Appetizers much better than average. Desserts excellent. Fries fresh cut, yum. Highly recommended by all at our table. Larger wine glasses would be only improvement! Thanks for the great meal.
