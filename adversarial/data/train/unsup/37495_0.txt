Another weekend roaming around building up an appetite. Me and my cousin ventured to this place in the 168 Market shopping center (across the street from China Mama). I was surprised by the store front sign only being in Chinese and Korean with no English on it and headed on in. The place was not very busy but the owner greeted us warmly into a modestly decorated dining area with light green walls and several pictures of various nature type scenes. My cousin was craving Cha Chiang Mein (Jajangmyeon). He's been inquiring all week where he could find this dish and thats what led us here. We ordered the Cha Chiang Mein ($6.25) Kim Che fried rice ($6.95), Mongolian Beef ($12.95) and the Fried Dumplings(8 pcs. for $6.95) (AKA Wor Tiep, pot-stickers or Gyoza). \nThe Cha Chiang Mein (http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/2d8lbnq) is nothing to look at consisting of a black bean paste (nearly-really black) sauce over noodles with some veggies and pork but was very tasty similar to a Hoisin flavor.\nEverything was very delicious and was priced reasonably, about $35 for the two of us. I'll probably be back if the cousin wants the noodles again or try the other types of dumplings.\n\nAfter dinner speaking to the owner they are Chinese who grew up in Korea which points to some of Korean influences and Shandong is a province near Korea as well.\n\nPros: Quick service, the dumplings are huge and handmade.\nCons: I want my Mongolian beef spicy hot, I'm unsure why everywhere I go now its just a sweet stir-fry of beef.\n\n\nPhoto I found of the place. http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/22lmfqu
