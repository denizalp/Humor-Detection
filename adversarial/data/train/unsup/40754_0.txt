I came in with severe sinus pressure and congestion. After a week of dealing with this I was at my breaking point! The staff here was so nice and efficient! Devone the front desk girl was quick to get me checked in and very sweet! Miriam was the medical assistant and was such a joy to talk to as well. Jay Gunnell was the provider who saw me and he was incredibly knowledgeable and attentive. He explained everything to me and really took his time to understand my symptoms and find a way to get me feeling better as fast as possible. They really made my whole experience here great! I couldn't believe how gracious, efficient and caring this office was! I will definitely be back!
