I've been wanting to try this place for a while. Finally made it in for a late breakfast the other day. The space itself is adorbs. The service is amazing! And the food? Incredible! \n\nThe boy has a sweet tooth... so we started with the donut holes. They come with some really yummy dipping sauces. \n\nHe ordered the vanilla bean french toast.... which was amazing. The toast is so thick that even with me helping... we couldn't finish! I ordered \"The Chicken or the Egg\" which was a delicious combo of fried chicken and an over-medium egg (that's how I ordred it) with avocado and roasted tomato. YUM. \n\nThis is a definite winner in OC. Loving that such a yummy place is right down the street.
