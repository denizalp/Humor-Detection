After drinking at an open bar from 8pm to 1am I decided that I clearly needed to drink some more.  My friends were at O'Shea's and suggested that I come by and play beer pong.  Beer pong?  I'm IN!  \n\nThis is another of those low budget older casinos that are now a dive with cheap beer and drinks and I'm sure cheap buy in on the tables.  But the most important thing to know is that in the back they have rows of beer pong tables.  Just buy your $10 pitcher, get some plastic cups and a ball and go to town.\n\nI know it is hard to believe that I have never played beer pong even though I am a consummate drinker.  So what better way to pop my beer pong cherry than by playing while in Vegas.  I got in on a game with a new friend that had been playing beer pong with my friends earlier.  We were a great team and rocked our first two games.  At first I did think UGH I cannot believe we are drinking beer after that ball went in it since the ball has been bouncing all over the floor and had people's grubby hands all over it.  But I am pretty sure that all the alcohol killed whatever germs were floating around and I've already had my flu shots so I'm good.  I'm still alive 4 days later so it isn't gonna kill you so post up and play!\n\nI am DEFINITELY going to put O'Shea's in the Vegas rotation next time I come back!!
