Not quite sure what all the Yelp-hype is over this place. It's certainly adequate, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get back here.\n\nDazzling modern restaurant (what a douchy name!) serves up Toronto's most overdone cuisine: \"Asian Fusion\". The menu manages to offer Thai, Chinese and Japenese, plus a sushi bar at the back.\n\nThe food was quite good! I had a thai green curry with chicken ($14), It was served with coconut sticky rice. The portion was decent and the curry was rich. The rice was delicious; it wasn't quite as \"sticky\" as when you get it served in a bamboo basket, but the coconut flavour more than made up for that.\n\nMy dinner date had some kind of spicy lemongrass chicken ($12) which also got 2 thumbs up.\n\nDecor is nice, staff were attentive, but overall I just felt like this place was trying a bit too hard to be cool.
