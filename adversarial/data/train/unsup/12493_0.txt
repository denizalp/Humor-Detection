I live in state about 10 years and I ate over hundred Korean restaurant over here. Be an Asian I love Korean food especially BBQ. However, I have to say the food and service right here is awful in my whole experience. 1. It's my first time to seen a bbq restaurant grill to do bbq without oil. We checked with a waiter and he said we don't use oil here. Excuse me ? With out oil do you guys know how hard to cook meat? 2. Each time I must call by myself if I would have a services. No buddy helps cook and no buddy coming. 3. Food like fast food, come on. \n\nAnd yes , the price is really good. But I won't come again
