Holy delicious! I never knew I could enjoy vegan or vegetarian food sooo much! Luna's makes eating healthy fun and different which makes it that much more interesting. \n\nFirst off, the. Restaurant itself is great...it's so clean inside, the employees are really friendly, and they have indoor and outdoor seating. I would say the inside decor is somewhat hippish but it's not so overboard that you feel awkward if that's not your thing. It's very inviting inside and they have some near artwork up. \n\nSecondly, the food!!!! Amazing! I got the a avocado and basil sandwich but instead of bread got it wrapped in collard greens. Omg I could not get enough. It had so many different tastes, the most prominent one being freshness! The hummus added a richness to it and even though it's now a lot of food, that definitely helps to feel more full after. Everything from the onions to the sprouts to the tomatoes made this sandwich. And how could you forget the a acacia, yum! I could eat them plain and be satisfied so this only made it that much better! You get a side with every sandwich so I got the kale salad, again deelicious, especially the dressing. \n\nAnd then dessert...oh man. Got the berry lemon cheesecake, so good!!!! And again tasted so fresh! I really liked the pecan crust, completely different than \"normal\" cheesecake but it almost felt healthier....almost. \n\nI cannot wait to go back and try pretty much everything but specifically the burgers!
