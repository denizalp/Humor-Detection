This place just keeps getting more and more crowded! Isnt there a limit to how many peopld can be crowded into a gym at one time..i just left, bathroom was disgusting,  couldn't get in a good workout because equipment was always full. No place to really stretch as you have so many circus acts going on on the middle..i mean really, do we really need all of those silly little contraptions that you have to do a simple work out..lol.
