I really enjoyed my margarita pizza and spaghetti. I went there every night when I was in town. The place is awesome. Not only was the food good, drinks tasty (raspberry lemon drop), and the staff was awesome. Donte was absolutely positive and helpful. He greeted us immediately and was super friendly.  Thank you Wolfgang puck!
