This place is a hidden gem, for sure. You can find me here for brunch any day.. love the intimate feel and amazing service! They have a private wine room that's perfect for a small group dinner.. bar and dining area with a small dining space upstairs that would be ideal for a group of 10! I ordered a special carnitas omelette with avocado.. the red sauce and cheese makes the dish unique and extra tasty. My friend ordered the chicken quesadilla, and we shared a Caesar salad- both items were great! And they have pretty big portions. Our other friend ordered the Heidi pasta- they make their own noodles, and it is truly delicious! Would be ideal for a first date for sure!
