I've been here a couple times before. It was pretty good. My favorite drink I think was called the chunky monkey. Chocolate and peanut butter and if I remember correctly I got it blended. I had some good memories there. I remember when I first started going to my church back in 2012 that's when I remember visiting. I went with a couple friends. And every time since I got that same drink. So I couldn't tell you if anything else was good. But the drink I got definitely was.
