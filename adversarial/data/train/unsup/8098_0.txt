This review is for the nanny service they provide at Town Square. I have gone to some of their events in the central green area like their Wed. story time and that's always great but until yesterday I hadn't ever used their mall nanny service. I'm only sorry that I haven't done it before. It was amazing! I was able to go to get my hair done at Look Society (only reason I chose that place is because I could get the babysitting service at Artsy Nannies, which is just around the corner.)\n\nIt was immaculate and there's a shop section with nice toys etc and then there's a gated off play and craft area with a staff member there to handle things. Milli was too excited to even bother saying goodbye to me. I signed a quick info sheet and it was completely no drama. \n\nWhen I returned a couple of hours later, Milli was happily playing with three other kids and it was super calm and under control. She just got out of diapers a week ago and she was completely dry- they had handled her potty training upkeep perfectly. She had done some painting and made some crafts. Have I mentioned that it was SIX BUCKS AN HOUR?\n\nOn our way home, Milli kept asking to go back to \"school\" to play. She was totally happy, clean, and cared for. Now that I know I can trust them to handle everything, I will definitely take advantage of it. \n\nAnd moms- if you need to get some shopping done or hair etc, it's perfect for that. \n\nBOOM.
