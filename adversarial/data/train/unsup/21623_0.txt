Note to all: do not DO NOT go to the store after 10pm on wknds cuz it's a biznatch to even enter the store. \n\nThe lines for Marquee, which are right next to the shop, are crowded and blocking the entrance of Crsvr. It's like you gotta pass Marquee's velvet ropes just to go in...\n\nBut, I brought guy friends into the store (and they are avid sneakerheads)and they loved the stuff. Especially the new Lebron and Kobe stuff.
