As a kid I burned my skin to a crisp repeatedly while surfing in Hawaii, before the advent of effective sunscreens. Blisters and peeling face were actually a badge of courage back then..... That said I know my way around a dermatologist practice.\n\nI have spent countless hours in derm waiting rooms, to eventually be seen by  harried P.A.s doing all the work while the actual Dr. steps in for 30 seconds (if that) and then leaves. \n\nAfter an exhaustive search of the net for a Skin Doc. in Charlotte, looking at reviews, training and Board certs, I found Dr. David Schulman...\n\nHarvard trained\nBoard certified\n20 years of experience\nSkin cancer specialist\n\nI made an appointment in days not months. It was a drive to Pineville from Midwood but completely worth it. No wait, Dr. Schulman spent more time with me than his PA\nand more time than any other derm doc ever. The skin cancer screening was literally the most thorough I have ever had. The office and staff were great.  \n\nHIghly reccomended.\n\nUpdate 6\/5\/12\n\nDr. Schulman deserves more stars ! \n\nok for more than 10 yrs have been a wimp about getting a large thing removed from the base of my neck right on my spine .... (not my head)... previous derm docs said 2 + inch incision big scar, expensive, scary .... bit the bullet went to Dr. Schulman because of my previous experience with him.  incision less than an inch, \nvirtually painless ( neck and wallet) no stiches means little scar. \n\nIf all docs were like him, I wouldn't  be so reluctant !
