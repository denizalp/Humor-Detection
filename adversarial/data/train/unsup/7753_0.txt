DimSum wouldn't be my reference here, but I'd like to give a 5 star for a new delish plate that I tried last Friday here with my fellows: Baked cat fish rolled with rice paper and mixed chili-tamarind-pepper sauce. The thing is, you have to call ahead to reserve this food because it can take some preparing times within 30-45mins. We ordered lobsters first, but then there were all baby minion lobsters so we might as well tried other specialties. I think we hit a jackpot when a party of 5 who ordered this came pretty late, so of course we had a pleasure to shorten the wait time for this one.\n\nWe arrived at 7pm, got seated right away in the middle of the pathway. We ordered crab meat and asparagus soup for appetizer, Singapore Mai for the add on, the baked fish, along with some boosters for a fun and warm night with friends. \n\nThe waitresses who served us were amazingly charming and friendly. They already knew what we wanted ahead of time without even have to clarify. \n\nThe soup is tasty as always, we had the selections of soy sauce, chili oil and pepper on the side in case we wanted some extra flavors. We didn't touch the Singapore Mai because we saved room for the main plate. And here we come, a giant big baked fish with numerous garnishes... My mouth is watery just to think about this delish plate. I forgot to mention the bill was pretty decent too.\n\nGood food, good company, and greatest service ever. We will come back.
