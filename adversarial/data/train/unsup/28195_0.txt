With this restaurant being just around the corner from my house, I decided to give it a shot. I was a little skeptical as the shopping center seems to be a little sketchy, but don't let it fool you, this place is damn good. Prices are in line with other Vietnamese style places and the quality is excellent. Service is fast and friendly and luckily it isn't ever hard to get a table.
