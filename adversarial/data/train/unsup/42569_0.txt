We loved this restaurant!   We ordered the half fried chicken, and multiple sides.  We started with the cheese & watermelon appetizer; that wasn't my thing - the cheese was mild, but had an aftertaste.  We also ordered the heirloom tomatoes and the classic biscuits.  The homemade jam with the biscuits was amazing.  That was enough for the two of us.  \n\nThe service was impeccable.\n\nMy only complaint was with the vodka drink that I ordered; the Albert's Collins.  It was served in a tall glass, but, was filled with one block of ice.  If it didn't have an ice cube, it seriously would not have been more than a shot.  Way too pricey for the size of the drink (imagine that, an over-priced drink in Vegas!)
