I have been working with these docs for 2 years.  Although it was a rough start, I am finding that they are taking excellent care of my dogs.  Before moving to AZ I had the same vet for over 10 years and trusted him 100%.  I do alot of comparing the new office to the old office.  With Prestige, I think we are now on the same page and I trust them.
