This is probably our new favorite spot to dinner dine in Vegas- (but don't worry Bouchon you are still breakfast and brunch). It's new- only opened in May and worth your stopping in for. \n\nAs you well know, Food in Vegas is amazing these days and with Chica you have the yummiest Latin menu of them all- Not overwhelming choices, not retread Mexican but a really inspired combination taken from all over South America.. first time here be sure to get the roast chicken and the octopus appetizer. The steak with an artsy plate smear of mole could definitely use more mole\/ but nothing the waiter couldn't happily fetch more of. The waitstaff here have always been friendly and passionate.\n\nThe design of Chica  is also lovely - and you know I am a stickler for details design wise.. the plates and dishes are very special and worth a note here.\n\nGreat for a big party too!
