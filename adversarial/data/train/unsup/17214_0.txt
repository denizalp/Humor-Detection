Overrated. NOT. \n\nI literally booked a one night Vegas trip just to eat here! When we came that night, they told us they were not taking any walk ins because they were fully booked for the next three days. I didn't have a reservation! But luckily, the seating at the bar was first come, first serve, so we waited til someone left. \n\nOur experience here was 5 stars across. \n\nOur bartender\/waiter was awesome. We ordered the pre fixe that came with the scallops, beef Wellington, and sticky toffee pudding. In addition to that, we also ordered the lobster risotto and the dry aged ny strip.\n\nThe scallops - O.M.G. They were amazzzzinngg. The sear was beautiful and the flavor was spot on. The only disappointing thing is they split the scallops in half, and really, were getting 2 and a half scallops. But it's sooo good, that it's still worth the $$$$$$$$. \n\nThe lobster risotto - another O.M.G. Amazing and def worth the $$$$$$. It would be nice if this came as an entree. It is just not enough as an appetizer! \n\nThe beef Wellington - I have always been curious about this dish for as long as I've watched Hell's Kitchen. This dish was a 4\/5 for me. It was tasty and so, so tender, but wasn't as crazy as I was for the first two dishes. \n\nThe dry aged ny strip - 4\/5. Very tasty. It came out a little salty, but nonetheless, it was flavorful and tender. \n\nThe sticky toffee pudding - very good. Although, I wish I had more ice cream for every bite with the pudding. But this dessert is so unique and quite a surprise! \n\nI can't wait to come back! Forrrreals.
