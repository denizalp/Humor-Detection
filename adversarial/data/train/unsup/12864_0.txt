I had a very lousy and miserable experience this past week when I attempted to have dinner here. I sent the restaurant an email with a complete description and they didn't bother to acknowledge my email.\n\nYet, I am not surprised given how rude the male hostess treated me and how much of a peanut gallery the servers behaved like.  I have never been treated so rudely and been insulted by the hostess before. I am never returning to this place and will continue supporting one of the many other Italian restaurants in the neighbourhood.\n\nHow appropriate that they are named Old. They treat single patrons with disdain and younger patrons with such rudeness, like an old man looking with contempt to the new generation.\n\nI am never again coming to La Vecchia.
