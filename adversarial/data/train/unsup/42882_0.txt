What an absolute treat. Unfortunately, we arrived shortly before closing while passing through town and didn't have as much time as I wanted to spend here, which probably could have been all day. On the rough industrial edge of Pittsburgh, Bicycle Heaven is a dreamy escape into the wonder lost world of whimsical bicycles in all their strange glory.  They've got pretty much everything. The sheer aspect of the museum of it all and is enough to be in awe of. This is where kids dreams go to live on when we all grow up.
