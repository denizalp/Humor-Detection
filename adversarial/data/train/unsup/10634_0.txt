It was a Friday night date night and CK Tavern was the place that was picked, it was his pick and I was going with the flow.\n\nWe were seated ordered our drinks, then the conversation just started to flow, our waitress came by 2 twice to see if we were ready to order and to be honest we hadn't even picked up the menu as of yet. She then told us to let her know when we were ready, and after an hour went by we took her up on that offer.\n\nI wound up ordered the Chicken Cheesy Phil with a side of fries. This was a great little sandwich, chicken was perfectly cooked, the bread soft yet firm. It also had the perfect amount of cheese too, not too little nor too much, I have to say I really enjoyed my sandwich. \n\nWe wound up staying for few more hours, and I had to ask him why he picked this place because he is neither into baseball, football, basketball, and he said it was because it was close to my work. Scored him some bonus points! Haha \n\nCK's a great place to catch some games, grab a drink or just hang out with some friends, glad I gave it tried, and look forward to coming back! \n\n**oh because this was a 1st date night, I wasn't fully comfortable with exposing my Yelp Nerd yet, so no photos were taken :( haha **
