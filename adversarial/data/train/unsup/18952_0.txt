As a sad Marylander that gets disappointed every time I order any thing crab related out here where I live in Southern California, I was super happy to learn that I needed to head to Vegas this weekend for an event and would have some time to eat at Crab Corner. \n\nIt was JUST like being at home! The only thing missing was the river side picnic tables and the humidity. This place gets it right! The hush puppies were delish, the peel and eat shrimp were served hot just like they should be and the dozen crabs were a god send! \nI also sampled the Maryland Crab Vegetable soup and was pleased. It could be made a bit better by adding just a little more spice to it, but otherwise it was great.\n\nTo all east coasters that are transplanted anywhere within a few hours drive of Vegas this is a must go! The location is miles away from the strip, and easy to find. \n\nMy only issue is the lack of any lacrosse sticks hanging on the walls and no Naval Academy Blue and Gold anywhere. Perhaps this Annapolis girl should send some gifts their way.\n\nThe prices are reasonable and about the same as to what I am used to spending on crabs even at home in Maryland. I know some reviewers mentioned price but I would have paid triple what they charged and still been happy!\n\nBy the way the owners are super nice and friendly and it was fun to hear an authentic Maryland accent from someone that was not a character on The Wire or a member of my family!\n\nI will be back! Next time I'm trying some crab cakes!
