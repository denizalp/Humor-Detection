Man look...\n\nI've heard many stories of this burger joint and finally had the chance to try it. Anticipating a meeting with heavenly beef, my hopes were set high. Before I could get my second foot thru the door, I was greeted with a welcome and a smile. I looked around and it looked homely. Nothing too fancy. More like an old hot rod without all the gaudy stickers...subtly hinting at \"this car's gonna dust you, but it won't let you know\".\n\nThe food: Again...man...look...I ordered the bacon cheeseburger w\/ lettuce, tomato, & grilled onions. And fries. Gotta have fries. Because fries. Took my first bite and totally forgot about every other burger I'd ever eaten since living on the west coast. As ketchup ran down my chin and my cheekbones began to sweat from the all-beef patty experience, I had a couple well seasoned fries (big enough for a man's hands) and decided this was the one for me. Dood! The fries were everywhere! I felt like everyone in the building was staring at a caveman. Myself. Turns out they were all into their food just as much as I. I also got globs of ketchup on my phone as I live tweeted my entire meal. \n\nI'll be going back again. Great service! Great food! My meal ran me $12 including the tip I placed in the jar.
