We had a great first time here. There was no wait for a nice table placed next to the center bar area where we had a good view of the entire restaurant pretty much.\n\nWe had the Lamb and Salmon. It was absolutely amazing. My personal fav was the Lamb even though I ordered the Salmon ;) we also had some Lobster Bisque, Avocado Fries, Shrooms and Colossal Shrimp all of which was to our liking.\n\nOur waiter was polite and helpful with his food suggestions\n\nThe music was a little on the loud side but we could hear each other because it was a small table.\n\nI think all and all we will go back and might recommend.
