If you are in the area and hungry, there is no better option than to order a quarter chicken and fries and Ramados. Montreal is home to some of the best Portuguese rotisserie restaurants, but none offering charcoal-fired chicken at affordable prices like Ramados. The combos are packed with generous servings of chicken, fries, and salad, so there are no worries of leaving unsatisfied. Don't forget to order some natas to finish your meal! \n\nRamados is a take-out restaurant, but there are two or three tables inside. However, there is no better place to enjoy your saucy, charred chicken than the nearby park on a sunny afternoon!
