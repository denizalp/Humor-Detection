Had the everything bagel and potato bagel with chive cream cheese and they were  pretty good. They are not the traditional chewy style bagel but more of a soft pretzel texture which is ok as long as you like that kind. The service was good but they weren't that busy either. They have a good selection but they don't have my favorite which is salt bagel. If you want a authentic bagel go to Bagelmania on Twain.
