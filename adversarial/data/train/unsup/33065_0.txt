Harkin's Superstition 25 is one of my favorite places to go see movies. I love how it's HUGE with 25 theaters!! It even has a bar which is cool. They are quick with getting you your tickets & I like how it's so big & roomy that it doesn't seem crowded even when a lot of people are there.\n\nToday when we saw our movie, it took a while in the popcorn line. There were a lot of cashiers, but they would say they were not open or you would see another one counting money from their register & they were closed. That's why I deducted a star & gave them 4 stars. If the cashiers are on the floor, they should be ready to go & help customers. That way, the wait won't be as long. The staff is friendly and I love how this Harkin's has a good variety in the movies that they show, so I will be back!
