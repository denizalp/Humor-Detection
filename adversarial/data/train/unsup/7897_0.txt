Apparently the University of Phoenix just ignores you when you have a problem with them. \n\nAfter two posts being deleted on Facebook I will take my voice to Yelp:\n\nOne year ago, I had a death in my family. I asked for a short time off to go home and be there for my loved ones. When the request was denied, I did not let that get in the way of being there for my family. \n\nSince then, The U of P returned a loan I had taken out for my next quarter of schooling, because of this, I now own the $500 dollars. This $500 dollars is now preventing me from continuing my education and even more recently it is effecting my ability to purchase a house. \n\nMy future has only been effected negatively from my time at the University of Phoenix.\n\nThank you.
