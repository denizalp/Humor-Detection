AMAZING ice cream. Put A Cone On It offers very unique Asian ice cream\/gelato flavors, some of which I've never seen before. Instead of the simple \"Green Tea\" ice cream you see everywhere, you get Hojicha (which is unrefined tea!) that tastes very light and fresh, and the tea bits provide nice texture. They rotate a few tea ice creams, from green teas to black teas to Earl Grey (my favorite!). They also have a green tea leaf and white chocolate bits combination that I've never seen anywhere else.\n\nWhat I really love about this place is it always avoids that syrupy heaviness that most dense ice creams can have. Their black sesame has a wonderful graininess and if you look closely has a neat texture.\n\nThey add a 2-dimensional cone to the top, which I eventually realized made it look like an upside down ice cream in a cone. This is honestly what made me come here, I was sitting in the bubble tea place next door and I saw a lady walking down the street with one on a hot Summer night. It caught my eye and I went looking for its source. I've been coming here ever since! You can ask for a chocolate or vanilla cone, but I prefer chocolate.\n\nDon't be afraid to ask for samples if you want to try a unique flavor, the staff are very friendly.
