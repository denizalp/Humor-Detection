Had a friend recommend this place. So I went here today. The shop looks pretty cool and the names on the donuts are funny. \n\nOnto the donuts........ They look amazing, but that's where it ends. They did not taste like they looked. It was a let down on the taste buds. The donut itself was dry and not really moist, which they should have. \n\nThe staff was very friendly and courteous. But charging me $3 more to pick my own dozen was pretty lame. My dozen came out to just over $17, which is pricy for 12 donuts. \n\nSo, overall it's a 3 out of 5 stars. They just don't live up to the hype. Like a gorgeous super model with Trump's mindset.
