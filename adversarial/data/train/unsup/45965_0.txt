Very cute coffee bar with great decor! I stopped by for a coffee and wanted to buy a slice of roll cake but couldn't afford to... it's $5.25 for a slice of the smaller rolls. It's pretty and all but I don't think I'll ever know if it's worth it. Just slightly shocked at their prices! I wish they had a larger selection of pastries. Huge fan of everything else though! I love their tiny kitchen behind  glass so you could see the chef at work!
