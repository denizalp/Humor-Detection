Filib's what can I say. If you are craving your basic Mexican taco shop this is the place! I am just excited that one has opened closer to home!\n\nPersonally I love their burritos, nachos and quesadillas. Filib's is my go to place when I am hungry and need a quick meal.\n\nBTW I still do not agree with Yelp, burritos are a food group, DARN IT!
