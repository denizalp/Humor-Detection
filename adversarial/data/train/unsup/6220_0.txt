Great dancing, absolutely no singing at all. If you like watching Britney dance around to her own CD, this is the show for you! \n\nI really did enjoy the show even though she was lip synching. Her dances were entertaining and the back up dancers were awesome and energetic.\n\nThe drinks were strong and expensive, $24 for a cranberry vodka but it comes in an awesome Britney souvenir cup! \n\nI think it's one of those things you have to do once while you are in Vegas, just to say you did.
