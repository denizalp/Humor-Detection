This is the best yakitori restaurant in town! \n\nWhen we walked into this new restaurant, the interior was stylish the sushi bar located in the heart of the restaurant and there's many booths around it, there's another separated area almost like a private room will sit comfortable for 10 people.  \n\nWe sat to the sushi bar like we always do in a Japanese restaurant.  Most of the dishes are tapas style and they are kind of dandy.  So feel free to order more! And dont forget to order the house special as many as u can.  \n\nThe service is superb and food is amazing.
