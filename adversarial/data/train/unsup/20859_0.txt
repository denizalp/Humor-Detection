wow, well lets just say it makes Panda express look like a fancy gourmet dinner.\n\nI was starving and i wasn't craving anything while i was walking down Downtown Las Vegas. Actually me and my girlfriend couldn't decide what to eat so basically we ended up here. We saw the chinese food and it looked alright and took a chance anyway. We also saw the .99 cent shrimp cocktails so we got one of those too.\n\nThe chinese food was terrible, probably because it had been sitting on the heater for a while. The shrimp cocktail wasn't too bad and better than the chinese food.
