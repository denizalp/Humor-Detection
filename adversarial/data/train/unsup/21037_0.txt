They've been around for a while and it's been a long time since I've eaten there.\n\nThey serve American-style cuisine consisting of subs, burgers, pizza and fries. They got pasta and chicken, too.\n\nTheir subs I found to be tasty and I had no issues with food quality.\n\nWith the plain decor and run-of-the-mill menu, they may not be the King of Subs anymore, but it's still worth a gander if you're passing through Ville St. Pierre.
