After the radio show wraps up to unwind and just hang out with the crew and guest grab something to eat and catch a movie(something to review on the next show) normally we go somewhere close but after last weeks fiasco at Sam's Town(see review on here) we picked somewhere close to home- Regal Cinemas Texas Station 18 as you walk in they are polite they tear your ticket they asked to check my bag(totally understand that one)The concession area was very clean was and easy to navigate(unlike Sam's Town) The Theater was clean and cool(temp) We watched our movie and enjoyed ourselves...we will be talk about this on our show Sat night...good job Regal Cinemas Texas Station 18 We will be back
