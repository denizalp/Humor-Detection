My family and I stayed at the Monte Carlo for the weekend and had $50 credit for each room to use on any of their selected Las Vegas Blvd restaurants. Since it was a Sunday, most of the restaurants and kitchens closed at 11pm and our only option was 800 Degrees. The employees are extremely friendly and patient with nine of us telling them what we wanted on our pizzas, which was great. If you've ever been to Pieology or Blaze, the concept of 800 Degrees is pretty much the same with the freedom of picking any and every topping. If you don't want to customize your pizza, you can opt for one of their specialty pizzas!\n\nMy family and I ordered a chicken and pesto pizza, a pepperoni pizza, and one of their specialty pizzas, which was sausage and peppers. Immediately I noticed that they don't have grated mozzarella and simply just distribute a ball of mozzarella on their pizza. Other than the cheese, they're not skimpy on the toppings! Our pizzas arrived less than 5 minutes after I placed the orders and each of us had 2-3 small slices. Honestly, for the price ($9-$15 a pizza) I would have rather saved the credit and use it the next day at a different establishment. The pizzas, except for the chicken and pesto, were bland and the crust was extremely thin. I also want to mention that there was some sort of bubble on the pizza on the specialty pizza and the employee remade it and checked on us to see if we were satisfied with our food. Great service!\n\nIf I didn't have the $50 credit from Monte Carlo, I probably wouldn't choose 800 Degrees. I am, however, impressed with the exceptional customer service practiced at this establishment!
