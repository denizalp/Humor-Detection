Always love a pizza and salad from Barros. The food quality has always been great but the service provided by their younger staff members could be better.. Some of the employees look straight out of high school and need to work on their attitudes.\n\nOrdered food from the wrong location last night, and the manager took care of rushing the order as well as canceling the order with the other store. Props to him!
