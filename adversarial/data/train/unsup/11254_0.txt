Upstairs restaurant in Market Square was a good spot for a bite before the Penguins hockey game.  It's not a large space but adequate with a long bar and tables throughout the long but narrow space.\nTV's are all along the bar area, service was friendly, efficient, and fast.  I like that our server actually asked us if we liked what we ordered.  This used to be a usual thing but not so much anymore.  My husband wasn't going to complain about his beer option but since she asked if he liked it, he had to be honest and said \"not so much\".  Well, our server promptly said \"no problem\" and she'd get him something else.  She insisted.  How nice is that?!    I ordered a bloody mary and requested celery.  It was ok, nothing too special about it but oh, how I did appreciate the celery with it.\nOn to the ordering.  The menu has lots of grilled cheese options so we both selected one of them.  I opted for the mac-n-cheese grilled cheese.  They all come with tomato soup and chips.  The sandwich was good but so very messy with the mac-n-cheese oozing out everywhere.  I think I would rather have had just the mac-n-cheese without the bread.  The tomato soup was good but was not a very large portion at all.  Chips were good -- I ordered them with parmesan cheese on them.\nThe noise level was a little louder than average -- not bad but it was filled with Penguin hockey jerseys and it was a bar\/restaurant and everyone was happy so it was to be expected that it was not a quiet venue.  \nAll in all this was a decent place to grab a bite and brew.
