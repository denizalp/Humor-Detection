I love diners. I love breakfast food. I love independently owned ANYTHING. In spite of John's Diner having all of these ingredients, it proved to be the perfect storm for one of the most uncomfortable experiences of my dining life. \n\nI HATE to have to write this review, but I was so appalled that people like this place I had to protest. It was filthy (I got a coffee mug with hot-pink lipstick caked on it), outdated, muggy, falling apart, the coffee was weak and the food was cheap - in quality and price. You say no-frills. I say the setting of a horror movie right before everyone gets murdered. I left with a new desperation to take a shower. I'm so sorry, I wanted to like it. \n\nSave yourself the discomfort and visit the real no-frills diners of lakewood: The Place to Be and The Coffee Pot.
