I have seen some magic shows in Vegas, and Mac King has beat out the others on so many levels.  You don't even need a drink to start laughing!  Yes, his act is that funny! \n\nHis tricks don't involve a lot of smoke and mirrors or showgirls and that's what makes it more impressive.  He can pull off a comedy act which could have stood on its own, but he incorporates wonderful, new tricks involving a \"cloak of invisibility,\" a goldfish, and a man in a bear suit.  Wow! \n\nDid I mention that prices are VERY resasonable?  A tip:  Go to some ushers standing in Harrah's and ask them for the \"two for one\" coupon to see Mac King.  They will claim that they don't have them, but slip them a 10 (that's Vegas for you) and see if their answer changes.
