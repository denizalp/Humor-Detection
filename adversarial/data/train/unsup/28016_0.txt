The place has a wonderful look inside but that is where the wonderful stops. We had a group of 10 and service was terrible. We were lucky to see the waiter 4 times the whole meal. The menu is limited and at $25-35 a plate less than stellar. The food was not good. Pastas was dry and not tasty. Then when one person at the table found a long hair in her food, the plate was taken away by the waiter that we had to request to see three times. And never talked about again until we got the bill and he quietly mentioned that it had been removed from the bill. No apology, no visit from the manager, nothing. I would not recommend this place to anyone.
