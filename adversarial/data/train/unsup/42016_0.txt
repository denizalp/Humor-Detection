I started off my quest for a shower remodel by seeking bids.  Wow, that was harder than it should have been.  I selected D&D as they submitted the most clear response to my estimate.  I did good this time as they did a fabulous job and the shower is stunning!  Everything was just as they promised, including a cleaning service to clean the rooms after construction was complete!  Nice!  Every question I asked was answered and no detail too small was overlooked.  I'm one happy customer!
