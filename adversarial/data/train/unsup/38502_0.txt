I have been using this service for about nine months now and I am extremely pleased.  My home is always thoroughly cleaned to my satisfaction. I am quite particular about cleaning and she has met my expectations. If there are ever any small issues, Pam has been very good about resolving them and making sure that I am a very satisfied customer. I did have a change of cleaners and when I was not happy with the replacement, Pam sent a different person that I am very happy with, Marlin (sp)is great! She takes the extra steps to clean those areas you don't always notice right away but when you do it is a delight that is it done! It is nice to know that Pam really cares about her business and makes sure that you are happy with your service. It is often hard to find a company that sincerely cares about customer satisfaction. Thank you Pam!
