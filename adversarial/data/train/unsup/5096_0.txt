Very bad customer service I was waiting for 2 hours and as we came to the clerk a African American women was rude to us and was causing me and my family anxiety I would not recommend nobody to come this airline learn to have some class lady  she wouldn't even tell me her name. People like her would not let others enjoy something they had payed for.
