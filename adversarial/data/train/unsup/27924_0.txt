I had a car reserved near the train station Enterprise for over a week.  However I was staying closer to this Enterprise so my hotel could take me over via shuttle easier.  I canceled the train station reservation AFTER I made the new reservation online this morning.  When I got there about an hour or so later the young lady at the desk said they had NO cars to rent. And she called me and left a message 10 minutes before I walked in.  On the Enterprise website they ask for a home phone number which is what I entered (I thought maybe it was for Credit Card verification or something...didn't really think about it) and since I am not home...I never got the message.\n\nI swear to God it almost turned into a Seinfeld episode:\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=A7uvttu8ct0\n\nJerry: I don't understand. Do you have my reservation?\nRental Car Agent: We have your reservation, we just ran out of cars.\nJerry: But the reservation keeps the car here. That's why you have the reservation.\nRental Car Agent: I think I know why we have reservations.\nJerry: I don't think you do. You see, you know how to *take* the reservation, you just don't know how to *hold* the reservation. And that's really the most important part of the reservation: the holding. Anybody can just take them.\n\nNow I have no car from either Enterprise and the hassle of finding a hotel shuttle or other means to get around town on sales calls for 2 days. \n\nThanks Enterprise!
