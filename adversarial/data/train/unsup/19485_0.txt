My car had been overheating yesterday on my drive home from work so this morning my first stop was to put some coolant in before I got on my merry way. After about 5 minutes of driving, my car shut off after exiting the freeway and I was thankfully able to start it back up and chug into Ron's parking lot. \n\nJasen, the manager, noticed me outside and asked if I needed any help and I told him what happened. He popped up the hood and said that his team would be able to take a look within an hour, so I made myself comfortable in their lobby. Not too long later one of the mechanics explained to me what was wrong, and another one took me out to my car to further explain what was happening. My car is my dad's other baby so he did some price shopping and he found a place that could get it done for cheaper, but the entire time the staff was more than friendly and I never felt that they were trying to take advantage. \n\nThey were getting a lot of traffic while I was there and by their rating, I thanked Jasen for their time and let him know I'd give them a call when I need to replace my tires. \n\nGood guys, nice shop.
