This place is an absolute MUST. Great patio!!! The food is very good. Not crappy bar food.  So far we've had the short ribs, burger, Greek Flatbread and Macaroni...EVERYTHING has been delicious. Service was great.  The restaurant just opened, so I expected a few hiccups, longer wait time on food coming out... but this was NOT THE CASE.  Service was flawless.  This will be our new spot.
