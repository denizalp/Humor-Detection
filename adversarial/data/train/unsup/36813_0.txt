To be completely honest, this place blew my socks off. This is the best Italian restaurant I have ever been to....ever. The food was cooked perfectly, the service was amazing, and the ambiance was spot on. I felt like I should have been celebrating a special occasion based on how fancy the place was. My only complaint would be the location; I swear it was like looking for the holy grail to find this place.
