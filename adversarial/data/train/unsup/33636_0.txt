Inconsistent service but overall never great. The last time I went for a pedicure and removal of my gel manicure color I was really disappointed. The gentleman seemed rushed. I was 34 weeks pregnant and after taking the gel off my nails he asked me to bend down and rinse my hands in the pedicure tub instead of suggesting I rinse them at the hand wash sink! When I checked out I was disappointed to see how much it cost just to remove the gel (no file, cut, etc), had I paid $5 more I could have had a regular manicure. Will not be back.
