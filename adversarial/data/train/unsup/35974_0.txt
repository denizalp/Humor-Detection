Had the \"Early Bird Special\" .\nEggs were perfect. Lots of bacon (5 pieces), that was also cooked perfectly. \nPotatoes were ok, I'd say average. Tasty, but more on the mash \/ chopped side, which lends itself to be more like mashed. They weren't crispy, but, we're still tasty.\nCoffee was hot and a bit above average.\nMy wife commented that the water for her tea was hot, which if you're a tea drinker, you know is essential. Most places it is not hit enough.\n\nWill be back.
