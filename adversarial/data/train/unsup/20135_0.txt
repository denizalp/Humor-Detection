A \"cool\" place, but if you don't have ironic facial hair and skinny jeans, then you might stand out. The cocktails are pretty tasty but you will break the bank if you plan on drinking them all night. Considering the neighbourhood is turning into a hipster haven, I guess places like this will become more common. I overheard a long and loud conversation about veganism and I wanted to blow my brains out. I would rather make love to a bag of garbage than listen to some curly mustache douchebag talk about ethical food choices.
