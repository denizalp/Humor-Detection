Their pizza was actually great but I'm giving them one star because they swapped my calzone with someone else's calzone. Normally this isn't an issue but I had cut a bite off the one I received and found out it was the wrong one. The guy then brought my correct calzone, took the one I had eaten from and went over to the people whose calzone it was. He asked them if he could cut the end off and give it to them. If they are willing to do this in front of the customers, what do they do behind the scenes? The funny\/weird part was that the other customer actually said it was ok to lop off a piece of their calzone and they took it anyway because they were under time restraints!!! Amazing! I'll never come back here again, that is a completely unprofessional and disgusting way to run a business.
