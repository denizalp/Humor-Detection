Today was my first experience driving a Lexus.  We are serious buyers and plan to pay cash.   At the end of the presentation I could tell you the salesman's life story and his idea of a test drive resembled an experience on a race car track.  Even after commenting on my lack of enthusiasm for his driving skills, he continued his race car antics, rather than emphasize the benefits of purchasing a luxury car.  To make matters worse, he shared that his accent was from northern Louisiana, which is similar to Texas and I shouldn't compare it with whatever language they speak in southern Louisiana, which is coincidently where my 96 year old father resides.  As he continued his life story rather the amenities of the car, it was determined that members of his family graduated from the same University where I attended college, but I wouldn't know them because they were obviously much younger.  As a senior citizen, I am proud of my age, but didn't expect to be reminded that other people are younger than myself while attempting to purchase an automobile.  I will be buying a new car in the near future, but not at this dealership.  If the general manager isn't aware that his salesman would be better off demonstrating  Corvettes, then he needs a wake up call.  The salespeople shouldn't be getting their thrill of the day by frightening the passenger, and then acknowledging I wasn't the first customer to be terrified.\n\nOn a side note, we did a test drive earlier in the day at the Honda dealership.  The cars were cooled off prior to the test drive and we were offered bottles of water due to the extreme heat.  For the price of a Lexus, they might consider the same service.
