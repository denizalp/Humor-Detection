Incredible Brunch! First and foremost, reservations are absolutely required. I am so excited to have found this little restaurant. Please know, it is best to just trust the dishes the chef has created. Refreshingly, this is not a place where you can get extra fruit on your pancakes...you can go to Stack's for that. These dishes are well thought out and crafted. Leave it! They make a VERY limited amount of freshly made donuts each Sunday. Make an early reservation if you want one. They open at 11am and were out by 11:45. The deviled eggs are amazing. My husband really enjoyed the Arancini.
