I have been to this location twice. I'm fearful of reviewing any Cox location because Cox Communications as a company has an abusive history of not being concerned with their customers true needs and interests, overcharging, increasing bill fees\/rates with little or very hidden notice.\n\nWith this location I am impressed. Plenty of friendly staff - checkin on the iPad as you enter, wait for you name to be called. Both visits during moderately busy times I was in the shop less than 15 minutes.\n\nMake this the norm Cox.
