I bought my wife a gift certificate for a facial as a Valentine's Day gift and both of us couldn't be happier. I'd seen mention of the services and since it is near my office, I made arrangements with Melissa to stop in and check it out. She was very friendly and showed me the office that she shares with other health and beauty professionals. Everything was very clean and nice and it all was very professional.\n\nMelissa even walked through the different types of services she offers and we decided to get my wife a certificate for a brightening facial.\n\nWhen my wife was ready, it was easy for her to make her appointment and set up her service. She went in that day and said that Melissa was very friendly and knowledgeable. She's had facials before and she said this ranks up there with the best, and more expensive, ones that she's had.\n\nSince she met me for lunch after she finished I also had a chance to see the results. Her skin looked clean, fresh, moisturized and rejuvenated. \n\nIf you're looking for a gift for a significant other or a loved one, or you just want to get a facial for yourself, check out SkinWin. Great service at a great price. I highly recommend it!
