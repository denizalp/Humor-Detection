Can I give a negative 100.  I cannot even begin to write the horrible service I received.  I will just say that after buying $3000 worth of kitchen appliances and 6 months of repeated issues of various forms from not receiving my items on promised delivery date to not receiving my store rebate to my fridge being dented when I received it and then just stopped working after 4 months to very, very bad employees to employee turn over to....the list goes on and on and on.  Nightmare experience.  You've been warned.  Just saying.  Never again will I step foot In a Best Buy.
