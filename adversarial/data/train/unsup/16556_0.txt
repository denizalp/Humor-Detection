I'm giving this race only one star. They didn't have the right sized shirt for me.  They handed me a large and I wear a small or extra small.  They said they were out.  I contacted WCT by phone and email and they wouldn't send me the correct size.  When I registered for that race I selected small because that was the smallest size you could get.  If you pay all that money and spend all that time training the least they can do is give you the right sized shirt!!!  argh!!!!  phew!\n\nBesides that the conditions were miserable... I did it in April of 2008.  They ran out of water on the bike course (which showed how poorly they planned for the bike course).  This made it unsafe for the racers.  Someone had told me after the race that the temperature was over 100 during the bike portion.  I will not be doing this race again.  Boycot m dot races!!!\n\nThe only good thing about the race was the volunteers.  They were very nice and extremely helpful!  Maybe the race is better now that it is in November.  Hopefully they have the t-shirt situation undercontrol!  I know many other race participants that got the wrong size t-shirt and were also very upset.  It's not the end all be all but it is a big deal when you spend all that time and money training and they can't do something as simple as that correct.
