STOP -- don t go here -- you will hate it.   Whew - that was close. I want to keep this place all to myself!   The people -- very nice and very friendly. The atmosphere is first class dive (in the best way) - it is comfortable, clean and very inviting. The food -- was an A+ -- my wife and I tried 4 different wings - and all of them were cooked perfectly and the sauces were great. The beer selection was good (and very cold!) -\nOverall -- I loved it and I will be back -- this really is a corner bar that has that hometown charm.\n\nbut don't go there -- its all mine!
