Here is the post I placed on their Facebook page:\n\nHello. I was at 1Oak on Saturday and I wanted to express the very unpleasant experience I had. I was staying at the Mirage with my girlfriend. We were walking in the lobby and and young African American male approached us and asked us if we wanted to be on the list. He said that the lady would drink free until 1am. I was also told by the concierge that I as a man, would be let in for free until Midnight. So we proceed to wait on line at 10:30. After waiting on 2 subsequent lines, I was charged twenty dollars even after presenting my room key. Then we were told to see a young lady about the free drinks. She then offered us 3 drink tickets and then 3 more if we \"liked\" 1oak on Facebook. I felt completely misled! My girlfriend is a heavy drinker and would have liked FREE drinks until 1am, not 3 drink tickets. This was a COMPLETE MISREPRESENTATION and I feel taken advantage of. Then to top if off, she was told at the topside bar that her tickets were no longer good after midnight. There were three other female patrons who were told the exact same thing and we all complained to the bartender as we were all told the same thing. I can tell you that after this experience I will be telling this story to everyone I know and I will be very hesitant to use any services associated with The Mirage moving forward. I will be copying and pasting this to the management of the hotel as well. Thank you.
