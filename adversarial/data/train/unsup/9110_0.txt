If you haven't tried Italian ice before it can be easily compared to shaved ice, but the texture of Italian ice is way more smooth and much easier to eat. My favorite flavor would have to be cotton candy it's not too sweet and made just right. You could even have frozen custard with your Italian ice. Rita's has other things to offer like milk shakes, sundaes, and cream ice, which is just like Italian ice but much creamier. Rita's is a great place to go to for a nice cold treat on a hot summer day.
