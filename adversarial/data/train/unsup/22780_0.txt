I know I'm supposed to hate Hot-Topic since it's a \"scene\" sort of place where high school suburban goths and nu-metallers get their gear and whatnot, but they carry all sorts of pop culture memorabilia here including Walter White bobbleheads, vintage Marvel Comics t-shirts, and such. It's also the biggest Hot Topic I've seen to date with walls lined with t-shirts featuring everyone from Slipknot to Tupac. So, there was a bit for me to gawk at as Kay insisted we come by so she could look at Monroe piercings. \n\nIt appears that Hot Topic is usurping Spencer's (word has it that teenage shoplifters chased them out of South Hills Village) , and considering HT's lack of more risque items (no sex toys here), it's easy to see why. \n\nThis South Hills Village locale even carries vinyl records, even if it seems weird that a (not half-bad) band like Avenged Sevenfold would be offering up vinyl versions of their albums. I didn't think that set was into the old formats like fans of black metal are. \n\nHot Topic is what happens when places like Eide's and Slacker go corporate and blunt their edge. Whether or not that's a bad thing I'm not sure. Hey, if it steers a few confused kids away from Coldplay, so be it. I mean, they did carry a bit of Iron Maiden merch...\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=XGmuq-i7cpE
