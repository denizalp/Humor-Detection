Had to fire Justin Rodriguez because he was not taking care of my pool. He allowed the filter for the Shear Descents to completely plug up; it hadn't been checked and cleaned in what had to be months. He also allowed the heater to keep running, which he should have noticed by the pool temperature.  All-in-all, not a good experience.
