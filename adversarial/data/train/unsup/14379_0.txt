What can I say, this Harris Teeter is lit! I am referring to the parking lot ha ha ha! I always feel safe coming here for late night snacks. The parking lot and gas station are perfectly lit for late night shoppers like myself.\n\nI've never had a bad experience. This location is clean, safe and the staff is nice. Personally, I love using the app to scout great deals on products. The inventory is pretty accurate which is nice. Here's a fun fact! For each product you select, the aisle number will appear. Cool right? Of course you can use the online shopping expresslane checkout, I haven't tried this feature yet. \n\nThere's a great selection of local beer and wine available, along with malt beverages and mixers. You can build your own six pack for $10.99. Last year I discovered the $2.99 Oak Creek wines, cheap but delicious!\n\nI'll admit some products are more pricey compared to other stores, but sometimes you have to splurge on your favorite Jalape√±o Cheddar bread that's $5.49. I know, I know! $5.49 for a loaf of bead? Why Shay? Whyyyy?!! It's sooo worth it!!! Side note there are half loafs available for a cheaper price.\n\nI've seen this area develop a lot, I really like this HT location. I hope this area continues to thrive with all the new developments.
