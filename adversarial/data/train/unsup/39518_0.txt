Wow! I was not expecting to find Caribbean inspired cuisine in the middle of the Strip District! My husband and I stopped in without a reservation, but we were seated outside immediately. Our server Justine was right on it, with cold water, and within a few minutes there was a pineapple-strawberry Mai Tai in my hand. \n\nThursday's are fried chicken night, and after seeing so many other patrons had ordered it, my dining partner couldn't resist! He also got the conch chowder which was delicious. The conch was sweet, and not chewy or rubbery at all - it tasted like conch chowder from a place in the Bahamas I've been too. \n\nI got the heirloom tomato salad and order of crab cakes as my meal. I loved the avocado pur√©e that was plated with the tomatoes- so flavorful, I will have to try and recreate it at home. My crab cakes were excellent too- sweet chunks of crab with a mango and red pepper salsa on top. There was a little something extra in one of the crab cakes, and our server was quick to bring me another order, she also took them off the check without me saying anything - I would have been happy to pay for them since they brought a replacement, but nice gesture. \n\nI live on the west coast, but will definitely come back to Kaya on our next Pittsburgh trip. I'm still thinking about that heirloom tomato salad!!
