The sushi and hot food were REALLY GOOD!!! But kinda sucks that they only gave 2 packets of soy sauce for a $70+ take out order. LOL. It would have been more enjoyable not to worry about running out of soy sauce.. will def come back for the good food though!!!\n\nEdit: They fixed the issue with the soy sauce packets yasss! They started delivering too so that's a plus!
