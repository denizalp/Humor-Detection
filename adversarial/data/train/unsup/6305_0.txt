After a few visits to Amorino, I truly believe that they are at the top when it comes to gelato and sorbet. \n\nService has always been pleasant, and the flavors have stayed consistent with the smooth texture. It still amazes me that Amorino can maintain that high standard of quality knowing that all of their Gelatos and sorbets are shipped from Europe! \n\nAll I know is that I'm very glad Amorino has chosen Las Vegas for their first west coast location, and even  happier that the folks at Charleston Outlets North asked  Amorino to open another shop that is even closer to home! ALOHA!!!\n\nShaka Meter:  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  5
