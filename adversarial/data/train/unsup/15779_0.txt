I was in Phoenix for the weekend and my friend took me here.  Walking in, the decor and layout reminded me of Corner Bakery Cafe or Panera Bread -- both of which isn't in Arizona at all.\n\nAll 3 of us ordered the Paradise Club.  She also got the Southwest Chicken salad and even though it was 105 degrees outside, he ordered the tomato soup.  His excuse - it was cold inside the restaurant.\n\nThe meat, lettuce, bacon and melted cheese was layered between a croissant cut in half and oozing of their mayo spread.  Everything was freshly prepared in front of you as you grab a tray and stand in a cafeteria-like line.   I was told that although everything is good here, they're famous for their cookies.  The best part?  It's free with your meal!\n\np.s.  The cookies were good.  In fact, I bought some later at the airport location to take home.
