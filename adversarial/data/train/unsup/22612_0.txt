This location is usually the one stop a few blocks away from my friends house. So we are either ordering door dash in the middle of the night to her house, or we are all heading to the restaurant at the butt crack of dawn the next day after get together when there is no branch available yet.\n\nI have been meaning to review this location for a while since I have been eating here for the past 10 years. So here it is. More recently just in the past week, I think I have eaten here three times. Just because it is close to where I am in the errands I am running. After all, driving all day and running errands you did not want to go home and cook a five course meal.\n\nI usually have the steak burrito with pico de gallo and potatoes. Or the smaller tacos with Carne asada and rice and beans. My husband always orders something different so I couldn't tell you how many times he's gotten what in the past week. But I know that every time I order something it will definitely be with Carne asada. \n\nThe one thing I order the most is their CARNE ASADA FRIES!  Yummmm. The front staff is always friendly. And because they are so busy there is always a wait while eating in or for takeout. And I really really really enjoy their Horchata.
