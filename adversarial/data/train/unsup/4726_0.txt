Do not go here if you are already drunk! They will take advantage of you!\n\nA couple weeks ago, my husband and I did a Mill Ave pub crawl. This was stop #3 (I know - it's not really a \"pub\"! - blah blah blah!) - we wanted a couple appetizers and a couple shots of ouzo.\n\nI should have known I was too drunk to be around big fat Greek restaurant waitresses (BFGRW) when the waitress started caressing my arm while I ordered cocktails, and I didn't pull away. That's just a bad start.\n\nWe ordered feta and olives and a *small* greek salad. The Feta and olive plate should be called 'feta plate w\/ olive garnish' - there were only 8 olives on the entire huge plate. When I tried to articulate this, the BFGRW wanted to sell me more olives! I was too drunk to explain that the plate didn't actually have enough to begin with, so we let it go and didn't order any more. The *small* greek salad was interpreted by the BFGRW as the \"large\" greek salad - she obviously realized she could have her way with us. We also ordered their flight of cocktails - I would not recommend this - it tasted like gummy bears in three flavors. \n\nMrs Big Fat Greek Restaurant Waitress - I may have been too drunk to defend myself, but I remember everything! You will not be a stop on our next Mill Ave pub crawl!
