Service was pretty good, no complaints. The food, however, is just not that good! I'm not sure how this place compares to other local restaurants, since I no longer live in the area. I would much rather trade their huge portions for better quality food and preparation. I had the brussels which weren't crunchy. My pork was super thick and very difficult to cut. My father had the cassoulet and thought it was too salty. \n\nBone marrow was good, but they serve it with all types of toppings to conceal the fact that the bone marrow isn't very tasty without them! \n\nAgain, I'm not super aware of the options in Pittsburgh, since I no longer live here, but my guess is that you can find better. This place isn't as good as it used to be.
