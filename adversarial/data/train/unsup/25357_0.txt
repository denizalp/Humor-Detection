First time here.\nI was passing by and found the place right next to the theater. Went along and sat at the bar. \nDid AYCE the price was decent. $2 cheaper than most places. Ordered salmon holic, something wrong 69, rainbow, and salmon nigiri. They were all good. The amount of rice was perfect, fish was fresh and well-cut. Food came out on perfect pace, and the sushi chef was very friendly. I am pretty sure saw him at other restraunt before though. The only reason for 4 stars is I never saw the server after i got drink. My drink was never refilled. There were two servers, which should be enough considering the size, but they never come to the other side.
