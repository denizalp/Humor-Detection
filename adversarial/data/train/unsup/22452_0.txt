Wow. I'm not sure what sort of pizza reviewers are used to eating, however, this has got to be some of the worst pizza I've ever had. :(\nThe people on the phone were nice, the pie was ready to go as soon as we got there (we were early), and smelled fantastic going home... So much potential!\nThat's where the love affair ended. The toppings look shriveled and gray. We got the veg head and added sausage. I've never tasted a pizza with so little flavor. The sauce was bland, the cheese non-descript, even all of those topping tasted like nothing. The lack of flavor was the biggest surprise and lasting impression. \nMy quest for a respectable east valley slice lives to see another day...
