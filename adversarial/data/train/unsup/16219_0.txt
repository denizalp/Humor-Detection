I'm a bad customer! Didn't follow the after care instruction, so Mai had her work cut out for her! She was so awesome! Fixed my brows and they look amazing! I will take VERY good care of them! If you have never had microblading done - don't go anywhere else! You will NOT regret it. Mai is an incredible artist and meticulous.
