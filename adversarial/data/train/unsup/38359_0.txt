This is a great art museum, with a lot of different areas including the science museum.\n\nThey had a bug display going on which is in the very back of the Dinosaur exhibit.  It's pretty interesting, but they displayed a lot of the collection up way to high to really see!  It also makes you think, wow! they must have decimated the local bug & butterfly populations when they were gathering these specimens!\n\nWe went a few years ago when they were doing some reconstruction & they had all of the art work in a \"salon\" type display with everything in one or two halls & spaced closely together... I liked the way that looked.\n\nThe Architecture Room is incredible.  Life-size plaster castings of so many types of structural beauty!\n\nI really loved seeing the Japanese art exhibit with all the various artists and their styles.  Some of the most beautiful parts, to me, were the artists stamps\/signatures.  They were so delicate.\n\nWe'll definitely go again.
