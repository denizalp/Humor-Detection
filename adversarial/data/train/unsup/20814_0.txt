I got a great full hour of treatment from Christine that hurt like hell (like it's supposed to) and now I feel like I can turn my head freely from side to side. \n\nWas I a bit stressed and tight? Yes, I think so. I'm better now.\n\nTake advantage of the Yelp deal while they still have it. This is a good massage.\n\nAbout the only criticism is that free parking is a bit tight. Usually some metered spots are available along 4th Avenue.
