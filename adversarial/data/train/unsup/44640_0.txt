Location great for PNC Park. That's the best part. \nOrdered chicken wings and they were tough. \nThe worst part.......I needed some private time in the bathroom. Unfortunately the stall locks on both stalls were broken. However I did find a small 3-4\" piece of string ON THE FLOOR I Macgyvered into a lock! (All while under a certain amount of distress I might add!) REALLY?!?! This simple repair couldn't have been made\/monitored?!?!?! A high school shop student could have made this repair!\nThis is a case of 'little things mean a lot.' Take pride in your establishment. \nWon't be going back.
