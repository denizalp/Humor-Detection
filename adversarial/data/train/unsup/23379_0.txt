Busted on RedTube again?\nYou can't help it. \nHaving a penis, as one comedian put it....\"is like having a friend who always wants to come out and play.\"\nYou're not a perv, but tell her that. Like she's going to believe anything you say right now.\n\nWell my friend, the playground has officially closed, and there's only one way to get it back open...flowers and chocolate.\nI know, its cliche, but chicks really do eat that shit up.\n\nFlorists? Forget it...they're a rip.\nConventional grocery stores? Great if you want to get her something that looks like you stole it off a grave marker.\n\nTrader Joe's is your best bet.\nFor $5.99, you can get a floral bouquet guaranteed to get the playground open for business again, and in short order too!\nThe chocolate bars are only $1.99, I recommend several.\n\nWhile you're at it, grab a bag of TJ's movie popcorn when you're there, you'll need it for the movie you're going to watch with her later.\n\nWhen you get home, whip out the flowers and chocolate, while you proceed to scroll through the DirecTV listings and queue up a flick.\nWait..\nWHAT ARE YOU DOING???\n\nDidn't you learn ANYTHING?\n\nChange the channel to The Notebook you idiot, and get Black Beaver Bang 11 out of the queue right now!\n\nDo I have to tell you everything?\nJesus!
