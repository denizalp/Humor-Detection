I am an avid Asian food fan, so when I say this is the best...it IS the best. Super big portions. Fresh ingredients. And a large menu that they will tweak to fit your taste buds. \n\nThen there is their great service. When you walk through the doors, you become a member of their family. They don't wait on you, THEY TAKE CARE OF YOU. They aren't happy, unless you are happy. Whether it is take out, or eat in, they go the extra mile to please. \n\nThis is my new Asian Food home! Treat yourself to a wonderful meal with friends.
