Based on what you are getting for the price, it's definitely not worth it, but due to the limited selection of Asian cuisine in Las Vegas, this will do...for now.\n\nAt the convenience of being inside Venetian, I really can't complain, but $13 for a bowl of beef porridge is a little ridiculous. I must admit, from the menu items I have tried, they are all pretty decent except for the soup, especially the Egg Flower Soup. The soup tasted worse than the imitation Egg Flower Soup at a Chinese buffet. I was a big fan of the Sze-Chuan Beef Noodle and the Ba Bao noodles though, just not the price tag. But again, we are in Vegas, so I can't really complain. \n\nFor the most part, Noodle Asia satisfies my craving for Asian noodles while in Vegas, especially after a night of partying, and I am thankful for it's existence.
