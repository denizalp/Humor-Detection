Beer: Unusual variety. Always new and different bottles in the cooler.\n\nFood: The pizza in the back room is amazing, but pricey.\n\nCrowd: Typical trendy tremont folks, which is much better than the west 9th broskies.\n\nBartenders: The one wavy\/curly haired girl was very personable and working her butt off to do both tables and the bar.  The other skinny girl with long black hair was content not moving and shooting death stares all night. But Thomas Edison still gets 5 stars from me.
