Holy moley these guys throw together a mean, green salad machine! My team brought me here for my pre-birthday lunch. I ordered the Club House half-salad w\/ chicken and had I been wearing socks, they would've been knocked right off of my tootsies.\n\nWe went at about noon, so parking was a little tricky, but as we approached someone pulled out *giggle* and we were able to get the rock star parking a pre-bday lunch enjoying girl should get. (If you saw some of the heels I wear, you'd probably sign a petition for me to get self-imposed handicap parking...you know, the handicap spots that you find that are nowhere near a door, but are still closer than BFE at the ass-end of Wallyworld?)\n\nAnywho, since it was noon, there was a little bit of a wait (maybe 5-7 minutes) to sit inside however they have open seating at the bar and outdoor seating (which is what we went with). The temperature outside was oh-my-f'ing-holy-hell-hot for only 1-2 minutes, at this point we had our promptly delivered liquid refreshments and had become acclimated to the misters (for those not from hot places, those are the delightful mist contraptions they put on restaurant patios to keep guests cool, not a euphemism for the guys at the table...get it? Misters? lol)\n\nThe salad dressing they used was all I could think about for the rest of the day. It was phenomenal. The server was quick and efficient and the hostess was on the ball. Oh...and did I mention there's a full bar? Yeah, check this spot out. YUM!
