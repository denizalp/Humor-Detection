So we just went to the new bakery at 1847.. WOW what a disappointment. $17 for 2 ham and cheese croissants and 2 tarts. One tiny slice of ham and half a slice of cheese..no condiments of any kind. The tart has barely any filling. Selection was poor. Won't be returning. Highly recommend not to bother trying it.
