After the debacle at New Orleans airport, I was glad to change planes in a more familiar setting.\n\nSky Harbor, probably the best named airport, is a pretty good airport.  Yes, there may be some distances to walk, but there are the moving walkways which help a bit.\n\nFood and sundry shops are pretty average, that is to say, acceptable.  It's a nice airport, I'm a fan.
