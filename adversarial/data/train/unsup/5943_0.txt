The store has interesting objects for sale. However, the woman behind the counter was so rude, it dissuaded me from buying a console table there. I took a business card as I walked out. The lady literally chased after me and grabbed me by my wrist. I assumed she thought I was stealing so I showed my hands, and she ripped the business card out of my hand and stormed off. W O W. I've never been physically accosted by a salesperson before. They need to fire her before they have a lawsuit on their hands. Needless to say, I won't be returning.
