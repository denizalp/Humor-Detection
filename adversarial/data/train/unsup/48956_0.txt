I came here on a Thursday night around 7pm. Before coming here, I read the other reviews and I know that I might have some trouble dining here without a reservation. Luckily, a table left as we were entering. After the host checked if they were able to accommodate us, we were seated.\n\nThe first thing we got were the PEI mussels ($11) to share. I expected the dish to have more flavour to it. The main flavour I got was the cilantro (keep in mind that I'm not a fan of cilantro but that's not their fault). I tasted the broth and I thought it was quite bland as well. I've definitely had better mussels elsewhere.\n\nNext, my parents and I shared three main dishes. The tagliatelle pasta with braised beef marina ($18) was a disappointment. The braised beef was tender but the pasta was very soft. This dish tasted very Asian inspired. The seared haddock with tomato chutney ($24) was okay. It wasn't as moist as it could be. I thought that the tomato chutney went very well with the fish but they didn't have enough of the chutney in the dish! The best dish was definitely the oven roasted chicken wrapped in prosciutto and mushroom ($23). The chicken was incredibly tender and I loved their pickled vegetables on the top.\n\nLastly, we shared two desserts. The creme caramel ($7) was standard and tasted good. However, the star of the meal in my opinion was the apple pecan crumble ($7). The top was crisp and the warm crumble was awesome with the cold vanilla ice cream.\n\nOverall, I felt that they did a great job creating dishes that tasted homemade, healthy and not pretentious. I also thought that the price went well with the quality and quantity. However, the taste just wasn't there and I just didn't feel a welcomed atmosphere while dining at the restaurant. They were never rude to us but they weren't overly warm towards us either. I think that it's important to note that ambiance is an important part to an enjoyable meal.
