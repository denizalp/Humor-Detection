Came here for brunch on a busy Sunday morning. The wait to be seated outside was about 15 minutes but no wait for inside. Server was fast and friendly. I ordered the Spanish cast iron skillet which came green chili pork and poblano hash. It was awesome. I tried my friends brick oven tamale and it was also top notch. Bar has everything you need. Will definitely come back!
