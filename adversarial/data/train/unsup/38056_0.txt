Returning customer of this lovely place. If you are looking for something new & different without giving up on quality, this is a must-try! I love their Shrimp PoBoy & can't bring myself to eat anything else because it's SOOOO DELICIOUS, but the atmosphere is classy & simple & I really love this place. A ton of wine choices to drink there or to buy for home, deserts, cheese....you've just gotta check them out!
