I lived across from this Circle K for an entire year, so I know every square inch--from the sandwich island to the walk-in refrigerator. Shopping here is a truly uncomfortable experience. The parking lot is typically strewn with broken glass and wandering transients. The food is macabre, unless you enjoy microwaved Big Az Burgers and sausage muffins. The selection of wines makes my eyes water...tetra paks of Vendage and Barefoot...sob. \n\nNonetheless, I can't honestly give it one star. It's considerably cheaper than the Bonanza Gift Shop and the service is efficient (to say the least). It's not a terrible place to go if you need a can of Chelada or a bag of chips on the Strip. That's the best recommendation I can make...the choice is yours, should you choose to accept it. \n\nOh, for some extra fun, you might visit here around 2AM on a Friday night. I've never seen such an assortment of bedraggled alcoholics and crazed tourists. They actually position the security guard by the door to bounce the riff raff. Yowsa...
