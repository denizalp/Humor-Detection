1\/2 star for the amount of restaurants in the hotel, 1\/2 star for the laser light and fountain show and another star for the shuttle service provided in your resort fee. MAKE USE OF IT!! Anyway, my boyfriend and I were so excited to stay in this hotel after staying by the strip for three nights. When we arrived, we were greatly disappointed.\n\nCHECKING IN\/OUT:\nWhile checking in, we were given a certain \"look\" by the lady at the front desk. Since it's an elder people hotel, she was so skeptical of us and said \"Are you guys 21? ID\" like, who the heck talks like that? We flashed our ID and she had no choice but to smile and unwillingly tried to start a conversation so my bf helped a little by saying he just turned 21 a couple of days ago and that's why we're here. Upon checking out, she (the same lady) just stood there and looked at us stupid without even asking how can she help? Uhm, okay lady, you're paid to do your job, so do it right. If you hate people or us \"kids\", you can always find something else to do. Since she was rude to us, I decided I wasn't gonna say a word to her, not even \"thank you\" or \"have a good day\".\n\nOUR STAY:\nThe room we got was alright, decent, I would say. Bed and pillows were fine... The only thing that sucked was our view and the extremely clogged sink.\n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE:\nSome guy who worked the night shift was as rude as the lady (do they only employ rude people or do they hate the world?!). We asked for utensils and the guy looked at us stupid like he hasn't heard of a spoon\/fork. Then he rudely said \"we don't have such things\"... Okay DO YOU EAT WITH YOUR DAMN HANDS?! I wasn't expecting those metal ones, but plastic instead and yet they don't have it? Even Motel 6 has it! He could've said \"I'm sorry, but we don't have them as we don't do room service but you could try McDonalds located behind you\". It's not that difficult!!!\n\nWILL I BE BACK?:\nDEFINITELY NOT!!! I also won't recommend this hotel to anyone especially if you're younger. But even for the elder ones, you should save your money for somewhere else as this could happen to you. It's not worth it!\n\nThe management should do something about this before this hotel deteriorates more... It's already not the best but some great customer service would help a lot. It's lacking way too much now.
