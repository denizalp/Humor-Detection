Sorry hipsters; you're just too dirty for me to ever join your ranks. This coffee shop seems like a cross between my high-school detention hall (not that I EVER was sent there) and a cottage. All the furniture is really and truly on its last legs, and that means you should prepare to tip merrily away on tippy chairs at tippy tables.  This is in fact a sparsely populated furniture graveyard, but I'd rather let it RIP and make my way to someplace less precarious.\n\nAnd then there is the surly stare from the oh-so-cool barista. \n\nLook, I realize this isn't McDonald's and smiles might not be free, but there ARE safe and healthy options to misery, really there are. \n\nThe coffee was surprisingly good, but not worth the $2.50 + 0.50 tip offered in lieu of being glared to death by said barista.
