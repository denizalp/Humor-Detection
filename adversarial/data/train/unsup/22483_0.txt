Don't take your vehicle here unless you want to fix something other than what it's there for. If it wasn't broken before you brought it in, it will be when you leave. And it's not going to be a cheap fix. They gave me a paper with a list of problems and no estimate of cost to fix it. Reading the other reviews, looks like they may do this on purpose in order to hike the price later. Not good business, boys. And what the hell kind of place offers deals on oil changes that does not include the oil filter!?! Update: so I took my truck to a diesel mechanic. There is now, in fact, a half inch crack near the #5 injector of my diesel fuel rail. Of which is not \"normal\" wear and tear on a diesel truck. It's upsetting that I cannot prove that it was not leaking before we took it to Greulich. However, I know that it was not, because there is nothing on the ground under where I park my truck at home. Nevertheless, the diesel mechanic we are using is charging $300 less to fix my fuel rail.
