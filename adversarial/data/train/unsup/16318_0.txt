One word: cockroach!!!! A large live one fell on my husband's leg while we were sitting in a booth. He flicked it off and then killed it. This disgusting incident caused us to look around a little closer at our surroundings. The carpeted floor had crumbs, drink lids and bits of food all over. The knick knacks had cobwebs. When we went to tell the manager about the cockroach, we noted food all over the floor behind the counter. Dirty dishes were sitting on tables. When we told the manager about the roach, he didn't seem surprised. He apologized and said he'd call the exterminator right away. He did not offer to comp our dinners (which were only half eaten) or give us any other incentive to come back - not that we would EVER go back anyway.\n\nThis incident comes a few years after our last visit to Fuddruckers at the Superstition Springs location, in which my daughter discovered a live beetle in her ceasar's salad. Disgusting!\n\nI called Fuddruckers corporate office as well as the Arizona Health Dept. the next day.
