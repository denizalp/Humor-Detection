I absolutely loved all four and a half years that I spent attending Baldwin-Wallace.  I would seriously go into a state of depression when I would try to imagine my life afterward.  I made more friends and accomplished more things than I could have ever imagined.  It really prepared me for the real world and helped me find people I plan to keep in my life for a very long time.  \n\nI think one of my favorite aspects of the school are the professors.  Granted, I had a couple that drove me up the wall, but I found once I did a little research, I set myself up with some truly wonderful and inspiring teachers.  Classrooms are small enough that you can develop a more personal relationship with them - they'd recognize you and stop to chat around campus.  I'm quite fond of very many of them, and miss seeing a lot of them.\n\nGreek life is really great here.  It's not the like stereotypical, hazing jerks you see in shows on TVs and movies.  It's a welcoming community and a lot of fun to be a part of.\n\nFor ladies, I think that BW had a great selection of guys to date.  I feel like any guy who chooses to come to the generally smaller, quaint school with a community of wonderful people over some sweaty party state school must have had parents that taught him well.\n\nMy only other advice would be to get involved in all there is to do, and do it right away! I didn't get involved in campus activities until my junior year, and I wish I would have done it sooner. Keeping busy with those activities helped me make new friends and develop skills that I will use for a lifetime.
