I had been here a couple of times while I went to school at SWIHA across the street. What a waste. I'm not really sure why people drive around with Pete's Fish & Chips bumper stickers and why people rave about it, or why anyone would give this place more than 2 stars because it's awful. Absolutely awful!\n\nFirst off, it's over priced for what you get and you're getting frozen food! NOTHING is made fresh. You get frozen square pieces of fish, frozen shrimp, frozen fries, frozen, frozen, frozen. You'd be better off going to your grocery store, buying it cheaper there and cooking it at home. It's sad when Long John's Silver's actually beats out someone in fish and chips. Plus even after they cook they're frozen fish squares it doesn't taste good. Its greasy and bland. Also the red sauce...yeah it's gross. I wanted tarter sauce and was told no.\n\nSecond, service is appalling! Why are they so damn rude? The people servicing are disrespectful and always love shutting the little screen door in your face. They also don't accept credit cards, or debit cards. Really? Come on, catch up! The first time I came here I had to leave and go to Wendy's because I don't carry cash. So I had to try again another time, That was my first experience. There is no excuse to not accept cards nowadays; Geez, you can accept cards on smart phones, it's that easy!!!\n\nLastly, hygiene. Ugh...gawd...gross. This place has got to be breaking alot of health codes. Their staff looks dirty, they constantly handle money with the same gloves they use to prepare food. Plus, I have seen staff go on cigarette breaks using the same gloves they use to prepare food.\n\nJust take your business elsewhere. Just listen to the majority of the people who have given reviews, most of them are NOT good because this place is terrible.
