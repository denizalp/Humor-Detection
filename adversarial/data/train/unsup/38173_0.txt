I am never disappointed here! I went for their taco Monday this week where all tacos are 3 dollars! I also got the corn queso which is one of the best queso dips I've ever had! The service was wonderful! We had a spirited young lady who made sure we had everything we needed, she split the bill appropriately and even gave us to go waters! I couldn't have been happier! I get the plantain tacos which are vegetarian and a phenomenal twist to a taco!!
