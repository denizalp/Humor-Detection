This place rocks! Co-winner of the best chips and salsa in the valley. Best house Margs at $3.00 each...top that one! The Mexican pasta with wide egg noodles topped with their green chili is addictive and you won't find that one anywhere else. Its always busy and hectic but somehow they find you a table quickly. They also tend to remember you on return visits which means they don't have turnover of their help like the chain places do. \nHighly recommended and would give it the coveted fifth star if they would someday do a little remodeling as it is \"rustic\" and then some if you get my drift.
