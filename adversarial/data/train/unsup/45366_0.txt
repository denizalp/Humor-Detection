True southern food served up in a trendy fashion . The restaurant is small but cozy .. Reminds me of potty barn \/ restoration hardware . Service is amazing . All of the servers take care of all tables , not just the ones in their sections . This seems like a new way to run things , but it's seamless , so perhaps other restaurants should borrow a page from their playbook!\nOnto the food! I really really wanted to try the fried chicken and biscuits... But the shrimp and grits wouldn't stop calling to me .. So shrimp and grits it was. Fantastic ! Flawless !! Best grits I have ever had !!!The more I analyzed the flavors ,the more I suspect they make their grits with cream cheese, heavy whipping cream & butter .. I don't know for sure but that's my best guess. Shrimp\nWas average , nothing spectacular , but it didn't have to be the whole dish was beyond 5 stars.
