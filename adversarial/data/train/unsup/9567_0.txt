2.5*\nHow are 2$ tall cans selling for $10 here? Gettin ripped off left right and centre here.\nNice venue, great events- but when you have a decent cover charge AND are super ripping folks off on drinks and you aren't supposed to be a douchy club?? Just the wrong combo.\nWill be back for events and gladly pay cover but will be skipping on the bar.\nThey also have a really terrible selection on drinks.
