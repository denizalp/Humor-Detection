Wow Blue Martini is seriously a joke now, their new management is HORRIBLE! \n\nFriends and I went in yesterday using our lady VIP cards (drink ticket), checked in on facebook (drink ticket), used valet coupons (drink ticket) all which we had done before without issue (i'm there on a weekly basis). Well last night we were told that we were \"exploiting\" them by using those tickets because each of us had 2 or 3. I'm sorry it's YOUR loyalty\/comp program and we're the ones exploiting it?\n\nBut that's not the worst of it.. we decided to move outside on the patio after the manager told us this, finish out drinks, and leave but the manager came back got right up to my friends face and YELLS at her!!! He said we moved tables to try to scam another server. It was ridiculous! Now their cocktail servers are tweeting us saying \"there are two sides to every story\" and that the manager yelling at us HAD to be warranted because the management is \"so easy to deal with\". Are you kidding me??!! What happened to the customer is always right? Especially when we were completely calm throughout this entire situation and did absolutely nothing wrong.\n\nI have been a loyal Blue Martini customer since it opened but I will no longer patronize them when they treat their LOYAL customers this way.\n\nAs a friend just commented: Wow getting threatened for taking advantage of the deals THEY have put in place... because that makes perfect sense.
