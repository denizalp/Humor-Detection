My workplace is about a block from Canteen. The food is generally pretty good - big fan of the new burritos on their menu.\n\nMy major issue is with an extremely spotty pick-up experience. Canteen and other food fight restaurants have food delivery\/pickup via app using ChowNow. The app is fine, but as of late ordering pickup has been painful. I don't think my expectations are that high - order online, have the order ready to pickup in 30 minutes, but I've been let down the last two times:\n\nTake 1 (three weeks ago): Was super hungry, ordered pickup at 12:07, get an email 18 minutes later that it'll be ready for pickup at 12:55 PM.\n\nTake 2 (today): Ordered around 11:25, got email saying my order would be ready at 11:54. Got there at 12:04, saw my order on the counter, and had to wait ten minutes for them to pack up my to-go order and let me on my way. \n\nAgain, I like the food, it's just frustrating having such subpar pickup experiences. I'd like a place I can count on when I want to grab something quick downtown, but I guess I'll have to stick to the food carts.
