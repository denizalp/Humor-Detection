WOW. Condos smack dab in the middle of the heart of Las Vegas Blvd; IN City Center's property; NEAR the trendy Cosmo, and ACROSS shopping at Planet Hollywood.\nThis is real estate's best bet: location location LOCATION.\n\nEven more better than their location are their amenities. \nIt's own valet, pool (on the rooftop), gym, movie theatre and pool tables. This place is great for bbq and parties during the summer.\n\nYippeeee, I can't wait...HURRY, SUMMER, HURRY\n\nAlso, have to mentions the RIDICULOUS view of the strip from the rooftop =) Kinda makes you fall in love with Vegas all over again.
