3.5 stars.  Food was great!  But there was no way this place deserves 4 or 5 stars for the unwelcoming service we got.  So many yelpers gave this place great reviews so I had to try it on 12\/24.  \n\nMy BF and I tag teamed to switch standing in line **over 3.5 hours in line**  When it was my turn to leave the line, I went in search of a place for appetizer, lo and behold I found JEAN PHILLIPE BAKERY for a wonderful yummy Panini sandwich to hold us over.  \n\nOur overall experience at the buffet was horrible!!  Our hostess told us that we didn't have much time because the buffet was closing!!!  WTF We stood in line from 6p to 10p!  The BF did not want to leave after 1.5 hours of wait.  LEAVE people, LEAVE if you've been in line longer than an hour!\n\nHostess and hosts complaining about not wanting to stay late!  They need to take their frustration in the back room not next to our table where patrons cannot hear so we can enjoy our meal!  \n\nTIP:\nAttempt this buffet only if the line is not an hour long!  Go elsewhere if it is!!  it's not worth paying $80 for two and to be rushed and feel unwelcomed.  Go to Jean Phillipe bakery.
