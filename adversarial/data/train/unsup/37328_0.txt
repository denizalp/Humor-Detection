First the coco shrimp are delicious!\nThe house salad with blue cheese is the freshest and tastiest I have had in years!\nThe garlic mashed potatoes were unmatched   The best part of the meal was the medium rare Victorias filet. The best steak I have tasted. the vegetables were also fantastic!\nThis place is very good and is very consistent. You can't go wrong here.
