I've been here a few times before but this time I had writing on my windows from my birthday that had been on for a few weeks. I had only gotten the $5 wash as I just wanted to get the dirt off of my car that had been collecting for the last week. Brian and Alex were able to get all the leftover residue off of my windshields that the car wash itself didn't get. Thank you so much!! Best service ever!
