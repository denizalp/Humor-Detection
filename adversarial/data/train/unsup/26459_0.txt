We have been going to BLD for years and  absolutely love the entire staff. Almost 95% of the time the food is outstanding but there are few times, like every restaurant, that you have an issue with the food not being prepared the way you like. It's not fair of this Liz person to overhear a private conversation about food not being prepared correctly one time, and then badmouth the poor bartender for having to deal with it. BLD is a great place to hangout and get to know the team, who always make you feel welcomed.
