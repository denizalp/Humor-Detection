5 stars for service!!! I accidentally left my jacket including my house \/ car keys, employee badge etc. when having brunch at Boteco on a weekend trip to Vegas and the owners shipped me my stuff back to California within 2 days!!! Everyone I spoke to during this process including cleaning \/ wait staff, floor manager and owner were super helpful and empathetic of my situation. Everyone made sure they passed on the message ASAP.\n\nAside from that, Boteco is also a really great place for delicious, quality food without the Strip prices. Perfect for a brunch stop before heading to the Hoover Dam or even Grand Canyon from Vegas. Definitely would visit again!
