My (now ex-) boyfriend and I went to Naya back in Feb.  I suggested it, and between the positive reviews on Yelp and the fact that he'd been there and recommended it, I was excited to try a more upscale alternative to Aladdin's and Ali Baba.\n\nI ordered the molukhia (a dish containing shredded chicken and leafy vegetables), which the waitress recommended as one of her favorite dishes.  When it came out, I saw something that looked suspiciously like a hair in it, and by George, it turned out to be...exactly that.  The waitress saw me pulling it out of the dish, and came over to ask if everything was okay.  I showed her it, and she asked me if I'd like a replacement of my dish.  Wishing to be gracious, I declined.\n\nAfter a few minutes, the owner came over to ask how things were.  Without my saying anything, she said the waitress had told her I'd found a hair in my food, and apologized.  She then proceeded to explain that this was a problem with the meat provided by her supplier, rather than on the restaurant's end, and offered to comp me with the baklava.\n\nWhile I felt that the waitress handled the situation appropriately, the owner's (non-) apology and so-called remediation was anything but.  If what she said is true, then (1) this means other customers have had the similar unpleasant experience of having food containing hair served to them and (2) why doesn't she change her supplier?  Regarding my experience, given that I refused a replacement dish, I feel that the proper recourse would have been to comp the dish for me.  Comping me with a $2 dessert was, quite frankly, insulting.\n\nI won't be returning.
