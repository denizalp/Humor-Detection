This is a hidden gem in Mississauga. I have to say I always like to try out different salons and I usually go to downtown, but after I found out this spot, I've been very satisfied. I had Victoria and Kristy. Both of them are very professional and nice. The place is clean too. I think I will definitely be a regular !
