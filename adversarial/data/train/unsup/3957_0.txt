Im reviewing a gas station because Im bored.  This particular one is tiny and the staff is kinda lame but oh well.  Im usually in-and-out quickly and the rewards program for Speedway is pretty good.  Beer selection sucks but flakewood has a million other places to buy 40s and tapioca flavored rolling papers...
