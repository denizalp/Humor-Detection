First off, I do want to say that this is such a great store with so many lovely options for balloons. However, the service here is absolutely terrible. \n\nAngela was quite rude and abrasive when I first came into the store asking for pricing. She gave me half hearted answers and made it seem like I was bothering her. \n\nWhen I ended up purchasing a bouquet of balloons, she quickly changed her tune and was nice and polite.\n\nThe day came to pick up the balloons and I sent me husband to pick them up. He said that the individuals working there were incredibly rude and had I not pre-paid, would have canceled the order and gone elsewhere. \n\nSo disappointed because this place is so close to our house!
