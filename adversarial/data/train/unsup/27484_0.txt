I recently hosted a baby shower at GreenSinner. It could not have been more perfect. The space, the terrarium class, owner Jimmy and staff member Christian were helpful and so fun! Staff member Rose was so helpful and patient with the arrangements leading up to the day. All the guests are still talking about what a great time was had by all. I am looking forward to taking another class. I truly cannot say enough amazing things about GreenSinner and the entire unique experience. Love! Love! Love!
