Outlets are a hit or miss, depending what you're going for. They have a good alternative selection of brands (Element, Fox, Hurley, Vans, Converse, etc.) if you're into those brands, and also have other brands such as Coach, Charlotte Russe, and Windsor if you're into the others. \n\nThe Outlets are a hit or miss because there are some stores you can get good deals on, and others are plain expensive. They just remolded everything from the outside in, so the interior\/exterior decor is more modernized and cleaned up (which is always a plus). I believe the only major accredited store in the Outlets is Coach, and everything else is more of the secondary brands you hear that aren't top dogs but are still known. Still worth to give this place a browse through though, you might find something good.
