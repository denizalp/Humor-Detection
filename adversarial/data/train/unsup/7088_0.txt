Let's begin with a shout out to the excellent manager, Xavier, who made no excuses for the poor, neglectful service of our waiter who was no where to be found except on 2 occasions...to quickly take our order and then to throw our check on the table without asking if we wanted anything else...a courtesy that he didn't mind extending to the neighboring table.\nWe couldn't help but notice every other table received much more attentive service and the standard bone-in meat display choices to which we were not privy to. Could it be that 2 women out to dinner couldn't possible eat a large cut of beef? Or was there a passive discrimination towards 2 women who are a couple who dared to dine at this Snobberlin locale? We just couldn't figure it out. But on the merits of food alone, we would not return to Echo & Rig.\nSteak Tartare - Good and enjoyed caper berries.\nTuna steak frites - Meh seared tuna swimming in a sea of sauce. Garlic mash was good.\nJumping Beef - Beef tips in a stew-like sauce dubbed as Peruvian Demi-glass...it was ok but nothing to rave about.\nThe only Echo we'll be dealing with is our Amazon Echo.
