Came here two weeks in a row...what bad luck with tires lately.  Both times the tires blew out.  And changing tires is not easy!  Especially with big tires. \n\nThis location is clean, well kept, not much clutter.  Each time the staff was very knowledgeable and friendly and attentive.  Very professional people here.  This also have to be the fastest Discount Tire in the valley.  Both times I was in and out quite quick.  \n\nThe loo was okay, it needed to be picked up, and the toilet paper was quite low.  Other than that, a good loo with a slightly more powerful toilet compared to common house toilet.\n\nFortunately for me both times I didn't have to pay for the tires because of the certificates I get when I bought tires from them previously.  All I had to do is pay a small fee.  So if they try to sell you a certificate, get it, it'll save you an arm and a leg.  Overall an excellent experience, and this will definitely be my go to Discount Tire!
