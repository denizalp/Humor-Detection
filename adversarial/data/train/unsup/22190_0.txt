Cox Cable, hmmmm. What have you done in the past two years to warrant a $30 a month hike in prices? Besides making it easier and more expensive to be a slave to the idiot box there have been no major innovations to keep me interested since about 2006. No, we don't need or want your $600 value home security system. Guess I just found out why the rates went up. Anywho, this isn't so much a grip about pricing as it is about being trapped indoors turning the brain and body to mush.\n\nI ended up cutting cable ( life is so much better outside the living room, especially in sunny San Diego ) and telephone ( had to get phone service to get some sort of special pricing ). Never even bought a phone as my cell phones do their jobs quite well. Had to keep the inter-webz though.\n\nI cut those services on principle. Cable T.V. gave us reason to STAY indoors instead of getting outside an enjoying all that San Diego has to offer.\n\nFor those times when we're in and watching T.V. we have NETFLIX. I don't miss commercials one bit and trying to find a good movie on HBO SHOWTIME or CINEMAX is nearly impossible.\n\nWe may be drawn back into the fold but not anytime soon.\n\nBTW, I have never had any issues with their customer service staff be it over the phone or in person.
