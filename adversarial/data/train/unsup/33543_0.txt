Love coming to this place for a car wash! Dave at the front check in is always nice and professional. He educated me on all the different types of car washes and was very patient. This place can get busy but luckily they have an amazing barbecue restaurant inside. The food is amazing and is worth the wait at times! \n\nWith great service and food, This is the best carwash in town!\n\nThanks again Dave! \n\n-Leo
