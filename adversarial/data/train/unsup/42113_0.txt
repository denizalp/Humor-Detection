Food was alright, but the ordering process was so confusing I wouldn't go back. The Mexican corn was really good. There was almost no description of any of of the food, so you just have to know what you like. For instance, there are 6 different types of beef, but no descriptions about how they're different. Guacamole is bland, had to add a bit bunch of lime and salt to it. My husband really enjoyed his al pastor taco and carne asada vampira. A small but interesting selection of craft beers.
