I came to this location because it is extremely close to my house.\n\nThere are 2 people working the registers and  CLEARLY one line. I've been standing here for over 7 mins to make a simple return. These cashiers are extremely slow. If you cannot chat with customers and work the register, perhaps you should try one or the other but NOT both!\n\nIt's now been another 3 mins and I'm still standing here. There's something seriously wrong with this picture. It shouldn't take 10 mins to process a 3-item return...but it did.\n\nAnd for the customers who believe that they can stand on either side of the counter to be serviced...inappropriate. There is ONE line clearly marked on the floor, get in it! It should've been obvious with the two people standing behind me. Don't be offended when others, waiting to see how the cashier is going to act, state that they are next. You see other customers gathering in one line...follow suit!\n\nThe store was quiet. There were all if seven cars in the parking lot. I should NOT have been in line that long! I'll drive to Chandler before I come back here. This is a joke! \n\nStay away! Stay very far away!
