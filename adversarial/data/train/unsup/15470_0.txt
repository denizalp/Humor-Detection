Early 20th century speakeasy feel that can be hit-or-miss depending on the clientele and drink orders. This was one of the only bars with space on a weekday night before a concert. Strangely, a little too much space - it was empty save for a few other parties, and the lack of body heat made the place feel drafty and a little lackluster. Luckily, our server was attentive and settled us right in with some drinks and appetizers. \n\nOf the drinks we ordered, presentation was truly spot on for all three, but unfortunately pictures in the dim lighting don't really do them justice. Our favorite was the Hibiscus Ginger Fizz, reminiscent of a smoothie one might have sipped in an 80's diner. My Jack Rose, for all its ombre beauty, was too whiskey forward and I couldn't discern any pomegranate grenadine. If the drinks hadn't each cost two burritos each, we might have gone for another. \n\nThe food menu is crazy overpriced as well, and my friends paid $6 to get three Deviled Egg halves. My $10 Sweet Potato Hummus platter was good (the toasted bread borders on addictive), yet we all left to go eat burgers and french fries. \n\nI hover between 3 and 4 stars because I think we came on an off evening, where no live music gave life to the dark corners and the clientele seemed withdrawn and sober. The saving grace of the evening was our trusty server, who withstood our disappointed faces at the food quantity, our requests to split the check, and to do it double speed so we could eat before the concert started. And was generally just a positive person to be around.
