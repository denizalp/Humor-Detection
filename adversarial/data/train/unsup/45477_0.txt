This place is very unique and exactly the type of restaurants I think people are looking for when they go to Vegas. It is full of character and really embodies the quirky French personality. The atmosphere is great. We ended up sitting at the bar because for brunch, they get SO crowded! The drinks were great, the food: AWESOME, and the service was perfect for the occasion. I had the Cinnaroll Waffles, the people I was with had the Chicken and Waffles and the Banana Nut French Toast. I'd say out of all three dishes, the french toast was everyone's favorite. Their spicy infused vodka is really awesome in their bloody mary, too. VERY garlicky and spicy, but really good.
