Lipshtick is a female comedian series at the Venetian.  Roseanne Barr, Lisa Lapenelli, Whitney Cummings are a few of the comedians they have had so far.  Shows are usually once or twice a month.  We saw Loni Love when we went.  We literally had the worst seats in the house and could see just fine.  If you buy tickets up front there is a meet and greet with the headliner.  The show was hilarious.  There was an opening act that did 15-20 mins and then Loni came out and did about an hour.  Loni killed it and we laughed the entire time.  Like most stand up it is not for the faint at heart or those easily offended.
