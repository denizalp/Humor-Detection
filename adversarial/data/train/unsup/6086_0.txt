Carowinds is one of those places that I find difficult to review objectively.  The reason for this is that I am a Charlotte native (a rare breed), and Carowinds is the sort of institution that is just a part of the local fabric.  Growing up here, I have always gone to Carowinds; everyone has always gone to Carowinds; Carowinds has always been THERE.  This even goes back a generation: my parents were going to Carowinds when Thunder Road was the biggest ride in town.\n\nThat being said, I do believe Carowinds holds its own, especially as a regional theme park.  After all, with the introduction of the Intimidator, the park has the tallest, fastest coaster in the Southeast.  That's pretty cool.  The food is overpriced (as is to be expected), and with so much human traffic throughout the day, you're bound to run into the occasional spot of ick.  But on the whole, the park is fairly clean and the staff is about as polite as you can expect a bunch of teenaged summer employees to be.\n\nI suppose that's as objective as I am going to get.  Here are thoughts on some specific rides:\n\nIntimidator: tallest, fastest, etc.  Probably my favorite coaster.  Line can get long-ish, but it moves fairly quickly.  The first ascent to is a true \"wtf-why-am-I-doing-this-we're-all-gonna-die\" moment followed by \"WHEEEE!\"\n\nAfterburner: Formerly Top Gun.  Always Top Gun to me, actually.  My second favorite: it's still a lot of fun and since Intimidator opened, the line is usually very quick.\n\nNighthawk: Formerly the Borg.  You're suspended as though you were lying on your stomach, staring at the ground. I honestly can't decide if this one thrills me or terrifies me.  The line can be very long and slow, since the boarding process is fairly complicated.  I sometimes skip this one.\n\nVortex: Otherwise known as the ball-cruncher.  I am too tall for this one, fortunately.\n\nCarolina Cyclone: On the old side, but those corkscrew twists are still pretty cool. If you are tall, make sure you sent in the front, or you will have shattered shins.\n\nThunder Road: This old gal gets a bad rep for being bumpy, but I still find it pretty dang thrilling.  Perhaps because it is a wooden coaster, it *feels* incredibly fast and dangerous.  It's not as high as the Intimidator, but it feels subjectively faster to me, although I know it's not. Line is pretty short now that the shiny, metal coasters have eclipsed it in the public eye.\n\nHurler: Another older wooden ride.  Again, I think the (hopefully untrue) impression of rickety-ness from that method of construction adds to excitement.  The deeply-banked turns are fun.\n\nCobra: Short, lightning fast, but awesome.  A great \"whew, we're done--OMG NO WE'RE NOT\" moment.
