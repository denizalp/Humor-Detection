Our recent AirBnB was located on the 10th floor of The Jockey Club Hotel, overlooking the Bellagio water fountain. I was slightly hesitant when my brother said he booked this for us, because I have never heard of this place before and was worried about the quality\/space of the room. As soon as we walked into the 2bedroom\/2 full bath suite... I was quite blown away- to my surprise there was more than enough space!  \n\nAgain, our reservation was booked under \nAirBnb and for those of you that aren't familiar with that, it's basically a website where people post their homes\/apartments for people to rent while the they are away. Is so much cheaper than staying at a hotel because the pricing is based by the owner and plus you get all the amenities that the hotel has to offer. Although this is an older hotel, they have a pool, gym and jacuzzi to use. The jockey club is like a timeshare building and the cool thing is that it's connected to the Cosmopolitan so you basically go through the Cosmo to get to the connecting elevator for JC. \n\nI really enjoyed our stay at JC. The beds were comfy and our specific suite was very modern, big and clean. It had a combination of carpet and ceramic tile. There was a huge living room with dinning and kitchen that opened up to everything. Everyone knows you only need a comfy bed and bathroom to shower in, but other than that you don't need to go spend hundreds and hundreds on a fancy-shmancy room. I highly recommended booking your next Vegas stay through AirBnb!
