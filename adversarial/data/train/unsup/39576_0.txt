Although I wouldn't consider myself uber fit, I do enjoy exercising through different types of workouts from Bikram Yoga to resistance training and hybrid boot camp type workouts.\n\nDoing both martial arts and boot camps in the past I was expecting a challenging but not necessarily a killer workout.  I was wrong!  \n\nAlthough boot camp type workouts are often challenging, I feel the classes are often watered down a bit to the level of the overall level of the group.  However, at 1 on 1 boxing, if the instructors feel like you can do more, they push you to do more.  If you the 10 pound medicine ball is too light, they'll give you the 12 or 15.  If you are slacking on punches, they get on you to punch harder.  I haven't had a workout yet that I walked away feeling unchallenged.\n\nWhat I do like is that the workouts vary from class to class.  Some days it's all leg work (which I hate, but usually means that's what I need to work on) to boxing drills to medicine ball work to old school skip rope, running and sit ups.  A big plus for me is that there is no cursing - including the music that's played.  I hate cursing and the disparaging comments that often come along with it.  Being vulgar doesn't make me feel more like a fighter.\n\nMy only con is this.  I would like them to offer another option for their classes.  It seems it's just one deal with $99 for unlimited classes.  If they had a punch card type system at a reasonable price I would go for it.
