What a disappointment! I moved to Arizona and have been looking for a new stylist. After following one of the stylist at this location on Instagram for a few months I decided to give her a try even though the reviews weren't that great, for the salon, and made an appointment for a Saturday morning when they opened. I showed up 10 mins early for my appointment only to be told they were in the middle of a staff meeting and had to wait.... OUTSIDE! This is Arizona! It's 100 by 7am in the summer, and I had my toddler aged child with me, ( he was getting his hair cut too) After waiting outside 15 mins PAST my appointment time, totaling 25 mins again OUTSIDE, I should've just went home but against my better judgment I went ahead with my appointment. The \"stylist\" cut my hair first, without washing it first, and took off way more length than I had requested. I had an appointment that was completely rushed because their staff meeting went into my appointment time, and her next appointment was waiting. Needless to say I will not return to this or any Arizona hair co location. She took a total of 20 mins to cut both mine and my sons hair, mine alone typically takes over an hour. I never leave negative reviews but after being the type of mom that cared for her children and not herself for some many years I was so disappointed that when I finally decided to take some me time it was rushed, the people were rude, and the end result left me needing to go somewhere else to have it fixed.
