I wish I had read the previous review before I registered with Dominion. \nI recently moved back to Ontario and instantly regret it after having to deal with insuring my car. Not only am I paying over $60 more than I was in BC (provincially run insurance company and not money hungry private businesses) I am utterly getting screwed by them and I haven't even been with them a month. I registered on Nov. 17th for insurance, being advised they would need 2 months' worth of payments to start the policy - I advised this was OK. Today, Dec 3rd I have come to find that they \"scheduled\" that payment on Dec 10th ( 3 weeks after registering) and my next payment is on the 17th. They will be taking 3 months worth of payments in the month of December - right before Xmas. There is no room to have  the double payment come out sooner - since I was told it would be up to 10 days originally and now it is over 15 -  \"it is what is is\" per Dominion.\n\nWhatever you do, customer service is worth the extra 5$\/month you would pay somewhere else - stay clear of Dominion - they don't care about their customers.
