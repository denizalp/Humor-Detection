Absolutely terrible experience at this hotel. My vehicle got towed not 2 minutes after parking in front of the hotel to unload my bags and a Holiday Inn bell man didn't notify us about the no parking zone (It doesn't fit in their parking garage). I didn't see the small no parking sign and ended up with $180 in tickets and fees. \n\nThe bell man and tow truck driver laughed at my boyfriend when he told them to drop my vehicle off of the tow truck. A manager said that there was nothing they could do about the cost of the parking ticket even though it was such a humiliating experience. \n\nWe also had a leaking AC unit and called multiple times about the issue. Apparently vacuuming the carpet was the only solution and we came back to a sopping wet carpet in a whole quarter of the room.(the rooms are tiny and so was the gym) The upper management obviously doesn't care about their guests and this experience left a terrible first impression of Toronto on me. They could have easily offset my inconveniences with meal passes etc.
