Food: 2\/5       Price: 4\/5        Service: 3\/5     Ambience: 3\/5\n\nThis buffet is a little far from the Strip, but they offer cheap meals with pretty great taste! We came for the breakfast, and there was a wide selection including Italian(pizza, lasagna ), Mexican(tacos, enchiladas, beans), Chinese(fried rice, pot stickers, sweat and sour chicken), omelette station, American (biscuits and gravy, french toast, waffles, bacon, egg, fish and chips, potatoes), Carving (ham, brisket, ribs), salad bar, and dessert(pies, cakes, bread pudding, ice cream, cookies). Overall very worth the price and I enjoyed the meal.\n\nPricing \nBreakfast : $9.99\nLunch: $11.99\nDinner : $ 18.99
