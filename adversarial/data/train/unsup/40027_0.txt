I don't care for this nail shop too much. I'm new to the area and tried them about 6 times hoping to get the positive results as other reviewers but I have yet anything  to rant about. The shop is clean with a ton of gel options which is a winner for me but the quality in how they do your nails isn't too great. I prefer the men over the women for acrylics for sure but even with their nice look upon leaving, my gel always chips in less than 10 days. Once my nails were so puffy and the lady argued with me when I told her I wanted them thinner so I had to ask her who was paying. Another time my gel polish was so bad the manager even disapproved and said he would take it out of her pay and the next time, my gel would be free. That was a great comp for me but the next time I went (which was the last) they only gave me 10% off the gel.. not what we agreed to but I'm one to take losses and cut ties.
