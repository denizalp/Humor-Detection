I took my special needs sister here for her birthday and they were great. This is such a cute little place for girls! You can have parties here, but you should know that if you have a lot of girls, it may take a while. The place is small, but very nice. \nI would advise to get your girl a one on one appointment so that she can all the attention on her. They do nails, feet, facials, glittery tattoos and fashion shows. It can be pricey, but hey, it's a luxury to be pampered! \nMy sister loved it, and it turned out to be a great gift for her. We will certainly be taking her back :)
