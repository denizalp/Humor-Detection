Okay so it's confession time: I've wanted to see this place since the Real World Las Vegas. I know, clich√© unlike no other but it is what it is. My first time in Vegas, I HAD to experience this place. The feeling of taking that elevator and walking into the already chic bar area out to the patio gave me the most intense rush.\n\nUnfortunately (or maybe fortunately) for me, I had quite a few drinks before we made it here and I'm not normally a heel wearer. The combination resulted in me FACE PLANTING as I stepped out on to the deck. I played it cool even though I probably should have been kicked out but the bouncers were great about it. I really appreciate them not kicking me out because I enjoyed my time up there so much and got some great pictures.\n\nHonestly, I don't remember the drink. It was a cranberry and vodka I think and the boys paid for it. All I know is it was added to the list of drinks I consumed that night and did the job. Really, I just loved the views and being there. \n\nOh and the bathrooms were EPIC and very clean. Nice job, Palms!
