I honestly don't like Cirque shows. I think they have a ton of the same acts. But this show actually impressed me. I've heard many people say how this show is more adult with nudity, crude humor, and sex but I thought the dancers did it very tastefully and it wasn't too much. I sat on the balcony because I got the free tickets for booking a two night stay with mgm but I think the stage is setup that some of the stuff done in the front of the stage is hard to see. Just keep that in mind if you're going to sit on the balcony.\n\nI really like the humor that they put into this. It made the in-between acts so much more entertaining than some of the other Cirque's shows with the clowns.
