Good food, very friendly owners, small little place that obviously caters more to take out.\nI found it a little overprices compared to other comparable Pakistani or Indian restaurants, but it's probably because of the location.\nThe butter chicken and beef dish Pakistani style were great. Did not like the garlic naan we were offered, I prefer the simple one and assumed it would come with the food, since we never requested garlic naan. We got complimentary pakoras that were succulent.
