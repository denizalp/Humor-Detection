My experience at Sano Sushi is one i dread to experience again. Me and my sister went for dinner, got seated immediately, and got our order in promptly.\n\nMe and my sister both commented on the spot that we were sat in- it was in a completely different section of the restaurant. It was a little bit darker and out of the way but we thought nothing of it. \n\nWe had to specify the order MULTIPLE times, but eventually when the food came it was actually pretty good. The Spicy Salmon roll was impressive, as was the red tuna and the freshness of the fish. My personal favourite part of the meal was the salmon roses and the Red Snapper sashimi (freezing cold and fresh, AMAZING)\n\nThis is where the experience turned to shit. As we were eating, we noticed the waiters and waitresses seemed to be speaking and laughing a lot in their language, and then looking over at us and laughing. We knew they weren't checking up on how we were doing because they would have walked by and asked, and we knew they weren't checking to see if we need more drinks because i mean, why would somebody laugh at that. Its simply not funny. This seemed fishy to me (no pun intended). Eventually it became so irritating to my sister and I that i looked at them until they made eye contact, and when they made eye contact with me they were about to laugh, but when they saw that i was watching, they stopped in a very guilty looking manor. \n\nAs we were paying for our meal, we noticed another couple had walked in. Just prior to this my sister and I were discussing this odd behaviour and why might it be occurring. They sat the couple next to us when they sat every other person that walked in to the restaurant in the main section. Then I noticed something- \n\n*****Every single person that was seated in the main section was either Asian or normal white christian. The people that were sat next to us were a couple of two, one indian male, and one jewish looking women. Me and my sister are both born into a jewish family however she looks mexican and i look dark skinned.\n\nI came to the conclusion that this restaurant is racist and anti-Semitic and therefore i will not be returning in the future. \n\nFood:\n6 out of 10\n\nService:\n1 out of 10 (if that)\n\nOverall Experience:\nUnhappy and uncomfortable\n\n\nIf you feel like going out for dinner and are in the mood for all you can eat judgment and discrimination, by all means, please feel free to stop by Sano Sushi on Yonge Street.
