This place has the benefit of being in a high traffic area in downtown. Otherwise I don't see anything so unique about this place vs other Chinese hand pulled noodle places. \n\nI would say that if you compare bowl sizes, GB is slightly more expensive than places like Magic Noodle. But I'm not holding it against them for this. The broth and noodle texture is about the same as what you can get a Magic Noodle.\n\nThere aren't a ton of seats and this place gets filled up quickly. Not a bad choice if you have the craving. But I'd still prefer other hand pulled noodle joints because the menu option is very small here. For example, Magic Noodle has a more extensive list of appetizers and customization options.
