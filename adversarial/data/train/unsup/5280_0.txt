The Big Jim and the beignets have been on my foodie bucket list for some time and I finally stopped by last Sat.  The food was good (not great) but the ambiance was totally unacceptable.  They had a DJ playing music at an obnoxious volume. Not only was it at an unneighborly volume for being in a residential setting, but it was larded with the most objectionable vulgarities.  If I were a neighbor we would have a real problem.  As it is, I will most definitely NOT be a return customer.
