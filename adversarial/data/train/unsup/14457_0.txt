For the past 2 weeks I have been going back for at least 5 times, I really enjoy this place and recommended to all my friends, I felt the roll is very good value consider when I had that food truck thing, it was $20 something and it is pre-rolled One burrito is $12.99 plus tax if you want more seaweed or avocado it is $1 extra. \n\nJust saw a person said one burrito here is the same amount of food you get from \"2x 3$ maki\" LMAO  why you always lying always lying hmmmygwad stop f**king lying\n\nYou can always not liking something, but for God sake show some respect to those people who is working hard and trying to do better. And I have seen the passion in the rolltation staff.\n\n I understand there were some mistakes over the past few days, but nobody is perfect, and I'm sure all the food joints would never try to give their customers bad experience intentionally, otherwise what's the point of being in this industry.\n\n For those people who are way too salty about this place, eat more wasabi and let's see how you complain about it is not sweet.
