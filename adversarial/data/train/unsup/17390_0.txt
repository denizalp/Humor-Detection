This is my first time going to Verizon as my carrier. I was impressed with the staff how he really took his time in helping me out with my Apple 6+ problem that was purchased at Apple online.  He was very knowledgeable and informed me of all the great deals they were having. It's also a great location AND right next to Starbucks to go order while you wait for your turn at the Verizon store.
