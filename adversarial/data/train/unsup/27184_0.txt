I've lived here for 3+ years and I love this place. Great facilities, clean, and awesome location. The staff here is amazing especially Natalie and Michelle, they are practically family. The entire staff typically goes above and beyond whether its promptly addressing maintenance issues, calling your cell phone to let you know you have a package, or assisting in finding you another unit, they've truly made this place my home. Definitely would recommend to anyone.
