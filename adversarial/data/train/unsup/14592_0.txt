Came through drippin' drip drip.\n\nBeing a big boba tea aficionado, I was drawn to their drinks. Their strawberry matcha latte is absolutely incredible with homemade strawberry sauce and made on the spot matcha tea. It is reminiscent of The Boba Guys in SF. Their boba is just the right amount of chewiness, which can oftentimes be over cooked or made soggy. I've also tried their matcha latte which is equally as delicious! \n\nTheir ice cream is quite the creative concept where breakfast cereal is melded into the soft serve. They have a plethora of cereals you can pick from to create a treat drawing memories from childhood. \n\nI will definitely be back soon!!
