I love this place! I just spent $11 there on 5 items, one of which was a 'Lapis' skirt that retails for $40...brand new, never been worn, tags still on!! Thank you Shannon W. for bringing this wonderful little place to my attention! There wasn't any kids stuff...just FYI for other moms out there...but don't let that stop you from checking it out!!! they have wonderful clothes and shoes galore! Go and shop for yourself.  Shopping at Halo was possibly the best shopping experience in my 3.5 years of motherhood because they have a 1 eyed cat and a chinese crested dog that kept my toddler thoroughly entertained! If that isn't just the bee's knees I don't know what is! Go to Halo!!
