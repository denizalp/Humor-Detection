There were a little hiccups with the planning of the tour that we wanted to do. But the guys at the shop were accomodating and did a nice job to do the best they could for us. Cars were awesome. Dillon was a really good tour guide for our tour and gave us great instructions. Would definitely come back to these guys. Got to drive an MP-4 12C and an R8. Both were convertibles and also drove a Shelby GT350. Awesome cars and would definitely do it again.
