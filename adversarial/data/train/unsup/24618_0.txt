Wow!!! Stay far far away from this dealership for any service unless you have days upon days to be without a car. I scheduled an \"appointment\" for service on my car for an oil change and a squeaking sound, appeared to be a belt or water pump. I had to wait a week for an appointment, when I took my car in (Thursday 08\/17\/17) the \"Specialsit\" stated they'd call when it was done... I gave them my number asked for an estimated time, their answer: could be tomorrow or Saturday!! I asked what's the sense of making an appointment and waiting a week, the service specialist picked up a stack of work ordered and said they're all in front of you. Again, why even bother making an appointment then. I called later that day for an update (3:30 PM) for an update- they stated there are still 16 cars in front of you and if I needed my car the next few days I should come and get it, and that I would lose my place in line. He then told me they told me that when I made my appointment, this was never communicated to me... then he has the nerve to call me a liar and refused to let me speak with his manager on the phone.\n\nFind another dealership!!!
