The service was sub par.  We arrived around 2:00pm after a long flight.  The restaurant was half filled yet no host\/hostess in sight.  We wandered into the bar but all of the booths were dirty (not bussed).  We went back out to the main entrance and stood there for another 10 minutes.  I observed what appeared to be a spilled salad near the front of the restaurant.  Finally a waitress walked by and we asked to be seated.  We then had to wait another 10 minutes for a hostess to appear.  The service throughout the meal was friendly but very slow.  We asked for some additional dipping sauce with our meal and it didn't arrive until we were already done with the entire meal.  The food itself was decent chain restaurant fare but the service was absolutely horrible.
