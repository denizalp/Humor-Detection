We had the rudest bar tender helping us. She asked us to pay for our drinks before drinking them and stood over our shoulders until we paid. Then she called one of us \"cheap girl\" while leaving because we only tipped 10% due to her being rude and messing up another order (we ordered a can of 7up and she proceeded to pour the can into 7 shot glasses then gave attitude when telling her that's not what we ordered). Not a pleasant experience. They need more polite staff.
