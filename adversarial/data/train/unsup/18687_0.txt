Whenever I find a Japanese restaurant that is not only staffed by Japanese people, but the customers are Japanese as well...it makes a good impression. \n\nI had the Hirekatsu. My mom is from Japan and an excellent cook and this rivaled her home made version. The meat was tender and the portion size was filling. \n\nI went with my mother to try it out and she had the Mix Plate. She, too, was impressed by the flavor of the food. \n\nThe atmosphere was quiet, clean and quaint. We come to Vegas a few times a year and will definitely keep this place on the list of places to eat!
