Went on a friday night and had to wait about 5-10 minutes.  We tried the pumpkin spice ice cream with waffles (they also had a few other interesting ice cream flavor including an earl grey flavor).  The hot plate was interesting and the experience was worth trying at least once.\n\nThe service was good and while the environment was nothing luxury, it was quite a relaxing place.
