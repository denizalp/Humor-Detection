Have you ever had a particular food that you crave over and over again, no matter where you live or visit?  Mine is a particular quesadilla that I used to get at Gordo's in SF.  When I moved to Las Vegas in 2004, I have been on that search for a quesadilla just like Gordo's and I've finally found it at Los Tacos!!!\n\nThis is not just a regular quesadilla that you can get anywhere, this particular quesadilla is made with a flour tortilla on the grill, when its all golden on the outside and gooey cheesy on the inside and they put carnitas, guacamole, sour cream, salsa, rice and hot sauce inside...it is yummy in my tummy goodness!!\n\nOh, why oh why, have I not ever found Los Tacos before???  I had to make so many trips back to SF to get my oh so favorite Gordo's quesadilla cause I thought no one else could make it like them!  And I've tried! I've made the request to so many places out in Vegas, only to be let down every time....\n\nThank you Los Tacos for bringing my hometown so much closer to me, cause now every bite of your carnitas quesadilla, I can close my eyes and be in heaven!!\n\nOh- and their ceviche is pretty darn good too, but, I can't even think about that now that I know where I can go when I crave MY quesadilla!!!
