So I got a really good deal on a room. So my partner and I decided to give it a shot. I loved the palms place but they are different in ways. \n\nI checked in at the front desk with DJ who was friendly. Got us checked in very fast.\nGot our keys and headed up to the room.\n\nThe room was very clean and very bright with a modern flair. Furniture was clean and not outdated. \nBed was spacious and beyond comfortable. \n\nShower was open concept which was cool for me but others may not like that. I like open space in the bathroom. There was one part of the stay I did not enjoy. The bathroom faucet was making a G-d awful squeaky high pitch noise all night long. Made it really hard to sleep. The bathroom sink didn't drain well AT ALL. Also the bathroom door if it wasn't closed or open ALL THE WAY, it too made a horrible creeking noise. \n\nI showed the front desk agent Joan a video of all this and totally made it up to me. She was totally sweet and very empathetic. Problem fixed. \n\nWas upset that the rewards cards doesn't work at all places and very upset the hotel staff doesn't tell you to charge things to your room so you can get the points. Rather then telling me they don't give points here.\n\nGreat hotel because it's not overly crowded and it's off the strip. Give it a shot. It's worth the stay!
