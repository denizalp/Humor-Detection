Very friendly and professional.  I brought in our BOB double stroller to have the tubes in the tires replaced.  They had everything on site (several other places I called said they would have to order the tubes special) and had it ready to pick up in a couple hours.  Very impressed!  We will be back with all of our bicycle needs.  Thanks!
