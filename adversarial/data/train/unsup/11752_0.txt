Cute little hookah bar\/restaurant in Charlotte's \"French Quarter\". Waitress Holly is amaze-balls as she handled my group of 15 lunatics with ease. A hidden gem in CLT with first come first serve seating and great atmosphere. There are three rooms to choose from and a long list of flavors to select.
