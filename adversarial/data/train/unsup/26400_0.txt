Love my new lashes!! I used to get lash extensions all the time and decided to stop. Thought lash lifts\/tints would be my next thing and so I found Lorna at Beaux Amis Spa. She walked my thru the process since it was my first time getting the lift & tint. She was very gentle, took her time, I didn't experience any burning or any problems during the process.\n\nLorna noticed that my right eye was curling weird, she tried a couple things to fix it. She told me to give it 24 hours and see how they look. ( I don't blame her for them looking crazy, lashes on my right eye never cooperate)\n\nI honestly forgot about my right eye, was busy preparing for a trip and Lorna was so sweet to check in with me to see how my eye was doing. She said she didn't want me to go on vacation with messed up lashes. I then realized that my right eye was still a little messed up and she offered to fix it after her class so I agreed. Glad I went because she was able to fix my lashes and now they look perfect! And just in time for my vacation. \n\nShe went above and beyond to make sure I was satisfied and my lashes were perfect. Will definitely be returning!!
