New location!  Located on northwest corner of Guadalupe and Higley in the Tia Rosa strip mall.  Was previously located near baseline.  \nI have used this urgent care in the past as I prefer a pediatric urgent care for my kids.  We were in and out within a little over an hour. The back office assistant was very friendly, kind, and very geniune. The gentleman greeting us at the front desk was less than enthusiastic about being there,  but got the job done.  I didn't think it was appropriate that his electronic cigarette was sitting on the desk.  \nThe physician was appropriate and nice,  not like our pediatrician,  but we got what we needed.
