I went by the KX today and was upset to see that although the store is still open, there was a \"For Rent\" sign on the window. I know that there's a Common Sort across the street now, but their stuff is really pricey compared to the Kind Exchange. It may be too late, but I hope that the KX can turn itself around. They've been buying way less in the past few months, and the store's merchandise has become more limited, but this place still wins my vote over any other secondhand store in Toronto. I've been actively buying and selling with the KX for years, and I love that they have things at various price points to reflect their spectrum of customers and merchandise. Given the number of students in the area and the fact that the Common Sort hasn't caught on to this demographic, if this place is leaving Bloor Street, it will be a huge loss to the neighbourhood.
