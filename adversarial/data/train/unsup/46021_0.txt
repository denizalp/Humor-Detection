I don't know what's up with this Ross. It is perpetually understaffed at the registers. If you go when it's slow, they may have only the customer service register running (better hope you don't get stuck walking up with your purchase when some lady is trying to return eight different items). Similarly, I just went the weekend after Thanksgiving and only half of the registers were manned. The line was through the queue they laid out and then twisted over to the women fragrances so people entering the store had to break through the line just to start shopping. If anyones wait was under ten minutes, I'd be surprised. \n\nFor a place without many really great deals (unless the items are damaged), it's hardly worth the tight aisles and long lines just to save a couple bucks per item.
