What a great hole in the wall place.  Its a glorious mess with the order counter and kitchen up front amid the coolers and then the back room is divided between a dining area and shelves of food.  Doesn't look like much of anything, but it the food is authentic and inexpensive.\n\nI had two shrimp tacos, nicely griddled shrimp on soft corn tortillas with some cheese and onions; simple but very tasty.  The salsa they provide is really good, but very hot, so be careful.\n\nI will be back to try more of the menu.  If you are in the area and feel like a bit of an adventure, give them a try.
