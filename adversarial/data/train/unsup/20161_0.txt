I have been using NXY for a few years now, but I have been shopping at Ulta for years. I love the rewards program they have, and the fact that they let my combine the two accounts I accidentally opened. I had even moved and forgot to change my address so the lady at the counter gave me a coupon. The NXY cosmetics are almost always buy one get one half off, which is amazing since it's already such a great price. \n\nI do wish they would keep their shelves stocked a bit more. Sometimes, especially during the sales, it's tough to find everything on your list; but i know I can get nearly all of my toiletries in one stop. \n\nThey also carry and extensive selection of drug store as well as high end brands. All of the products I need to help me stay feeling beautiful are under one roof.  \n\nMake sure you sign up for the rewards program, you won't regret it.
