We tried the cannoli today and both me and my friend didn't like it.  He said it was not good in texture and very heavy.  My sentiments were the same.  And the biscuit outer shell was stale.  I had asked the server if the cannoli was fresh and he said it was made same day.\n\nThe cafe was clean and had nice decor.  I would like to try their coffee one day.  I thought prices were on the high side.
