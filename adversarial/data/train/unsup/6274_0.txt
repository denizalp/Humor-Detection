It was only two or three weeks ago that Lee told me she was working on licensing to expand, so it came as a sad surprise to read on FB today that she decided to sell the business AND close shop.  The status update mentioned that the flavors will soon make their way to grocery freezers, but not even the pretty and kind Gina knew about this when I stopped by at the shop this afternoon*.  [I had plans to go from massage to happy hour at a new place (to me!) when I decided I'd stop by and speak to someone at the shop itself about the sad news...]\n\nDoors close tomorrow evening at 7 pm, so hurry and stock up on your favorite flavors!  Psst!  The Red Velvet Scotch was tasty!  (The cake's recipe is one of Paula Deen's.)  The flavor was a tad sweet, perhaps, but I definitely could discern the scotch and red velvety treasure there.  Plus, it's so pretty!!  :)  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/lees-cream-liqueur-scottsdale?select=I5PSw4fpFZdIWCG_3wkbng#I5PSw4fpFZdIWCG_3wkbng\n\nFor those who have unused gift cards and would like to get a refund, please visit Lee's Cream Liqueur's FB site to get more info.
