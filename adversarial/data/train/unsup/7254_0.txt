So with Pancake in the name I only have one thing to say.....Challenge ACCEPTED!!!! \n\nThis place gets crazy busy on weekends so either come early or plan to wait accordingly.  \n\nBut once your in oh it's so worth it.  No matter what you get you cannot leave without getting pancakes. Share them if you must but please don't make the mistake of not getting any.  They have tons of varieties and I hear the Apple bake is a must (on my hit list).  \n\nI'm a traditional guy so bring on the buttermilk. Simple but delicious. Keep them coming cause I'm about to do work!!! \n\nOverall great experience with exceptional staff.  Can't wait to come back (I see you apple bake)!!!!
