Oh my lanta! This place has amazing cocktails! I think we sampled nearly every drink in the menu... Yes, I do remember them. Our favorite was their take on a classic old fashioned. Simple, delicious and light. The blood orange tequila cocktail was also so good! Not too sweet, which I appreciated. \n\nThe food, however, was just ok! I felt like they skimped on the quality of some of the main ingredients (a hot dog bun, my friends, can truly be a make or break). The poutine was a fun concept but our fries weren't hot! So sad, isn't it? I will give it to them though, their pirogies were out of this world tasty. They're deep friend... How bad can that be?) \n\nOur server was the nicest hipster I've ever met and the bartender was awesome so no complaints there.  \n\nOverall would be very happy to return... As long as I have an uber to drive me home...
