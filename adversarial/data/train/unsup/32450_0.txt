Finally,  a well cooked thin pizza!  It's been my holy grail for years in the east valley.  Delicious with plenty of toppings, crisp flavourful crust and a tangy sauce ( I loath sweet sauce).  Oh,  and delivery was prompt and courteous!  I can't wait to dine in and to try the subs. My fiance is a meatball sub fanatic and I've heard great things.  My new favorite go-to pizza place.  Bye bye Venezia pizza with your soggy, nasty crust.
