Super, Super COOL! I walked in and saw 125 beers on tap! WOW, I think I could be there all day - pass out and make another day out of it! Not that I would ever do that, but the thought just briefly passed through my mind. \n\nThere are loads of craft beer and then some of our old favorites, so something for everyone. What I liked the most is that there are two flights of beer to choose from - the normal flight which includes several IPA's, Ales and what not - I don't care for IPA's so I skipped this one!!! But woo hoo! They had a Belgian style flight - which is my total favorite!! \n\nMy flight had Goulden Drakk - Tripel Karmelite, Frambouise and a house Belgian that is made my SILLI! Too cool! \n\nI was there with my husband and a friend of ours and we ordered a California roll and a spicy tuna roll! They are HUGE! These are not served in the traditional roll but it looked like a round layer cake! There was plenty for three people and some left over! \n\nThis was great fun! The music is always great at the Yardhouse with the great beer and food - Just a fun time waiting to happen!!! \n\nSee you soon Yardhouse!
