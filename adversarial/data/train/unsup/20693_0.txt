I remember literally running into Aidan Quinn here on a girl's night out, shortly after \"Legends of the Fall\" had come out (as in smacking right into that manly, deep-barreled chest of his while not looking) and thinking to myself, \"Hot Damn, I need to come here more often!\"\n\nStar-sightings aside, Jello Bar has been the lounge lizard's choice of hangout in Montreal since the mid 1990's. The selection of cocktails, the funkadelic names, the acid jazz music and ambient ethos all make this place work. A more mature crowd, this is definitely not your typical raucous club for younger 20-somethings.\n\nGrab a group of your best gal-pals, dress up, go out for dinner and then come here for drinks and a relaxing evening, it's my tonic of choice from time to time.
