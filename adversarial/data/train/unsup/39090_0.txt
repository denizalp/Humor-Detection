Sure, it's a buffet, but it's also $40 and supposed to be one of the top in Vegas. Because of those descriptors, this was just average to a little above average. Options are great; inconsistency is not. The two saving graces here - (1) the 2 hour bottomless drink option for $14 and (2) the desserts. I had about a bottle of champagne (and a pretty decent one at that) and almost every dessert offered. Give it a shot I'd say.
