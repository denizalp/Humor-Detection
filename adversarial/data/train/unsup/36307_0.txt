Guys I'm so confused. So confused. I like to think I'm a hip person who frequents gallery crawls and drinks red wine and decorates my house with tons of plants, but this was truly the most millennial thing I've ever done. And I thought I was super millennial. \n\nYou walk in, are fronted with a huge wall menu, place your order, and sit. Anyone who has ever been to Gaucho (which def isn't Vegan) it's a very similar set up. That's cool I don't mind that. I've also have vegan food from other vegan restaurants and really enjoyed it (no I'm not vegan). \n\nWe sat in the back room which I didn't realize was like a garage area till after, when I started to freeze. It was so cold in there. I did enjoy the vibe and happiness around and ambience with the lighting. \n\nThe food: I ordered the pierogies and the potato pancakes. The potato pancakes were ok, but they were cold. Maybe they were supposed to be? The pierogies were good but I'm sorry I really don't think they're as amazing as everyone says they are. I liked the sauces and relishes with the dishes more than the actual dish. \n\nMaybe I'll be back? I kinda want this 5 star restaurant that everyone else is saying it is.
