Located in the FMP plaza, Tracy dessert is a typical Chinese dessert spot.\nNothing too fancy, you get what you came for. \nThey have your typical Chinese sago and coconut milk desserts and your grass jelly drinks too. \nI would say this place is mainly filled with Asians because let's face it we have bomb desserts. \nThey also have snacks and pretty big sized clay pot rice bowls if you're looking for something savoury to eat. \nAll in all, tracy is a good spot if you're craving that Asian sweets but don't expect great service or outstanding food.
