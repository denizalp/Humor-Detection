I'm only disappointed that it took so long to find this gem! It is so close to my house, right next to the Paymon's on Sahara and Buffalo. It's so small and closes early, so if you work hours like I do I suggest going in the morning or on a weekend. It's worth the time! I feel like the employee looked at me a little sideways when I tried to pronounce the food - which is not only okay with me but PROOF of the delicious authenticity of their food! \n\nI could not figure out what to order from the menu because it wasn't super clear. That could be an area of improvement, but for now I suggest checking out Yelp pics to see what looks good. I was with two of my friends, we all ordered something different, and everything was stellar. I really don't think you could go wrong with anything they sell here! My sandwich was so big I could hardly finish. The only thing I would change is I got my sandwich with a egg on top and if I did it again I think I would skip the egg. However, my partner wanted my egg anyway so I gave it to him and it all turned out great. The side salad is basically lettuce with a honey mustard type dressing and I was a fan! After we ordered we sat at a  small table by the window. The real light in this place from the giant windows is so nice! \n\nI also got a vanilla latte which was to die for! They delivered it to the table as well as the rest of our food. When we were done they instructed us to leave the mess on the table and they would get it. I like that service at a cafe! All in all, service and food are both amazing. I'm a huge fan and I will be back!
