The crowd is just an amazing mix of everything you find in Mesa. From barely legal to barely breathing, you'll find it at Rooster's. Handlebar moustaches, big beer bellies, tattoos. Definitely no guidos in the crowd here, though, as the Affliction and Ed Hardy loving crowd doesn't know this place exists. \n\nNice little dive bar with great service, Harry Luge and his band playing a mix of country, rock, and whatever else comes up when they're not out touring, a couple pool tables and now, a good patio to throw the smokers on. Decent prices on the drinks and always a good supply of Malibu :)\n\nThe only guy candy I've ever encountered is Harry. Double yummy on the ears... and eyes. Girls, not that I like to share, but visit this place and you'll be hooked... \n\nOne word of advice... when you leave this place, make sure that you use your blinker, don't make any wide left or right turns, as there is usually a motorcycle cop just waiting to nail someone's drunk ass.
