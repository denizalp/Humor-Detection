I found this café on Instagram because of their latte art. I immediately added this to my bookmarks. I am a sucker for latte art!  \n\nI was super excited as my husband and I approached the cafe. There are pictures of different latte arts outside this café in case you don't know what to get. The cafe is small but cozy. \n\nI ordered a cafe latte with a flavor shot of french  vanilla and my husband got a mocha latte. Our total was $9.25CAD ($7.47USD). Prices are so reasonable. The sizes are bigger than what you imagine. Although the barista did not know what one of my requests was but she was happy to google it and draw it. I don't know how she does it but the art comes out so beautifully! Both lattes were so delicious. We kept watching other patrons get their lattes to see their art.\n\nI highly recommend coming back to this cafe for the delicious coffee, friendly staff, and beautiful latte art. I know I will be back the next time I am in town.
