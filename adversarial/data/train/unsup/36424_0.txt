Dang, I really wanted to like St. Street Brats. The location is great, and it's an awesome place to sit for a while just to take in the scene. The staff is nice and the bar is full, but the food is definitely underwhelming. \n\nMy brat was burnt to a crisp and my fries tasted as if they had been set out all day (they weren't even slightly warm). The boneless \"wings\" were frozen Tyson chicken nuggets reheated. Good bar and decent prices, but eat before you come.
