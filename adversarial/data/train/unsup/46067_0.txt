When you walk in it is a little dark, a little beat up, but DO NOT let that turn you away. The service is AMAZING, staff is super friendly and accommodating, prices are right on point, the wings are crispy but still juicy, and the pizza...THE PIZZA...man lite but filling and doesn't leave you feeling bogged down. Seriously have not had a single issue at this spot. Every time I go there...which is often...and this place is a bit of a drive sadly...the experience and food just keep me coming back. I would say this is the number 1 pizza spot in AZ and I have been to A LOT of pizza spots out here...
