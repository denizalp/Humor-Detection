Yay, I want to go here today.  I was really impressed with this store.  It is VERY clean and VERY organized.  The ladies at the register (I say that because they remind me of the Lutheran church ladies that would have been friends with my grandma) are very sweet and genuine, taking care of your items as if they were there own.  \n\nGREAT book selection, too!
