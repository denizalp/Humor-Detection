Two trips here and two very different experiences.  I want to really like this place...location is great, decor and vibe is good...what's inconsistent is the service and food. I ordered the Bison Burger for myself and a kids slider new for my daughter...the sliders came out like rocks and had to be returned. Not sure why they ever left the kitchen? Staff...I don't know. First visit a month ago the waitress was great, attentive, etc...last night like it was a hassle and just not interested. I don't know...maybe an off night, but not a good second impression.
