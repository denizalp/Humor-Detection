Had lunch here with six of my coworkers today while in town for the LinkedIn Talent conference. The food was good (read: PORK BELLY BLT), our server was nice, drinks were brought out quickly and water was filled promptly. However, the service was SUPER slow. and I don't mean the kitchen was slow. I mean we all almost finished our drinks and then some, and our food order had still not been taken yet. And it was definitely not crowded at all while we were there. Open tables abound!\n\nWe ate family style (cuz that's how we roll). Food rating:\n\nSausage pizza: Good. Although we did not see actual sausage bits on it. Looked a lot like the\nSopresata pizza: Also good. Tasty!\nFuji Apple salad: Pretty darn good. Crisp and light.\nChips: AWESOMENESS. Covered in melty cheesy goodness with bleu cheese chunks and parsley. Nom Nom Nom\nPork Belly BLT: The absolute shiznit. Orgasmically delicious. I deconstructed that bitch and ended up just eating the meat. Hella good! Almost good enough to earn Wolfgang another star, but my feet hurt from walking to and from the conference and all over McCarran airport, in 5 inch heels and I am not in a giving mood right now.\nPineapple ginger mojito: Good, but I'd prefer the\nRaspberry lemon drop: Really good if lemon drops are your thing. They're not MY thing, but this one was pretty damn good (like how I like my men: strong, and able to quench my thirst).\n\nOur server was really really nice though, and accommodated us by splitting our bill three ways (for ease of company expensing later). Employees were nice and smiled and greeted us as we came\/left. Overall, good experience. Had a good time with the work peeps - The only downside was the wait , so minus one star, especially because we ran the risk of being late to the first session of the conference. To be clear I started with four stars because the food overall was not so great to give it five.\n\nThree stars, covered in braised pork belly!
