Fantastic happy hour period.  Stopped in for a quick couple drinks and small plates, was not let down whatsoever.  The $4 martini's \/ drinks were delicious as was the Scallops and Slider small plates a friend and I enjoyed.  The place was busy for happy hour as it should be.  Really thinking I need to start hitting this place more often.  Big bar, lots of seating, perfect.  My only complaint is the no left turn on Chagrin from the lot and the forced valet parking.  I just parked on the hotel side and walked thru.  Worked out great.
