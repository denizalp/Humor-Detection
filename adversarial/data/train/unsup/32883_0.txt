I have this every time I go to Montreal. It is literally a must.\nThe layout is kinda weird, you place your order then go take a seat. The main seating area is upstairs, but I actually kind of like it like that. It's not a big place, and they usually have 4 people on staff; 1 as cashier & to take orders, 1 to cook, 1 to clean, & 1 to prepare small stuff & deliver the food to your table. It's a pretty efficient system, but the thing is that the cleaner usually cleans downstairs and so it's really up to the deliver-er to bus the tables upstairs. It would probably be easier if people threw out their garbage & put their plates in some sort of bin, but there isn't much room so I suppose things will stay how they are.\nI always get the nutella-banana crepe, I might be obsessed, but it's definitely worth the $8.50.
