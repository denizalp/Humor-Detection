I absolutely love this place, the food is amazing, and have been here 10 times or so, but the last time I was there with my girlfriend, we both could agree that the service was absolutely ridicules. I didn't catch our servers name but it was some kid with white gauges. \nIt was about 2 in the afternoon, and we get there and it is fairly slow. Our server comes around to ask for our order and I tell him that we aren't ready yet. He revisits us about 10-12 minutes later, which is a littler longer then usual but nothing I would really complain about. \nWe put in our order and the food comes out fairly quickly and is good as always. At this point out waters were empty and were never filled for the rest of the time we were there. We are both fairly quick eaters and finish everything in about 10-15 mins. I'm a server myself so i was putting plates stacked up on one side of the table to kind of give him a hint that we were done and could use some service. But we ended up not seeing our server for FIFTY MINUTES after he dropped off the food. He did not check up on us or anything, we could watch him as he was doing all his side work as we sat there with no food or water left in front of us, contemplating if we should just leave. Finally at 2:55; five minutes before they close, he drops off the check. Finally i give him the 2 cent tip he had earned by neglecting us the whole time we were there, as I leave I thought, finally we are done here. \nBut that's not all... He literately comes out to the parking lot to confront me about his shitty service, and I told him how he didn't check up on us for 50 minutes and we were ready to leave after 15, then he complained to me about how he's losing money off this crappy tip, and quite frankly, I don't really care. Learn to serve or find a new job, I will not return unless I know this guy no longer works here. Sorry
