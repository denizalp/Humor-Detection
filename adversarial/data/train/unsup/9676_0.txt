Thank you Vegas Yelpers for all the lovely reviews!\n\nI'm always searching for new hot spots. I was craving pad thai... my new found love... and came across TSNH.\n\nFirst off... I love the location since I live right up the road and it's in between my commute to work and home. \nI'm all about reasonable prices! My meal was under $10. \nThe portions were big... I ended up taking home half of my meal.\nI went around 9pm and my fellow yelp las vegas elite\/friend and we were the only ones there... so seating and waiting for our order wasn't an issue.\n\nCute hole in the wall... casual indoor seating.\n\nOnly thing I wasn't a fan about was their angel hair noodles. Pad thai noodles are usually bigger in size. Taste was decent but I've had better pad thai here in Vegas.\n\nWould I come back? sure! If not for the pad thai... I wanna try their thai fried rice with chicken (since pad thai and fried rice with chicken are my only thai things I like).\n\nIf you're in the area and craving thai... stop by TSNH!\n\n-Miss Yelp 2011
