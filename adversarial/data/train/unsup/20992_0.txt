I used to live in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina for 8 years, and I have to say that the restaurant and the food feel authentically southern. Back in Myrtle Beach there was this restaurant that the Mayor of North Myrtle Beach opened. They never got your order right but it didn't matter. Whatever soul food you ended up with was amazing. This restaurant is like that too, but they get your order right every time. In fact, if you're getting to go, they'll open your boxes for you before you leave just to make sure you're happy. \n\nThe ambiance is not fancy, but it's very clean and it's authentic as the food. You can feel the love that goes into the cooking and the down home decor. I purchased two specials... A rack of ribs and the beef tips. As expected, they were moist, juicy and flavorful. \n\nI am so pleased that this restaurant exists. The staff feels like a family. Everyone has been so kind and are eager to share their favorite recommendations. I was skeptical, but when they say their dessert is better than sex. Oh boy do they mean it! I absolutely will be back.
