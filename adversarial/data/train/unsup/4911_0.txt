My new favorite place to eat at the Calgary International Airport! What a gem! \n\nInside the brand new International Terminal, The Kitchen is Wolfgang Puck's newest culinary adventure - and one not to be missed if you're nearby!\n\nThe interior of the restaurant is comfortable and clean modern lines with just enough rustic stone, mood lighting and linens to make it homey. The menu is varied through homestyle Americana comfort food with everything from Mac & Cheese to Sandwiches and Pizza. \n\nBut the real star of the show on our visit was the Chicken Milanese! Oooh! Do I have dreams of this perfectly breaded poultry cutlet goodness! Truly, it's the best one I've had in years! It's simply stated and not overdone plated next to a small green arugula salad. The breading texture is light and airy while still savory and satisfying. The cutlet is thin, tender and moist - perfect! Just the welcome addition of fresh lemon and some stone ground mustard is all that is needed. \n\nThe Chicken Milanese cutlet with lemon and stone ground mustard versus the arugula salad with cherry tomatoes is the perfect balance of sweet: savory: tangy.\n\nMy husband ordered the Fennel Sausage pizza with feta. He enjoyed it but I was too obsessively immersed in the Chicken Milanese to pay his dish much attention.\n\nWe visited The Kitchen just a few days after the Grand Opening and were pleasantly surprised. Typically newer restaurants are a little rusty and take time to smooth out the edges, understandably. However the staff we encountered on our visit were experienced, knowledgeable about food and wine pairings, attentive and efficient. Which is awesome when you want a nice meal but need it to be within your time schedule at the airport. \n\nReally, I can't say enough good about this place. My only complaint is that there isn't one in Seattle yet...
