I'm updating because when I emailed to cancel my service, I received a reply 2 minutes later of, \"OK\".  That's it.  Now I've done an online review and he answers wth paragraphs.\n\nI think the bottom line with Matt is he knows yards, but if you want to change your service in any way, you're a pain and he lets you know it with his attitude.  Once I hired him, I was made to feel like, \"Get out of my way, I know my stuff and if you change things, it's a pain.\"  That's not what I want when I'm a new customer. \n\nWhen I wrote to cancel, I said, \"The communication was lacking and it wasn't up to my standard, please acknowledge that you received this.\"  His answer, literally, was \"OK\".   This just confirmed why I was cancelling and in my opinion, why he's so defensive about my review.  He knows it wasn't the right way to answer my email. \n\nUse him if you'd like, your lawn will look great, just be prepared for the attitude.
