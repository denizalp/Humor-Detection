The food was fantastic and our server was great! I loved that it was byob. I had the meatloaf and it was amazing. My fiance had the artic char and it was also very good! The atmosphere was cool but not too trendy. The bathroom was very clean (I'm a freak about cleanliness of bathrooms, haha) the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that our entrees took an hour to arrive which made us late for the show we had tickets for. We wanted dessert but it was already too late. :(
