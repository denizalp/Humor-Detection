Half-price appetizers in the bar during 5-7pm Happy Hour! Yes, half price is still $6-8 a plate, which made us a little skeptical, but these appetizers are honkers, i.e. generous servings. Service was impeccable, especially given that we were seated in the bar and eating the \"cheap\" stuff. \n\nThe bread basket is notable, although the bread wasn't warm, it was tasty, and their butter is tasty. I love a nice, smeary butter. Between the two of us, we sampled the calamari, chopped salad, wedge salad and a bowl of clam chowder. I have no complaints. Every dish was executed well, and we had no problem eating every bite. The calamari was similar to a salt and pepper style, terrific! Both salads were fresh and topped with quality dressings. And, the bowl of chowder left my husband pondering, \"Legal, who?\"\n\nOne other thing, this place is huge! If you're looking to have a steak party with 20 of your closest friends, they can accommodate. \n\nGood eats, happy hour prices, and a nice atmosphere-- it's worth a visit!
