My family and I were in the shopping plaza this morning.  Our 4 year old son needed a haircut so he and I walked into the salon and asked if they could do a children's haircut.  Instead of a \"good morning\", a smile, and an answer to the question, the lady sitting at the front desk replied, \"we don't do children's prices\".  That wasn't my question and her delivery was such that I felt like I was somehow being judged financially.  It gave me flashes of Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman when she was trying to buy a dress.  I didn't care about the price.  I was asking a question because some salons prefer to not do such a young person's hair.  Your salon missed out on 2 clients today and a lesson in etiquette and good customer service is needed by those greeting customers as they walk in the door.
