We have used Skinny Wimp Moving twice in the past 7 months and both times have been absolutely amazing. Our first move with them was a huge load; we had to divide half of our furniture between a 3 bedroom apartment and a storage unit, as this was a temporary move until our house was finished. They were careful, yet quick during the packing process, and worked even faster during the unpacking process, despite the summer temperatures.\nFast forward 7 months: we decided to go with another moving company (AZ Movers) to save a little money (we moved 2 days after Christmas and were on a strict budget). Our scheduled appointment came and went and they never showed. We called Skinny Wimp to see if there was any way they could get us in that day. No problem whatsoever! They showed up around 4 and worked as quickly as possible to get our move done at a reasonable hour. Since my husband and I had already moved out all the boxes and small items in the apartment, they only had to move the furniture and what was left in our storage unit. This cut down on our cost immensely, and I also found a Yelp deal, which saved us another $75. We stayed on budget and were able to get in to our house as planned.\nWe had 2 different crews both moves, however, Mark was one of our movers both times. I can honestly say he is the most polite young man I've ever met. Everything is addressed as \"Yes ma'am\" or \"Yes sir.\" He even helped my husband set up our new TV, off the clock. \nHands down, these guys are awesome. Don't repeat our mistake of going with another company to save a couple bucks! As they say, you get what you pay for, and Skinny Wimp is definitely more deserving of your hard earned money than those other guys.
