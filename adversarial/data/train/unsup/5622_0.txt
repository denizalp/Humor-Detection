Veeeery busy!!!! We stood in line for over an hour to try this place and it was well worth it. \n\nThe prices of everything are very reasonable, especially the cannolis. They have a wonderful selection of cakes and mini cakes, cupcakes and everything else in between. \n\nREAL CUSTOMER SERVICE; Soooo my child was getting very frustrated and angry from waiting so long and by the time we got to the front she was screaming profusely!!!! She was acting crazy and being soooo loud. THEN one of the bakers working in the back actually came out and gave her a free cookie!!!! I wish I knew her name but she was African American with glasses and I really want to THANK HER and say how much I appreciated that gesture of kindness!!!!!! I hope she gets a raise because I know she deserves it just by being a sweet person!
