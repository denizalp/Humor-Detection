It is a Starbuck's so you know what you are getting and you probably know what to order. This was the first time at this Starbucks location but not my first time ordering Starbucks. Since it was morning, I ordered a Turkey bacon and egg white breakfast sandwich and a tall Pike. No biggie, normal-normal. \n\nSo why am I giving it a 4-Star? The line went super fast! There is a sign at the Drive-Thu mentioning to have your order and payment ready. When I got to the window to pay, I was on my phone checking in on Yelp and felt the pressure to get my credit card out. I am not good at following directions but even so, I was out of the Drive Thru line very fast. Oh yes and both the coffee and sandwich were as expected! :)
