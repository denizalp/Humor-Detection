$54 for a double bed room on January 2nd! Can't beat that deal! Booked on Expedia!! Will be back. It's literally right next to the mgm grand! Yea amazing deal right? Always plenty of parking too! You're rarely in your hotel room so no need to spend more than needed. \n\nWord of advice: bring sandals or flip flops because the floors are old and haven't been cleaned up as much. My restroom floor was pretty dirty but I'm giving them 4 stars just because it was such a great deal!!\n\nI'll be back!!
