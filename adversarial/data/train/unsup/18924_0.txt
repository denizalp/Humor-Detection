This is your LAST call before leaving Las Vegas! Go with your instict to stop over at the M Casino and Resort before taking off...  Your last grand buffet before going back to regular boring life style.. Stop off for your last grand buffet at Studio B! You'll thank me later! (Or hate me)\n\nGot to admit it, pretty good buffet! What blew my mind away was not the food, but yet the dessert bar! How could there be such delicious all you can eat dessert bar??\n\n I am devastated they ended the senior deal so my folks didn't get their discount. We paid  about $35 per person. One of the best part to not give up on this was there was a line for their VIPs and Handicap and another line for everyone else. Well, keep in mind if anyone in your party is in a wheel chair or an elderly, you can get into the handicap line and get in without much waiting! \n\nMy family is really not a big fan about buffets only because are eyes are way bigger then our stomach and we feel like crap afterward! BUT... who can resist missing one of the best Buffet in Las Vegas. I kind of forced everyone for a final stop and forced to have lunch at Studio B before heading to LA.\n\nThe food was impeccable. Prime rib and King crab legs, I just stuffed my face with these two items! haha. Fresh and delicious.cusines, from Chinese cuisine to Mexican, American, French! The list keeps going!\n\nOh my Gawd! The dessert section is like heaven. And usually at buffets the desserts doesn't taste so good, their either too sweet or not sweet enough, but this place is amazing! All different kind of cupcakes, from Red velvet, chocolate to peanut butter.Creme Brule, to all kind of cakes, macaroons, the best a full gelato bar!I had a pistachio nut gelato and a cappuccino (Yes even a cappuccino bar) to end my meal!!\n\nUNLIMITED EVERYTHING!!.. including Wine, Beer, Cappuccino, Express, and Gelato!!  :-)))
