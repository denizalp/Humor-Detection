Old School Pizzeria where have you been all my life!!! I almost lost my love of pizza! \nI started with the Gio salad featuring fennel and cucumbers. The presentation was classic and elegant not to mention delicious.  \nLet me say that the pizza here is absolutely inspiring. We ordered a small pizza with sausage, red bell peppers and mushrooms. I can safely say that it was the best pizza I have ever had. The house made sausage and cheese were indescribable and the mushrooms were a blend of shiitake, oyster, and more saut√©ed in garlic and cracked pepper, all on a sourdough crust! Yummy!!\nThen they go and top all the impeccable Italian cuisine with a true, old pizzeria ambiance complete with old, old school music. \nSimply delightful!!
