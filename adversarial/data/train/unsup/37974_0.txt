This is primarily my review on the food. The noodles and broth is good! The broth especially was thick enough and it was spicy good. Ok the spiciness is above the north American standard. The portion is reasonable but not large. There are enough beef slices, and beef balls. You get 2 ingredients per bowl. Everything extra cost $. Fair enough. It supposed to come with milk tea which is standard but I did not get to try it. Never came.\nOverall I think the quality of the food is worth a visit.\n\nHowever, being new, the restaurant has not work out the kinks of serving customers especially when it gets busy. I think they have not hired enough staff or perhaps not at all. So don't expect service, there is none. \n\nI might consider take away just because I did enjoy the noodles! I hope they survive long enough to work out the customer service kinks. They sure piss out customers who waited 30 mins but no food in sight.
