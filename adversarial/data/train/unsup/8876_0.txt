The spicy chicken app was delicious. Juicy and saucy but not very spicy. The service was good\/fast and the restaurant is clean and funky looking. The ramen however was disappointing. We got the spicy garlic ramen with pork belly any it was meh. Very garlicky (they add a scoop of fresh minced garlic) but but not spicy or incredibly flavourful. Aijisen down the street has a much more delicious, rich spicy pork broth. I personally like this spicy thai ramen broth. And my overall favourite ramen place still remains Kenzo (not the franchise one but a small mom & pop restaurant with the same name) near Yonge & steeles. There are way more extras like dumplings, egg, sweet pickled radish side dish, etc... and they're free!
