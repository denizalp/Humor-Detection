wasn't too happy with this place.  sort of a dive and wasn't really comfortable with the regular patrons smashed out of their senses during sunday lunch hour.  \n\nwhatever, i can take it with a grain of salt if at least their food was edible, but it wasn't.   i had the banquet burger with fries and 2x cokes to flush my intestines from this muck.\n\nmy senses were telling me that their bacon was sitting since the morning and way over crispy - dry and disgusting.  the burger seemed to have been one of those frozen $2 a dozen patties you can buy from walmart's meat section.  i liked how they possibly disguised the fact that their burger was horrid by drenching it in condiments.  serious, there was probably more volume of ketchup, mustard, mayo than the burger itself.  the fries, were probably the best part of the meal - even though they sucked too.\n\ni dunno, maybe i would give the place a second shot - as i believe in second chances.  However, I would save face going there again because of the alcoh-non-coolness of the place.  oh and i can't forget to mention the skin-head who walked in like he was sheriff that wore a jacket with embroidered print : \"Got a Problem, Let's fight about it\" or something ridiculous along those lines.\n\nFood's terrible, place is dirty, patrons are a sideshow and the customer service is fantastic compared to the rest of the elements.
