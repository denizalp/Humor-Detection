I had no idea this place existed even though I've driven past it a ton of times. It didn't really catch my attention. When my husband suggested we go there, I said \"Huh? Where?\" Been there once, definitely crave it again.\n\nThe carne asada burrito was delicious, and it was the perfect serving size. I was able to eat it all but I wasn't left hungry or unsatisfied either. They could definitely use some help in the service\/usability department though. When I first walked in, I had no idea where the menu was (it's written in chalk on the walls in very large print...so large I didn't even think to look at it as a menu). \n\nMmmm...I want a burrito now.
