Not bad. A lox bagel sandwich before takeoff was good enough for the price given the limited dining grab and go dining options in this terminal. Will it stack up against the best in town? No, but the bagel and fish were fresh and generously portioned. I would have added capers if they were available, but it was good for what it was.
