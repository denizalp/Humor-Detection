Let me start this review by saying this: \n\nI used to love Taco Tontos. It was cheap, fast, near campus, and burritos are my one true love. Around Thanksgiving I came here and got some special turkey burrito. I got food poisoning and felt like I was going to die. I literally couldn't even think about this place for months without wanting to throw up. You know how when you sometimes get a little too lit at the bar and almost die from alcohol poisoning, and you just can't even drink tequila anymore (or whatever you were drinking that brought you to the brink of metaphorical death) and you have to just write off that particular liquor? This food experience was comparable. \n\nFast forward to the present, and I had a hot date with a bearded hipster who also happened to have a man bun. My uterus was in absolute awe of this fine majestic creature when he suggested this little spot, and I definitely wasn't thinking with my brain when I nonchalantly agreed. \n\nSo, I came to this establishment weary of impending doom and not wanting to get food poisoning again. Alas, I survived. HALLELUJER. \n\nThe food was still as bland as ever, but the beef was tender and flavorful. I also loaded the fuck out of my burrito with some pickles, because it sounded fuckin delicious and pickles are bangin. \n\nTT also has an awesome assortment of craft beers and the vibe is usually pretty nice!
