CLINT is the man! I recently got a new iPhone 8 and was having trouble \"approving\" the device for certain apps. I tried everything the phone told me to do but, needless to say, I must be user-challenged. Clint had told me when he sold me the phone if I had any issues just bring it in. Well I did, it took us a few days but, low and behold, Clint came through. He was always kind, courteous and more then willing to take the time to help me. I highly recommend this store, mostly for Clint, he's a lifesaver! Thank you Clint!!!
