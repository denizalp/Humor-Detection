I woke up early Thursday morning with incredible arthritis pain in my knee, slept at most 2 hours over an 8 hour period. When I realized that standing up and putting pressure on my leg was nearly impossible, I logged on to Yelp and found several urgent care facilities, but in my condition, I realized that it would be difficult to walk even a few steps. Luckily I stumbled upon the services of 24 Vegas Hotel Doctor, a service that actually comes to your hotel room. I was somewhat skeptical of a service like this, being Las Vegas and all, but I called the number and spoke directly to Dr. Logan. We reviewed my symptoms over the phone, and we scheduled an appointment. I called at 6:30am and Dr. Logan arrived at 9:00am. What I experienced was a very professional doctor that spent several minutes going over my medical history, reviewing my symptoms, and recommending the options that I had to relieve my ailment. As it turned out, I was suffering from a gout attack in the knee, and I was given a steroid injection along with other prescriptions that he phoned into Walgreens. Within an hour or so, I was able to walk again and finish the conference that I was attending. Dr Logan followed  up with a phone call to see how I was progressing. Without his diagnosis and treatment, I don't know what I would have done. Thank you Doctor Logan!
