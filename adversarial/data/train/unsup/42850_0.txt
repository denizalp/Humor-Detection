Interesting setup, its located in a garage. Son and Mother team exceptionally friendly.  Lots of cookies !  Went solely for the chocolate chip cookies.  They are big and thick, however are not true choc chip cookies....have a peanut flavoring.  The chocolate pieces are not a high quality chocolate as well. Worth the trip to see this unique business. In a town that prides itself on putting fries and coleslaw on a sammich, it may be the best cookie you ever had.....but Mom still makes em better !
