I missed these jerks so much, I drove across town to see them again. Previously a food truck, Big Jerk hooked me with their amazing oxtails shortly before closing to prepare for a brick and mortar location- which finally opened in the Henderson area. Clear across town for me but worth the drive, particularly since we have so few Jamaican restaurants in Vegas.\n\nFOOD:\nThe oxtails remain my go-to, huge portion and super-tender. The jerk chicken is also solid, and their new pepper steak dish was also very tender. I prefer my ribs a bit saucier, but that may just be a personal preference. They have a couple of fusion-style burgers, for the less adventurous. Their sides are also on point, their mac and cheese is a must-order for me. Yucca fries, greens, and spinach are also good but the rice and peas isn't as consistent. When it's just right, it's amazing. They also have Patties, similar to empanadas, with various fillings- the beef is classic, and my favorite so far. They also recently added an all-day brunch menu on Sundays!\n\nSERVICE:\nIt's a walkup fast-casual spot, not unlike how their food truck was set up. Service is friendly, owners and management will often check on diners during the meal and they are open to feedback. Location is super clean and staff remembered me from my first visit, which is always great. Some of the newer staff are unfamiliar with the menu but the OG guys from the truck definitely live up to their \"nicest jerks in Vegas\" reputation.
