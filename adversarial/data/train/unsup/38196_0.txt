Best bagels in Vegas. I really miss this place since we moved back to California. No bagels even close to this good in OC. LA yes. I used to eat here 2 - 3 times a week. The everything, sesame, and poppy bagels are great. The cranberry is also awesome. The flavored cream cheeses are excellent as well. Black and white cookies and others sweets are good too.
