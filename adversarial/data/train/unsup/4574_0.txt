Olive Garden Fact: There is an Olive Garden cooking school in Italy and every year, more than 200 managers and team members travel to Olive Garden's Culinary Institute of Tuscany.\n\nLet's not beat around the bush and be honest: you only go to Olive Garden for the unlimited soup, salad, breadsticks, and the mints [Thank you for reminding me, Brittany C.!]. Anything else and you're just kidding yourself. I bet half the time, you people don't even publish your check-ins for Olive Garden because you're ashamed! :P \n\nNo hate for those of you that love it here though. Gimme that Zuppa Toscana any day!\n\nRecently, I tried their limited time Cheese-Filled Gnocchi Alfredo with Grilled Chicken. They were giant egg yolk-sized potato dumpling with cheese. All that cream and cheese forced me into a midday siesta! Will I be back for their Super Saiyan sized gnoccih? Nah. But it did give me enough energy to get home and promptly pass the eff out. Saturdays, amirite?
