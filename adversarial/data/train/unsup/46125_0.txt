I never thought I would say this but I love the Bay (well, this location and the Vancouver downtown location only)! They have an amazing selection of designer shoes including Charlotte Olympia, Casadei, Lanvin, Sophia Webster, etc. This bay also has a Topshop and the Room. I really like just wondering around the Room sometimes because makes me feel like I'm in a fashion designer gallery. The brands they carry are a lot less main stream than the ones at Holt Renfrew (they carry brands such as Giambattista Valli, Comme Des Garcons) .The pieces are really more like art works in my opinion. Of course they also have more affordable brands such as Sandro, Theory, Maje, Philip Lim, etc.
