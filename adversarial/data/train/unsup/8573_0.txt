So my husband and I read the 2 reviews and decided that this would be a good place to check out and hopefully buy another bike from. Sad to say that the reviews did not match our experience at the store. The staff was not helpful and in fact they were just rude and insulting. If I could I would give this place no stars but I can't. I do not recommend this place at all. I do recommend Pro Cyclery on Charleston. Had a great experience there. I would recommend that place in a heart beat. Luv the manager Leilani! She was really helpful.
