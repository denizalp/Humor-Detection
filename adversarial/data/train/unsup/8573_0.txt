This hotel is definitely for the younger crowd as the music is pumping and it's crazy packed at night.  The place is loud and gives off a lot of energy.  The casino is tight and confusing and sometimes hard to get around, as it gets very crowded.  The rooms here are in the small side and the shower is tiny with dribbles of water coming out of the shower.  On the huge plus side the bed was very comfortable and had some bigger pillows rather than the tiny little ones most casinos offer.  Overall, this hotel is just ok!!!
