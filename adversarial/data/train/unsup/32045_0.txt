The food is good. But wow the service here is TERRIBLE. They got our order wrong but we told the girl at the counter politely that she had forgotten something and she got a horrible attitude with us. \n\nShe and the other employees there started smirking and laughing and makinh my fiance anf I very uncomfortable. The servers there's were hiding behind menus and texting, ignoring the customers sitting down.\n\nNEVER going back there again.
