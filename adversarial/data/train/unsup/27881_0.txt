Fantastic, flaky goodness!\n\nAdorable spot dedicated to pies! Very nice addition to the neighborhood. The restaurant has a bit of a kitschy feel with the checkered floors (not my favorite look but it's totally fitting with the theme of the resto). Diners get to choose from the many savory and sweet pies. If you don't feel like dining in, there's always the option of take-out or purchasing a frozen pie. \n\n*The Butter Chicken-chickpea & Vegalicious pies are my two favorites! \n\nDiners can buy individual pies or include sides of coleslaw and fries. Portions are veeery reasonable for the price. \n\nThis place is a must visit for all pie enthusiasts!
