This is great for the price that she charges. She is professional and the room and equipment is clean. There are a couple of drawbacks...for the brazilian she doesn't use gloves, which kind of freaked me out. Also, you have to be careful when she is waxing your face because she's not very careful about getting the smaller hairs. \n\nShe is EXCELLENT at threading and did a great job on my eyebrows. I would definitely go back!
