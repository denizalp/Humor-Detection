I'm writing this complaint about an order last week for a takeout Tuna sashimi order which when I opened at home was Salmon. Because I can't eat salmon, I called right away and the cashier girl said they would refund the wrong order. I asked if they wanted the salmon order returned and she said throw it out. A week has passed and no refund on my cc. Called tonight about the refund, same girl made a lame excuse about nobody there to process the refund and hung up on me. I was furious about this behavior and called back to speak to the manger and she hung up on me again!  I wasn't rude or shouting but this kind of customer service is unbelievable!  They may have a good review from others but I'm definitely not happy about their service or lipservice.
