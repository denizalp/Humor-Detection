Another formulaic execution of the Walgreens system. This is a perfect store with the usual aisles of personal care, over-the-counter medications, a pharmacy, snacks and drinks and a seasonal aisle. I was able to purchase the cold meds I needed, a bottle of water with which to wash it down and a box of tissues for blowing my stuffed nose very quickly.\n\nIt's a good store that is in the middle of absolutely nowhere.
