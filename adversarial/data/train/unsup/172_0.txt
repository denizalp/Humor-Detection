First time here and I learned about this gem on YELP.  Let me just say that THIS is the BEST restaurant that I have been to since I started all this yelping!  It's not about the sparse atmosphere, it is all about the food and all the flavors.  My taste buds felt like they went to a party on steroids!  First started with the Fatuch salad, which I cannot even describe other than it had a light lemony dressing on it and was topped with fried pita chips.  Then I had the chicken kabob with hummus, instead of the rice.  Again, I cannot even describe all the flavors in either the chicken or the hummus.  The hummus was whipped up like potatoes, kinda.  The whole time I was eating, I was squealing with culinary delight.  I almost never order dessert, but just had to try what the next table over was eating.   It is called KNAFEH.   Apparently it is a dessert found in Palenstine.  If for no other reason you go to this restaurant, go for this dessert.   There just aren't words.   For a few moments, we felt as if we had left Charlotte for either a Middle Eastern country or maybe NYC.  We'll be talking about this experience for many moons.   I may not brush my teeth tonight because I want to keep the flavors in my mouth.   Double wow.
