I visited Standard & Pour a short while after they opened and was blown away by the excellent food and drink menu they have to offer.\n\nWe tried a number of dishes and all were creative and delicious. The desserts were especially intriguing. As someone who doesn't like overly sweet desserts, these were perfect for me. The play on wine & cheese and the saffron rice pudding were my two favorites. \n\nThere were plenty more stars of the menu but every dish is a winner, so you can't go wrong. \n\nThe restaurant is adorable and overlooks the strip from its perch above Henderson. Great place to enjoy some cocktails and have a nice evening out in the suburbs.
