Quality food, fresh ingredients and attentive service ...that's the motto of Emeril's Fish House! I tried an amazing variety of foods here. First off, the best appetizer on the list is Emeril's BBQ shrimp. The shrimp were tender and prepared with a smoky sweet BBQ sauce. It was so delicious I would recommend this as a must try app. My next favorite app was the blue crab with remoulade. There were large chunks of cold crab meat on a lettuce bed, served with a delicious sauce. The mushroom risotto was not so great. The rice was a bit hard, could have used a few more minutes of cooking.\n\nNext up main courses-  you cannot go wrong with the lobster tail with beurre blanc! The lobster was fresh and tender.  My favorite part of this dish was the mashed potatoes. There were saut√©ed sweet onions mixed in which took them to another level. Another delicious choice was the crab stuffed shrimp. The shrimp were marinated in a Cajun seasoning, served on a bed of succotash. They were not skimpy on the seasoned crabmeat stuffed inside. This is an all-around great place to have an excellent fine dining dinner!
