Where to start...\n\nBeen a long time customer here and with plenty of other vape shops in town the customer service and knowledge of the staff keep me coming back.\n\nJustin is very knowledgeable with all the products sold within the store and many sold outside of the store, also his attention to detail during rebuilds is amazing! My only complaint is that Justin winds up in the bathroom for long periods of time, which scares me as I feel he may have died in there.\n\nCraig is friendly guy and an amazing mod builder, I also love his cute little bald head some days I feel like rubbing it for good luck. Can I rub your head Craig?\n\nDustin is the \"do all\" guy and pretty much the wild card in the shop, if you need some crazy build Dustin is your man this is evidenced by his \"Cholo Mobile\"\n\nSharkbait or \"Noob\" is the new flavor girl, not quite sure what she does but she smiles.\n\nOh and lets not forget about the flavors, 31 flavors is for pussies these guys have like 31 thousand ok well maybe not that may but we must be getting close to 300!\n\nAlso I know I am leaving out some employees, names are not going well with me tonight probably since I am loving some of the new flavors they released in the past week and it is affecting my memory.
