Born and raised in Chicago so I am happy to find a place that serves Vienna dogs and also has Italian Beef the Chicago way.  The dogs were awesome and the beef was really good except I don't like Vienna's giardiniera relish....I prefer Marconis!  If Matt's used Marconi's relish instead and was able to get the Turano bread delivered fresh, it would be a miracle!  THE FRESH CUT FRIES ARE THE BEST WAY TO EAT FRIES!  This is how we eat them in Chicago and if you don't like them this way, then get the o-rings.  :)
