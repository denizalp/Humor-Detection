*my last review was removed as it was short and sweet and just said, here's my advice, \"don't\"\n*so I will add some color from my visit, the decor looks like a run down YMCA from the 70's, the elevators felt like they may or may not work all herky jerky not to mention there's like one for a ridiculously gigantic floor\n*at the front desk they said we got a \"suite\" on the 17th floor which sounded great until we got to it, it was seriously a bad best western, no mini bar, dark, dirty with a sweet Chia pet growing outta the drain in the shower, also had the ultra mini threadbare towels and those crappy little best western soaps, real deluxe
