Worse dentist I came here was told everything I wanted to hear and was left with my teeth screwed up after paying around 6 grand after all they do is just try to book you for more appointments even when they know u left crying! From the horrible results I was left with a messed up bite that I never had to begin with. I never\nMade the time to make this review because I wanted to just let it go but I come to yelp to find good places so I do t waste my time so I hope I save someone the stress I got having my smile done here \n\nHow willardsen started my work then once I payed I was passed around to new assistants every time and that probably how I got screwed once I had a horrible overbite I never had been b4 is when joe Willard even decided to step back in and try to correct a mess that already gone to far all they want is money once they are paid u no longer are an important client u will see for yourself idk were all these 5 stars came from last I remember there weren't much reviews at all!
