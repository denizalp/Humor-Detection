Do not go here... really. Do not go. I am stunned that they have good reviews. Has the world gone mad? \n\nThe organization of the restaurant is so bad it's hard to fathom. Head on over to one of the other amazing restaurants in downtown Gilbert and wait in line. \n\nI live in the neighborhood and am a local business owner so I always try to patronize locally owned restaurants. I kept giving this place a chance because the food is decent, but it's not worth the ridiculousness you must go through to actually get it delivered to your table! \n\nThis place is deserted for a reason. It's a crap shoot if you will actually get your meal or not. \n\nI'm guessing that their delivery service is the only thing keeping them in business. \n\nDon't go here if you value good service. No food is worth disrespect.
