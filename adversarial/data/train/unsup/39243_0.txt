All you can eat sushi bar for lunch is the best one in Charlotte.  The fish is fresh, the miso is delicious, and the atmosphere is loud and overwhelming.\n\nRusan's has been a staple in Charlotte for years, and it's easy to see why.  Walking into the place you're greeted with loud sushi chefs yelling at each other in Japanese a bustling crowd - a tell tale sign of fresh ingredients - and tons of fresh fish.\n\nOne surprising gem to look out for is the art on the walls.  Really nice stylized modern work by Rusan - I'm assuming to be the owner of the joint.  Who knew the guy could not only put together a sweet sushi place, but slap some paint on a canvas??\n\nThe best value they offer, as I mentioned earlier, is the lunch buffet.  For around $11 after tip you can bank on the fact that you'll be so full and groggy at 2:30pm, you'll have to leave the office or get a cup of coffee.  Don't forget to grab one of those bite sized pieces of cake at the end of the bar for dessert - really good!
