This review is for the lounge portion of Koi. This place delivered what has been my WORST Vegas club experience in recent memory. Our party got hooked in by the promoters advertising the $20 cover and open bar for ladies until midnight. \n\nThe lounge was a single, circular room and had obnoxious wardens with flashlights and aggressive security guards in the place of light shows and nice decor. The bartender was incredibly rude to everyone in our party. It took me 20 minutes (I timed it) standing in front of him to get a watered-down long island for $17. The ladies weren't able to take advantage of the open bar due to the long delays, so we really paid $20 each to come into a dark room and get dissed. \n\nLame!
