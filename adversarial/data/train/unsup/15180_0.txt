Yeah this place is just a not up to Vegas snuff.\n\nI really wanted to like it, but when you pay 250 a night to have a view of a concrete wall and then AC units with cig butts yeah.... then you know you get your money worth. \n\nI think that the luxor really needs to put the money in to redo it and also have a better checkin and check out system it takes far to long. \n\nJust not worth it, I think it is overpriced and outdated. With all the other options on the strip they really need to up their game.
