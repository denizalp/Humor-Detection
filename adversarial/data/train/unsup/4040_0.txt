Visited here a couple times since my review. \n\nWednesday nights they have a live trivia game from 8-9:30ish [winner gets free gift certificate].  \nThe trivia is nice although they had cheesy music on during the breaks instead of the cavs game. \n\nThe bartenders are cute for being the fake-n-bake types, what else did you expect: it's Parma ! The prices are higher than I what I'd expect for their beer and the atmosphere is still a bit older for me, way too many cougars around.
