Amazing way to spend a Sunday. I visited Kaya for brunch, which is only offered on Sunday, and was pleasantly impressed. From the moment we walked in the door, we were thoroughly taken care of. The hostess, whose name I didn't catch, was a wonderful woman who offered us a table even though they had a reservation coming in at 2. \n\nWe opted for the mojito and grapefruit-basil margaritas instead of traditional brunch cocktails and they were fantastic. The tropical guac (order the homemade kaya chips to substitute the tortilla chips) was awesome, I really wanted to take it home with me. We chose the chicken and waffles (it came with a spicy Tabasco butter which added an extra layer of flavor) and the huevos rancheros. I was super excited that the huevos rancheros came with ~more~ of the tropical guac, but it was all in all a fantastic dish. The bacon was peppery and delicious, albeit I wish it was a bit crispier, but it was a great juxtaposition to the sweetness of the grilled pineapple.\n\nI'll have to come back and see what Kaya has to offer besides an awesome brunch, but if brunch is what you're in the market for, definitely come check it out next time you are doing your Sunday shopping in the Strip.
