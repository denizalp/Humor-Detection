We ventured over to The Sweet Spot one morning for breakfast, having a craving for both good coffee and hash browns.  They are a bit of a hike for us, but the trip was well worth it.\n\nI had the Perfect Breakfast, with scrambled eggs (adding cheddar), hash browns, and a biscuit.  My husband had an omelet with home fries and a biscuit.  Both of our breakfasts were yummy.  The biscuits were soft and fluffy, the hash browns were both soft and crispy (and no extra seasoning needed!), and the potatoes were nicely flavored with peppers.  \n\nTheir lattes were similarly good.  We ordered two regulars with an extra shot (three shots all told), and no syrup.  They were piping hot, strong, and delicious.  \n\nService was fast and friendly.  We'll definitely return!
