BOGO on Thursdays. You're welcome. \n\nNot the best pizza I've ever had nor is it the worst, but it gets the job done. I also have left over lunch for the next day. I had their wings recently, and they were good, nice flavors and texture! The garlic knots were a bit lacking so I would skip on those. Also, pizza in general is salty, but I always end up drinking like a gallon of water before going to bed after eating 4 slices of their small pizza. Maybe their pizzas are a little high on the sodium content?\n\nThe dude working at the front counter is on it! He always packs us plates, napkins, crushed red pepper, and parmesan cheese. Props, dude! Overall, the good deal, decent pizza, and friendly service is what brings me back on Thursdays.
