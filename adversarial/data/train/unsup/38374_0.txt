My family and I were passing through. I had a  hard to find nail in my tire. Matthew took excellent care of my car and genuinely cared about the safety of my family. I highly recommend this location. The wait time was not bad at all in the facility was clean and very professional. Even though we were passing through we decided to stay and check out the aquarium and zoo based on Matthew's recommendation.
