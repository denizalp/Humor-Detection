Did I really forget to post a note for Nandini? I hate when I do that. A+ rating for this little Indian restaurant. Clean inside, friendly staff, and uber delicious food. We could not believe how flavorful (and not too spicy) everything was. Thanks for a great first time trying out some of your wonderful dishes. And the naan bread - perfect. Can't wait to get back and try a few new items next time.
