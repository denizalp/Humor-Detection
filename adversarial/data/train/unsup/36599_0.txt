We went on a Friday, late morning, with the intention of buying a new helmet for my wife and jacket and pants for me.  None of the staff acknowledged us, despite there being only one other customer.\nAfter spending 10 minutes trying on gear my wife found a helmet she liked but needed a smaller size.  I couldn't find the jacket and pants that they listed on their website.  We looked around for help but the staff were nowhere to be seen.  I decided to spend my time waiting for them by looking on Yelp for other motorcycle dealers which sold gear.  By the time I found the Triumph dealership down the street, it was time to go.  On our way to the exit we finally saw a member of staff.  He looked at us and walked off in the opposite direction.  No goodbye, no offers of assistance.\nI guess if you're not looking at the motorcycles, you're not worth their precious time.\nWe never did find a helmet, jacket or pants, but we did spend over $400 at the Triumph dealership on other clothes.  They will be getting more of my business, Carter Power Sports will not.
