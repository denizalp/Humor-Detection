Austin was a typical rambunctious Malinois. We got him as a rescue at about 18 months old and he had more energy and was always under your feet. We took him to see Andrew and Chad based on a recommendation from a friend. It was the best 3 week investment into Austin we could have ever done. Now Austin while he is still learning and still tests the boundaries, is a far better behaved dog. He sits, stays, heels, and goes to his bed (Place) when you tell him to. In just 3 short weeks they can take a dog who doesn't listen or care about what you are trying to get him to do and make him Man's best friend! Thanks for everything Andrew and Chad!
