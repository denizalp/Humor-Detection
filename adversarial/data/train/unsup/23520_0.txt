Horrible location.\nCalling this location downtown Champaign is a stretch. It's next to a police station near a sketchier part of town where there's little parking. No other night businesses are close.  The owners already owned the space from a catering service out they run, and apparently didn't think location actually mattered. Maybe a great interior could make up for this, but in this town it's hard to beat Boltini, and this doesn't come within a mile of it. \n\nBad drinks.\nThe mixed drinks were weak and more expensive that Boltini. Some of the  drinks were brought out in incorrect bottles indicating they didn't understand the basics of serving alcohol. I'm not very wise about these things myself, but it was obvious to me that my beer shouldn't have been served in a pilsner glass.\n\nBad service.\nMy group had to wait half and hour to get our checks. When I went up to the bar to let them know we had been waiting, I didn't get an apology of any kind. The waiter didn't know who ordered what, and actually forgot some of the beers.\nThey close at 1pm on most nights unlike every other place. Everyone was confused when last call was 12:45. \n\nThis place will have to make major improvements if its going to survive at all.  I'm pretty certain it can't. There are much better places to go in downtown Champaign. Don't waste your time.
