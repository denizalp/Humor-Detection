I like shopping at Costco once in a while, but I hate coming here on the weekends. It's way too busy! People everywhere with their oversized carts. I'm a small person so the carts feel a little big to me.\n\nWe all know you buy bulk items from Costco but I like to come here to buy my workout clothes. Okay, more specially, their Kirkland brand yoga pants. They are actually well made for only $19.99. Why spend big bucks on clothes that I'm gonna sweat in.\n\nI love their pre-made foods which are very convenient and their bake goods are also very delicious. \n\nI'm actually not a member but my boyfriend is so when I want to shop here, which is not too often, I'd have to come with my him.  BTW, regular membership is $55.00 a year.
