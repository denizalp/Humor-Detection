Well, came back to give this place a chance since their signage boasted delicious breakfast burritos...I ordered the huevos rancheros but after paying for my order I was informed by the cashier that in fact there were no whole eggs in the restaurant. She claimed that they had all been scrambled the night before in preparation for the morning breakfast shift, but they must have forgotten to leave a few whole for that one dish. She offered to have the eggs served scrambled or as an omelet instead. I'm not convinced that the eggs here are not reconstituted egg powder. This is a glorified taco bell, just with a little more extensive menu. Everything was served on Styrofoam plates with plastic utensils, even for dine-in service. I gave 2 stars because the dish was served with a warm salsa verde, which was spicy with fresh onion and cilantro...a great condiment. \n\nMy other qualm is that the heavy front door slams, shaking the entire glass wall each time someone walks in. The walls in this place may come crashing down someday in more ways than one.
