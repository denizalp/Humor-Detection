The Fountains at the Bellagio are one of the iconic images of Las Vegas.  \n\nThe show is every half hour or so starting in the evening and go through the late night hours.  The fountain show is truly impressive shooting jets of water hundreds of feet into the air.  Each show is accompanied by music.  There is not a bad spot to view the show from but ideally you would want to be on Las Vegas Blvd.  The Bellagio is on the west side and serves as the back drop to the show.
