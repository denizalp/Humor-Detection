I heard there s a new boba spot opening n I definitely want to try sth new. N they promote that they make organic boba tea n I really want to try. It located at the corner of a sort of ghetto  plaza, which makes me feel unsafe around. When I walked in the store, staff greeted me warmly but I m surprised that how hard the store tried to copy Brew Tea Bar n Mr. Z. (Will they also copy King Fu Tea n Tea Space? Let me know, lol.) \nI had the highly recommended tea, strawberry matcha latte and It s definitely NOTHING organic or powder-free. How come a strawberry that red? It has to be cooked with whatever illegal amount of color ingredient. How come Matcha stuff made without powder?  It s water down n too sweet to cover the tea flavor or maybe no real tea actually used. Their other topping looks weird as they presented to me to prove their stuff to be organic. \nEvery boba tea is made with certain amount of syrup. That is the truth. If they try to promote their \"organic\" stuff, then they got to use serious organic stuff like whole food n be honest to their customers. Customers r smart! I rather trust they making tea with certain amount of syrup n try their best to use fresh fruit at the moment of purchase n production. \nALSO, the bulb container is NOT recommended for refill due to the #1 level plastic container regulation. Thought the store offers refill discount, it is NOT safe to refill with that kind of bottle. Finally, Hope they understand the definition of organic n don't try to fool the market. I d rather stick with Mr.Z, at least they use real fruit at production n cook real tea daily.
