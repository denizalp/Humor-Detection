Stopped by on a slow Tuesday evening at Grit and Grace.\nWe had the small plate of Short ribs over cream cheese biscuits. It was one of the recommend items by the bartender and is was not the fall apart short ribs my girl makes. I was expecting much more. The small plate was good just not \"WOW, so I gave the 3 star rating. \nSo I finish my red wine then left. I figured if I had one of the best items I could only go down hill from there.
