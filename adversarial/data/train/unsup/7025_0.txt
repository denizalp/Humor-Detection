Pros: Pro-Buckhunt and Ms. Pac-Man arcarde game, some moderately priced deep fried vegetarian options, huge plate of nachos, bud light chicks giving out free booze....um...tvs?\n\nCons; The peanut thing to me is just gross. Why am I paying to eat in a barn? The tvs were weirdly placed, the food is still quickly made bar food and the ambiance is random mid-life crisis decor for that friends dad who is finally gonna \"party!\" and put up his favourite beer signs, some taxidermied animals. the ceiling fans with multi-colured lights-WTF?\n\nCould be bonus: If you have a mortal enemy allergic to peanuts, you could walk in the door and immediately shove their face into the peanut pit at the door-instant face swelling! And as they cry and fall to the floor-peanuts all over the floor stuck to their body! And....done.
