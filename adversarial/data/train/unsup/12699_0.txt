Sometimes you need an outfit fast and cheap, and this my girly friends is one place you should check out. My shopping experiences have been very hit or miss, but If I need a cute top or dress XI comes to mind first! \nYou will find anything you need here...pants,shorts, tops, dresses, skirts, shoes, accessories, and so on but be warned most things here are skimpy. SO if you are looking for church wear..this may not be your best bet.
