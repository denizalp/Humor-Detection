These apartments are really bad, they broke into our house last night & on Sunday night there was another robbery too. Same thing happened to my sisters brother in law that lived here. I don't feel safe here & my kids and I are scared. The front office isn't doing shit about it. Someone that lives here or works is doing this. They need to put more attention and put security over night. This needs to stop already. DON'T MOVE HERE ITS NOT SAFE\"
