Amazing pool company!! My sales guy Jay was awesome. Jay and the whole team at Laguna were very patient with me and my wife as we didn't really know what we wanted. The end result was beyond expectations and below our budget.  The best part was my backyard was finished a month before my neighbors and we started at the exact same time. Laguna rocks!
