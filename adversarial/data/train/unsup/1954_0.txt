I like Haggar because the shirts are fashionable (or at least, they're the fashion I like to wear) and they tend to last. As well, the outlet stores like this one seem to understand outlet pricing with deep discounts off the regular price.\n\nI popped in today and found a few things, though they're still well focused on the winter wear with sweaters and heavier fabrics. Looking at the clearance rack, I found a polo shirt in my size (70% off!) and there was a nice pair of slacks in my size and color (40% off!).\n\nEasy.\n\nSign up for their text program and get regular coupons!
