Green is my absolute favorite restaurant ever. The thyme fries are spectacular, the tsoynamis are heavenly, the argentine po-boy is enough to convince my mother (carnivorous, formerly suspicious of vegan food) to return again and again. And don't neglect the crab puffs, the buffalo wings, even the salads. What a perfectly yummy place.
