HORRIBLE!\nI explained carefully to the eyebrow lady how I wanted my eyebrows done and also showed a picture and she said she would make them look exactly like the picture. My eyebrows turned out horrible, she plucked in areas I had asked her not to and they were much thinner than I wanted them to be. She also missed out a lot of stray hairs and gave them a really abnormal shape. They were completely uneven. I explained to her half way that I did not like the shape and asked her not to do the same to the other eyebrow and yet she did. I had to run off to sephora and buy a bunch of eyebrow products after this.
