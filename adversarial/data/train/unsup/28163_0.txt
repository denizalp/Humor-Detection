Our second time eating here and again AMAZING FOOD!  This place is seriously good.  Their green chili sauce is legit New Mexican.  Last time we had a little left over to take home.  This time we asked for extra to take home for breakfast! Kids devoured the cheese curds! Definitely one of our staple go to restaurants now.
