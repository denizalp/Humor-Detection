let me set the scene for why i did NOT enjoy eating here.  up on mill ave for a nursing class on the weekend...with about 8 other girls...walked in after wandering aimlessly for the first 15 minutes of our 1 hour lunch break cuz we are all indecisive bitches...enter restaurant mexico.\n\nwe sat ourselves in the corner booth and almost walked right back out when we saw the sign that said \"no split checks\"...we prolly should have right then and there.  after being reassured that we would be able to pay separately, we decided to stay...then came the chips und salsa.  three chips in, i got a hair, A HAIR, in a chip.  ugh...way to start on the wrong goddamn foot.  took forever for our drinks to get there, food wasn't expensive, and was semi-tasty...i got the chicken taco & rice, it was good...except the BONE i got in my taco.  i was so super done with this place by the time we were ready to leave...but then we had to tackle the issue of trying to pay our ONE check w\/ 9 cards...UGH.\n\noverall, place wasn't half bad, it just got on my bad side with the hair\/bone\/check issues.  nothing worth writing home about and i would rather have wandered around longer...big, fat PASS on this one in the future.
