How much wood could a woodchuck chuck, if a woodchuck could chuck wood?  Sorry.  I went there.  Couldn't resist.  \n\nWith that said, that stupid tongue twister is all I could think about inside the Chuck Box.  I certainly wasn't waxing poetic about the food.  I thought the burgers and chicken burgers here were OK, but just average.  The chicken burger with pepper jack was cooked just right, but nothing about it struck me as better than normal.\n\nI've seen other burger joints with condiment bars, and was hoping for something distinctive, but no - just the typical average fixings.  The feel in here is very country or Midwestern with the wooden boxes as stools and burlap sack ceiling.  I dunno.  Can't really place it, but it's very laidback and unassuming here.  I like it, but The Chuck Box felt and tasted just average to me.\n\nCash only.
