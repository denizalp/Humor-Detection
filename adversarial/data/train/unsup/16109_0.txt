For some reason, I remembered the hotel used be more fancier then it is. Perhaps that was a few too many years ago... lol \nI still do love this casino and lodge though! It's comfy and cozy but the rooms are ready for an upgrade. For example, the bathroom really old school and TV, which was a small 27'' old school TV. \n\n-No free wifi :-( - (although you can steal from their or others unsecured network, it was still not convenience) \n\nThey have Bath and Body Works products! That's one of the reason I wanted to come back here..lol But the bottles are so small, it's barely enough for 2 people. \n\nThe pool area is gorgeous, but it was too cold to go swimming this Winter :-( \nIt's about 6 miles off the strip, so if you do not have a car, it's not convenient. They do have daily free shuttle service to the Strip. \n\nOverall, the stay was great. It was promo special $60 buy one night get second night free! Definitely a great deal. But watch out for their (Las Vegas) new 15% or so extra service amenity charge. I felt like I was cheated from that.
