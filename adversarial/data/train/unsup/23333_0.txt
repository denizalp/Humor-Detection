The Convention Center is many things. It's a pristine, clean and accessible space that attracts legit large-scale conventions, summits and business meetings.\n\nIts easy to consider events like Comic Con and Beer Fest when leaving this review, but I'm giving the Convention Center five stars for a very unconventional (ba-dum-ch!) reason: they have the cutest little urban farm I've ever seen. Yes, smack in the middle of this bustling Convention Center, there's an outdoor urban farm with oversized pumpkins, squash, honeybees, chickens and more. \n\nThey don't outright advertise it, but if you're touring the space or throwing an event there, ask to see it. It's literally the oddest little gem, and is uniquely beautiful. It completely catches you off guard to stumble into this green oasis, back dropped against the Rock Hall in the distance. At the Convention Center, they use the farm to grow their own veggies and eggs, and the chefs use the produce from their little farm actively. They'll even let you see the chickens! Kids will love exploring this medium sized area, so stop by for a moment to check it out. You'll never know if you don't ask!
