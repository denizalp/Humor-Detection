Is there a Rating system for Rip off and liars? They would be 5 Stars BAD!\n\nI took my truck into Brake Masters because the brakes were feeling a little off. I was thinking minor work nothing major. And my AC was being weird too.\n\nI get a call saying the good news is the AC will be $190 it has a burnt out resister and needs to be replaced. WHAT the good news is $190?\n\nThen on to the bad news, basically my entire sorry ENTIRE break system needs replacing, Master Cylinder, Front Brakes, Back, or and something was boiling and needs flushing. I'm sure there was more but I was in complete shock sorry SHOCK.\n\nSo I pick up my truck that I was convinced would not even make it home, and drove it to another Shop.\n\nScare tactics is want Brake Masters is about. I am not sure if it is because I am a woman or because I had the unfortunate choice of going to Brake Masters, but never again. And I will be sure to let everyone I know with a Vehicle, STAY AWAY!\n\nOh I got it fixed for $700 at a different place and nothing was wrong with my Master Cylinder. See my other review!
