I have been to Larry's a few times, and there are always bar fights between groups of people inside the bar and in the parking lot. The security is awful, they will break up a fight but continue to let the 'fighers' stay inside- which inevitably results in more fights. \nThe last time I went to Larry's, we were walking through the parking lot to our cars when some asshole thought he would be cool and shoot his gun off into the air. Security didn't do anything about this! I will never go back to this bar, at least not without a bullet proof vest on. \n(Besides all of this, their bartenders are slow and lazy and the bathrooms are deplorable.)
