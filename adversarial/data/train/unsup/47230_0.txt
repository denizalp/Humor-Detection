Update on my prior review and my stars are a a reflection of both visits. \n\nWe returned for dinner and sat at the bar this time. Had to wait for a few minutes for service but the bartender was super friendly when she got to us. We ordered some drinks and food, including the turtle soup. The turtle soup came first and I tried it - ugh, super salty and earthy. Definitely stronger flavor than other turtle soups I have had. I told the bartender that I wasn't a fan and wanted to get a salad instead. She took the soup and graciously removed it from our bill. The other parts of our dinner were good but not memorable. After food was delivered, we weren't visited again so I never got another drink like I had wanted. \n\nI want to give this place one more chance. I hope service is a little tighter and the food is more consistent between visits. I definitely WANT to like this place!
