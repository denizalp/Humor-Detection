We came here for lunch on the weekend. It was busy since we came during peak hours.\n\nI like how simple the menu is - there is no doubt what they specialize in. I went with the classic, the fish and chips. \n\nThe interior is fairly small with only a few tables and some bar seating. There are also a few tables outside, but the seating is seriously lacking considering how much traffic this place gets. Definitely not made for bigger groups.\n\nThe wait for the food wasn't bad; they were fairly busy and we only waited 10\/15 minutes for the food. The fish: delicious! The breading is light, crispy, and fried to perfection. The French fries were also good and you got a good portion size with your basket. The fountain drink machine is nice because there is such a large selection and you can mix drinks. \n\nAnother good point is the selection of sauces. My favorite was the Southwest Ranch! However, I'm a traditionalist when it comes to the fish and chips and loved the fish with Gordon's Tartar Sauce.\n\nOverall, Gordon Ramsay Fish & Chips really lives up to the hype. I will be back for sure on my next visit :)
