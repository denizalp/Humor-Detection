I did a thai yoga restorative workshop with Lisa Tai and Beatrix Montaille.  The room was a perfect temperature for restorative yoga.  It was toasty warm as this space is also used for hot yoga.  The two hour restorative class is very relaxing and serene with dim lighting and candles.  They supply everything from mats to bolster to eye pillows.  I just had to show up!  These classes run about once per month.  The next one is on March 16, 2014 from 5 to 7 p.m.  I will be there again to get into my zen zone.  Highly recommended!
