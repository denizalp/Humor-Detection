What's with the lack of reviews!  This place is BALLS OUT AWESOME!!!\n\nWhy?  Well, sure, it's annoying to battle all the children running around.  And sure, the music and the incredibly loud popping balloon game are really alarming.  And sure, it's Circus Circus.  But I mean, COME ON!!\n\nWe made a special trip to the Circus Circus just to check this place out.  I am so glad we did!\n\nI was there on 9\/21\/09 and the bar was rotating in full swing.  The bartender was charming and generous.  The view of the circus is good, until you rotate out of view, but wait. . . there it is again!  \n\nThis place is a stone cold trip.  Live out your \"Fear and Loathing. . .\" fantasies here.  Take a date and test their mettle.  Marvel at the sea of humanity rotating around you.  \n\nThere aren't enough stars to communicate the joy I felt while sitting in the Horse A Round bar.
