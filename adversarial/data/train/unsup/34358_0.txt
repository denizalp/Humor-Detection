Seriously delicious. This tiny stall in the Farmer's Market is run by a couple who hand make all their sausages and burgers themselves. I love that they are chicken products ( and occasionally lamb)  and have no crap mixed in as filler. For ten dollars you get two sausages that weigh about a pound. At first I though it was a tad bit pricey, but these suckers go a long way. I couldn't even finish eating one completely and used it for leftovers the next day. Missing link has a ton of flavour choices, with  catchy names like Redneck Shit Kicker, so you'll never get bored.
