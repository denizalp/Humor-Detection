I wish there was an option for 0 stars, cuz they don't even deserve one. We checked in and told them we had TWO people, and seeing as there was TWO of us standing there, I don't see how that would be so difficult to understand. 15 minute wait, not bad. Wandered around, came back, I came up to the counter and the guy walked away, not a word, just turned his back on me and left. A little irritated, I turned on my heel and walked out, decided to try again in a few minutes. We come back in and the nice lady at the counter asked for our names, (unintentionally?) makes fun of my boyfriends name, and tells me that since the first idiot never asked for MY name, I had to wait behind the other 5 people that came in after me. LIVID. Guess you get what you pay for.
