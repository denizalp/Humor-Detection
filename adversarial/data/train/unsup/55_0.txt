I'm not a huge fan of clubs in general, but... Tao is a full-sensory experience, if anything.\n\nRemember, Tao is still a Vegas club, no matter how you package it.  You get the requisite long lines, the requisite flabbergasting price tags on table service, the requisite REALLY HOT CHICKS, the requisite REALLY DRUNK FREAKS, and the requisite crowds.\n\nI just like Tao better than any of the other clubs in Vegas because there's just so much to see besides the people.  If I wanted to people-watch, I'd have strolled around the Strip.  There are mini-shows going on all over the place, people dancing on wall crevasses that you never even noticed before, half naked chicks floating in water, and... well.. just... keep your eyes peeled.  There's lots to see.\n\nA tip for the ladies?  Don't go with any boys.  Sorry, but we all know that a group of girls get in with little or no wait, just as in any club.  Boys, if you don't have patience, then shoot, just get a table.  It's Vegas.  You're supposed to indulge.
