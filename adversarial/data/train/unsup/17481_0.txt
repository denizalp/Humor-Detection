My review is for hiking to La Madre Springs on the White Rock Loop. I wanted to do the Loop, but we got a very late start. That's one bad thing about having trails within a gated park. Come on... that's what headlamps are for! We parked at the Willow Springs Picnic Area off Scenic Drive. The trail starts off as a wide gravel road. At 1.4 miles the White Rock Loop trail heads right. Afraid of being locked up in the park, we went straight towards the springs. But what the springs turned out to be was a small mossy retention pond created by a man made dam built in the 1960s. It still was a little surprising to see this in the desert. We took a little snack break and enjoyed the little 'pond'. But I still couldn't help but to feel a little board on this western section of White Rock Loop. Next time, I hope to experience the eastern side of this loop. Our round trip to the La Madre Springs was 4 miles.
