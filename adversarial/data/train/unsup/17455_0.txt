Nooooommmmmmers! Bachi Burger is delicious with extra delicious on top. We ordered:\n -The kids meal (of course) which includes a grilled cheese, fries and fruit. \n- The Crusty Crab ala Misti Y.'s recommendation, (Pan Roasted Crab Cake, Lettuce, Tomato, Avocado, Onion, Mango Chutney, Tarragon Remoulade, Butter Glazed Sweet Bread Bun). \n- The Kalbi burger (Ground Beef, Pork, Soy, Garlic, Ginger, Chili Paste, Green Onions, Ciabatta Bun, Kim Chee, Ko Chu Jang Mayo )\n- The Pork Belly Steamed Buns\n- Portuguese Donuts, Vietnamese Cinnamon, Coffee Gelato      \n- Iced Passion Milk Tea with Boba\n\nEverything was equally mindbogglingly delicious. My fav was definitely the Steamed Buns and Passion Milk Tea. The Boba was a little mushy, but the tea was outstanding. The Crusty Crab was the best crab cake creation I have ever had. Mr. R adored his Kalbi Burger. The Portuguese Donuts melted in my mouth and the coffee gelato took the dessert to another level altogether. I will return just as quickly as I can return to Vegas. \n\nThe only reason they are not getting 5 stars is the shotty service. Our server was fantastic, but we hardly saw him. It was extremely busy, but most of the servers were running around like chickens with their heads cut off. They were literally bumping into each other. The manager came over to our table at the end of the meal and apologized for the bad service, she said she felt bad and that they are working on it. I will update my review after another visit.
