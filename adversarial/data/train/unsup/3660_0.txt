I saw on their Facebook page that today BullPen was offering a 2 for one deal on burgers today. I was all over that. I had a hard time deciding between wings or burger last time. Good thing I went with the wings so I could get the burger deal this time. \n\nWe had the same waitress, sat in the same booth. The place had a handful of customers, so not particularly busy. As I said in my pervious review they have a few things to work on. Service is one. It's still a little slow. I ordered the Smokewagon burger. This is a double decker with bacon, Monterey Jack cheese, and jalape√±o chutney on a steakhouse bun. I ordered some Diablo sauce just to kick it up a little. This order came with fries.\n\nThis was one of the best burgers I've had. The burgers were cooked perfectly. Kudos to Ryan the chef there. It was juicy and flavorful. Trying to finish it was a job. These are 2 quarter pound burgers. The fries were just ok. They were the thin cut kind, not my favorite. A little Diablo sauce made the fries interesting. \n\nThis will go into my best burger list.
