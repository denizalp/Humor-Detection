NEVER GOING BACK AGAIN!! The lady was rough with my cuticles. My mom sat in the chair next to me and and the massage chair was broken so she moved to the next one over. They ended up seating a new customer in her old chair and with the old water my mom already had her feet in. Then they acted like me, my mom and sister were going to run out without paying. They were on our ass and very rude and pushy then charged my moms card wrong. Smh EFF THIS PLACE!! We will take our bi-weekly business elsewhere.
