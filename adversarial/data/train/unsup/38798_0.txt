We have been with this business for a number of years and have been satisfied in the past.  Don't know what's happened, but we notified them earlier this month (July 11, 2018) about our air conditioner sounding like a freight train.  Within two days a representative from Residential Services came out and they said they found the problem.  The wheel was going out and it could go any day now.  Residential Services said it was a special order and it would take a few days.  We were a little alarmed because we knew and they confirmed that the air could go out any day.  Well a week later they contacted us and said they got the part and would be out Monday, July 16th.  Monday came along and they called and said their technician had a family emergency and they couldn't be out now until Friday, July 27th.  They advised us that the part was in but the tech had the part in his truck.  They couldn't go retrieve it. We told them at that time that the air was down.  Well they put us on the priority list!  That didn't happen.  It's now Friday and they told us they won't be out till late afternoon or this evening.  Now mind you, we live in Las Vegas and there have been severe heat warnings for the last two weeks. It's 100 degrees out still at 10:00pm.  We advised them that we're seniors (70+) and there could be consequences to their delay.  No reaction.  They said they could bring out a portable air conditioner for one room but it'll be a $500 deposit.  Strange, they have the time to do that but not repair the main problem and we're just going to pull out $500 from \"where\"?  I'm confused! So, BE WARNED, don't use National Home Warranty because we called them this morning to and they stuck by their contractor and had no urgency at all. I believe in the old saying, \"if they're doing it to you, they're doing it to others\".  They never did show up today and no notification of any type.  We will not continue to use National Home Warranty once our year is up.  GT
