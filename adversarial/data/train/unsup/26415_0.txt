Hey Everyone.....had dinner there last night, 2\/26.\n\nLOVED IT..\n\nThe restaurant itself, very downtown urban modern, clean, bathrooms were spotless at the time of my visit.\n\nReading other reviews there were several mentions of the Pretzels w\/ the Fondue.  C'mon...pretzels and cheese, what's not to love.  This appetizer didn't disappoint, pretzels were hot and fresh, didn't have that 'just thawed' taste, the cheese sauce AWESOME!   We also had the white shrimp from the raw bar.  At $3 dollars a piece i thought was a little pricey, with that said they were terrific.  HUGE, plump and fresh, the taste was truly great.  My only bad thing to say about the shrimp was the 'shell on', had i thought to ask i would have asked that they peel the shrimp before brining it out.  It's a personal pet peeve of mine of having to take the shells off shrimp.  For out main meal we shared the Saturday night special which was baby back ribs and the grilled swordfish.  The swordfish was served with some kind of barely side dish, VERY good, the fish was terrific, would definitely get this again.  We were split on baby back ribs. They had a heavy char on them, which i loved my friend wasn't crazy about them but said they had a good flavor.  The meat literally fell off the both with almost no effort at all.\n\nThe service was very very good, our server Steph M, was very attentive w\/o being intrusive, which can sometimes be a fine line.  Our drinks were NEVER empty, which is HUGE, we tend to drink a lot of iced tea while we eat.\n\nOn a side note, they have signs pointing for parking for the restaurant.  A sign at the exit of the elevators would be a great help.  \n\nCan't wait to go back.....i hope this place makes it!\n\nCiao everyone!
