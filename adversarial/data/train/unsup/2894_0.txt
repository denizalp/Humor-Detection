You don't know tender until you've stuffed your face with a serving of the marinated galbi at Woonam Jung, and that is my recommendation to you: a face stuffing of marinated galbi at Woonam Jung. I am pretty sure it will cure whatever ails you. \n\nYes, it is going to cost you more than AYCE options. It will cost you approximately $28 for one order, but you will get a dish that defies culinary logic. This galbi manages to be thick AND tender, which leads me to believe they have a Korean black magic wizard in the back casting tenderizing spells. \n\nHowever, they should also hire a wizard to work out their service kinks. It is grand opening still, and they were swamped by all the CES businessmen posses. They were out of tea, out of broccoli, and they managed to mess up our order in every way possible, including running one credit card for the entire bill after we gave them three for a split check. We were there for 3-hours! Someone who didn't eat the bewitched galbi would have probably given them 2-stars based on the service alone.\n\nIf fish is your friend, you will also be pretty delighted by the seafood combination, which comes with lobster tail, squid, shrimp and salmon. The seafood lovers at my table were drooling on the bountiful sea offerings as they were laid across the grill. It is a good value, although we think we may have been given a double order? (Refer to paragraph 3.)\n\nBanchan were not particularly notable to my dismay. \n\nHowever, in the end, Mr. Tender Galbi made up for everything. Seriously, I realize it may be a bit more than you want to pay for Korean BBQ, but your pennies will be well spent on this marinated masterpiece. (No need to waste the extra buck on the \"prime,\" unmarinated cousin.)
