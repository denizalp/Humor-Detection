They got new hair stylists. The older lady didn't speak English at all and literally did everything opposite of what I wanted her to do. I've never felt this mad before that I have to rant on yelp. I wanted the front of my hair to remain the same length and shorter on top. She did the exact opposite and now I just look like I'm crazy. Also she freaking shaved my widows peak when I specifically told her not to. Who on earth does that? I loved my widows peak. Anyway the new Juno hair is a disaster and definitely very over priced compared to the service before. Don't go there!
