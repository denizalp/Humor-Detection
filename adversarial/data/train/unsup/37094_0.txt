I'm giving 4 stars because the service itself was professional and I do like my eyebrow shape. \nBut, if you believe you have a relatively sensitive skin, then trust yourself and don't risk it. I did a facial threading with eyebrows two days ago, and now the skin underneath my eyebrow as well as both cheeks are red and irritated with bumps. All I did  after threading is wash my face with cold water, apply a basic moisturizer, avoid sun exposure and didn't use any other products just to make sure I won't have skin irritation, but it happened anyway. \nThis was the first time I tried threading, and will be the last time also. I don't believe in second or third time will be better kind of thing.
