Solid 3.5 stars for food and 4 for service and ambiance. \n\nInvited to join a few ladies I know for dinner before a Suns game, I was informed that reservations were made here.  Having not tried this downtown eatery yet, I was looking forward to the experience.  \n\nWhen I arrived, the ladies had ordered a bottle of a nice sturdy red wine, I was offered and accepted to be served but only requested a short pour, as I only wanted a taste.  I pretty much stuck to the water. \n\nThe server was very attentive and came back to check on us regularly.  When it came time to ordering I was quite appreciateive to the suggestions she offered.  I finally decided on a bowl of soup (shrimp and corn chowder) and the Ancho Pork empanadas.   In hindsight 2 rich choices but both quite tasty.  \nThe soup had at least 5 good sized shrimp, perfectly tender in a creamy base that was seasoned well and just enough spice to warm and not overwhelm the palate.  \nThe empanadas had seasoned pork, with a flavor similar to chorizo (garlic, chile, cumin), the crust was a flaky puff pastry.  This was served with a sweet citrus pepper marmalade that complimented the empanada well.  \n\nOverall I was pleased and I will have to go back to try again as I hear their happy hour is great.
