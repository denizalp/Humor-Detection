our seats were on row 205 in the middle way back.    there good seats if you have great vision,  we wear glasses and still saw jennifer lopez fuzzy.  she does stand and sing and dance and look straight toward my way  being i was straight up in the middle facing the stage.   at the end of the show everyone stands and dance and it is hard to see her as i'm a short person and most of the people in front of me were all way taller then me.  she does walk toward her left side of her stage shaped as an o  and stays there and sings and dance and talks to the crowd and she does the same toward the right side of her stage shaped j too .  have fun and go see her,, her show was spectacular!
