Came here last night and it was a lot of fun.\n\nBoondocks has a nice patio with cornhole, some pool and best of all it is Dog Friendly!\nWe came here for a happy hour and had some of the sleepy dog beer (so good!) and ordered some of the pretzals and I was happy with the service, food, and beer selection.\nI also got some water for my puppy, and they gave me a nice dog treat for him (super cute!).\n\nSo - why 4 stars and not 5 if it was a great time? Bc I don't know what sets them apart. I need to try more thing sin their menu and really see the quality of their food. But the pretzals were bomb! And puppy enjoyed his treat!
