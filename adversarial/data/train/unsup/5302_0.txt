I feel a deep sadness for anyone who has not tried this gelato place yet. I love this restaurant so much that I am willing to overlook all its faults (tiny, overly-warm and super crowded) because it is simply... delicious. \n\nAnd addicting. \n\nKekou Gelato House is nestled amongst other food-related \"stuff\" like cafes and restaurants. Christmas lights are draped outside from one end to the other, hanging over long, wooden benches. No matter what the weather is like, there are people milling about, happily scooping out ice cream with their brightly coloured spoons. Upon entering I get a blast of warmth, which undoubtedly feels comforting in the winter but unbearable in the summer. The menu is supposed to be \"Asian-inspired\", including flavours such as durian and Tsing Tao Plum. \n\nWhen you pick your cup size for your ice cream, the \"small\" and \"medium\" size can hold 2 flavours, but the \"large\" size offers you up to 3 flavours if requested. They let you try out samples before ordering, and it's usually a quick procession to the cashier despite the lineups. It's definitely tastier if you eat outside, and there's a lot more space too!\n\nThe fruit and tea flavours are mixed better than the other options in my opinion. The sweetness is very balanced and not overwhelming, while the texture is quite smooth to the tongue. Their sorbets are scrumptious as well! Kekou's uses a \"traditional custard base, which [they] age and pasteurize in house for 10-12 hours\" (taken from their website), thus combining the ingredients naturally. They have quickly become my dealer in all things sugary. I love it here! \n\nThe best part, of course, is their stamp card. After you collect 9 stamps, you can receive a free medium-sized cup of gelato or sorbet! I am personally insulted that not enough places have this stamp system yet. Free food is the perfect way to encourage people to do anything.
