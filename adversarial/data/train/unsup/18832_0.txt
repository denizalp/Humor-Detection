Boyfriend and I had a date here. We enjoyed it. There were a few hiccups but overall we had no major complaints, hence the four stars.\n\nThe good:\n- Each table has a cup of tiny Jenga that you can play with. At least.. it looked exactly like Jenga?! So that was entertaining.\n- The restaurant was clean and well-decorated.\n- Prices were OK, not dirt cheap but they were bigger portions than usual Thai restaurants!\n- Food came out surprisingly fast.\n\nThe not-so-good:\n- We ordered the spiciest level for all our dishes and they forgot to make one dish even a tiny bit spicy. I have a feeling they accidentally gave our dish to someone else since they seemed surprised it hadn't come out yet.\n- They charge you a no-cash fee without giving any notice so I ended up paying a few dollars more since I paid with a card. Some notice would have been appreciated. \n\nOther notes:\n- The crispy garlic chicken tastes really good.. It has the consistency of Korean-style fried chicken. I really enjoyed that.\n- The green curry is less thick than the usual. Maybe that's why it came out so fast? \n- The pad thai was not that impressive. I am usually hard to please because I have really high standards for pad thai. This one was just OK. They use the thin kind of noodles for it.\n- The green curry and the garlic chicken dish both come with little plates of rice.\n\nI would definitely come back since we had a nice time overall! I would love to try the Thai tea next time.\n\nBTW, if you like spicy food or are used to crazy Asian-level spiciness, don't be afraid to get the highest level. Yes - get the one that's hotter than the 'Thai hot' level. All I can say is - we are still in white-washed Arizona and you have nothing to fear. It isn't even that spicy.
