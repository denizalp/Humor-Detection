Amazing Garlic Chicken Wings.  Truly amazing.  This joint does not get any more humble.  The sign on the road merely says \"Chinese Food\" in both English and Spanish.  It doesn't even say Tams.  There are no tables.  It's literally a hole in a wall.  Get out of your car, walk up to the hole in the wall, place your order, wait 10 minutes, grab your goodies and drive away.  The menu has all the favorites you would expect  but you want to get the chicken wings. (Many different flavors available.. we got garlic).  They're part southern fried chicken, part chicken wing (you get the whole wing - not just 'paddles' and 'drums\") and part chinese food.  Chinese Soul food indeed, and perhaps the best wings in town.  We also had the chicken egg foo young and it was superb.  The egg roll was big, thick and loaded with goodies.  It was also dripping with grease.... I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing.  Anyway, I ate all of it and it was pretty darn tasty.  Unless you're packing, I would go to Tams during daylight.  The neighborhood is tough.  Try Tam's.  It's amazing.
