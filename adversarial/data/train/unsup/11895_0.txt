Looking for a little speed in your life? Venture over to Charlotte Motor Speedway, a destination where NASCAR drivers and fans can get their ultimate rush.\n\n\nIt's been said to me many times before: \" Charlotte got a lot\", and personally, I think that's far from the reality. But, one thing should be on your Charlotte's bucket list, not to just attend a NASCAR race, but even better, to get your heart racing, your palms sweaty and be so freakin' excited by getting behind the wheel of a real NASCAR race car. \n\nI bought my NASCAR\"Practice Driving Experience\"ticket, and I was thrilled. After meeting the crew chief, with other drivers, at the 20 minutes instruction class, and being familiar with the course's corners, I took a step back for a bit. I realized the most powerful cars, the drag race cars, are manual transmission!!!!! \nSeriously Sari. How didn't I think of that. I disappointed myself. But I didn't give up! I opted for the NASCAR\"Ride Along Experience\" instead.\n\nI was strapped into the passenger seat of one these 800-horsepower beasts, next to a talented professional driver. We drove around Charlotte Motor Speedway, and reached the speed of 173 mph.\n\nThe 6 lap NASCAR ride along did fulfilled my need for speed. As a thrill-seeker who's often addicted to the rush of excitement, I was high. The wild ride, was another jaw-dropping, curse-inducing (sorry!) experience. \n \nUpon completion, and for additional fee, I received a car video that captured my experience, plus a photo plaque \"for bragging\", and Logo hat & T-shirt of my choice! \n\nIt was 5 crazy minutes of pure adrenaline rush. Highly recommended. I'll try to learn how to drive a stick shift, and I'll be on the driver seat next time.\n\nFIVE Yelps!
