As the dutchess of two gyms and someone who works out near-daily, you wouldn't think I'd be a fan of this place... but it's perfect for date night because my guy can build his own burger and I can build a fantastic salad!\n\nBurgers are perfectly cooked, and cooked to order, so don't expect it out in three minutes flat. Add on as many toppings as you want, most are free with charges for the obvious like guac and bacon. The 1\/3 pound is their most popular, but by guy tends to get their 3\/4 pound. Bun always seems to fall apart, not sure if this is because the patty is thick and toppings make it hard to bite or if they should upgrade to sturdier buns.\n\nThe Salad-Lovers-Salad is aptly named, and at $10 is a bowl packed with all your favorite ingredients, including several cheese options. You can make it as healthy (cucumbers, tomatoes, olives, pickles) or indulgent (cheeses, croutons, bacon) as you like. Protein is like $2 for grilled chicken, $4 for salmon. Even sticking to free ingredients, the portion is enormous. \n\nThey have typical burger-joint apps, sides, and shakes. The fries are skin-on with salt and pepper, and I really like them but my guy prefers their thin-cut onion rings. Definitely try their fried mushrooms, which are sliced (like fried pickles typically are) rather than whole, for maximum crunchy surface area. Pair this with one of their dips, the Sriracha Ranch is my fave. I don't do shakes but my guy swears their malts are top notch.\n\nService is attentive and friendly, so long as you keep the whole \"this is not fast food\" thing in mind for the timing.
