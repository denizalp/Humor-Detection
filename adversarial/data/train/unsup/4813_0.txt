Watch out for city council meetings! They gave us the run around for 8 months on a re-zoning process, plus were incredibly condescending. Words cannot express my dismay at the double standard that Councilwoman Schroder presented--reprimanding one side of a communal dispute without acknowledging the other side's continual bullying and threats.
