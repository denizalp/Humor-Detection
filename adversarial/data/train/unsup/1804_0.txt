I get there at 3rd for my lunch date and place not busy but we get sat at that weird half booth type table with 1 chair. So I sit on the booth side with my date. I guess I should have thought to ask if we should push 2 tables together because with all the condiments and stuff on the table I only get like 4 inches of the corner. The waiter announces how excited HE is because we're his last table. So his focus was on him I guess. It was a crummy experience and I'm sad about the decor and layout change. Next time I'll walk the restaurant and find a better roomier table or sit at the bar. Eating at the bar would have been more room.
