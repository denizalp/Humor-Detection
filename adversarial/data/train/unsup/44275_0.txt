One of the best happy hours in town -- and you can get it on Saturday! It may not be one of the cheapest happy hours in town (with things averaging around $8) but I do feel like it's a bargain for the atmosphere and quality. \n\nWhen it's Saturday and one-half of a couple wants sushi and the other half wants something that's not sushi but just good food, where can you turn? Enter Parallax. The happy hour was a surprise bonus. \n\nThe what felt like 30 page clipboard menu was a bit overwhelming and honestly, I wanted to venture off the HH menu for a drink but it was too much and I didn't know how to decide. \n\nThe short rib pot stickers were my favorite and I can't wait to come back to have them again!! The sushi rolls were very flavorful and tasty (and seemed fresh) and the tempura green beans were also a stand out!
