The 4 stars are for the large women's section! Some locations can't seem to stay stocked. That is not the case here. I stopped in the afternoon on a 50% day & there was still an over abundance to go through! I found a ton of name brand jeans & a couple of great skirts! If I had more time (I spent an hour & a half) I bet I could've found a lot more stuff! I unfortunately had to use the restroom while I was here & it was not an ideal experience. The registers were disorganized & a little chaotic but that's to be expected on a big sale day!
