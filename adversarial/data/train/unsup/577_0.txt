2\/7\/18\n\nBestest attractions ever of Las Vegas: The \"O\" Show at Bellagio, and...\n\nThe Coca-Cola Store.\n\nYes, besterer than all of the (admittedly damn good) nudie bars... well, maybe not \"all\" cause I didn't do them all... bester than all the best poker floors (not like it's easy to top that--who doesn't love to sit next to guys with BO worse than orangutan who hates water at the zoo???), bester than any buffet in town (...except maybe Bacchanal Buffet in Caesar's Palace, though definitely cheaper), bester than any fancy schmancy restaurant (okay, again... out of the ones I tried I guuueeeesssss), bester than Frozen Hot Chocolate at Serendipity...................... well... okay it's close...\n\nLook, it also saved my soon-to-be nephew's life.
