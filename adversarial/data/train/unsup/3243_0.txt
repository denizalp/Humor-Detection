Yoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo. This place is off the chain good.  Came here with my boyfriend this past Sunday afternoon after seeing all of the awesome Yelp reviews and it did not disappoint.  The place was PACKED and we waited about 20 minutes for a table.  No biggie.  I'll wait for good food.  We were seated and ordered two agua frescas (one strawberry (for him) and a watermelon (for me)) along with two of their famous tortas.  About 20 minutes later our drinks and food came out together.  I wish the drinks came out sooner (I was thirsty), but again, the place was packed and the boyfriend and I were engaged in conversation anyway.  \nTortas?  Bomb!  Agua Frescas?  Bomb!  Definitely a fork and knife kind of sandwich (it's huge!).  I preferred my watermelon agua fresca to his strawberry, but they were both yumm-o. The boyfriend couldn't say enough good things about his torta (he'd never had one)  and I was so pleased to know that I had found the amazing Mexican restaurant I had been searching for since relocating to Phoenix in July.  I'm still perplexed as to why there is such a lack of decent Mexican food here!\nThe menu is diverse and carries many other items besides tortas so check it out.  Also, Adam Richman from Man vs Food came here to film a food challenge episode.  You'll immediately know by the wall sized photos of him strewn throughout the restaurant.  Bring your peeps and an appetite and you won't leave hungry or disappointed.  I can't wait to come back and try more stuff!
