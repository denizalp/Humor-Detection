Saw Escape Games Mesa on Groupon and decide them out....the captain's quarter's was so fun! There were 4 of us and we finished with a few minutes left. It was just challenging enough to get frustrating at times and then feel stupid when we figured out the clue lol This was our friend's first time doing an escape room and we loved it..will definitely be back again!
