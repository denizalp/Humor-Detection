5 stars ALL the way! Been going to them & ONLY them for the past 3.5 years & would not ever think of going any where else. Tammy is by far the best nail lady I've ever had. You would NOT regret coming here. All these negative reviews are lies! Everyone in the salon is great. From the main receptionist to the owner of the salon Kim! Love them all. And this is the only salon where my gel color gets compliments and asked what color is it because they mix their own colors! To me it's perfection at this salon. Just look at my nails on the main pic of their Yelp page. Every where I went they complimented on the color and shape of the nails. Basically the over all look. ESP from that picture. Don't waste your time and money going any where else!
