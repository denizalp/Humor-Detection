I've been there for weekday dinner, weekend lunch, and weekday lunch.  My fiance and I keep bringing friends to it as well because we all love it.  A perk about this place is that it's the only all-you-can-eat sushi place I've found downtown that includes dim sum (including shrimp dumplings) on the menu, as well as more than just ice cream in the dessert selection.  Also we can order sashimi salmon and tuna during LUNCH on weekends- a real bonus.\nTheir sushi and other dishes are fresh and delicious.  Service has been ultra fast all times I've been there and they have 15% discount for students, and a stamp card for the 10th meal free.  \nFor me this is about as good as it gets!
