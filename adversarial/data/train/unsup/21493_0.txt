Vegas could use a bit more southern hospitality. Actually A LOT MORE! I was slightly turned off by this restaurant sharing space with a smokey bar when I first entered. Especially since I was eating with an infant. As all parents can attest, happy infant = happy meal. I quickly forgot about the environment w\/ the Olympics on TV and a happy Bobby Q greeted us to our table. Thumbs up for the ambiance! \n\nIf you want to experience passionate food,  you are in the right place. This is real comfort food made from scratch. I wouldn't classify this as modern, but more as clean! Clean plating and crisp flavorful sauces! Bobby Q sauce and Honey Cayenne Butter can be poured on anything and it would make the dish amazing!\n\nCornbread from an iron skillet, chicken and waffles, shrimp and grits. Priced just right for the quality of food and proportions,  I'm really excited to come back and try everything else. \n\nI hope Bobby Q and the crew does well so they can move to a legit location! Ride that magic bus like Slidin' Thru!
