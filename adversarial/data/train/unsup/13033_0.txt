I ended up at Makutu's Island on a recent Saturday morning with my two kids and my mother-in-law in tow... We were looking for an indoor play option to escape the heat, and that's exactly what we found!\n\nI didn't know much about it other than what I read on the Yelp reviews and website, and I'd say that what I read was pretty accurate.  We arrived around 10:30am and it wasn't too crowded.  My kids (3 and 4 years old) started running around and exploring as soon as we entered.  Note: before entering, you must sign a waiver and pay... I think it was less than $30 for the four of us to enter,; pretty reasonable.  \n\nThe kids found plenty to keep them busy, and we bumped into some other friends of ours while we were there.  Some of the play areas are for kids over 5 or a certain height, but they aren't monitored, so it's up to the parents to keep an eye on their kids, which some were doing \/ some were not.  \n\nI spent another $10 in games with the kids... skeeball, a wheel of fortune type game, one where you throw a ball at clowns to knock them down, etc... We got tickets and with those,  prizes (erasers, fake teeth, and candy).  Isn't it amazing how the cheapest junkiest little things can make kids so happy by the way?!\n\nWhen it started to get more crowded around noon, I'd had enough... We convinced the kids to leave after a small melt-down and headed out to nearby Pita Jungle for a quick lunch before we headed home.\n\nThis place is definitely A-OK - it won't blow you away as an adult, but it's a fun place for kids -- especially if you're looking to escape our crazy AZ summer heat!
