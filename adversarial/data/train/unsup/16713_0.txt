I'm basing this review of my visit on a first impression. Sometimes a first impression is all it takes. I met my friend Heather C for lunch at Digestif. We walked in and were greeted by a friendly hostess. Our server was at our table as soon as we were seated. He overheard me admiring their absinthe fountains and he ran to get me information on where to buy one just like theirs. I thought it was very nice of him. He then ran through their specials of the day. I nearly fainted when he stated that they had a foie gras burger topped with arugula to offer for lunch. I am A LOVER of foie gras. I immediately ordered it but asked for no arugula. The waiter stated that the chef offers baby spinach instead. Perfect. After a bit of wait, our food was served. Ah... what can I say my fellow foodies? The food was beautiful! I had to take several pictures of it for my food porn collection (see pic). I did away with the bun and ate the meat and the french fries. It was fabulous. The burger was a ground up flat iron steak and the foie gras was served on top of it with the baby spinach finishing off the creation. Fantastic, well cooked, and full of flavor. \n\nIf this is any indication of the quality of the food at Digestif, I will certainly become a devoted fan. It will be interesting to see if my next visit will be just as good if not better...we shall see!
