What a joke!! If anyone ever asks me to attend this club again! I will kindly show you a sarcastic smile, while giving you the middle finger and walk away!! This place is like a crammed hallway! ALL DUDES!!! It seriously is a waste of time. You literally have to push yourself through a wall of people that are shoulder to shoulder to get anywhere! I am not even sure if the Fire Marshall would be pleased with the occupancy of the place. This place smells like Body Oder and Vomit. Both make sense giving the fact I seem someone blow chunks in a packed crowd! That was really the only entertainment I saw at this place!
