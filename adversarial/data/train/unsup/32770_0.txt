Wow!! Amazing facial! She really does a great job and it is affordable too! She does a thorough job with extractions too! I got a great cleansing with a sonic brush,followed by a nice smelling pumpkin peel. She really removed all of my blackheads.Plus she massages your head,neck,hands and feet!! My skin looked and felt great afterward. Four weeks later my skin still feels smoother and absorbs moisturizer better. She has a nice on-line system to book appointments as well.
