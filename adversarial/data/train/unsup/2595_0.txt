I'm a fan of superheroes: comics, movies, you name it. Typically, you'lll find me in a big debate on superhero powers: invisibility vs. flying. Tonight, I longed for bionic arteries that could withstand daily dosages of Penguin's delectable greasy food. \n\nPenguins is an \"establishment.\" Landmark restaurant, arguably in a historic location, complete with the tiniest, antiquated porcelain drinking fountain , fit only for pygmies, out front. It feels more like a bar than a restaurant inside. Lots of wood on the walls and bar, a jukebox blaring David Bowie, Foo Fighters and some hairbands. \n\nThe burgers are straightforward and delicious. Soft, moist bun, lettuce, tomato and a hand-shaped burger patty, that tastes like the heralded In-N-Out burger on crack. The Ribeye Sandwich is surprisingly delicious. Horseradish mayo compliments the tender beef, a messy mass of perfection. \n\nThe stars of the show are their generously portioned, translucent tissue paper inducing, greasy sides. We ordered sweet potato fries and thin onion strings. The sweet potato fries, when dipped into honey mustard sauce are addictive. Although not super crisp or battered, the sweet potato flavor rings through. The onion strings were lightly battered, sweet and tasty. They are the kind that are just oniony enough to satisfy, but not too oniony where you'd run for some mouthwash right after.  I seriously could imagine me pounding both down after a night of drinking. Speaking of which, beers: $2 domestics, $3.50 imports. Not bad. \n\nRarely will I take leftover fried food to go, but I took a box home tonight. Hoping somehow the oven will revive the amazing cravability factor of my onion rings and sweet potato fries. \n\n3 beers, 2 entrees, 2 sides (lots leftover) $24.
