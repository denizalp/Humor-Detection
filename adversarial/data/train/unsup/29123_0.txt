Service was great.   The atmosphere is very trendy.   The decoration is fun and creative.   The music is very annoying.   They actually had a song that just said \"Sushisamba!\" over and over.   It made me want to shoot myself in the head.   How pretentious. \n\nThe non-sushi items were great.   We had the tuna tayaki and roasted vegetables.   Both were outstanding. \n\nUnfortunately,  the sushi was very mediocre and extremely expensive.  We won't be back.
