Horrible experience after returning the car. Accused of turning it in without filling up the gas when I was clearly told it would be $10 per gallon and who in their right mind would want to pay that. Then was charged 6 different times and was told they couldn't do anything about it and that it was only a hold (which made me overdraft multiple times due to other pending transactions) and was told they couldn't refund that and to speak to my bank for credits. Finally got the gas stuff figured out and was promised credits that haven't been fully applied. Still dealing with the overdraft fees and waiting on credits. Everytime I call I get the run around and I'm told the system is down that they will call me back but they don't and haven't. I refuse to ever use your company again as my experience was horrible. Told them that my flight was leaving in the morning and I needed those funds back in my account but no one gave a crap and walk off multiple times leaving me standing there looking for answers. Wouldn't recommend Avis to anyone I know while traveling or seeking a rental. Either upgrade your systems or train your employees to do a better job in providing exceptional customer service.  If you know there's a glitch why the heck would you continue to service Customer????? Why???? My credit card was charged over the spending limit and I'm left to deal with it. Not because I don't manage my finances because that wasn't the issues, the problem was I was charged more than what I was supposed to pay. \n\n\nOnly employees that were great was the girl who helped me when I got the car and the young lady when I first tried to return the car. Everyone else was TRASH! DO NOT RENT FROM AVIS. Go to enterprise instead. I don't know why I even tried with another company. Smdh I guess this was my fault. TRASH TRASH TRASH.
