Stopped into ToGo's for the first time today for lunch. Walking in the door I was greeting by a funky odor. It didn't smell like bread, it didn't smell like cleaning products. Maybe it was the soup of the day? Maybe the ham had turned? Whatever it was, it should have been a sign to turn around. \n\nI went up to the counter and the woman working said something to me about a dog and I was obviously confused. I said \"what?\" and she looked at me and said \"hi\" like I was the crazy one. Then the woman ahead of me in line came back and it turns out the dog conversation was relevant to her. So another guy came up, saved me from this awkward moment and took my order.\n\nI got the turkey and cheese on parmesan bread. It looked good in the picture but this sandwich was awful. The bread is way too thick and dry. It didn't taste fresh at all. The turkey had no flavor. The mayo had no flavor. It was bland, boring and blah. I would have rather gone to Subway. And I hate Subway.\n\nToGo's? More like NoGo's.
