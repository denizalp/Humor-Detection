Francesca has a great selection of Italian baked goods - pastries, cakes, cookies, breads, etc., dishes for hot lunches such as lasagna and arancini (rice balls), gelato, and a cafe.  \n\nWe came here to get some of their sugar donuts - they're pretty big, bigger than your average coffe shop's and they're delicious. We also got a chocolate-stuffed powdered donut - overall, it wasn't too sweet which made it super easy to eat quickly. \n\nI also got a sandwich - prosciutto, hot capicollo, house mayo, havarti, lettuce, tomato, salt, pepper, & oregano on calabrese bread ($6). The size is huge which makes it a good value - I needed a bit of help finishing it. I also got it toasted on their panini press but left it for too long before eating it since it was takeout and the bread hardened. If you're going to get it toasted in-store, eat it right away!  We also got two of their arancini - rice balls with ragu and peas. I wish they could put some sort of tomato-based sauce on top of them but they were delicious nonetheless and filling. \n\nService is friendly and quick and the store has a modern take to it.  The cafe's seating area is also a decent size - about 20-30 people could fit. My family and I really like Francesca and I look forward to coming back to try more of their items.
