Absolutely disgusting. And I'm not talking about the food. The owners are foul people with zero sense of customer service. Very rude and aggressive the older guy who owns it I think his name is Sammy was the rudest person I have ever come across. Cursing at customers over the phone and in the restaurant in front of everyone with no shame whatsoever. And I have had better pizzas from papa johns and dominoes. If I could give this place negative stars I would.
