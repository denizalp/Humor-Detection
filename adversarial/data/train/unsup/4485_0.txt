My family and I always have a nice time when we come here! The weather is perfect right now!! Take it while you can, before it gets hot!! I love traveling to this park probably because it reminds me of the good old days when I was young! Its right across the street from my old high school so I know this park well! Haha!\n\nThe park alone is very spacious and always clean! There are a few different fields to play soccer or football, they have huge basketball courts, a few volley ball courts, a few different playgrounds for children, a ton of benches and tables (covered and non covered) a nice little lake and a few trails that travel around the lake. There is so much to do here, spending just an hour isn't enough, walking around the lake on one of the paths could easily take an hour (depending on how fast you walk of course) \n\nWhen I was younger I would come here to jog, the paths are perfect and its nice to \"get away\" a little by running one of the paths that travel behind the lake into the desert area. Now I like to come here because my son and my friend's dog love to run around together. There is a leash policy for pets because this isn't a dog park, but if its not too busy we just let them run around. The great thing about the little lake is it's filled with fish. So if you take all the required measures to fish, you are more than welcome to prop up a little chair under a nice shady tree and cast a line!\n\nGood times!!!
