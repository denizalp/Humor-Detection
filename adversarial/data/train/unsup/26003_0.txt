It may be a good idea for Mr Lemonis to come by to do a quick run through.  why did  the restaurant open 20+ min past its stated opening time?   the restaurant was kind of dirty, empty ketchup container, no napkins at table, no cheese pies, place looked disorganized....the food was good, but i expected a better experience. Also... napkins instead of paper towels in bathroom... and the place was\nsuppose to open at 2 for lunch on 4th of Jul.... Isnt that kind of late???
