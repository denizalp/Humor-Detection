This place is small and the wait time is horrendous \nI am writing this review as we wait for our food\nIt is now 9 53pm\nAfter waiting since 8 30 we still have not gotten one plate of food\n\n1. Ga pow- a good portion of meat and the texture of the pork was tender and not gritty. White rice compliments the dish perfectly, but on it's own can be a little too salty\n2. Pad Kee Mow- very flavorful dish with tender noodles and meat. My only complaint about this dish is that there wasn't enough noodles in proportion to the rest of the dish\n3. Short rib fried rice- so tasty but again a little on the salty side. But if you mix some white rice with it and add some thai chilies the dish is great.\n4. Pad Thai- it was a little too tangy and where were the peanuts? I love the peanuts normally on this dish. I felt a little sad that it wasn't what I expected\n5. Mango Sticky Rice-Delish!! The rice wasn't too sweet or too sticky but where's the mango?! Such a small portion of mango for $6.50....can't you charge $7 and give me more mango???\n\nWaiter Dino was very nice\nWhen he noticed we were waiting for a while he made sure to let us know \nThe girl in the front seemed snooty but after we talked her up a bit she was a tad more friendly...and by tad I mean I wasn't going to pull her hair from behind just to be like, who did that?! \n\nAnyways, this place was good\nCome when u aren't hungry\nBc by the time you get the food you will be starving \nGood tactic Le Thai...
