Located inside the JW Marriott Resort this place is a good place to unwind. It has a great atmosphere. Keep in mind all things in perspective. This is inside a hotel resort so the good rating is not in compared to a good bar or a good restaurant. The bad is the pricing, way over priced drinks and food even for a hotel restaurant. But still good enough to stop by. \n\nGet the fries, they are literally the largest French fries you will have ever had in your life.
