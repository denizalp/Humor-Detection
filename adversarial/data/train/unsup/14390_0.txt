We all pretend we don't like Starbucks, though we do. I love to support local coffee shops whenever possible but still frequent a Starbucks here and there. I have to agree with Bridget F-- the staff here is way more pleasant than many coffee trolls I have encountered in my day. I've also seen them be pretty patient with some pretty difficult people with difficult requests (why does no one just order a coffee anymore?!). The interior is clean, the wi-fi isn't awful, and it's a decent place to take a break and do some work. There are obviously worse places you could be! There's no drive-thru here, so be prepared to grab your coffee inside!
