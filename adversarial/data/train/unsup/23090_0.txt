Very happy to finally make it to Brio!\n\nLocated in the beautiful Tivoli Village an outdoor patio can be found here and especially if you're here in the evening it's magical.  \n\nI love a place that is nice but still allows families to feel at home.  Great kids menu and lovely genuine service! If you're sick of taking the kids to Chili's come here!\n\nIt was the sister's birthday so we came in and since we had been eating all day we settled for an appetizer and some salads.  My son had the salmon off the kids menu and I'm so happy they offered such tasty options and generous portions.  His salmon was grilled to perfection ( I wish I would have ordered it!) it was served with broccoli and mashed potatoes.\n\nThe desserts were to die for!  They served them in shot glasses and were reasonably priced and there was no guilt since they were small portions, but just enough to satisfy the sweet tooth. The creamy concoctions were creme brulee, lemon cheesecake and a chocolate flavor-I think from what I can remember. But they were all fabulous!!! \n\nThe bill for the four of us was only $42!\n\nI can't wait to come back!
