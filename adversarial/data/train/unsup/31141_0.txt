Here's my experience .... Woke up, smelled a burning odor - knew my 23 year old furnace was toast. Called the Co. that serviced it - and they confirmed - and said A\/C was soon to follow. They gave me a quote on both .... But not a lot of more info. \/\/ That's when I dive into Internet and start the research process. \nBottom Line: As long as you get one of the Top Named equipment - you will be A-Ok ... IT IS ALL ABOUT THE INSTALL !!!! So, I call 2 of the Big Names and 2 more local (yet recognizable) companies. I will tell you right here - I like to do business with local \/ independently owned types. Made appointments across one day - Nascair showed up precisely on time with the owner \/ Dave and \"the go to guy\" Mike. They walked me thru how they would implement and recommended 2 different series of equipment. An hour or two later I had a complete quote via email - everything spelled out. \nMet the other 3 Cos. And it was what I had anticipated - they were more concerned about who else was quoting \/ pitch book \/ arm twisting \/ -- one guy cancelled his appt 3 times --- it was painful. \nSo - I jumped in with Nascair - installers Alex & Luis were EXCELLENT !!! Called before they showed up \/ explained their process \/ worked hard all day .... Just really good guys. Proud of their work quality and it shows. \nDave & Mike came buy to check up and took his workers out for lunch - that should tell you about this company right there !!! \nSO - here's my advice : GET 3 QUOTES \/ Obviously one from NASCAIR. \nThen GO WITH YOUR GUT with who you want to give your $ Too.... And who you trust. IN MY OPINION- YOU WONT GO WRONG BY USING NASCAIR !!! \nNote: I learned those \"big guys\" spend approx. $800k annually in advertising (guess who foots a lot of that?) And - They get some of those marketing funds from one of the Mnfg. - which is the system they try to shove down your throat..,\n\nUpdate 6\/11\/17 - I knew I made the right choice !!! My new a\/c wasn't working on Sunday afternoon ...???!!!! Called them - they answered the phone (on Sunday!) . Told me they'd have someone here Monday - Bingo - this big Aussie shows up - super nice guy - goes straight to work with me hovering over him - shows me a damn yellow jacket wedged itself between a required contact (can't make the circuit) - Bingo ! I got A\/c again ......\nThis is the BEST A\/C Furnace company in town !!!!!! Locally owned ---- \nYou are Not just a number here --- you are a valued \"client\"!!!!!!!
