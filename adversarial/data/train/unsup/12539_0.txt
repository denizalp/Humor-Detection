First thoughts on the hotel were bad I was walking into the elevator and the door began to shut on me. I barely got my suitcase in in time. Then when we selected the 3rd floor and it began to go up then an alarm went off and when it got to the 3rd floor the elevator started shaking like it was going to fall and we lucky got out of it. So I ignored it and it was late that night and I didn't want to take the stairs so I tried to get back on and take it down and the doors opened and the second I walked in the elevator started shaking so I jumped back out of it then decided to take the stairs. I'll be taking the stairs from here on out.
