This was hands down my favorite restaurant in Phoenix for years. I LOVED the patio and the building, it was so quaint. Very upscale shabby chic. I was incredibly disappointed to see the new building when I took my grandmother there for her birthday. The atmosphere changed from comfortable, fun and eclectic to overly grandiose in a way that is unflattering. The food was still quite good but half of the experience was the atmosphere. I don't know that I'll be going back anytime soon. :(
