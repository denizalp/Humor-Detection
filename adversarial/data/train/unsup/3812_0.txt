Boo!  Been here twice.  Last week was a bad start to an overall meh experience.  \nWent on a Wednesday night with a large group for a birthday party (not my idea).  The plan was to buy bottle service.  Trying to call in advance to get connected with a host was the worst experience.  Touch-tone phone number and a voice message required to get a table?  I never got called back by anyone.  \n\nAnyways, part of the group is already inside while I and another guy arrive a bit later.  The host at the front podium (Dave) stated even local guys had to pay $20 to get in.   Mind you, I've worked for the nightlife industry for a few years here in Vegas to know that I'm not paying to get into a 'bad' club, off the strip, on a Wednesday.  When I told him we were getting bottle service upstairs, he almost didn't believe me.  He had to call up on his radio to confirm that we were indeed getting a table.   \n\nSo a table is confirmed.  We get in 'free'.   I ask the other guys how much they were charged: $10.   Dave was trying to charge me $20.   Was the staff just trying to make some extra money on the side?  We made sure to get our money back from their 'cover' fee.\n\nAnyways... the view is the only thing they have going for this place and honestly, there are plenty of other clubs and bars\/lounges with way better views ON THE STRIP.  (Foundation Room, Mix Lounge, even the bar at the Stratosphere).  The crowd is just a whole mix of everything but mostly an older, I-don't-know-better-than-to-go-to-Voodoo crowd.  The DJ was super inconsistent.  No real great transitions from one song to the next, a mix of hip-hop, then some rock and roll, classic rock (what?) and maybe some edm type stuff.  \n\nI also asked if there were any local or industry night deals on table service.  Nope. $700 for two bottles of sky vodka on a Wednesday night at an unpopular club. At least I didn't foot the bill.  Definitely would not recommend this place if you're trying to have a real good time in Vegas.
