Used to come here 5 years ago. Went back a few times over the past six months to really give it a chance and have now decided that  this place really jumped the shark. \n\nYou can taste the poorer quality of the food and lament the stingy amounts of basil in dishes based on the ubiquitous herb. The food is now made by cooks, not chefs and the service is impersonal and detached. There used to be a great mix of staff with winning personalities, now it's just blonde girls who visibly hate their jobs and expect tips just because they iron  their hair. \n\nVivoli looks like it's on track to close its doors and it may just be time to pull the plug.
