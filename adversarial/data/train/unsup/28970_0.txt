I've been here twice now and both times had a really good experience. The first time was for a full leg wax and was ALMOST a perfect service (see below for the negative point). I loved the tv's in the treatment rooms, they were great for distracting you from the pain and didn't make you feel awkward if you couldn't keep up a conversation with your waxer for an hour.\n\nThe second time I went was for a mani pedi and I saw Jamie. She was AMAZING. My hands and feet looked absolutely fantastic and I had so much fun talking to her for the almost 2 hours I was there. I am going to start school for esthetics in January and she gave me all kinds of advice and tips for going through the program. I can't wait to go back and see her again.\n\nThe reason I gave them 3 stars was actually because of the wax. I don't remember the name of the girl I saw (and she was great, don't get me wrong) but I've been getting full leg waxes every 1-3months for 5 years at various other places and never once have I had a wax that didn't go all the way up to my hip\/pelvis. The waxer said that they \"usually stop at the shorts line\" and not wanting to be difficult, I didn't argue. But it was really and inconvenience to have the very top 4 inches of my thigh all the way around still hairy. I at first thought maybe this was just a thing that happens in salons that I was unaware of but after asking around through girlfriends, everyone else thought it sounded really strange too. For this reason, I don't think I would ever get a full leg wax there again but I would for sure go back for nail services with Jamie and maybe smaller wax services too.
