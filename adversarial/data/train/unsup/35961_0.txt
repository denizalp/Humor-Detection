Amazing service and facial treatments at this salon. New equipment and top of the line customer care from arrival until you leave. Thank you to Julia and Cathy as they were very helpful in helping me choose the right treatment for my sunburnt vegas face. I chose the high quality two mask treatment \/ hot clay facial that rejuvenated and helped me remove the dead skin and bring life to new skin. Julia was very helpful and teaching me about all the different kinds of treatments. This is my new go to spot for facials \/ mani pedi in Vegas! Until next time.\n\nTwo days after update. My face is now feeling brand new and ready for NYC
