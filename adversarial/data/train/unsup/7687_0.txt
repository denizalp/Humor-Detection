the owner is half a crook.  here is the deal, you need to keep your eye on him at check out EVERY TIme.  its bogus.  we go in there all the time and the staff is the bomb; they are great guysl, they know our name and order.  i hate to cut the place off as it half unfair to them.  Memo is the owners name. yesterday he simply looked us in the face yesterday and stole a dollar fifty two.  i lousy 1.52, came up with a LAME excuse, as to why, but that did it for me, i'm all done.  food is great but andele up the street is just as good and they don't try to skim a buck and half on every ticket.    sum it up  Good tasting food, Great and friendly staff, Crook Owner.  you decide for yourself!
