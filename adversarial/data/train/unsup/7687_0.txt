Small Japanese ramen joint with the best soup and noodles! I've been to several different ramen shops here in Las Vegas and this is my favorite! Not only is it good but it's way cheaper than other places. I ordered the spicy donkatsu ramen and have also tried the regular donkatsu ramen and they always satisfy my cravings. I recommend trying those out because the soup is pork broth based which makes it so much more flavorful. \n\nHeads up: The restaurant is really small so don't be surprised to be put on a waitlist!
