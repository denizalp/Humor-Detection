Oh my goodness. I mean, like damn. Our meal and drinks were so good. I technically could end this right here, but I'll say a little more just for GP (general purpose).  \n\nWe got to Vegas in the early afternoon, but wanted to get checked in at the room and conference before we started to relax.  At the Bellagio, there are so many options, but Spago had just opened and boyfriend said he had a great experience some years ago in Palo Alto. \n\nWe got there at 445, when they were preparing for dinner, but still serve customers with a reduced menu (e.g. bar menu). Even on a reduced menu, they had a selection of seafood: west or east coast oysters, poached prawns, main lobster rolls, as well as bar favs: wings and prime rib burger, and sweet twists on pizza: lamb sausage and brocolini and one with shrimp. We got four different items and it was all da bomb! \n\nI'm not a big drinker. I can literally nurse 1 drink for the night. This night, I had two. I know! A margarita and one called, Out on the Tiles. Now, my margi was good, but that specialty drink was delicious. \n\nWe were sitting across from the bar. So we had a great view, and video, if I might say,  of the fountains. It's going to look spectacular at night. The ambiance is also cool, Nuevo, and. Chic, but welcoming. \n\nI can't end this without talking about the absolute outstanding service we received from Dominique, Our server, and Jenny, who made sure we were never parched. Good food is worth your dollars. Great service is worth your time. I would certainly spend the time, again and again to return to Spago. Thank you for a great experience.
