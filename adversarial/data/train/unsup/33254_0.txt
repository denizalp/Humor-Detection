Ordered the fried chicken, deviled eggs, biscuits and an artichoke pasta dish. The chicken is a large portion, i think we got around two breast pieces, a leg, and a wing. the chicken was extremely moist and crispy, and the hot sauce was good too. deviled eggs had a smoked flavor to them, and were topped with a smoked roe, they were super delicious. biscuits were a little dry, but i really enjoyed the jelly that came with them. \n\noverall, i thought this place was good! i would reccomend to anyone.
