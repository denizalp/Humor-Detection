Great crust, sauce and cheese. Service was good, but it had to be because this place is f'ing tiny so we sat next to the kitchen door and they had to walk by us every 30 seconds.\n\nThe parts I didn't care for.\n\n---No booze, sure you could BYOB, but that's a hassle sometime.\n---This place has maybe 6 tables, 2 parking spaces, and located next to an oh so romantic Circle K.\n---We were brought the wrong pizza, (which I started to eat before I noticed) it had sausage and broccoli.  Flavor was good but there was water, NOT OIL, in the center of the pizza.  Obviously the center crust sucked but the rest was very good.\n---Had some chicken special thingy, good but not 5 star Yelp good.\n---The Cappricosa (sp?) pizza we ordered arrived it had canned black olives on it, out of the jar artichokes, and basic cubed ham on it. Oh yes, there was water in the center of it too. WTF?\n\nWe were given a piece of tarimusu because of the mix up, which was great. Thank you.\n\nSome of the items I saw come from the kitchen looked really good so I'd go back and maybe get take out or stop in for lunch.\n\nSo better than average food, but not the best ever.   \n\nThe location sucks, there is no ambiance at all, and no booze.\n\nThree stars from me.   I guess I'm a Cibo kind of guy.
