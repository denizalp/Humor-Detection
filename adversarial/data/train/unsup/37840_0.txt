Came here to bowl my sweepers today. I bowled the 9 am squad. The lanes had plenty of oil on them. The oil started breaking down in the beginning of the second game. I still bowled good. \nThis is a nice bowling center to bowl at. I suggest calling in advance to find out when open lanes are available. Weekends are usually filled with league and out of town sweeper bowlers. They have graveyard special bowling rates after midnight.\nThis is one if my favorite bowling centers in vegas.
