Been going here since 2007. \n\nI have never had a problem with them, EVER. Even when I was going to get my dog neutered they reassured me what I thought was best for my dog was what the right thing to do. I was brought into a room and everything was explained to me on what there procedure was. (I have never had a dog or cat before so this was all new to me on what they do, and what to expect)\n\nAnyway when I got my dog back and they explained on what to do and how to care for him after. Explained that if I bought the cone at an expensive place just return it and they would sel me one cheaper, because my dog will remove it by bitting it. after returning my $25 cone at the pet store and purchasing one from them i did save $8 my dog DID bite through it. I found a video on youtube on how to save biten up dog cones as my dog had to wear his for at least a month because his a small guy and can get to his stiches. \n\nAlso after the operation I noticed that my dog's nails were cut, I have never been able to do it myself, and im scared to bring to him to a professional because he might bite someone but when he came back all his little paws were cut just right...I was not charged extra for that. \n\nI also received a few calls asking how my dog was doing.\n\nSparky goes every year for a check up and for all his shots required in renewing his licence. \n\nThe staff is friendly, easy to approach, and understanding.\nParking is plenty but if you go during really busy time be prepared there is a Tim Horton's(has their own parking) but its next to each other and there is also a pub.\n\nI dont get why they keep getting such low reviews \nREMEMBER you get what you pay for\nthis clinic in my opinion is the cheapest, most affordable in Toronto and they DONT rip you off!\n\nIF I ever move ill still be coming back to this clinic!
