This place is incredible with the amount of dedication put forth in maintaining all of those pinball machines. On the website they have listed about 150 pinball machines plus other arcade games are also available for play as well. The location is well hidden and took me a second glance to finally realize where it was.\n\nAnyway since I live here for the summer I love to nerd it up here playing all of these pinball games from the past. I actually own the P: HoF Williams Collection on the Wii so it was great to see half of those tables here available for play. Those tables would include Black Knight, Fire Power, Funhouse, Pinbot, and Space Shuttle.\n\nP: HoF is truly a hidden gem here in Las Vegas.
