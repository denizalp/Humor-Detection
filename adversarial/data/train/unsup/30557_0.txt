This used to be one of the very best run McDonald's hands down. Week after week I came in for fresh food n perfect parfaits...every week until this week that is. The store manager was rude, my parfaits were expired, my husband's muffins were harder thn an ex con! Oh I could go on n on about the short comings that have befallen this once glorious restaurant. When I pointed out my expired parfaits n rock hard muffins I was told the was nothing they could do about it but refund my money. Thanks for leaving me hungry McDonald's...And hopefully there's no fire or emergency here as all the kids will be trapped inside the playland from the garbage cans blocking the only exit from the kids dining area during regular business hours...
