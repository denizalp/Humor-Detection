I love this park. It's huge! It's so wide open and it all centers around a man made lake. You can easily get two miles in at this park going around the lake. In a future tip I will measure the distance but I ran and fiddled around and easily got in two miles. They also hide rocks in this park so that is fun :) there are a lot of duck and geese at this park. A great place to walk your leashed dog. They also have sand volleyball courts (but there is no nets, bring your own?) they have a lit basketball court and bathrooms as well. Great place to eat lunch under the covered picnic tables and\/or along the path somewhere ;)
