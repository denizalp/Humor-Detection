Average at best. I'm a pretty normal size guy why could I not reach the back row of the salad bar at all. I dropped most of the topping on the table before I could make them to my plate. I got the chicken Alfredo from the pasta bar it was okay the chicken had a weird taste though. Will probably not go back would rather just go to firehouse next door.
