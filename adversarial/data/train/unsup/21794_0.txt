Hands down best sushi in LV. I've been around the city trying other sushi restaurants to see if they up to par- and they aren't.\nHere's a list of why.\n1. The fish is fresh.\n2. The staff is amazing!\n3. The menu is very well thought out.\n4. There is a great view of Las Vegas\n5. I have NEVER had anything from Naked Fish I did not like.\n\nI am a very picky eater. Like I said in my quick tip- I don't live on this side of town, but will make the drive. It's worth it.
