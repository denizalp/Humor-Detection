Average at best... After a solid 10 min, our server finally came over. We ordered the sampler to start, to which he responded \"I don't think we will be able to do that since we're busy\" ummm... So you stop cooking once you get busy? P.s. they were not busy. The food was fine. Nothing to write home about, but not bad.
