Girlfriend picked this place out of desperation as it was the closest thing we could find. I was not impressed with the decor of the restaurant front. It looked a tad ran down for my taste. After looking at the interior, I was still unimpressed with the consistent ran down look. We were told there was a wait, but we would be immediately seated on first table. After running around for half an hour and leaving a few other brunch places, I decided I needed to eat and just wait. \n\nThis is where my day seemed to have taken a pleasant turn. Was seated quickly as the next booth opened up. Very cozy booth, I'd say good up to a group of 4. Food arrived in a good time. We started with the buttermilk pancakes and those were definitely good. It had nice crispy bottom, but with a nice fluffy body. A little too much syrup (prefer to have it on the side). \n\nFried chicken and grits were also delicious. Fried chicken was crispy and had a unique batter. Grits were rich and hearty. The side of Brussels sprouts are a must have! It was sweet with a mild kick. Brisket and the cornbread was also amazing. Most of the brunch places I've been to usually has everything tasting the same at the end but each dish I ordered here had it's own distinct taste. Prices I thought were fair but they definitely could have charged more if the interior looked a bit more fixed up. \nDefinitely will be coming back in the future if I happen to be in this neighbourhood. The place didn't really speak out to me, but the food and service definitely spoke to my soul.
