ah yes another review. Went to Cibo with a large group of 14 current and past co-workers to hear our co-worker and friend play guitar there. Everything was great at first. Nice  service, nice atmosphere, as allways, good food. There was another large party on the patio with us and it was still quiet and relaxing. My co-worker brought his dog and it was cool that they allow that. Then I looked down and realized it was 7:30, and I needed to go. Some people were going to stay and drink more, but I had to go. So I asked the server if she could put $20 of our bill on my card. Um, I guess not. Get this- they DONT SPLIT CHECKS, and only take 4 debit\/credit cards per bill. So not only could I not leave until everyone paid, but we were going to have a hard time paying the bill +20% added gratuity b\/c most of us ( being 40 and under) only carry credit\/debit cards. The. best part was when I asked her to put $20 on my card she looked at me and said \"What do you want me to do with the card?\" hmm, I want to pay for my food lady. GEEZ sorry. ALL of this on a Monday night. Apparently we were $2 short ( go figure with 10 different people) and she actually brought out a calculator and tossed it at us... treated us like we were bums.The servers attitude alone was rude and ruined for us.I will go back (if I'm allowed) as the food is good and the service, usually, is good too.( At another point she said she couldn't go inside and check on something b\/c \"its too busy in there\". Hm sorry your place of work is busy on a Monday night during a recession. Don't worry, I doubt it will last for long.)
