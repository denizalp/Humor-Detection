My daughter is growing so fast! Today was her first drum lesson! This place seems really busy kids pouring in and out. A very nice space the staff was very helpful. They have a really nice selection of instruments including mini Fender's that were so cute. They have amps, string's,  books, and pretty much anything else you'd need. They have a lot of teacher's here they teach it all 7 days a week. \n\nI may just sign up for those vocal lessons I've been wanting to do. Too bad I'm way passed the age cut off for American Idol. \n\nOh and for dad's they had the depressing Cardinal's game on over the radio. It was painful to listen to I'm glad that I couldn't watch it!
