This is my go-to Korean BBQ place in Las Vegas. Everything about this place is on-point! The location is also very convenient because it is located right outside the Galleria mall. One of the best things about Gen is how they run their wait list system. You first give your name and phone number to the hostess and when your table is ready, Gen will text you. I really enjoy this system because you don't have to stay in the restaurant the whole time. You can go into the mall and go shopping!!!\n\nThe Staff: 5\/5\nI've never experienced any issues with their staff! They're very quick putting orders in on the I-pads they carry around, speedy at delivering orders and re-filling drinks, and excellent at replacing the grills. All of the staff I have come across have been very friendly and helpful.\n\nFood: 5\/5\nCompared to many other KBBQ places, Gen has so many more options! Some of my favorite meats include the Red Wine Pork Belly, Gen Beef Bulgolgi, and the Premium Beef Short Ribs. My favorite side dish is their Kimchi!\n\nThe Prices: 5\/5\nThe price is amazing! I think it's one of the cheapest and best KBBQ places in Las Vegas. If you live far away, the drive is worth it, believe me! For AYCE lunch it is $15.99 and for AYCE dinner the price is $20.99.
