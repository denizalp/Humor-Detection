Pretty good dim sum considering the price range. It can be really busy at noon in the weekends. The place is crammed with tables and chairs, making it very crowded and noisy. The salty pork bone congee is very hearty with deep fried dough. The best is the salty egg yolk sesame ball with a crispy outside shell and a runny but flavorful inside fillings.
