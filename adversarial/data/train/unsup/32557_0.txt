The last time I went to Uzu was when they first opened and I had mentioned in my previous review that I didn't really enjoy the soft serve as it wasn't creamy enough and had too much of a slush-like consistency. I went back the other day with some girlfriends because they had never been, and I'm happy to say that it has improved! I tried their black sesame this time and it was yummy. At $6 a cup it seems to border on the pricier side, but they've changed it so you actually get 3 free toppings on it + unlimited sprinkles and condensed milk drizzle. What really impresses me about this place is the staff! Such friendly people. I'm a fan and would visit again if I was in the area!
