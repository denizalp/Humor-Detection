I've been to Vegas a bunch of times and staying at the Venetian was my favorite! We actually ended up in the Palazzo towers, and our suites were beautiful. They were large and spacious with a great bedroom area, and a sunken living room. The bathroom was amazing with a great jacuzzi tub and separate shower, and of course a TV (3 TV's total per suite!). I just love that the Venetian has so many great shops, restaurants, and of course that great Italian charm!
