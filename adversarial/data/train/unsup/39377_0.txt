I don't even know where to start.. If I were able to give more than 5 stars I would. Shaina is AMAZING! I have received many Brazilians in the past, and I was never fully satisfied with the outcome.. The hair would grow back as if I shaved, spots would be missed or it was extremely painful. I decided to jump on yelp in hopes of finding someone who I was happy with and could continue to see. I read shainas reviews and decided to give it a try.. I was BLOWN AWAY by my experience. She made me feel so comfortable without and forced conversation, the wax was perfect temperature and her technique was FLAWLESS.. I kept waiting for the pain on the super sensitive areas, but they never came!!! Not only was my experience in the shop phenomenal, but I was shocked at the lack of hair growth when it grew back! When it was time to go back for my next appointment the hair was so sporadic I could've easily stretched it out longer. My second appointment only took like 10-15 mins top and I was out of there w a smile again. I've already passed her info along to my gfs at work n I hope this convinces someone to try her out cuz she's that dang good!!!
