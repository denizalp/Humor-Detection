I've been a member at this gym for ~2 years. My credit card expired on 04\/16, which prompted the owner, Jackie, to call me. At that time Jackie asked me to place a new card on file and said otherwise my gym access would be suspended. I came down with bronchitis shortly after, and never placed a new card on file.\n\nFast forward to 09\/16 and I see that I've been billed, $34.95, every month, since my card expired, including a $20.00 decline fee on 05\/16. I call the gym, to which the employees have to wait for Jackie to call me back. Fine. Jackie calls me back the next day, says she can't find my file, and she'd have to call me back from home. Fine. Jackie calls me back the next day from home and says my file is at the gym. Um, what? She proceeds to tell me she researched my question and emphatically states that I had, in fact, come in and put a new card on file in 05\/16. No I did not. I had bronchitis. She swears I did, and asks me to meet her at the gym the following day so she may show me my file and the document I signed on 05\/16 authorizing the new card. Fine. I meet her at the gym the following day-shockingly-she says she doesn't have the record of the authorization for the new card. She then protests that I wasn't in fact billed for the months past 04\/16, to which I produce my statement to completely refute her new claim. Then she says she can't tell which credit card that statement is attached to, so I produce the expired card from 04\/16 that I still had in my wallet for I don't know why sans nostalgia.\n\nShe finally relents and agrees to refund 05\/16, 06\/16, and 07\/16 plus the $20.00 decline fee. I say OK. Then she asks for a new card to place on file; when I inform her that I'd like to cancel, she becomes unglued. She asks why I would like to cancel, I respond by evidencing the way I've been treated, directly, by her. I remind her that she, without saying the words, called me a liar. She quipped that she was \"not making stuff up\". I calmly remind her that in fact, she was \"making stuff up\" when she said that I had placed a new card on file 05\/16. Her reply? She didn't \"make stuff up\" she \"made a mistake\" and then tried to turn it around on me asking if I had ever made a mistake? (For the record I'm sure that I have, in fact, errored, but in this instance I also didn't try to claim the contrary for purposes of argument.)\n\nShe said she wasn't going to \"help me out\" if I was just going to cancel. I said it's not about helping me out, it's about not defrauding your members.\n\nHad Jackie simply treated me with respect, instead of acting like I was trying to get something for nothing, I would have just placed a new card on file. I actually had the new card sitting physically on the table between us. Her own moral turpitude was her undoing. How can she morally ratify \n\n1) Informing me my access to the gym would be revoked hereafter from an inability to charge my expired credit card\n\n2) Continuing to charge my expired credit card, presumably through some agreement between herself, Beezlebub, and Visa.\n\n3) Knowing I did not use the gym due to #1 then refuse to refund the payments for the gym I didn't use\n\nAs per the actual gym, it does get busy between 5-7pm. Overcrowding was a huge issue when the price was $19.95\/month. Less so now that EOS opened down the street and Jackie raised the price at Snap to $34.95\/month. Only one of most machines, including a squat rack, which I have had to wait up to 45 minutes to use, however this was only on one occasion. Missy is exceptionally welcoming, knowledgeable, and friendly. Jeff rarely speaks to anyone, but he at least always parks in the same spot, so if nothing else he's consistent. Outside of this ~$125 billing issue and subsequent treatment by the owner I never had any issues and would previously have recommended the gym if it's the geographically most convenient option for you, as it was me. But now, I hope the San Andrea fault runs precisely down the center of the gym and splits the place in two. \n\nSnap Fitness corporate doesn't appear to have a working number, so I'll have to avail myself to the Yelp gods to recover my $125.\n\nLegal Disclaimer - All statements hitherto are solely my own opinion, and in no way may be construed as fact.
