We could tell right away when we walked in this place was a bit challenged.   We stood waiting for about 15 minutes while employees walked past and no one seemed to give a damn.  When they finally did come over, they had to go see what was available... (Note:  Ray Charles could have seen what was available.... almost everything was available :) .   They asked us to sit down and we waited some more.   \n\nWe finally got seated to a dirty table and after the drinks took too long we gave up and went somewhere else.    Ill pay extra for decent food, but not when the staff seems to be mailing it in.   \n\nFor the same price, try whiskey Roses across the way.   \n\nmeh.
