My friends and I paid $30 for the buffet with unlimited champagne. It was delicious! My friends drank so much champagne, they were buzzed all night long. We also stayed there and ate\/chatted for 3.5 hours. The drink service was great. The food was also delicious. I literally liked everything I put on my plate. The diversity of food here made me ecstatic and it's all good quality. I wish I could go back asap!
