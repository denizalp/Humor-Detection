Just moved to Cleveland in the last week.  After checking out Zagara's, Heinen's and Target, I would easily say this is my favorite grocery of the three.\n\nHeinen's had great selection and variety, but the customers were extremely rude and the staff for the most part unfriendly.  When I had read the reviews previously about the rude customers and unfriendly service I thought it'd be fine, but it really made the experience far too unpleasant.\n\nTarget had good prices, but less variety and the product wasn't quite up to quality, but the cashiers and employees were quite nice.\n\nZagara's was the best between price and quality and as an added bonus the staff has always been friendly (I've gone in about 4-5 times by now).\n\nI think overall, Zagara's is the best choice for grocery around this area of Cleveland Heights as far as I can tell.  I will say it is definitely not Wegmans, but it's a nice family owned grocery store and I'm quite fond of it already.
