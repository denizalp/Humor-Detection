Yippee for Magnolia Ice Cream arriving in Sin City, something that I've grown up with, as have countless other Filipinos.  \n\nFlavors on the board the last visit:  avocado, buko pandan, cashew langka, green tea, guava, halo-halo, haupia, kona coffee, lychee, macapuno, macapuno ube, mais queso (corn and cheese, mango, Thai tea, and the uber-popular UBE.  I enjoyed the double scoop of Thai Tea and Ube on a cone very much and plan to return to try all of the flavors eventually.\n\nLocated inside the bustling Seafood City, Magnolia Ice Cream also serves up halo-halo.  Unfortunately, I have to say the one I had there is not the best I've ever had.  There was way too much ice and not enough evaporated milk, so much so that I could barely mix-mix the ingredients.  This can easily be fixed, though, so hopefully it will be better the next time around; I'll be sure to request less ice if I try it again.  \nWelcome to town, Magnolia-your ice cream is masarap!
