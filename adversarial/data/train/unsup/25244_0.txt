Went here expected my hair to be perfect even showed them a picture of the hair color I wanted they said they'd make it for me But IT WAS HORRIBLE! I wanted a full highlight and they told me I couldn't because there was no time for it and I would have to reschedule again. I had to come back because me and my sister couldn't get done together because she brought her kid. I told them if i could get a balayage instead but, they turned my hair dark! instead of blonde. So if you end up here Make sure they do your hair right or it would be a waste of your time. Also ask them How many bowls they'll use on you because they will keep using until you'll end up spending alot.
