Stopped by this spot to grab a quick brunch on Sunday. There was no wait time around 11am and we were seated right away. I had the chicken sausage sandwiches which was delicious! The fried potatoes is also a must get as they were toasted to perfection. The service was quick as well. I will definitely be back again for brunch!
