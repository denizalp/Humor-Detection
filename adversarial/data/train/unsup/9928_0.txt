Pieology is better than most of the current crop of \"Chipotle-style\" build your own pizza chains, though not quite the best I've had. The ingredients are fresh and varied. Crust is credible, but not awesome (I had the wheat crust). All their crusts are thin, and there is a gluten-free option. The wood fired oven yields a better taste than at places like Pie Five, which use a conveyor that moves the pizzas through a gas oven. Overall, it was very tasty and fast. Staff was courteous and service was excellent. If you're craving a quick pizza (or salad) for lunch or dinner, this is a pretty good place for it.
