disappointed. i went here based on yelps raving reviews and i fully regret it. not only did the shellac manicure only last a week (i might as well have gotten a regular many at half the price) i also got a wart on one of my fingers! totally disgusting. this place is not sanitary at all. i would never go back - not even if someone paid me.
