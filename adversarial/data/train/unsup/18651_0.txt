I came here for my birthday dinner with my parents and sister; they have been coming for years and were so exciting for my sister and me to try it. The staff is great, we were welcomed and attended to very quickly. However, the experience here wasn't all the great. I ordered the California Cut and includes the prime rib, mashed potatoes, yorkshire pudding, and salad. The salad was ok. I didn't really like the dressing and there was more beets than there was lettuce. The worse part, however, was the prime rib. I've had way better prime rib at a way lower price point. The meat was cold, fatty, and lacked flavor. The mashed potatoes just tasted like unsalted butter, with a not too flavorful gravy. The yorkshire pudding wasn't too bad. I did order a side of the buttered peas to go along with my plate and they were great (but you can't really go wrong with making peas). They did bring out a free dessert for my birthday. It was a coconut cake with ice cream, but they poured canned pineapples all over the cake so I was unable to try it because I'm allergic. I expected so much more from Lawry's, but all I got was overpriced bland food. I will not be returning that's for sure!
