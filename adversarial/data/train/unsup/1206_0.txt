How I didn't know this spot existed is beyond me! Although I must say I was slightly disappointed. I went with the carrot cake, as it was one of my fave cakes when I was able to eat cake, and I have to say, it didn't measure up to what I remember. The cake was a little dry, super crumbly and didn't have the spice kick you find in carrot cake. \n\nThe mini coffee was pretty tasty, I'm just not into these type of baked goods anymore, as it's been years since I've ate them. \n\nThere is still other goodies I would try.
