Not happy with my hair at all and treated awful!!  Salon is overpriced and hair cut and color was not right.  After complaining and at the salon for over 5 hours the manager\/owner threatened to call police on me since I told her my hair was not right and did not like it at all.  This situation was mishandled unprofessional and uncalled for in a service industry  providing hair services.   Customers satisfaction and request do matter!!!  I will not be back and do not recommend this salon to any one.
