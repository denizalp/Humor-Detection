I've been to this Morton's twice so I'm comfortable in providing my thoughts. Please note that on both of my visits I ate at the bar so my comments below reflect my experience. \n\nFrom a food quality and atmosphere perspective I would give them a solid 4. Candidly, I don't see much difference between Morton's and any of the other high end chain steak houses, ie., Ruth Chris, Prime, etc. There is only so much you can do with a steak. \n\nThe side items are all al la carte and pricy, however the portion sizes are reflective of the price. As would be expected there is an extensive wine list and it also reflects typical restaurant mark-ups.\n\nWhat I was not overwhelmed with was the staff. Don't get me wrong, they were efficient and did their jobs, however on both of my visits there was an air of arrogance from the bar staff. Absent was any kind of sincere smile or \"welcome, great that you've selected us for dinner\", or \"can I suggest a nice desert tonight\", etc. I think this is where the independent steak houses excel; they really make you feel welcome, especially when sitting at the bar. \n\nThe net\/net, this Morton's is a very good place for a steak, but it lacks the total package from a service perspective that I would expect when paying the prices they charge.
