I'm a Mexican food junkie. Nothing beats a good Carne Asada Burrito or a Bacon, Eggs, n' Cheese Burrito when you got a case of the hangovers. Los Betos is average in satisfying your Mexican food fix.\n\nIf you're drunk, stop on by and get your favorite post-drinking Mexican dishes. They have what everyone else has. They won't disappoint. \n\nWhen sober, however, you'll notice the inconsistency. The tortillas are sometimes hard and taste days old, the guac is nasty on occasion, the Carne Asada frequently is dry and rough. \n\nIt's okay Mexican food...unless you're schmammered. Then it's the shiz!
