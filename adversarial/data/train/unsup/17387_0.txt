aaaahhhh the Aveda School! What a little hidden treasure this place is. Had I written this review three years ago (that's when I had my first Aveda School experience) I would have said it was a great salon with even better prices for their services. Now in 2012, I can still say it's a great place but the prices for the services have certainly spiked. The Aveda School is definitely for those of us who don't have the energy or the funds to salon hop looking for the perfect stylist\/colorist (yes I color my hair and I am not ashamed to admit it). I mean where can you go in CLT and have 2,3 sometimes 4 people working on your hair at one time? Just remember this, the person actually providing the service is a STUDENT and student=SLOW. If you are there for a cut and color be prepared to be there for a minimum of 2 hours. But also know you will leave there looking pretty fabulous. \n\nThe only other service I have had at Aveda is the brow wax which was good as well. I will say the Estehticians are usually afraid for hurting me. I try to assure them that I am already voluntarily agreeing to have hot wax applied to my face and then have it ripped off with a tiny piece of cloth. I know what I am getting into and you won't hurt me. For those who are still not convinced, I reassure them by saying I have passed Kidney Stones and I have given birth. I think I can handle a little hot wax. The Kidney Stone story usually does the trick.\n\nWith all that being said, the Aveda School is well worth the experience
