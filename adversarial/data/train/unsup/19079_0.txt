Had a chip in my windshield for a week and ended up cracking from end to end. The same week I received a flyer in the mail for $100 check for a glass replacement. I called and spoke with Gibson and made the experience very pleasant. They where out at my job the next day replacing my windshield and I received my $100 check just like they said! Awesome job, I'd refer anyone to them!
