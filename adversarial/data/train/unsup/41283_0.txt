From the moment you walk in the door, the service, the food and the atmosphere is amazing. The waitstaff was super friendly and attentive. I went with a group of 6 girls and had the sampling menu which was absolutely delicious. They bought over all the favorites and they quickly became my favorites as well. We tried the crispy Taquitos which were out of control (I probably could have eaten 10 more) the filet minion was up to par as well, it melted in my mouth. And desert ... Oh my god, you HAVE. To try the bananas foster and the banana chocolate cake!! the Everything was just simply amazing. At the end of the night the manager, Rahna came to say hello and to check that our experience was what we expected, she was super sweet and made our last moments there even better! This place is great!
