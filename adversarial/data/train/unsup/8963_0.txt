I went to this place cus we where new to the west side and liked to do karaoke and this bar was close by. 1.) The bartender was sick with the flu and still working?? 2.) this combo bar thing is weird and attracts different style crowds that don't necessarily mix 3.) the way you request a song was different and confusing and the host didn't follow the list anyway. In my book that's 3 strikes your out!! and the search goes on for a good karaoke bar.:(
