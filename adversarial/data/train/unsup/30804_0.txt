My first meal in Montr√©al. This is just amazing. Live music, beautiful outdoor seating design, the service  is friendly and quick, and the food is just so delicious. The best of all is the price is very decent. \nI walked in expecting to pay \"super fancy restaurant\" price for this incredible experience. It ends up $100plus tip Canada dollar for 4 people.
