If you are staying around the Toronto area and are in need of some authentic Asian cuisine this is a must try. The sushi tastes like it was straight out of the ocean and the chefs know how to give a presentation. The main course started with a miso soup and I know that most miso soups taste similar but this one will stick with you for the rest of your trip. Everyone was delighted with the service and food and we will be coming back when in the area.
