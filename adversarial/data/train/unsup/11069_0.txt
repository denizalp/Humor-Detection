Probably my favorite record store in all the valley. I have no idea why I have yet to write a review for this place. Stinkweeds is the creme de la creme of record stores in my honest opinion. They have a great selection of used albums. Both CD and vinyl selections. \n\nNow, I know some of you kids reading are going to have no idea what either of those things are. You have probably never heard of a cassette tape or VHS either. All of your baby photos were probably taken on a cell phone. You have probably never had film developed either. So strange to me. This store holds a little piece of nostalgia that is near and dear to my heart. I am one of those people who can pin point exactly what I was doing the first time I heard a song. I associate most of my memories with music. It's just one of those things that will take me back to elementary school, summer camp, Jr. high, high school, pool parties, my first car, road trips, first kiss ,moving, living in Japan, moving again, being pregnant, more road trips, living in Cali, the beach, falling in love, the birth of my son, bar fights, heartbreak, depression, recovery, moving again, more road trips, more parties, and more life. Stinkweeds is a treasure chest of memories. I can't walk in here and leave with nothing.  \n\nAlso if you frequent shows at Crescent Ballroom you can pick up your show tickets here. I was buying tickets from Stinkweeds at least twice a month for a while there. \n\nMusic is therapy. Get yours here.
