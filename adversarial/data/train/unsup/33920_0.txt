Enjoyed a quick stop here with girlfriends on a Friday night. Parking was easy and free in their lot and without reservations, we were seated immediately. \n\nWe were also helped immediately by our waiter, also - a pretty bar girl taking alcoholic requests and got approached by the Staff photographer who insisted the photo is free. This was the hugest problem we had with Peppermill since she INSISTED the photo is free - to take! To have is $20 for one copy, $25 for a second. Um, sorry, that's not a deal when the first is overpriced at $20! \n\nWe wanted some light bites and got the appetizer platter (substituted the Shrimp for more cheese sticks), and got the Fruit Boat for $18.99 with a side of cottage cheese. It was all fine with a cool presentation with a great waiter. \n\nOn a side note, the bathrooms are very clean which is appreciated considering it was a Friday of a holiday weekend with lots of tourists! And a wedding party to boot!
