The bar is good the Express Pizza place, nothing express about it and the food is just ok.  I guess if you are sitting at the bar drinking and you get the munchies it works but just to come eat, I would not recommend it.  There are places that have way better pizza and wings however, the BAR, is worth every second of your time. \n\nThis is a great neighborhood location with a friendly bar staff.  What separates this place from other neighborhood bars, if you are a first timer coming here, the regulars are warm and friendly.  You don't always find this in a bar.  \n\nAnthony the bartender commands the bar and does a great job at making sure everyone has what they need when they need it.  \n\nIf you are in the area and looking for a place to watch some sports, just relax and have a drink or drop a few dollars in a machine, this place is a nice place to hang and do any or all of that.
