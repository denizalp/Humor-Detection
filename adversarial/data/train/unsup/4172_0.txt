Icy juicy is in the same plaza as the restaurant District One and the place you can play pool called Cue D's. \nHonestly, I only go to Icy Juicy whenever all my favorite boba shops close because the drinks here are pretty okay. But when I do come, it is always so busy and there is that certain group outside smoking. My problem is that when I am inside waiting for my order, I hate that cigarette smell that envelops every other scent. All I smell are cigarettes. \nThe menu is quite extensive, and there are a plethora of drinks which can be a bit overwhelming. I order the Thai tea and sometimes I order the Hokaido. I just recently tried the green tea latte and that does have sea salt cream on top. They do also have appetizers (shrimp balls) and huge desserts such as honey toast and shaved ice but I have not tried those. \nThe boba itself is just okay, seems like they either overcook it or they just like the overlooked texture. \nThe service is pretty okay but only if you are ordering to go.
