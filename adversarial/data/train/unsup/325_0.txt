So in the spirit of burger week in Toronto, I decided to visit a brand spankin' new burger bar in the hood that's NOT offering the $5 burger specials.  It was storming all day and I was too lazy to hit the gym.  That's when I decared I was going to go all out and call it a \"fat day\"... and a fat day it was!\n\nArrived at 8:30pm, this corner block restaurant is a lot bigger than what it seems from the outside.  The two of us were greeted and sat by the host.  Right away, I concluded that it had a good vibe with some background music and friendly staff.  But wait, something was missing.  Why do they NOT have TVs?? I was really hoping to catch the NBA playoffs!\n\nIf you have read my reviews before, you probably have noticed how difficult menu-ordering is for such an indecisive food-lover like myself.  The Works decided to make it even harder by having a million choices on the menu!  I hate it... I love it!  \n\nButterscotch Chocolate Milkshake: $3.97 Kid size (4.5\/5 stars)\nIn addition to a beer, I've really been a sucker for milkshakes lately, and since it was a \"fat day\", I went for it.  SO MANY to choose from, but this one hit the spot!  Oh, and all drinks are served in a measuring cups! TOO CUTE!\n\nTower O Rings: $9.69 (3.5\/5)\nA little pricey, but the portion is fit for 3-4 people for appetizer!  Huge onion rings stacked on top of another!  You get 2 choices of dipping sauce and we got the chipotle mayo (ALWAYS get chipotle!), and the curry mayo (ACTUAL curry flavour!!).\n\nSk8r Boy burger +banana: $12.78 (4\/5 stars)\nI really wanted to get the Hunka Hunka Burnin' Love, which is peanut butter with bacon and banana on your choice of patty.  Can you spot what is missing on this? CHEESE!! How can you have a burger without cheese?!!? Then I saw the Sk8r Boy, which is the same thing but with jack cheese instead of banana.  I did what Superwoman would do: get the Sk8r Boy, and ADD BANANAS!! Oh I am a genius!  Only criticism is the thick beef patty was done med-well to well, so a bit dry for me. \n\nDead Ringer burger: $12.89 (4\/5 stars)\nBBQ smoked brisket, bbq sauce, jack cheese, and a onion ring.  I was a little hesitant with this one at first 'cause I don't like the sweetness of bbq sauce.  But then, who doesn't like meat on meat?! It actually wasn't that sweet at all, but again, a bit over done for me.  Definitely asking for a medium patty next time.\n\nService: (5\/5 stars)\nShe's awesome! Patient, friendly, and attentive.  Extra star for sharing the same great pb and banana burger taste as me!\n\nI love the menu, although a little overwhelming.  With all the choices, it brings out the worst in me.  But it is so descriptive and funny to read!  Salt and pepper shakers are in light bulbs, the decor is all construction-themed.  I also noticed the front wall is a garage-style door that opens up during sunny days.  They definitely need TVs, but either way, I am coming back as many times as it takes me to go through the entire menu!!! Sponsors? (If serious, send me a msg! haha)
