In the southern end of MGM Grand Las Vegas ( near the grand pool complex ) lies this ultra chic and stylish Japanese dining establishment. Came here with a buddy of mine after we spent the day testing our luck at the casino. Getting reservation for this place was a cakewalk considering that this time was their off-peak season. We practically had the place to ourselves but don't let the emptiness fool you. Shibuya delivers. PERIOD. \n\nOur choice of seating was at the bar in which case we all know, that's where the magic happens. Our waiter\/sake sommelier was absolutely wonderful and helpful. He helped us choose a sake within the price range i suggested. I don't exactly remember the name but i do remember the lightly sweet taste and the clean finish of it (Junmai type).   \n\nI suggested to my buddy that we go for the Omakase which is a tasting course con prized of 7 dishes so we can get a taste of what they have to offer. He's down. All 7 dishes were of high quality but two really stood out. \n\nA) Sashimi Duo - Chu Toro, Ginger Soy Sauce and Spiced Crunchy Garlic Kanpachi, Yuzu Juice and Black Truffle Oil \n\nSeriously, what the eff??? Fatty tuna should be renamed fan-effin-tastic. I've never tasted such quality of Toro and Kanpachi. Freaking orgasmic!\n\nB) EZI EBI  - Australian Lobster Tail and Diver Scallops in Uni Sake Butter Sauce\n\nWow, just wow. I can't even describe what goes on here. That Uni sauce is ridiculous. If they put that *hit in a can and the end of the world was coming, you dam better believe there'd be riots at the supermarket.\n\n\nStaff was very friendly. I recommend this place if you got the bankroll or you want to take your lady friend out for a special dinner. Ask the waiter with the ponytail for recommendations. He won't steer you wrong!
