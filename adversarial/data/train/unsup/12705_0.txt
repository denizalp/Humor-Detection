Extremely unhappy just took my daughter in here the waitress was rude, and I ordered a hot cocoa for my daughter and it was so hot I burned the top of my mouth I tried to tell the waitress 3 times and she completely ignored me . I work at a restaurant myself I have never seen such horrible service. I have been wanting to try this place for awhile but never again I'm glad I tried the hot cocoa instead of my 2 year old daughter. Horrible place
