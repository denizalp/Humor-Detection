I was moving out of a rental property and needed to have the rainforest that had grown in the backyard cleared out.  I worked with Natalie who was WONDERFUL and very communicative throughout the process.  She made sure that I had all of the answers to my questions and helped me get the date best for me and their crew scheduled.  The guys came on the day and time promised and did a good job.  Not much on the expectation scale to be honest; just wanted everything cleared out so I could get my deposit back.  They went above and beyond and also pruned the tree and shrubs which I hadn't asked them to do.  Given all of the other local companies I reached out to who either didn't bother to even answer me or gave me some totally outrageous quote given what I needed done, Green ServPro was a welcome change.
