***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 1\/100***\n\nFinally it's open after weeks of seeing and passing the sign almost everyday. Let me tell you it's worth the wait. Located in a strip mall around the corner of Tropicana and Fort Apache sits this little gem. It's a quaint mom and pop donut shop with minimal d√©cor but their products and friendly service are what makes them shine. They offer a variety of donuts from your good ol glazed to the often sought after cronut and all the yummy goodness in between. Prices are comparable to the more known Dunkin donuts but Ace's quality surely surpasses. They open at 5 am which is super convenient to stop by and grab treats to surprise the coworkers with.\n\n****PS****\n\nLOL read Ryan H's review, couldn't agree more. Glad to know I'm not alone in that department. It seems like whenever I come here I tend to pay more and more. I always just order half a dozen but I never pay $5.99 like how it's advertised (and yes I am aware cronuts are $3) The last time I visited, I ordered a dozen and bam total bill was over $16 and this was after I asked her which donuts were part of the 9.99 price tag: her answer was 4 of the special and the rest regular donuts. It's not going to stop me from going there because I do like the quality and the ladies are nice, I just wont get a dozen anymore hahahaha.
