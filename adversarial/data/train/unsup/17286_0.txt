Typical dive. My husband and I had an issue at the bar because some drunk shouted at my husband and when I responded, the bartender tried to rip my coffee out of my hand, essentially assuming I would be throwing it at him, which was NOT the case. I got the overwhelming feeling that they side with the drunken loser regulars instead of normal, responsible people who stop by. Every person affiliated with the ownership is a lush.
