I'd dined at Zuma last year during the first weekend of March Madness and came away so impressed that I knew that I had to take my wife here the next time we were both in town.  We had dinner reservations for 6:30 on a Tuesday night, which was likely a good thing because by 7, the place had largely filled up.  We were seated at the robata grill, which offered a great view of delicious looking (and tasting) food being prepared.\n\nOur decision on food was easy based on my previous experience.  We had the Premium Omakase ($178\/person, which was a $10 increase since my previous visit).  We received 13 courses; seven of the dishes were the same on both visits, with the new ones likely based on seasonality and availability of ingredients.  I was a bit disappointed that we didn't get the Mushroom Hot Pot this time, which was mind-blowing in its deliciousness despite its simplicity, but all of dishes we received this visit were obviously prepared fresh to order, beautifully presented, generous in portion size, and amazingly satisfying.  Service throughout our meal was attentive and our meal was well-paced\/sequenced, which was a feat worth mentioning since our food was coming out of three separate kitchens.  While very pricey, Zuma's omakase game is strong and I highly recommend it as it offers a good cross-section of everything that Zuma offers.  In my opinion, Zuma continues to be the best kept food secret in the Cosmo.
