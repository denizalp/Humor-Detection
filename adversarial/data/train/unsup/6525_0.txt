ASK FOR THEIR SECRET CHINESE MENU FOR CHINESE. IF YOU ORDER ORANGE CHICKEN & EGG ROLL AND COMPLAIN, WELL FUCK YOU.\nThat being said, the beef in chili oil is gorgeous, string bean with pork is fantastic, special recommendation goes to wontom in hot oil. The staff is very friendly and knowledgable. This place is native Chinese foodie approved!
