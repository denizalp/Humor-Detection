We really like the shipping services of Forex, but unfortunately we have to give them only one star because they employ thieves and liars. My wife shipped three boxes from our house and the man who came to pick up the boxes is a thief and liar. My wife placed a roll of duct tape that she used of taping up the boxes on a table near the boxes. After the pick-up man left she noticed that the duct tape was missing. She called the Forex office on E. Charleston and they said the pick-up man denied taking the tape. This may seem like a trivial matter, duct tape costs about $6-$9 a roll, but what if it had been something more valuable such as my wife's purse placed on that table by the door? If someone would steal a roll of tape, then they would steal almost anything. Also the truck he used leaks oil, now there is a big (12\" diameter) oil spot on the street, and the street is barely a year old. I would have liked to give a 5 Star review, but honesty and trustworthiness is very important to me.
