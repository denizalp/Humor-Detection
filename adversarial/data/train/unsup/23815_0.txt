After performing a search of \"Find: Meatball, Near: Chandler, AZ\" and stumbling upon the fantastic reviews for this place (many of which give praise to the almighty meatballs), I was pretty pumped (and a bumped) to try the meatball sub here.\n\nNow since I got my order to-go, I kind of expected the bread to get soggy, which is exactly what happened.  Understandable.  Since the meatballs were HUGE, I decided to just separate them from the rest of the sandwich and eat the bread in between.  After the first bite from the outer edge of the meatball, I made note of two off-putting things.\n\n1. The meat tasted quite bland, like there was barely any seasoning.\n2. More importantly, I thought it was odd how soft\/mushy the texture of the meatballs were so I cut them open and, to my dismay, found them to be quite under-cooked (still very pink) in the center.  UGHhhhhhHHHHHhhhhHHHHhhh\n\nLuckily, the #3 cold sub (Mortadella, Salami, Prosciutto) was delicious so at least the entire experience wasn't a complete disappointment.  Also, the service was nice & friendly, so that's always a plus.\n\nNeedless to say, I will not be returning and will continue my quest for the one meatball sub to rule them all.\n\nGrade: I don't always eat meatballs, but when I do...I prefer not to have to go numero dos immediately.
