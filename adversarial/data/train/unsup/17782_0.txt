My girlfriend & I enjoyed the tacos, but the attitude in this joint just plain stinks. Our bartender Dan was cool, but he was the exception to the hostess, who certainly seems to believe the world spins on her axis. \n\nIt was 6:15, the place was empty but we were sat at the bar, with only 4 spots to choose from. We were told we had until 8 before they'd change over to the next reservation. No problem, I'd mentioned we'd only need about an hour, already. Just as I was about to tuck into my plate, she reached across and over my plate to grab the interac machine. When we left at 7:45, most of the tables remained empty. She was happy to greet her friends with big hugs and smiles, while new customers just didn't seem worthwhile. Another Mile End spot that started out well but has taken the hype way too much to heart.\n\nHipster heaven, especially when it comes to smug.
