Decent place if your Asian hair needs to be cut! I used to be a regular here, recently I've been checking out some of the other Japanese\/Korean places in town, but I've decided Maya is still the best! I've had Jina and Andy as stylists and they are both great. Service is okay, not very organized, the reception lady is a bit rude, but it's definitely worth the price! I personally consider it to be better than Kamiya.
