It was as good as the ratings suggest.\n\nI ordered something other than a roti by mistake...the manager said it would be no problem to bring me one...so he switched it! And it was my fault! I had a lamb and veg roti. Fuck. It was great. Eat half though, save the rest for later. You don't need a whole roti.
