Went with the family for thanksgiving dinner.  It was very good.  I imagine you can't go wrong at cartwrights    I've not been here before. But I will certainly return. They are a steakhouse and I don't eat beef or other large mammals.  But I will give it a shot and try their seafood.  Great service, tasty.   Good choice for thanksgiving.  $400 but not bad for four people with a couple drinks and a bottle of wine. If you visit Cave Creek and want a good dinner in a really neat place I certainly recommend it.  But here's the thing that irritated me.   And I guess maybe this is a holiday thing.  I don't mind when I have a large group at a restaurant and they add the 18% tip in the bill  Lets say 8 people or more   I get it.  But four people?  Seriously?  I always tip minimum 20%.  But if you tell me to tip 18, then that's what you get. Two couples shouldn't have the auto tip   I realize some people are cheap pricks who do 10 or whatever  but I do 20. So you dick your server. Again great food and atmosphere   But that add on tip chapped my ass  again maybe it was just the holiday, but I can take  $340 and do the math  four stars for the meal. Minus one star for unsportsmanlike conduct
