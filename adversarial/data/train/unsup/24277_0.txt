Wow. Jackie Rogers is awesome.  I found out about Reflecting Hands Massage through Groupon. I booked a hot stone massage (60 minutes). \n\nFrom the moment we started, I knew this was going to be a great massage. She's very talented. Pressure was perfect the entire time and the flow of her hands was both relaxing and rejuvenating. \n\nI've had many massages in Las Vegas and I can honestly say that she's probably the best hot stone massage I've ever had.  I haven't really been a fan of hot stone massages until today. Always felt like the hot stones are uncomfortable for the masseus who can't wait to put them down so they can stop burning their hands. Haha. Didn't feel this way at all with Jackie. I think she used a total of 8 stones on my back, resting them all on my lower back as they cooled off. \n\nBefore we began, she asked me if there were any problematic areas she should focus on. I expressed tightness around my shoulder and neck area and she spent a majority of the time working through those knots and tension. I always feel like that question is ignored by other therapists \/ spas in vegas. \n\nI typically buy groupons for a deal with the intention of not really going back, but Jackie is great and I look forward to booking my next appointment with her!
