Not impressed with this dealer. My husband and I went on 3\/11\/16 to look at a ram we saw on line. We liked the truck despite the fact it had obviously been smoked in, had a cigarette burn in the seat, had 2 previous owners, and had just fixed a dent in the bumper. With that said, we offered 25% below the asking price to open negotiations. They wanted the full price and we not willing to budge. We came in with cash and they would still not negotiate!! Not very professional at all. The salesman James was new in the job but nice guy. Management was the problem. They let a sale walk right out the door. I would not recommend this dealer at all if you are a smart shopper.
