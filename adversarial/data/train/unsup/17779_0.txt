We stayed here for a night earlier this month (coming from California). We had two queen beds in our room, and it seemed pretty decent. The air conditioner is probably what I cared about the most because it was freakin' HOT at 11pm. Yes it's cheap & better than paying a shitload at the Strip, but the one thing that grossed me out was when I was chasing my little 1 year old around, I stepped on a wet spot on the carpet. What. the. freak. I had no idea what it was. I just kept thinking to myself that it better be water. Ew.\n\nThe next morning we checked out at noon (that's a plus) & had breakfast downstairs at Coco's. My entire family ordered the $3.99 breakfast meal which included eggs, bacon\/sausage, hash browns, and toast or pancakes. It was pretty good for the price.
