My boyfriend and I recently went to the Lazy Dog at Town Square and could not have been more pleased with the experience! The food was absolutely incredible and we thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere. Above all, the service we received was absolutely incredible! Our server Marina was attentive, charming, and very knowledgable. We spent quite a while out on the patio and Marina made sure that we were comfortable and well taken care off. We also had the pleasure of meeting Kristen, the manager. Kristen was very friendly and extremely accommodating! At one point my boyfriend remarked that we were receiving celebrity service, which made me laugh because it was spot on. I had never been to the Lazy Dog before and it is now one of my favorite places to visit!
