We were patients of PEC but we decided to look for a different optometrist. Dr Tara Ransdell is great, very knowledgeable, professional, friendly. The problem is her front desk staff are rude. Their rude and unfriendly attitude was not just a one time occurence but a persistent problem.  Also, this practice's insistence on making an appointment  only if you provide a credit card number to charge you if you are a no-show makes you feel more like a profit center than a patient. Sorry Tara but your front office women aren't doing YOU a service.
