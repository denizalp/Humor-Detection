I was a repeat customer for over a year with a specific person ( I wont mention her name because as a person I really did like her).  I got my usual highlights touched up for a while, but this time I wanted to try something completely different.  LONG STORY SHORT.... I ended up going back 3 times to get my hair colored because it was not right... then at the end of it all, my hair ended up falling out. Yes, we all shed normally... but i literally am thinned out... and you can see it on my scalp.  Met with a dermatologist  who told me that the chemicals might have been sitting on my head for too long, or under the dryer for too long...  im so upset by this because I am getting married in a year, and I went specifically to her and told her i was trying to grow my hair out.... I even texted her on my 3rd color \"are you sure my hair wont damage?\" She said NO. but no.... my hair FELL OUT. there are NO WORDS to describe how I feel.  She offered to see it, but frankly... i went back way to many times to fix the issue I just dont trust her anymore. I will NEVER GO BACK.
