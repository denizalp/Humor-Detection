I have to say I think this property is in desperate need of a renovation. Everything seemed okay at check in aside from a lack of parking. Honestly I wouldn't have had a car if the hotel offered a shuttle from the airport, but apparently this is not something mid scale hotels in Vegas do. When I got to my room after a long day of traveling I pretty much just jumped into bed and passed out. \n\nThe next day when I was getting ready for the day I started to notice things. For example the faucet in the room leaked and was a nightmare to turn off. In fact midway through the 1st night I had to get up multiple times to fiddle with it to get it off. The carpets were worn down and when I came back to my room later that day after being out the entire floor smelled like a decomposing body. \n\nThe morning breakfast this location offers leaves something to be desired as well. Thankfully I only made the mistake of trying it once and never again during my stay. \n\nIf I was going back to Vegas I honestly would not stay here again.
