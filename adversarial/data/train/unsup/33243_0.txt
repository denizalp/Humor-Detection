After seeing LOVE, my boyfriend and I watched the documentary \"All Together Now\" which documents the arduous process that was creating this show. The founder of Cirque, Guy, was close friends with George Harrison, who had initially thought it'd be a wonderful idea if the worlds of Cirque and the Beatles somehow met.\n\nIt was no easy task, as this was not just a collaborative effort of the director and actors, but of the original musicians, and their family members and Apple Corps. Basically, everything you see during this show is both Cirque approved and Beatles approved, as every little decision was closely collaborated upon by the likes of George Martin, his son Giles, Yoko Ono Lennon, Olivia Harrison, Paul and Ringo. \n\nAnd it's amazing. It really is. \n\nWhile I've meanwhile never been a huge fan of the loose plots Cirque comes up with, the sensation of mixing several ethereal visions & effects with remixed, remastered Beatles songs proved to be a place-altering experience. I had many moments of being lost, confused, but joyful of that lostness. Certain moments of mixed music, mixed with the right vision, often left my speechless and happy, and as close to the Beatles as I'll ever be.\n\nThere are two kinds of people who will see this show: Beatles fans, who will connect on a spiritual level to what this means to the fans and the actual artists, and occasional\/not so much fans, who will still find something beautiful and deeply gratifying about this show, because it is just so highly worked on, so highly imagined. \n\nIt's certainly an endeavor of its own, and its magical!\n\nPersonal favorite scenes: Octopuses Garden (which begins magically as Good Night - I LOVED this!), Strawberry Fields Forever (a demo version which Yoko donated from her archives, reworked), Within You Without You (mixed awesomely with Tomorrow Never Knows), Something and A Day In a Life. The music was all revisited by George & Giles, and includes demo\/anthology versions worked upon - including \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\" which brought in a whole new orchestra to re-create the feeling of the song. It's almost like hearing these songs new, done by the master himself!\n\nEnjoy! :)
