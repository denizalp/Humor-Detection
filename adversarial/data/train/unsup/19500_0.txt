I will give two stars because the ultrasound tech was nice, as for everything else about this place, blah. The girl Andrea who works the counter is socially challenged and has the personality of a rock. When filing out paperwork she failed to have me read or sign the contract stating that if they could not get a good position there are no refunds, that's right, we signed nothing and were told nothing of the sort! Well after four min of the the tech trying she determined it wasn't going to happen because he was faced the opposite way ( went in for a 3d face at 30 weeks ) So after being in there for 4 min and paying $90 for a bear with his heartbeat and a pin, we got nothing! The girl reminded us we signed a contract, then she looked at our paperwork and said, oh no you didn't....duh! We were not told any rules and were not given any contract to sign because of her stupidity. Then she told us she couldn't help us and to call manager at 2. She was so rude and dumb, that is putting it mildly. This place is good for gender determination but for anything else it sucks, and they need a better receptionist then this half wit!
