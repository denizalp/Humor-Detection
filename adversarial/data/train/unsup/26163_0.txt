so gooood..  while it has some of the thing you do.e to expect at a thai restaurant. there are things in the menu with trying that I never seen before. I tried the pork bone soup and rad na, padseeew (this one I always get no matter where I go). all was really good. pork bone soup really sour but it was so enjoyable.\n. nice interiors  too.
