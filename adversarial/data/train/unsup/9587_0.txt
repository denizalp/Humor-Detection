The Gym was okay, not enough weights...kinda wierd to go check in at the front spa entrance. Nice cardio treadmills so you are not waiting for them.\n\nThe massage was decent price but all the other stuff was pretty expensive....like getting a men haircut for $50?\n\nIf u pay extra $5,  you get to enjoy the cold pool, the spa, and the sauna. Once you pay the $5, you can use it as much as you want for that day.\n\n The Men locker room is small but the showerhead pressure is nice.\n\nOnly reason, I use the spa was because I was staying at this Hotel and I needed to workout everyday.  The Hotel also have a huge free pool outside for Free.\n\nOverall the Hotel is great and my connection help us get front row tickets to the Jabbawockeez in Music and take pictures with them.  If you are a friend on my Facebook, it is posted there. :)
