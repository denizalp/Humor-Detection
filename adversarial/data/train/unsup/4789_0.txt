I wish I could write 0 about my experience here. I've been coming here since I was in middle school. I have troubled skin, and I've always trusted them. The front desk staff over the course of the last few years has become the absolute worst I've dealt with. Ever. They're trashy looking, and they are uneducated, unhelpful, and aggressive. I live 40 minutes away now, and was willing to make the drive, because aside from them, my experience with professionals has always been good. I called specifically asking if they took my insurance, and if I'd be paying the specialist copay of $30. She confirmed. So I made the drive, during rush hour traffic, to get an appointment in before work. When I arrive, I'm informed the copay is $100. I tried to speak to the girl, and she starts going on about how they're contracted, this and that. To me, this is irrelevant. She won't let me speak. I've made this drive for nothing, and they're asking me to pay 3x what I had originally thought I was going to. I will absolutely never go back. I will tell anyone and everyone who will listen not to go there. The front desk staff ruined my rapport with this business. Fuck you guys.
