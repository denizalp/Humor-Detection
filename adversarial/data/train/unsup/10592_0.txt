While at the mall this weekend they were handing out free cookies to mom's and coupons for free cookie with any purchase. The free cookie was a sugar cookie with rainbow sprinkles, which was really good. The cashier behind the counter was really busy with a line of customers wanting great cookies. The cashier was very friendly and helpful. They have a deal where the customer can save and get for cookies; this is what I bought. You buy five cookies and get the sixth free for $8.99. \n\nThey sell slurpee's here too!! I had to go back to those years when I could drink these and have some. What I did not drink the twins did! And it was great, very cherry on such hot days now. I had to buy the red velvet brownie since it is my favorite of all the dessert flavors. The red velvet brownie was delicious and paired well with cherry slurped.
