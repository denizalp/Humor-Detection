This place has real potential, but unfortantely for them... weird policies and horrible service kills it. I've heard a lot of great things about Honey Pig, but I just don't see where people are getting from.\n\nHoney Pig is slightly different than the other KBBQ places in town. Unlike the other spots, the Pig has huge cast iron dome. They grill most of the side dishes and still leave space for the meats if you order AYCE.\n\nThe AYCE has alot of catches. The menu doesn't indicate it, but you can only have one order of the rib-eye, which sucks cause that is usually my favorite dish. I found it odd because pretty much every other AYCE KBBQ joints has unlimited portions of Kalbi. The AYCE is limited to pretty much from 5pm - 10pm. So look to Sura, Woo-che, or Tofu for a light night fix. I found the Bulgogi to be incredibly sweet, seemed like it was over marinated. The spicy pork and beef tongue were on point. The side dish choices are limited and inconsistent. We went one time and they didn't even offer kim-che until we asked for it. WTF?\n\nThe service here sucked. We came in for lunch were 1 of 2 parties in the whole restaurant but we still couldn't get decent service. Our server forgot our orders, messed up some of the sauces and we had to hunt her down for re-fills. The 2 times I have been here I have been disappointed, not sure if I can suck it up and come back for a third.
