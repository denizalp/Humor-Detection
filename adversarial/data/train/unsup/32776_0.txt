Great stop as we leave Vegas.  Local coffee shop with Super friendly service, nice atmosphere and free wifi! \n\nFood was yummy (bagel, cheese and egg sandwich) and the prices reasonable.  The ice blended drinks were good and tasted like they had less sugar than a Starbucks counterpart (we enjoyed that!).
