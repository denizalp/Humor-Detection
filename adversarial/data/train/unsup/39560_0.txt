My teacher friends and I have the chance to be students at PS702 on Friday, June 19th. I can truly say I have never had more fun, good food and great atmosphere in my life. There were 10 of us total and we tried EVERYTHING on the menu, food and drinks. We played some other the games and just soaked the place in. It was fantastic. We had so much fun we will be having are July birthday celebration there.
