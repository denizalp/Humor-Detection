The best way to describe this place is, overpriced. We were three people for dinner, we all had an appetizer, entrée, and split a bottle of wine. This cost us 177$ + tip. Seriously? I understand it's Toronto and prices can be a little more than elsewhere, but I felt like I got robbed.\n\nAfter being seated at the table and given menus, our waitress and the owner (?) or maybe he was the maitre d', asked if we were ready to order. When we said we weren't, they literally hovered over our table, pens at the ready. Seriously? Give us some space and time to make a choice. It's not like there was a line out the door and the restaurant was packed.\n\nFor the entrée, I had the Grilled Octopus Insalata. If by grilled octopus, they meant cold and rubbery, it was spot on. My wife had teh Calamari and it was well, it was calamari, we've had worse and we've had better. My friend had the bruschetta and well it's hard to f***-up bruschetta\n\nFor the mains, I had the Pollo Parmigian, well it was essentially chicken with some cheese thrown on it and warmed up and thrown on an ice cold plate. This was in direct contrast to my wife's plate, of spaghetti bolognose, which we have to assume was prepared by Chef Mike, as the plate was piping hot and the past warm and a bit gooey. Chef Mike, isn't the chef of the restaurant, that is our pet name for anytime we suspect our meal was prepared in microwave. I can't remember what my friend had, but, it couldn't have been great, as I don't recall him saying a word.\n\nOne last word about the wait staff. When serving water, go to the side of the table the person you are going to pour for is on. Do not lean across the table and pour. (A), it is rude, (B), I don't need someone's arm in my face, and (C) it's kind of gross to have your armpit hovering over my plate.\n\nIf you are starving and have to eat somewhere, I suggest going across to the Metro grocery store and picking up a sandwich.
