After a lukewarm experience, the owner of MWC reached out to me via Yelp and asked for a second chance after apologizing for the subpar trip. My wife and I obliged and ended up having a great time. Our server was super friendly, knowing just when to stop by our patio table to check drink levels, ask about our food and provide general chit chat. We were able to take advantage of the happy hour (ends at 6:00p), which offeres $5 wine selections (white & red) + $5 22 oz. draft beers. You can also order discounted appetizers. We tried the chicken quesadilla and it was outstanding. The patio was quiet, clean and offered a nice view of Ahwatukee gold course. There are bistro lights that turn on when the sun sets, and we also experienced live music the night we visited (Saturday- seems the music begins around 7p). \n\nThe food was really good- after the app we tried three types of the bruschetta and all were tasty (Italian was super yum). There is a wide selection of menu items, ranging from flatbread pizzas to pasta dishes. The drink list is impressive, but know this is a wine and beer bar only. You'll have numerous options to select from- and the staff is very knowledgeable and helpful in finding the right glass of wine for you and your table. They can even help you pair your wine with food items. \n\nI'm really glad we gave My Wine Cellar a second chance. My wife and I have been visiting for quite a few years now (with previous ownership) and have always enjoyed ourselves. For a wine bar, MWC leaves the pretentious attitudes at the door and focus on friendly service, great wine selections, and some really cool beer options for the non-wine patrons. The environment is casual, and I would recommend to my friends and fellow Yelpers to give this place a shot. A great date spot if you're looking for some place new.
