EDC has grown a whole lot. This use to be my annual music fest, who am I kidding thee best rave everrrrrr and still going strong! I loved it when it was here in LA! I wish they would come back here but hey its a great excuse for a road trip. I went to EDC LA until the last year they had it here. This is how a crowd get down and real. The music is always great and when the beat drops the crowd goes wilding. \n   I love making costumes for each day. It's really my favorite part besides the music. We get to see so much creativity come out of people. Always good vibes and awesome people.\n  The last year in LA was crazy though, music was turned off in the main room for a long time, and vendors refused to sell anything until the music was back on. People were jumping from the seating area into the arena, on vendor tents. I guess they had a good reason not to hold it here anymore lol.\n   Although it's no longer in LA. EDC is still thee most awesome rave and you can experience it in Las Vegas the city that never sleeps, just like ravers! LOL \nPLUR! (^_^)
