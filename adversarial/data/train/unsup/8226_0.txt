The service here was really good & they were really nice but my brows came out horrible. \nI got a wax & a tint and both were so bad. I had already had a eyebrow shape & just wanted her to clean it up. She gave me two different eyebrow shapes both were horrible. Then when I got the tint, the color was way off. I have blonde\/ brown hair and the eyebrow tint was red brown!!! \nI am so dissatisfied with my brows and now wont leave the house without filling them in with makeup. Which is why i wanted the tint in the first place, so I wouldnt need makeup.
