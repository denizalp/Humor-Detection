One of the problems with growing out short hair is that it starts looking a hot mess when it hits a certain length. I can tell myself for months straight that I'm not going to cut it, but then it hits my shoulders and I suddenly want to go Emma Watson on this ish.\n\nNikki Olson's name was recommended to me for a cut and highlights by my recently hair-savvy mother, who had bought a Groupon only to find out too late that it was for new clients only... thus, the Groupon was in my greedy little hands. I told Nikki of my hair woes (growing out hair, wedding to go to, easy, cool, etc etc) and that I was pretty open to ideas. She went straight to work. I like that she doesn't gossip the whole appointment, yet she's conversational. My kind of stylist! She decided to give me randomly-spaced highlights throughout my hair and then chop up the cut so you could see the highlights pop through. During the cutting portion, I was nervous because she seemed to pick up chunks at random and just *SNIP*, but the end result turned out really cool! Very sleek and just my style. Nikki made some great choices and I'll definitely be back.
