If I could leave zero stars I would. Told the receptionist I needed a clean up of an under shave. They booked me for a consultation and explained that I could still get my undershave. Told Lo, the stylist that it was booked for a consultation but that I just wanted an undershave. After tousling my hair for 15 minutes, I was told that it was booked for a consultation and that Lo was too uncomfortable giving an undercut. When I expressed my disappointment, I was told it was due to \"miscommunication\" and that I could go somewhere else. No apology, no \"here's some free shit sorry for the convenience.\" Seriously, how are you in business? Abominable customer service.\n\n\n\nIn response to Jay C: not only is your comment insulting, it's also incorrect. After visiting Lola I went down the street to a barber. I left the shop in 15 minutes. Shame on you and your business for not delivering any customer service. Shame on you for addressing this and not apologizing. Seriously, anyone who is thinking of going here- just skip this crap. Can you imagine if you actually trusted them to cut your hair, they said they were capable of giving you the cut you wanted, but then couldn't and didn't apologize---EVEN AFTER YOU POSTED ON YELP!?!? Lol
