This place was amazing!\n\nFirst time getting a couples massage & Rein was able to get us in same Day at the appointment time I requested. He recommended not to use the groupon and he'll honor the price and the ad because groupon does not do a me day apt.\n\nThe place was very clean & calming with the soft music.\n\nBefore we started they had asked us how we wanted, where we wanted to get massaged and if we prefer a male or female massus.\n\nMy massus was Lisa and she was great! She was so great that I feel asleep and twitched on her while she was massaging me .\n\nMy husband had a male massus and wanted a deep tissue because he was having back aches. He said he hit the spots real good.\n\nI'd def recommend this place to a friend and will be coming back!
