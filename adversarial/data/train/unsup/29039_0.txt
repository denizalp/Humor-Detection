I bought a new Ford Escape from AutoNation earlier this week and it was the best car-buying experience of my life. I worked with Bev Olecki and she (and the rest of their team) worked hard to get me a great deal on my car. There was no pressure and Bev helped me select the most cost effective options for my needs. Bev found the car I was looking for at another local dealer and brought the car over to AutoNation. After we finished our price negotiations, she handed me over to their Finance Office where (much to my surprise) my deal was promptly completed with no delays or problems. All in all, a great experience. I look forward to buying here again in the future.
