I had seen so many pictures and reviews of this place, so I had to come when I was in Vegas in September 17. When I arrived, there was a small lineup, but it was so worth the wait. \n\nI ordered the infamous Slut and I can't describe how much I loved it. The egg was perfectly poached and mixed well with the potato pur√©e and chives. The texture was very smooth and the aroma was just hard to describe. Together with the crispy baguette and it was heaven. It was so good that I came back a few hours later just before my flight back home. A must try if you have never had it before!
