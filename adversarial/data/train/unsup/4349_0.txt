Get your carb loading engines started because Suárez Bakery is all about the tasty baked goods. Located towards the bottom of the Park Road Shopping Plaza, the glass counters are filled with cakes and pies and cookies and donuts. The \"Texas Doughnut\" is the size of my head! Lots of interesting brownies and pastries!\n\nI opted for a nice and easy cheese danish, which I brought down the way to the coffee shop. The cheese was tasty, the danish was tasty and crumbly and all sorts of yummy deliciousness. Fresh!\n\nTotally recommend Suárez!
