This Auto Zone has excellent customer service. The staff was very friendly and helpful. My brake light was not working. I bought the bulb, went home, and attempted to fix it by myself. While doing it, I realized it was much more complex than I initially thought. I went back to the store and they did not hesitate at all in helping me. It took a while but they got it done. They had a really good attitude about it the whole time. I owe them! I would recommend this place to everyone.
