Our office got together to all have our cars washed and chose this company. We scheduled a certain time and day for this, a couple days in advance. I loved the idea of being able to start a relationship with this company to have 5-10 cars washed bi-weekly on a regular basis. They never showed up at the scheduled time, and they picked the date and time!  When we called the owner he said, \"Oh, they're just not there yet.\" That was it. Anyone who has no sense of urgency, or is not upset when their business dropped the ball, probably doesn't care about the quality of their work either. We cancelled this appointment because punctuality is important, and so is taking care of your clients.
