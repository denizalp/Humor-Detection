All L&Ls are pretty much the same. The food is consistent no matter what location you go to. The only difference that I noticed was that some locations put way to much rice in the Spam Musubis. Although it's not the best Hawaiian food in the city, they have many locations and the food is good enough. \n\nThings I like about this location:\n-Quick and convenient: I usually call in my to go order and my food is already ready when promised.\n-Friendly staff: The two employees that I have seen working in the front have always been very nice and don't mind giving you extra sauce when requested. They also promote their stamp card: buy 9 regular plate lunches and get the 10th plate free! I know that other locations have this as well, but they don't care to tell you about it. \n-The restaurant is very clean.\n\nWhat I hate about this location:\n- The area is kind of ghetto. I have seen homeless and some weird people hanging out at this plaza so be careful!\n-The parking: the parking stalls right in front of the restaurant are tiny. If someone else parks next to you, good luck trying to get in and out of your car!\n\nOverall I like this location, but its too bad that the area doesn't seem very safe.
