i think the froyo wasnt really that good the flavour wasnt really special and the taste of the froyo wasnt really rich (pretty plain) they have more toppings than menchies but menchies has better froyo. i personally dont like the toppings much cuz everytime i go there the toppings are mostly chocolate or cookies..price is standard for frozen yogurt. this yogurty's has more toppings but some other yogurtys has really less.\nthe place was clean and comfortable if you sit there and eat.
