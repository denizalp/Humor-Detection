I had my birthday here in the private room.\nThe service was amazing, the waitress was very knowledgeable about both the menu and the wine. \nThe food was great. We ordered almost everything on the menu. \nThe short rib was delicious, melt in your mouth. \nScallops were great, as was the tuna tartar.  \nMy friends were disappointed in the cheese and meat board. Overpriced for what you get. \nI was disappointed in the root beer float dessert. Tasted nothing like root beer and was quite dry. \nI would recommend this place to others, just know what to order!
