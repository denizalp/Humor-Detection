I've been here twice- once for the kbbq and once for the UFO fried rice + ddeokbokki. \n\nThe first time I had kbbq here, it was pretty good; we got the BBQ set with pork + beef. It came with a lot of side dishes and vegetables, 2 bowls of rice. The meat was super fresh and it was really good! \n\nThe second time I came here I got ddeokbokki + kimchi bacon UFO fried rice with a friend. The food was okay, but I feel like they could have added more rice cakes in the ddeokbokki, as I felt a bit dissatisfied in how little rice cakes there were in the dish. The fried rice was okay, we added cheese to it (which cost an extra $3). \n\nOverall, I would probably come back again if someone asked me to but not on my own will.
