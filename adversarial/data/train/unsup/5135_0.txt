This spot is located in a strip mall across from the Palace Station on W Sahara. The entire front side of the strip mall is under construction and it was not easy finding a parking spot at lunch time. There was about a 15 minute wait in line. The dining area is small, so you may be taking your order to-go if it is busy.\n\nWe ordered the Angry Tuna, Twin Dragon, and the 3 Amigos. We all chose the seaweed wrapper. Everything was excellent. They were all basically giant hand rolls filled with different items. Most of the rolls are around $8 to $10 dollars. Definitely worth it.\n\nI will be returning to try more menu items. I recommend that you give this place a try. You won't be disappointed.
