I have been getting waxed for many years now. Brazilians have always been a particular pain. But Karla is hands down the best and I've had such a positive experience at their spa. From their seamless online appointment booking to their email confirmations to the quick, painless waxing service received to the affordable price of only $35 for Brazilian, I am truly so impressed. I've gotten expensive Brazilians that were painful and not nearly as clean. I'm not one to write a lengthy review but this place is a gem! Definitely going to be coming back here very soon!
