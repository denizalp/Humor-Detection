I found this company when I was having an error message show up on my Canon printer.  After all of the online troubleshooting, it told me that I needed to contact an authorized Canon service center -- I was surprised to find there were only 2 in the Phoenix area...and luckily, this one was close to me!\n\nI called and was thrilled to have a human being answer the phone!  He was very helpful and answered all of my questions about service fees and possible charges -- I said I would think about it (it was just $25 for the diagnostics, but I know oftentimes it's cheaper to just buy a new one than have one fixed...and he agreed!).  I decided to take it in to them anyway and see what was wrong.\n\nI was greeted by Grant when I went in and he was extremely understanding and helpful -- said he would check it out and get back to me the next day (it was about 4:15 pm)  --- I was very surprised to get a phone call later that evening from him -- he said he was working late and went ahead and looked at my printer.  Unfortunately, it was bad news...the part and labor would run about $125...pretty close to the cost of a new printer.  I said I would think about it and get back to him.  He understood and even gave me suggestions of places to look for new printers!  I decided to purchase a new one...but was allowed to go back to the store to get the ink cartridges out of my old printer!  A nice savings as I didn't have to buy new ones right away!\n\nIt was just very refreshing to find a small business still ran on honesty and customer service!  I feel bad for not spending more than $25 there...but should I ever need printer repair (or other business machine) services again, I'll definitely be back!
