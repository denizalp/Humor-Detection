I have such great memories of High Park as a kid where we'd have many a get together including picnics and bbq.  The park is huge by Toronto standards whether on foot or parking it's a treat to be in this park.  \n\nThere's multiple points of access:\n\n-There's eastern access from Parkside\n-Northern access from High Park avenue at Bloor street\n-Southern access from Colborne Lodge drive at The Queensway.\n\nThe Colborne Lodge entrance is limited however.  There is a road block that won't allow you in very far so parking and access the rest of the park can only be had on foot from there or from one of the other entrances.\n\nThere is a restaurant in the central location of the park that has a somewhat decent sized parking lot.  There's also parking along the access road leading from Bloor along the route where the pool and courts are.\n\nGrenadier Pond is the large body of water that runs north and south near the west side of the park that borders the neighborhood of Swansea.  The area leading to the pond is a bit of a grade and is sort of steep by our flat standards so it's a bit of a walk back uphill if you parked at the restaurant.\n\nThe trees, land and ground in general are very well kept.  There are ample bins for your recycling or garbage but not necessarily compost bins.  \n\nOverall this is a well kept park and nice piece of green in the city that barely has any green near the core of the city.  \n\nWhile High Park is not downtown or closer like Trinity Bellwoods it's still the largest park in the west side of town not bordering Mississauga (Centennial Park).  \n\nHigh Park is transit accessible and has a nearby subway station by the same name.
