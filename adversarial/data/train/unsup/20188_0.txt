I'm a happy corvette owner! I will only take my Vette to John at Southwest Classics!\nI feel confident with the high quality of service I receive each time I have needed to bring her in. \n\nIt's unfortunate I've had to have some work done, but I'm happy to report... I fall in love with my Vette over and over when I see her all shiny and perfect again!\n\nCustomer service is number one for me! And Southwest Classics always delivers! Why go anywhere else? \n\nHappy corvette owner! Thank you Thank you!
