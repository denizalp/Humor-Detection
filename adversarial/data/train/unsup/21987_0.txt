This restaurant has been around for quite some time and recommended by a few.  Most of the customers are non-Asian. It is the all you can eat Japanese restaurant.  For a week night, it is $18.99.  \n\nThe Miso soup tastes good but only warm and not hot enough.  Agedashi tofu is lightly batter but found to be bit sour, so we return it.  Shrimp Tempura also is lightly batter.  It is not oily, the shrimp is long but thin.  Gyoza is deep fried to be crispy.  The Salmon and White tuna sashimi is fresh and good.  The beef roll with sprout is much better than the other restaurants.  Udon is very hot and soup tasty.  You can order chicken, beef or seafood as the tops. Eggplant has too much sauce on it.  Edamame is a bowl portion and steamed hot.  Dragon roll is average.  Sushi is not packed enough and when you pick it up, it can easily split into 2.  The ice cream either Green Tea or Red bean is a large single scoop.  The fried banana is very delicious.\n\nThe waitress is attentive and polite.  Service is good.  Food is served in a timely manner.\n\nDon't know whether it is due to the tofu, I got diarrhea at night.
