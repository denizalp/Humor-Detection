I have tried many of the sushi places around the area, and this is by far my favorite. The rolls are delicious, and they never skimp on the toppings (if something says it has crunchies, I expect more than a sprinkle!). Dine in or Take out, our orders are always correct. My favorite are the handrolls, which are a cone made of seaweed, filled with rice, cucumber, and your choice of a few select proteins. If you dine in, they serve these in a special dish to hold the handrolls upright, instead of laying on the side.\n\nIf you have never been here before, definitely try it. You will wonder why you eat sushi anywhere else! If you like spicy foods, try the heart attack-trust me!
