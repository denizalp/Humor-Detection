My visit not as great today as my first visit. This time I knew to order my salad (salmon\/spinach) WITHOUT onions.  So, I get my salad and it has those awful red onions diced so small that you cant easily pick them out. BLEH!! I detest raw onions - ESPECIALLY the red ones. \n\nSo when our server finally makes it back around to check on our table, I showed her the onions and reminded her that I had ordered without. She took it back so they could remake it...and I waited & waited & waited.... \n\nWhen she finally brought it back out, my dining companions had already finished their meals. Since we have already been gone for an hour, I asked her to go ahead & box it so I could take it back to the office to eat.  Waiting for it to be boxed took a long time too... WTH? I should have asked her to bring the container to the table so I could do it myself. Sigh. \n\nWhen I finally got back to office & had a chance to eat, the mood was ruined for me. I did not enjoy my salad and certainly did not enjoy my overall dining experience.   For the $ I definitely expect better from them.
