Last meal in Vegas before we have to fly home to idaho.  You know that saying save the best for last?  Well that is the case with Guys restaurant.   Was not disappointed at all.  Even our son said we need to come back here again after eating the drunken fish tacos.\n\nThe mac n cheese bacon burger was legit.  Turn into Harras to park and wind your way back to the Quad. Once you Valet park it is right there. Winner winner chicken dinner.
