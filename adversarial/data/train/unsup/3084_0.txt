I have only every had one menu item at Oaza. The Chicken Shawarma.  To sum it it up in as very many words as the Yelp review length prompter stresses me to do so, the Chicken Shawarma shall be described by myself, the one and only Benny K, as being born from Earthly goodness constructed by loving fingers that have been blessed by Angels who, surrounded by dancing Cherubs, praise up to the high heavens singing songs of wonder and glory about how such an amazing culinary treat was ever packaged ever so snuggly into a little sweet tight package and forth delivered into our unworthy mouths for such a pleasurable treat.  Chips like it spicy baby.
