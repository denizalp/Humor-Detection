Asian central as all I can say! ;-)  Great for people watching as the crowds brings the casual to the overly dressed (or not dressed) to this event. Seriously, do girls need to cake on heavy make up to go to a night market? What's up with that? \n\nBetween the smelly tofu and the heavy long line ups, some of it is worth it and some of it is not.  The best part is that there's always more choices than time.    This event is a staple for the summer crowd in Markham and it's been highly successful so expect more to come in the following years!\n\nTips:\n\n- bring cash and lots of it as the ATMs on site charges a hefty service fee\n- come early to avoid line ups, the worst is if you arrive after 7pm and onwards.\n- there are more than enough skewers and smelly tofu vendors, try them all to see which ones you like better\n- dress light, this isn't a formal or the club, you will smell of BBQ smoke and sweat, guaranteed\n- great place to stock up on freebies, like Trojan condoms. (I walked away with more than a dozen!) There's a joke in here somewhere.... ;)
