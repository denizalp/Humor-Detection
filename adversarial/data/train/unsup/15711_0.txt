My wife and her sisters went in to get matching tattoos. The tattoos took somewhere between 45 min to an hour to get done. My wife was charged $180 for a tiny tattoo with very little detail. EXTREMELY overpriced and definitely praying on tourists. For reference I have a large tattoo that starts on my forearm, wraps around my elbow, and then takes up most of my upper arm. I paid $600 total and it has a ton of detail. They might do decent work, but definitely shop around before paying their outrageous price.
