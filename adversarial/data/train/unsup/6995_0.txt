Peixoto Coffee is just what Downtown Chandler needed. \n\nSlight hipster vibe but insanely strong coffee, this is the perfect place to stop in for your daily cup of control. \n\nMy favorites have been the Nitro Cold Brew as well as the traditional Cold Brew. \n\nBoth are delicious options; however, I tend to favor the Nitro Cold Brew which has the appearance of a Stout beer. \n\nRegardless of your choice of coffee, hopefully you have a lot to get done because you probably won't be sleeping for the next 10-15 hours. \n\nWhile Peixoto tends to cater to actual coffee drinkers, the \"milkshake coffee\" crowd is apt to find something to enjoy here.\n\nMe? I won't lie, I love the Menta Mocha every year around the holidays. \n\nIt's cool how they pair up with other local businesses such as Fluff It Marshmallow.\n\nSeriously, get the marshmallow fluff on the Menta Mocha for a true treat. It's worth the $1 extra! \n\nThe last time I paid a visit, I saw these delicious things coming out from behind that counter that resembled a Root Beer Float.\n\nLooks like you can now get a Nitro Float with freakin' Gelato in it - That's next on my \"To Try\" list at Peixoto! \n\nSupport local and drink coffee at Pay-Show-Toe.
