This business is unethical and shady.  I had reserved a car online and was told that the fee with taxes would be $ 302 for a 4 day rental of a mid-size car (Hyundai Elantra with 35,000 miles).  When I arrived they asked me if I wanted the CDW insurance and I said \"no\" I don't want it.  They had me initial like 8 places on the form and I assumed part of that was to decline the insurance.  Well, they charged me for insurance and other surcharges above and beyond what the reservation showed for a total of $ 164 more than what the original reservation stated.  My total bill for a 4 day rental was $ 466!!!  That's insane!!  Once I caught the extra charges, 2 days after my rentaI, I asked for them to credit me back the amount.  They wouldn't do it.  Bottom Line: Do NOT rent from Payless. They are unethical and force you to pay for the insurance that you don't want.  I've seen others on Yelp have problems with them as well.  Phoenix in general charges a ridiculous amount in taxes and surcharges for rental cars.  Save time effort and money and just use Uber or Lyft for all of your needs.  I could have had over 20 Uber rides in and around Phoenix, Scottsdale, Tempe and all of the suburbs of Phoenix for less $ than renting a car.  Ridiculous!  They should be ashamed that they gouge renters.  I agree with Red J. and would prefer to give them 0 stars.  They suck!!!!
