My cat got shaved here a couple weeks ago. I've never had her groomed before, so I don't have much to compare it to. However, my experience was somewhat of a struggle. \n\nFirst off, I had scheduled an appointment a week prior and then even called to verify the time the day of. When I showed up, they said they had no record of me in their system so I had to reschedule for an appointment a week later. Not super happy about that.\n\nWhen I finally brought my cat in the staff was extremely friendly, caring and helpful. The service was fast which I appreciated. The inside feels like a pet groomer in Toontown - super colorful and whimsical. They had two store cats that were adorable and soft as clouds. The cat groomer was also particularly nice.\n\nMy cat is indoor\/outdoor so she has her front claws and isn't afraid to use them. I was very upfront that she isn't friendly with strangers, hasn't ever been groomed before and probably will try to murder anyone that comes near. I knew it would be difficult for them to groom her to a T. I was excited to see her groomed like a lion though.\n\nIt is very nice having her clean and cut (she was nappy from being outdoors). However, none of the lines are clean and her cut is rather ratchet - this I expected. Like I said, my cat probably wanted to murder the groomer. \n\nMy main complaint is they hacked half her whiskers off on one side. :( I'm sure she was extremely hard to pin down and shave but she needs her whiskers to better her cat skills especially when she is outside. It was quite disappointing. I probably won't have her groomed again regardless but don't have any plans of bringing my other pets here in the future. \n\nThey definitely tried really hard but it wasn't the best experience.
