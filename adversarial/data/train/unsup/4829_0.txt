Such a pretty café with a sunny, mellow vibe and glorious big windows and lots of spots to sit in groups or peacefully alone. The coffee is not perfect but I love that it's tucked one block away from Rosemont metro on a pretty residential street. I love the art inside, all dangling origami and chalk drawings of boats. I like that they have baked goods and cheesy savoury filling options and a restaurant license so if you eat a meal you can have a glass of wine - when I was in school this was my perfect all day study vibe. We used to search for perfect, secret cafés and only share them with other kindred spirit people who understood their importance. If I had found this café back then it would have been my most secret, and I'm super glad to have it in my life now.
