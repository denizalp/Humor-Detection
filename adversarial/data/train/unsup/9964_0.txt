I had been to a painting party with my friends and thought it was tons of fun, so when another Groupon popped up I bought it for my mom and I to do together. \n\nWe finally booked our painting party for today at Nacho Daddy's. I actually really enjoy having it located in a restaurant. Easier to order food and get refills. We had a private room and I enjoyed the fact that it wasn't too overbooked. We had plenty of room to spread out and paint. My mom and I ordered some nachos to share. Service from Nacho Daddy's was better than our previous visits, which I was pleased by. \n\nOur instructor was very friendly. She wasn't too concerned about details about painting. She gave us basic instructions and let us have a little more free reign to let our creative juices flow. The three hours went by very quickly and it was lots of fun. \n\nNext time I will try to pick a painting that is a little less intricate as everyone seemed to have a hard time keeping up with the difficulty level. I was still surprised by how well our paintings came out, but make sure you check out all the options on their web site before booking your appointment. You can pick based on painting. \n\nYou can book private parties and there are also child's painting parties that are available. Definitely worth it for a nice relaxing outing.
