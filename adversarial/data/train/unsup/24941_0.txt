This is a super cute and cozy place to get a massage! I didn't even realize this place was here, but parking was easy and the front desk staff was super friendly. I've heard great things about the chiropractic side of things as well, so I will have to come back. :)\n\nI have to say my massage was AMAZING! Tana did a great job at listening to and understanding my needs, and I felt great afterwards! The bed was comfortable and she was very attentive. Thank you so much!!
