Was in Phoenix for a business conference & decided to drop by this place Friday night close to my resort. Walked in & was greeted by employee right away! Sat me down, walked me through the menu with hookah, drink, & food options. Hookah was fantastic! The owner himself shook my hand & introduced himself. The customer service & the friendly staff itself will make me want to come back here next time I'm in Phoenix!
