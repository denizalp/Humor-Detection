I went in yesterday and was very happy that I did. I was a little leery that there was only one review but they offered all that I needed - oil change\/service, car wash and speed. I got all three in spades. Add friendly service as a bonus. I would have made the rating 4.5 stars if I could but the app wouldn't let me. (The dryer function in the drive through car wash needs work as it left a fair amount of water on the driver's side. Did good on the wheels though)
