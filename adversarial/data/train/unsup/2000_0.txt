I think this is one of my favorite places to be on a warm summer night.  I love to sit outside and gaze at all the twinklies....it is the most beautiful view of the city.  My man and I like to sit upstairs in the lounge area.  The bartenders are great.  The service is spot on.  Their food is really good too.  We always get the cheese tray, it has the best selection of cheeses and sweet touches like honey and fig marmalade.  I am a huge tapas fan so we typically get a bunch of appetizers and split them.  They have a nice wine selection and it is reasonably priced.  This place is really sexy.  Check it out.
