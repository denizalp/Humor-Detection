Pretty disappointed in this place!!  The salsas weren't very good at all (one overly sweet and one had an off sour taste) but the chips are excellent.  \n\nOur main issue was three of our party wanted a la carte enchiladas.  Ordered them and got the bill--they were 5 cents more than the plates with rice and beans.  The server never told us--hey, the plate is a better deal.  Their pricing needs some work \n\nWe are sticking to Carlos OBriens in the same parking lot.
