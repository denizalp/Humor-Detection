This is my first time at any OHSO. I was very impressed with the layout of this establishment. It is so customer friendly with open spaces for people to walk around and hang. I love that this place is dog friendly. They even give a water bowl to your pet with their name on the bowl. Amazing!! \n\nI came here with a large group and the staff worked very hard to make sure everyone received their drinks quickly. There was a bit of confusion with passing out the drinks to the wrong people because different staff was passing them out, but our actual server made it right. \n\nThe pork wings were very good. I would have those again as a meal. One thing to remember is that this place brews their own beer so you can't order a Budlight. You get something similar to it. This also goes for their different shots. \n\nIf you want to play fun outdoor games come here. They can corn hole and ping pong. This is definitely a fun hang out spot for you and your friends.
