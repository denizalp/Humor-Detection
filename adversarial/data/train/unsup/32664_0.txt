I came here to get my hair done and was really happy with my experience. Sarah did a great job cutting and styling my hair.\n\nAll of the employees were really friendly and this was a great environment to get my hair cut in. I will definitely go back to see her again. \n\nThey provide customers with a great experience from the ambiance and atmosphere, to the bubbly and fun attitudes of the employees. You can tell everyone enjoys working here and it's a great salon to get your hair or makeup done. They also sell lots of jewelry made by local designers. \n\nThis salon is worth checking out.
