Walked into the bar area to gamble and have a beer. There wasn't a bartender around, not a good start. Sat for approximately 20 minutes before the bartender showed up and took my beer order. I had one beer and she asked if I wanted the food menu. She gave me one, I played another $20 and never saw her again until I walked out.
