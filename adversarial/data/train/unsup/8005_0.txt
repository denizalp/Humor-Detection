Can I give 0 stars? Really... you advertise 15 flavors available for wings... and when my party order's 50 wings, you say we can only choose 2 flavors! What the hell? I can go down the street and order any number of wings at Native New Yorker and get them in ANY configuration. And right next store there is a Buffalo Wild Wings with a more liberal flavor policy as well.\n\nThat is exactly what I did. Walked next door to BWW and got 50 wings, for less money and got to choose 5 flavors! If you want to survive with all of your nearby competition, you are going to have to step up your game!
