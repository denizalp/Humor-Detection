This by far is my favourite Swiss Chalet location, they're fast, friendly and efficient.\n\nI don't have a ton to say about them, because I'm primarily a takeout customer and 100% of the time it's ready as soon as I get there or even earlier. And when I had issues with the app, they resolved it instantly. Their customer service is amazing.\n\nThe only flaw is getting there, because you have to go around a gas station and it's a bit awkward, but it's worth it.\n\nThe food has always been perfect, fries aren't soggy, chicken is always moist, wings are perfect. That's all I really order, but it's always good, so why order anything else.\n\nShort-no waits, good food, nice staff. It's a great Swiss Chalet.
