My most recent layover was in Charlotte where I had a hungry stomach and 3 hours to kill.  So, I was looking for a spot I could grab a bite and write some Yelp reviews like a good Yelp nerd would.  1897 Market was my spot.\n\nThere were a lot of spots on the wall with outlets for charging and electronics using, but have your back to everyone else and I'm not cool with that at the airport: too many weirdoes walking around snooping and doing other weird things.  I asked to sit at a table on the wall and got a good spot.\n\nThe food wasn't too bad.  I went with my server's (Zach) advice and order the shrimp and grits.  It went against my better judgment of what I know about food cost to quantity\/quality ratio, but I took his advice and it worked out well.  I also got a side salad as well.\n\nFunny thing, but the side salad was served in an odd shaped bowl similar to a soap dish.  It had a weird dip in it; it wasn't quite a bowl but certainly was not a dish.  I had a hard time keeping my tomatoes from squirting up over the sides, rolling off and committing tomatocide off the edge of the table (one actually did).  It wasn't a big deal, but then some French guy the next table over kept coughing up a lung like he had \"la bubonic plague\" or something, and I started to wonder if I made the right choice of dinner spots.\n\nThen the main course came out and I was relieved.  The shrimp and grits were very good.  The grits came with cheese melted in them, and could have passed for some homemade mashed potatoes.  They also garnished the dish with arugula which gave it a zesty spice.  Last but not lease, there was plenty of shrimp to my delight.
