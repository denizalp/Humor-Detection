I was going to go to Udupi for lunch, but then I saw the sign saying that it was \"pure vegetarian\". No thanks.\n\nLuckily I stumbled on Taj Mahal in the Food City shopping center. It was fantastic. The have lunch specials now instead of the buffet, so that the food is fresher. I wanted Chicken Korma, but it wasn't on their list of lunch specials. This wasn't a problem however, as they were willing to just give it to me anyway at the special price ($7.99).\n\nIt was delicious, and it also came with naan, lentils, yogurt, and a small salad. All this for $7.99 -- are you kidding me? The naan was fresh and hot, and very tasty. And again, the chicken korma was incredibly good.
