My husbands screen cracked and he went to the apple store to get it fixed and they said it was hours long of a wait to talk to someone. I called uBreakiFix and they were able to get it done within an hour. The person I spoke to was extremely friendly and helpful. We were highly satisfied with the time to get the phone fixed, the cost, as well as the customer service! We definitely recommend this place!
