This place has enormous portions! I got the crab cake Benedict and it was absolutely delicious, the crab cake was slightly spicy, layered with Sunnyside up eggs, tomatoes spinach, biscuits and mashed potatoes covered in a delicious Chile sauce. My friends both got their fried chicken but didn't really enjoy how battered it was but loved the spices. It's super heavy for breakfast so I'd recommend eating this for any other time.
