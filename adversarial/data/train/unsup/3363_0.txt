I ate lunch at Fran's last week for the first time and WOW! I'm going to be back again and again.  I like the eclectic menu, it's not the usual boring..... burger, some sort of chicken, some sort of fish, sandwich with some canned choices of a side dish. Oh No,  Fran's menu is pure innovation. My server was well versed with the specials of the day and gave great service.  I got the sense that they mix it up in there from day to day.  \n\nI had what they called a meatball slider and Madone was it good.  I had a side of Mac and Cheese (which I consider myself a M-&-C connoisseur)  Even the Mac and Cheese had a Fran twist that separates it from the pack using several shapes of pasta and a few different cheeses.  It was the best M-&-C I've ever had in Charlotte (including what used to be my favorites Lupie's and Mac's BBQ).\n\nI was also impressed with the presentation. My ten dollar lunch was presented and garnished with the care, pride and attention like that of a Saturday Night, Uptown $50 Entr√©e at the newest sheik place with a trendy one syllable name.   The tableware was really cool and retro styled (Melmac or Fiestaware like) very fitting of the charming-ness and uniqueness of Fran's.\n\nFran came out, introduced herself, welcomed me, asked what I thought and even gave me a couple of cookies.  How great is that?\n\nIn short, awesome menu, excellent service at a great value.  Should I become a serial killer (though not likely), get captured, found guilty and sentenced to the death penalty, I want my last meal to be Fran's Mac and Cheese.
