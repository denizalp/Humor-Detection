Inconsistent quality for both breakfast and lunch. I typically order a Sausage McMuffin and some days it's burnt, others it's fine. Service can be either super quick or slow as molasses, which has led me to go there less and less. The employees also range from someone openly complaining to really kind people thanking you for your business.
