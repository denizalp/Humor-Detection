I was hesitant about coming to this establishment because of the overwhelming bad reviews in regards to their customer service. I went during lunch time and was seated at the bar. Five minutes went before a waitress noticed I wasn't being helped.. She apologized and quickly brought me a glass of water and a menu. She returned two minutes later and asked if I was ready to make an order, which I was.\n\nI ordered the following:\n\nTeriyaki Rice Ball - This rice ball is crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. It is covered in a teriyaki glaze. It is served hot and is good.\n\nSea Bass Yakitori - Delectable and melts in your mouth! Be sure to order it (salt only, no sauce).\n\nNigiri Ikura - Amazing \n\nNigiri Unagi - Tasty\n\nNigiri Saba - They gave me a piece that was not presentable and tried to cover it up with some green onion. Regardless, it was delicious!\n\nCalamari Tempura Roll - Calamari is hard to get right and this was spot on! Fried well, was soft, and tasty. If the calamari or octopus at a restaurant is tough and chewy.. they do not know what they are doing !\n\nGrinch Roll - Delicious! Would order again!\n\nBoth rolls had an issue with keeping their form; it seemed that the rice was a tad over cooked and was not rolled tightly enough.\n\nThe food started to arrive within five minutes! Once I was done eating, I asked for the check and received my check and a complementary piece of cake within two minutes.\n\nThe sushi is great, the service was good, and the prices are fair; I will be returning for sure.
