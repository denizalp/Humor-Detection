I was taken by a friend. It isn't a very clean place- it's plastic utensils and melamine plates and plastic drinking glasses- and the waiter took us to the very back, when we requested a new seat- he tried to shove us back into the side crowded area-where the bathrooms are located,  with the other white people- \n I finally just walked to one of the many open and empty booths in the main room and sat. \n\n I ordered the palak paneer (spinach with fresh cheese).  My friend ordered the onion masala dosa.  His dish was about $7.50, mine about $8. I also ordered a standard mango lassi. It was standard.\n\n A large crispy dosa was brought to my friend- with maybe- 2 tablespoons of filling 5 inches long in a 12 inch long dosa. He offered me a taste, as my dish hadn't arrived. \n I took a very tiny bite- as there was almost nothing to bite there. A good 5 minutes or so later my dish arrived. My friends food had been  consumed by then.\n\n   Finally, a bowl of dark green spinach appeared. It had obviously been sitting in a warming tray for hours. And we ate at around 8PM. When one would presume a dinner crowd would expect somewhat fresh fare.\n   What cheese I could manage to fish out- was compact and hard, and obviously old.\n I often make fresh paneer myself- I managed a vegetarian Indian restaurant some 25 years ago- I know what to expect. I've been cooking Indian food for 25 years. \n  I roast and grind my own blends of curries and garam masalas. \n  It was bitter- and unappetizing. That's what happens when heavily spiced dishes sit on warming trays for hours.\n There was no rice. I reminded the waiter- no rice ever arrived. I also asked if I might have some chutney- or yogurt- \n  Anything to offset the blandness and monotony of a bowl of old spinach- god forbid I should ask for a $3 piece of bread- of course I got nothing.\n The rice, which was supposed to come with the overpriced dinner- never did arrive.\n \n   It was a crappy cheap restaurant-  the food was way overpriced- and the quality was way under par. \n  I left feeling ripped off, and pissed off.\n\n Oh, and still very hungry.
