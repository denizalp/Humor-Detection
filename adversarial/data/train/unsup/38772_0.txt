Decided to try out tc tacos.Not impressed to start the food was a bit pricy for what you get.The tortillas were dry..meat was bland.Definitely not authentic.Also the rice had hard chewy pieces in it. Ive never had Asada that taste so bland before. With all the other Mexican food options near by i would pass on tc taco.  I also read the reviews before I  came in hoping to try their so-called best menudo in town. Guess what? They're not serving menudo on the day i came in? At least that's what I was told by our server.....LAME. come on this is AZ..If you're going to do Mexican food and claim it's Authentic. Then do it right or don't do it at all there's too much competition out here I mean honestly I would rather hit a Filiberto's then TC. And to top it off there was hair in the food
