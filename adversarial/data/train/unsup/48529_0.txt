This is a nice cafe on the ground floor of a former textile factory turned office building.  i can't speak for the quality of the coffee, as I don't drink coffee, but the food is good, and fairly reasonably priced.  In addition to standard deli sandwiches they have several vegetarian sandwich and meal options, as well as a nice variety of desserts.\n\nFree wifi is available upon request, and the cafe has it's own restrooms inside.\n\nThe cafe is only open during normal business hours, Monday to Friday.
