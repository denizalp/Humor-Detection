It's almost impossible to give a 5 star rating to a car dealership, because although this place was miles better than previous places I had visited, it's in their nature to try to pull a fast one on an unsuspecting customer. They are the scorpion, but I refused to be the frog.  \n\nI had sent a few emails back and forth to John Skoko before I arrived. I told him I didn't want any games, just to buy a car. True to his word when we arrived he had the keys to the car we were interested in and we went for a test drive which included the freeway. John was knowledgeable about the vehicle, he knew the features and the specifications. He was patient and engaging.\n\nWhen it came time to talk numbers and play the game, negotiations almost went south with some hidden mystery fees that even the manager  didn't know what they were for. \"Every dealership charges that\", they said, but were silent when I asked exactly what it was. That's the state charging that, not us, they claimed, but quickly contradicted themselves when I asked for the fees to be itemized. After some back and forth they were taken off. I might be from England, but I didn't come over on the last boat.  \n\nOnce we got everything squared away I got the deal that was advertised on the GMC website. That's all I wanted. But I did have to put up a fight. All in all it took four hours from walking in to driving off in a new car. Almost, but not completely painless.
