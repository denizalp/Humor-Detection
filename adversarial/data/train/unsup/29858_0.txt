Recently opened in Mississauga!\n\nThey do have variety of appetizers such as crab croquette, takoyaki, karage and many more (ranging from $6-$12)\n\nAt first glance, menu seems pricey especially with their KATSU (from $14-$20, depending on which kind of katsu).But you'll definitely get full with your meal, especially if you order the katsu with double cheese (mozzarella & cream cheese inside) plus, we had the one with original sauce!! And it was good!!!\n\n\nPlus..... here's a tip: The rice, salad, and miso soup are all refillables!!!!! Definitely worth the bucks!! Also, I suggest that you request for the sauce on the side so your katsu wouldn't get soggy easily.
