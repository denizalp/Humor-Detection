Not much has changed. I asked for a wine recommendation. The first recommendation was the most expensive white by glass on the menu at $18, the second recommendation was the 2nd most expensive wine by glass on the menu at $16 and the 3rd wine recommendation they gave was a \"discontinued\" wine, not on the menu, but higher priced then all the other wines besides the first 2 they recommended on the menu at $15 a glass. I tried the most expensive, because I have the money- it wasn't worth it though. I've had far superior wines at a number of paces for far less. \n\nWhat I dislike the most about this place is first, the bartenders will always recommend the most expensive wine on the menu, 2nd I was shocked that the staff (more than one of them) actually asked me what I did for a living without having any other sort of casual conversation... yes, I'm a decent looking lady that looks young for my age and I can afford your ridiculous recommendations... none of your business what I do. How rude. Of course, I tried to explain, but it was over their heads. \n\nAnyhow, a 56 year old man sat beside me and at one point navigated my hand to feel his biceps and pecks... it was actually impressive, but um... yeah- no comment.
