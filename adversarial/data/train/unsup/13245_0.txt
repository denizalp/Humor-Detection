With all these glowing reviews, we finally hauled our bootays over to the other side of town to try it.  Boy, were we satisfied!\n\n-Apple Lychee Soda - way too sweet for my taste.  however, for those sweet drink lovers, this had plenty of lychee flavor.\n\n-Truffle Parmesan Fries - Didn't care much for the sundried tomato aioli on the side, but these truffle fries are the best I've had outside of a gourmet restaurant.  They stayed crispy and salty with just enough of the truffle parm aroma and taste.\n\n-Garlic Salt & Pepper French Fries - I didn't enjoy this as much.  I've had really bomb diggity salt & pepper flavor at other Asian restaurants on various other accompaniments.  So in comparison,it could have used more flavor blast.\n\n-Kalbi Burger - This was great!  The flavors of a kalbi short rib in a burger patty made it super flavorful and the patty was juicy.  The kimchi inside gave it that extra tangy and spicy kick.  The pickled cucumber panchan on the side was good.\n\n-The Crusty Crab -  I enjoyed the crab cake inside, but I did not enjoy the mango chutney paired with it.  That's probably me just being biased because I generally don't like salty + super sweet together.\n\n-The Lonely Bird - This was actually really enjoyable also.  Chicken and Turkey usually scream \"i'm-too-healthy-don't-eat-me,\" but the Herb Pesto sauce made it moist and flavorful.\n\n-BBQ Bachi Burger 5 oz American Wagyu - This was just a regular burger combination, but what made it stand out was the wonderful bbq flavor char and juicy burger patty.  Bravo, Bachi burger.  Bravo.\nVietnamese Coffee - I quote my friend, \"nasty,\" and she's the queen of drinking Vietnamese coffee\n\nConclusion:  Fun, flavorful and juicy burgers with above average fries.  Tip:  If you can help it, go before lunch time rush because I can see how it can get to be a little touch and go with the service.  We came right before the lunch time rush, so service was decent right up until the lunch time rush started and we were waiting forever for one Vietnamese coffee.
