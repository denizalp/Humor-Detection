Tried to pick up a quick meal on the way from the Railway and have a picnic at the park.  Sadly the honey walnut shrimp was soggy and the shrimp meat was tough and chewy especially at the tail ends.  They served us the brown fried rice (yeck!) instead of white fried rice.  Ate half of it hoping it was just a few bad pieces, nope it just got worse.  Next day I had the bad food stomach botulism hangover.  My girls orange chicken looked like it fresh enough.  Never realized how to appreciate the Las Vegas fast food until I ordered shrimp in a small town where they probably don't like seafood in general or they just can't fathom spending another buck on it.  Still love you Boulder City but fcuk this Panda yo.
