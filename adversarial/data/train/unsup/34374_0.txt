Tried this place a few years ago in the location at Niagara  falls and absolutely loved it. Came back to the one in montreal last night and per usual was amazing. The only problem was i asked for the sauce on the side and my dish came out with the sauce all over, and my dads prime rib was cooked to the wrong temperature. After we got those problems fixed the meal was delicious. Hope they expand to the east coast soon.
