Lemonberry offers self-serve fro-yo.\n\nToppings vary from fresh fruit to cereal to graham crackers and candy bars.  Add what you want and however much of it.  Be sure to sneeze in the sneeze-guard.  Weigh and pay at the end.  \n\nThere's 6 different flavors of fro-yo which I believe change weekly or at least bi-monthly.  \n\nFriendly service offering taste tests of whichever one you desire.  \n\nNew business seems to be doing well, hopefully they can survive over the winter.  Maybe they should offer a Vitamin D boost in their yogurts.  \n\nAlso, Josh Cribbs tweeted that he loves it, so it's gotta be good.  Any chance to run into that fine man, I'll take.
