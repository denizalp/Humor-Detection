No bang for your buck here. The happy hour \"recess time\" is decent. We reviewed the lunch and dinner menu while we waited for our food. Not much price difference from happy hour! Like $1 difference. And this is just bar food. We got the crushed velvet. Their version of a Moscow mule with blueberry and blackberry flavor. We got the Parmesan truffle frites, speck & eggs, crispy naked wings, and crispy ahi tuna tacos. The one thing that was worth it we're the truffle fries and ahi tuna tacos. The food is decent. You can tell that they are trying to bring different flavor and style to their menu. The wings tasted like fried chicken and side note - they don't have ranch. It was worth a try, but honestly, I would not be back.
