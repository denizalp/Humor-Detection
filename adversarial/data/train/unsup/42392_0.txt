So many choices! No matter what you're in the mood for, pepper mill has it. Their menu is huge and has everything from breakfast to turkey dinners. Their drink options are extensive as well. \n\nThe atmosphere is very different from most diners. It's very dark with neon and velvety purple colors. Very cool \n\nIf you go, try the Belgian waffle it's really good. \n\nAlso, their giant fruit platter is amazing. Like ENORMOUS and it comes with a loaf of AMAZING banana bread. You also get like 8 scoops of sherbet. \n\nA must try if you ask me.
