Mexican food usually tastes pretty similar from one restaurant to another to me unless it's really good or bad. Everyone seems to have one thing that sets them apart.  Since this was my first time here, I don't know what that is yet here, but what I can say is their sauces are amazing. Good hot sauce gets 5 start f from me.
