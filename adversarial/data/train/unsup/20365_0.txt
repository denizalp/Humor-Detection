This area has plenty of housing but not many options to choose from for evening cocktails. Luckily a spot like 92nd Street Cafe exists. Now, here's something very important to note: disregard the name \"cafe\" in the title. When I think of a cafe, I think of a quaint spot where I can get a nice coffee, a simple sandwich\/salad and sit for hours while reading a book. But at 92nd Street Cafe, think about this spot more as one where you go to after a couple or to get a couple drinks and waist the day\/night away with bar food and dive drinks. \n\nThe scene here is pretty classic and fun. I walked in and saw a large group of bar goers themed in their best 80s attire. I saw old men who were stumbling around like they'd been drinking since 1989 and I saw normal bar goers just there to kick back and have a few. \n\nIt's divey in here but clean, the staff is friendly and the drinks are good. It's a narrow bar but surprisingly has a decent amount of seating a room. The interior has plenty of activities for the drinkers as well. \n\nI will end this review with a funny observation I made while there and that's the fact that this bar is right next to Sweet Republic. One day the kids are getting ice cream with their folks, the next day they are home from college and discover 92nd Street Cafe next door.
