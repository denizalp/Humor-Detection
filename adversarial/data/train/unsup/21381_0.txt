Im a Ryerson alumni I started visiting Salad King more than 7-8 years ago whenever it was that they first opened their doors at the old location before the building burnt down. I do miss those days. But i can't say that I don't crave SK every so often\n\nHere's what I've learnt though in my many many visits. Their noodles are top notch but very few of the curry dishes are finger lickin' good. I dont venture out much to those. I'm a big hot food fan so the spice scale for me is the best thing anyone can ever come up with! I've hit 15 chillies and oh my.. no words. now I stick to 5 or 7 or if im feeling adventerous 10 .. depending on what I'm getting.\n\nTry their Kari noodles - my personal fav - packed with flavour! \n\nI dont care what anyone has to say - my love for Salad King is never dying *insert heart here*
