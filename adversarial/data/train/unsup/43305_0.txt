I tried both the Bellagio buffet and the Wynn buffet since there were so many mixed reviews for both. I have to say that the Wynn buffet is so much better. My boyfriend and I stood in line at around 2:30pm and stayed until 4pm for the dinner items (which only included some new sushi items, crab legs, and prime rib). The spicy tuna hand roll and salmon poke was probably the best part of the buffet. The dessert was mediocre. The creme brulee tasted like pudding, it was very watered down and had a runny consistency. I did enjoy the peach and strawberry self-serve sorbet though but not much of the other desserts really stood out to me. I wish there was more variety and choices for the buffet, my boyfriend even indicated that he went back several times only to get the same items he had already eaten.
