Everyone knows that length and girth are desired by all women... for their eyelashes, and frankly I am no different. Oh how I long for full, long luscious lashes that make people stop in their tracks and say \"DAMN THAT CHICK HAS SOME AWESOME EYES!\" \n\nWell it seems my prays to baby Jesus have been answered in the form of a $45 Groupon offer for $200 worth of lashed. My first impression of this place was \"Why don't they have a coat rack damn it?\" I am a self professed nomad and carting around more stuff than a Parkdale hoarder and it seemed as though they didn't have any place for my coat, umbrella and bags.\n\nI met Colleen my \"Lash Technician\" and she was a pro. Other technicians were asking her for advise and she would give them very detailed instructions. The conversation was light and varied from what is your favourite mascara to what is a good way to dump a boy.That being said the procedure took just under an hour and didn't hurt one bit. Colleen said I have lots of lashes and that she would add a few extra at no extra charge to make sure it was even. \n\nIn the end I got 75 lashed per eye and loved them. They lasted about two full weeks with a few lashes lasting three weeks. The only thing stopping me from giving them 5 stars is the price. My lashed would have cost well over $200 which I guess is about $15 a day. As a student I can't get used to this level of vanity but for a special occasion it is a good idea. \n\nAs previously mentioned their \"Bon Voyage Package\" might be a better bang for your buck: \n-Full leg, bikini, eyebrow wax\n-Mani\/Pedi\n-55 lash set\n-Smoothie\n\nTip... don't put mascara on before your appointment. This seems like common sense to me but apparently my technician said there are many who do it anyways.
