Live nearby and tried them for happy hour and was very pleasantly surprised. We had heard mixed reviews before so weren't too sure. Anyway we all liked the items we ordered, especially the beef brisket sliders!  Our server, Erica, was great and took time to explain the menu. Will definitely go back.
