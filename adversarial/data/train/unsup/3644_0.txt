Let me make this very very clear:\n\nThis is the BEST food you will ever have in your life.\n\nOk, now that we have that established...let me take some time to convince you as to why.\n\nThe Pineapple upside down pancakes are so good that every other pancake for the rest of your life will be dry and tasteless in comparison. Unless of course you can convince the chef to make you coffee and donut pancakes. Also FREAKING amazing.\n\nThe sandwich I am, three egg scramble, upstream benny (or ANY of the benny's for that matter) are slap yo mama good.\n\nOh and the best part? A Colorado based company!! When I moved from Denver a couple of years ago, I was devestated (no, but really, I was) that I wouldn't get to make my regular weekend stop into Snooze. And lo and behold, they came to Arizona! This is the second location in the valley. The other location is off of 20th and Camelback.\n\nJust a side note, the wait times can be a little long, but I GUARANTEE that every minute is worth it when you take your first bite. Guarantee it.
