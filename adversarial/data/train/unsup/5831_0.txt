The staff here is friendly, and generally offer helpful advice.  The inventory is nothing too exciting-- no interesting vintage instruments; the place is mostly stocked with lower end instruments from the major manufacturers.  On weekends, prepare for the place to be very crowded, with lots of teenage guys plugging guitars into high gain amps and wailing out some metal riffs.  \nI dislike the general vibe of distrust in this store-- which must emanate from management.  For example, when you purchase something (e.g. a guitar pick) the transaction is processed by the person behind the counter, and you then bring your receipt over to a second person behind a GLASS CASE, who inputs something into a computer and stamps the receipt, at which point you return to person 1 to collect your wares and exit the store.  To my knowledge, this is the only shop that processes sales transactions in this way this side of the Iron Curtain.  Everything smaller than a guitar is kept behind a lock and key here, but nevertheless you are obliged to check your bag upon entry.  I bought a piece of gear here that  was not compatible with my guitar, and when I returned it they first insisted I could only have store credit; when they agreed to a refund, they insisted on a $20 restocking fee, though I returned the item packaged exactly as I had taken it. \nLong story short Toronto: this is a mediocre chain store that operates on the assumption that its clientele are thieves.
