Okay. By 1 star, I actually mean 5 stars...If you are legally blind. If you want the sound effects of \"Imagination...*echo*nation....*echo* nation..............\"\nand the strange PBS special pre-show...It might work for you.\nAlso, the corniness of it, outlives itself.\nHonestly, My friend and I began to look at Rick as a guardian angel after staying at the sahara for 4 days (you would too, okay!?). He's everywhere in there. They really got us with their advertising. On our last night we decided we had to go see his creepy face in real life. This poor man revels in himself for about an hour and a half. The audience seemed to enjoy it and so did the children....however, the entertainment for us was watching and then debunking his tricks.\nAfter all \"Dreams become active, which in turn, become dreams...\" It was philosophy 101...Rick said he made his dream come true. I still can't bare to actually look at the picture we took with him without the VIP tickets, because it's a little eerie. Those pants were too tight hunny!
