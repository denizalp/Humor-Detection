Made a huge mistake and went to the airport hungry.....damn.  Since I was stuck at the airport, I decided to try a new place.  My flight was out of gate B-12 and there is a 360 Gourmet Burrito joint that I've spotted here in the past....so I went for it.  There was no line and the menu is pretty large with a lot of options.\n\nThe lady working the register kept asking me for my order even after I told her I needed a few minutes to review the menu.  I decided on a Steak Burrito (Steak, Rice, Beans, Cheese, Lettuce, $6.99) and blurted it out......before I could say anything else, a guy handed me a Burrito....wow, that was fast!  I also ordered a bottle of Water ($2.99) and a bag of Jalapeno Chips ($1.99).\n\nThe Burrito was small....about 1\/2 the size of a Chipotle or Q'doba Burrito.....and it is very Bland.  The Beans had no flavor.  Additionally, there's no Salsa on it.....and there is no Salsa Bar.  WTH?  I looked up at the menu and saw that Salsa is $.99 extra.  Dammit, nobody told me this.  Actually, for extra cash you could get Guacomole ($1.25), Sour Cream ($.99), or Salsa ($.99) in your Burrito...or bundle them all together for an additonal $2.99...what?!!  That would have made this tiny Burrito $9.98, no freakin' way!  Glad I didn't see that.\n\nAnyway, it was a complete waste of money and calories.  Save yourself and don't stop here if you're at McCarran Airport.\n\nWill I return?  No!
