Ok...really! This place so pisses me off and i am the Duke. Show some respect...lol\n\nA paying customer asks for one simple request and they screw it up. Not the first time either....like an idiot i give them the benefit of the doubt and they always mess it up. \n\nI go into the place make an order for 10 wings...hot and extra crispy. The bartender repeats my order back to me and specifically says \"extra crispy\" right? She comes back 15 mins later and brings my wings. In hindsight, i should have checked them then and sent it back. But I didn't.\n\nThey were rubbery, nasty wings. What a waste of money...i should have just lit my cash on fire.  \n\nI threw them in the trash. I would not even make my dog eat that crap.
