Just moved to Charlotte and I finally got to see what all f the hype was about. One of my coworkers raged about the \"grandmother\" pizza so I had to try it. And trust me, I was NOT disappointed one bit. The crust is thick but not overwhelming - has a nice crunch to it. Although it was busy, the service was quick and the staff really makes it a family atmosphere! I excited to try some of their other menu items.
