Brand new Target in a convenient (and busy) location. It's much smaller than other Targets, but it has all the necessary toiletries, clothing and market items. There is also a Starbucks at this location! So far, so good! There's a ton of security all throughout the store, which caught me off guard.  Oh and there's lot of self check-out stations! I'm glad they opened one up closer to me! I'll definitely be coming here more often.
