If you are going to name yourself stk you better have a good steak.  I don't even think they use prime beef.  The porterhouse was cooked to perfection but it lacked flavor.   \n\nThe atmoshpere is fun if not a bit too loud on the music.  I'm not a big fan of yelling across the booth to speak with my friends.\n\nThe service is not bad but not good either.  It just sort of is.  They did mess up on our carpaccio.  We ordered 2 and they brought us only one.  Instead of bringing us another they took the one on our table back and brought out another which still is just one carpaccio.  \n\nIf you like star gazing then this is the place for you.  If not go else where for the price you are paying.
