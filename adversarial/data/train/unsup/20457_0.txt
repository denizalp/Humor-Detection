Sage - you will find it tucked neatly and quietly into a corner of Aria, dwarfed by other restaurants, but you need to go here to treat yourself to a delectable meal.\n\nAmbiance - typical of Strip restaurant venue, but with a touch of old-school, almost speak-easy look with large dated paintings on the wall and antique lamp shades next to the tables. All the touches were there, including variations in plating, quirky silverware, and impeccable service by the waiter and busser.\n\nBread service offered a brioche roll and a cheddar-bacon roll, along with an herbed, very creamy, spreadable butter, and accompanying salt (from Australia we were told).\n\n$89 Tasting Menu - of which my friend and I ordered off of, each ordering a different item, and we shared a majority of the food between the two of us.\n\nWagyu Beef Tartare: A serenade of flavors with a cracked egg on top and served with crusty bread. Salty, but savory and an obvious taste of carefully cured meat. \n\nFoie Gras Custard Brûlée: Not exactly my favorite dish of the night. Crackled top offered too much bitterness with only a hint of sweet, paired with also bitter kumquats - this dish just did not have a medley of flavors that would be expected.\n \nGrilled Spanish Octopus: A gorgeously plated dish with served along with Chorizo aioili and a textural surprise - Marcona almonds! All in all a taste festival in your mouth.\n\nMaine Day Boat Scallops: Nothing wrong with large succulent scallops. Bathe them in the sauce that comes in the dish, and add some of the oxtail for best flavor combination. \n\nBacon-Wrapped Iberico Pork Loin: Rich and almost sinfully delightful pork belly is served along with the loin, which Is nothing like you will find outside of an establishment like Sage - or perhaps Spain if you'd like to travel there to have some piggy delightfulness.\n\n48 Hour Beef Belly: Never mind the pork belly, this beef belly was so rich I could barely finish the portion I was given. Not to say it was not good - it was definitely more than good, and combined with the sweet onion and crunchy root vegetables you can't go wrong.\n\nMeyer-Lemon Cheesecake: Probably the least strong of everything I ate. Just too many flavors and too much going on with this dessert to truly enjoy it.\n\nFoie Gras Candy Bar (ordered outside of the tasting menu, but only $20) - Melt in your mouth creamy peanut butter and foie awaits you encased in a chocolate milk bar, topped with a dusting of gold and crunchy popcorn. Once you cut into it, the caramel oozes out and you pretty much die and go to heaven. The end.\n\nJust kidding, we also ended out meal with a selection of teas - I had a pomegranate that was flavorful and refreshing, and lastly we were presented with a \"shot\" of hot chocolate flavored with rosemary - a surisingly lovely combination of flavors. \n\nHighly recommended. Foodie must list. I will be back.
