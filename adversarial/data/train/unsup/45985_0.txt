I just recently bought a dog, and I bring him to this Petsmart for grooming, training, and supplies.\n\nThe training is really affordable and effective.  Willie (the trainer) is great.  He is a results oriented trainer, and guarantees his work.  You pay for the puppy training, but if you feel the puppy has not made progress, Willie will continue to train him until you get the desired results.\n\nThe grooming people here are extremely nice and do a good job for an affordable price.\n\nOverall, this is a very clean and affordable place, with extremely helpful and nice people.  I love going to this Petsmart and would definitely recommend their services.
