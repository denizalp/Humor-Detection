I came here abt two years ago to get my fix of ink. (they are addictive)\nWell, I drew my \"Tat\" out so I figured how hard could it be to copy and paste right... RIGHTTTTT!!!!\n\nwell after Mr. What-Ever-The-Hell-His-Name is finished smoking (why do they have to smoke before work?) and started on my tat... when I looked at the clock go round and round and round (damn near 3 hrs) for a tat that was maybe 3inch by 3inch. \n\nNOTE... MY TATTOO was a Ying\/Yang, with the two lil circles representing 2 clocks in the inside. (can you picture that.. right.. that ain't too hard right.?)\n\ni told buddy he did a \"great job\" tipped the dude a few more bucks because i KNOW he needed it and wld probably be his last. \n\nWELP.. IT WAS.. a friend went (even after I told them where to go for good work) and wanted me to come with... and that person was NOT there anymore. \n\nalso.. i HATE when an \"artist\" tells me what to get.. even when I tell them what I want and where i want it. THE NERVE of another artist to tell me NO, you should get it put ______ instead. GTHOH. \n\nI'M PAYING.. RIGHT?????........................... RIGHTTTT!!!!!!!!!
