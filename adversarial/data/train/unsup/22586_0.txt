Ohhhhhh weeeee!! This place is ALWAYS amazing! From great food to fine entertainment, you can not go wrong eating here. Sit back, relax and enjoy the show here. If you don't enjoy what you eat here, you need to get your tongue checked, your taste buds must have disappeared! I had lobster and filet on the hibachi... oh and the fried rice as well (dont get reg. white rice, entertain your mouf with the fried rice!), it was DAMN good!!! Ok, I gotta go, I'm drooling now!
