It's been about 10 years since I was to the MGM buffet.  There was no line at the register and the person at the register told me to go to the VIP line as I had a comp.\n\nThe layout is different since they renovated some years ago.  I checked everything out first.  After looking around, I got a New York steak piece (not really NY steak) but it was OK and there was still a small amount of pink.  There were also creole shrimp and they were very good, very spicy!  I added a chicken cordon bleu which was not the best of my first selections.  The fried wonton were not good at all and should be avoided.  Rounding out the first plate was some pasta Bolognese which had a surprising amount of heat from ground red pepper.  It was pretty good for a buffet.  Someone wasn't afraid to spice things up a bit.\n\nFor the second plate, I got some sushi roll slices which was standard buffet type.  I got two pieces of spicy Portuguese sausage which was quite good, and I went back for more of the pasta.  I loved the pepper heat of it.\n\nI had some carrot cake and a chocolate pudding for dessert.  These were standard buffet type desserts.  Nothing special but not bad.\n\nThe staff was a little slow with bringing my first iced tea but when she did bring it, she brought two glasses at once which was nice.  \n\nThe buffet is OK but for the price, I'd go to others which have a better selection of items.
