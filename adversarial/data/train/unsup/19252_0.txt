This has grown to be our go-to spot! We have been here a couple dozen times... our favorite place to have a chill drinking night. They have happy hour from midnight to 2AM, where drinks are half off, 50% off pizzas and 5$ appetizers. \n\nAmong everything, this place wouldn't be what it is without the amazing people who work here... Homer is hands down one of the coolest bartenders in life! Same with Kristy & Toya, such nice genuine people. They always greet us so warmly and we always have a good time because of their energy! They seriously make the whole ambience for this place! :)\n\nWe usually opt for a few drinks (I go for sweeter drinks like a zombie, mai tai, etc... He goes for a jameson & ginger) and we will order a pizza. They're all extremely good -- are big fans of the STEAK FAJITA PIZZA, as well as the ROASTED RED PEPPER & ARTICHOKE... oh, and can't forget THE GILROY! All delicious!
