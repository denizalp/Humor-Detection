I loves me some barbecue! This was my first visit to Rudys and it was BOMB! Driving up to this place you can smell the the smokiness and barbecue aroma in the air. \n\nWe arrived just in time before it got busy and the lines long. The menu was simple with just meats and sides. I had the 1\/2lb brisket and a cup of green chile stew. Brisket was tender full of flavor and delicious. The stew was delicious and would definitely have it again. The portions are big and it comes with 4 slices of white bread. So it was very filling and did I mention you can sample an item before buying it?  \n\nThis place is organized with a table full of condiments, large bench tables for plenty of seating and a little store inside. They've also got a huge sink to clean up after your meal. If you're an ice tea or lemonade person, they sell it by the gallon to take home. Awesome!\n\nIf you're a barbecue person or not, give Rudys barbecue a try. You'll be glad you did. Get there early though to beat the dinner rush and avoid the long lines. Oh yea, be sure to pick yourself up some rice crispy treats from there. They're so good. They say they go fast and after trying one, I bought 3 more.
