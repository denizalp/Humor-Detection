Weak drinks and overpriced bar food make this place very low on my radar. However, we went with a group of friends for the Veteran's Day deal where they provided a free meal to veterans. I was meeting someone for lunch later so I only had a drink, everyone else ordered a meal(including the veterans in our group). Here we are 2 days later and every single person, that ate there all have flu symptoms. I feel fine and coincidentally I didn't order anything to eat. Some line cook was probably sick and they wouldn't let him call out since they were busy for the holiday. Way to give some veterans the flu with their free meal Applebee's!
