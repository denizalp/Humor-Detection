My husband and I used to come here on dates in the 70's so decided it would be fun to come here for our anniversary. I had the crab legs and they were so sweet and wonderful. I will never go to Salt Cellar and not order these!!!  My husband had the blackened halibut and was very happy with his meal.   Our server was excellent as well. Highly recommend getting reservations.
