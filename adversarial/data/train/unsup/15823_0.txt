After \"playing\" with the markets for 15-some years and taking numerous courses where you basically take a 3-5 day class and you are released with a notebook and a pat on the back, the one thing that differentiates OTA from the rest and sold me on the concept of trading as a career is COMMUNITY. The fact that OTA offers \"real\" classes in a brick-and-mortar setting, that they had a physical presence on an international level, and you are going to be plugged into a community of traders each and every day, as well as have the opportunity for unlimited retakes anywhere in the world, I knew this was a place I could not only take a class from, but someone I could PARTNER with over the course of my new career.\n\nThe instructors I have taken\/retaken my four classes (so far!) have been top shelf. The support team in the Extended Learning Track and Mastermind Community are as responsive as some of the best support staff anywhere in any industry. The staff at the Charlotte location are friendly and have been very helpful to me anytime I had a question or needed some additional information.\n\nI sympathize on the one hand with some reviewers saying there is a heavy handed sales pitch. This is, of course, a for-profit educational institution, and committing to this type of career is not for the faint of heart (hence the 3-day intro course to let you know what you are getting into). \n\nAdmittedly, this education is not cheap. But it's a heck of a lot cheaper than any other kind of business venture where you will put yourself at risk multiple times over. For $376,000 (and having a personal net worth of at least $450,000) you can buy into a franchise which will grant you the \"privilege\" of changing someone else's oil and MAYBE take home a modest salary. For less than one TENTH of that, you can take the entire SUITE of classes at Online Trading Academy, and make as much money as you want, provided you have the discipline to create a plan, and follow your plan.
