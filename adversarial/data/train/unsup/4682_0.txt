Wow, the most ghetto airline I have ever been on and the folks over at the Phoenix airport (ticketing in particular) need some training in customer service and common sense. \n\nOur group was running a little late and we rushed to ticketing to check our bags in and the man said we missed the cut off to check bags in (which we pre paid for online).  He told us that we have to take all our bags through security and gate check them.  So we rush to security with an elderly man who has a pace maker and a 3 month baby.  In addition to all the extra things we had to do with the elderly and baby to get through security (break down stroller, carseat, scan liquids, pat down elderly man)...we also had to take our huge bags through and get it raided by TSA and not to mention dump out all our toiletries that cost us even more.  A normal airline would send the bags through the next flight and we would just pick our bags up later..but no this airline didn't.  \n\nIn addition to this, the man at the ticketing counter failed to mention that they will charge us an addition $60 PER BAG to gate check even though we already paid $25 per bag already online making each bag $85 to check on the plane, the price of the actual ticket was $95 to put things into perspective.  CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS? \n\nI hope this airline goes out of business with all the nasty ways they can think of charging their customers.  Oh you want a drink on board forget it...they walk up and down the aisles saying \"drink or snack for purchase?\" As a heads up water is free but guess what...they don't tell you unless you ask LoL because they probably don't want to waste their time.  \n\nOne of the airline attendants said \"Just wait until we get on commission\" in this excited ghetto tone.  We normally fly virgin, southwest or alaska airlines and have never received such horrible service.  You really do get what you pay for...in this case unfortunately we had to pay a ridiculous up charge.
