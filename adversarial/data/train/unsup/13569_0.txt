Discovered this Dive, on Hugh Howsers,\"California Gold\", how off he was, location, for starters. This is in a hell hole, the Ghetto of Las Vegas, what a terrible and horrible area, place has bars on the Windows, It's off the corner, small parking lot, you have a walk up window, with Riff Raff all over, and  some Snake Oil Salesman, selling you whatever you need or want, Now the Ice Cream and Custard, wow, Much Too Sweet and Sooo over Rated, More than enough sugar for a life time, although I'm sure 9 out of 10 Dentist Recommend this joint. Hugh Howser, this place is the pits, Literally. Yes this makes CA. Gold shine, this is a Vegas coal hole. Rest in peace Hugh. Maybe  Luv should call it a career and shut down their Window! This is an Ideal Place for people in Search of Diabetes!
