Best buffet I've eaten at so far when I was in Vegas. They have a groupon going right now for 4 ppl either lunch or dinner including drinks for $95. That's a good deal because the buffets can get expensive. They have a variety of cultured food from American, Asian, Mexican, Indian, Italian and their dessert station was promising. Everything you could possibly look for its there. What got me was the already cracked crab legs they have lol. But you can't go wrong Everything they had at this buffet was delicious and flavorful.
