Nice atmosphere. Sit on the patio on a nice day.  Good service. \nThe ahi tuna tacos sounded great, but were so so. \nThe tomato and mozerella salad was good and so was the arugula with apples salad. \nThe free Pesto bread was great.  The sangria was not very good. All in all a nice place, but there is so much choice in that area that I would go elsewhere next time.
