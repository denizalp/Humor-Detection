My Mother-in-law's assets were very compact. it took MHK 10 months so far,caught them in bold lies, and had to do much of the work ourselves to have them execute the trust.  Many friends and family learned hard, informative lessons through this. The very situation we paid to avoid turned into a nightmare at  $10k !\nPlease do yourself a huge favor,  get someone you know and trust. At least do your own research before signing up. \nA very stressful year after losing someone we all love.
