Total clueless employees. Hostess stood there looking at me for en extended period of time with a blank look on her face. \n\nFirst time I went, I ordered their cracklings to start. Asked for extra Cajun seasoning on the side. The waitress informed me they could not give me any because it was a secret recipe and they were afraid someone would steel it and walked off. I asked a second waitress who insisted to take my fresh cracklings back to the kitchen so they could apply their super secret rub. I thought it was kind of odd. None of the waitresses were able to tell me much about their food other than what's written on the menu. \n\nThe second time I came in at 1835 on a Tuesday evening. Asked to be seated in the patio. Hostess rudely told me that he patio was closed since they didn't have a server out there. Just a quick observation there were about 3:1 employees vs. customers in the main dining room. They didn't look short staffed. I'm sure they could have had a waitress walk a few extra feet to the patio on a beautiful Arizona evening. \n\nI guess another open establishment would much rather have my 100 bucks that evening. I hope corporate would give their staff of ditsy girls better training since they are the face of the business to the general public.
