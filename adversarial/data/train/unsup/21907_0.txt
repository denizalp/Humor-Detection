Las Vegas Premium Outlets to the rescue. My sister was invited to a wedding and I decided to come along. My sister needed a few extra items which thankfully she found here at this outdoor mall while. The venue wasn't too far from this location and it made everything very easy as it's near downtown. That is why we chose to go to this shopping mall as oppose to others in the area.\n\nParking wasn't too bad especially since they have a parking garage. We came on a Friday afternoon; the mall wasn't super crowded but there were a good amount of people present. We were able to get in and out of stores in good timing. This was my first time here at this outlet as I usually go to Fashion Show Mall.\n\nAfter all the shopping we spotted Chipotle Mexican Grill and that's where we headed next.\n\nHours\nM-S 9 to 9\nSunday 9 to 8pm
