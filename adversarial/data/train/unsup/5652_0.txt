It's restaurant week and it was the first place I chose. The total came out to ~$50 a person, and I was surely disappointed. The Steakhouse didn't live up to expectations. \n\nHere's their 3 course meal: \n1)Fleming's Salad: Candied walnuts, dried cranberries, tomatoes and croutons. Rating: 3\/5. The salad was decent, but not memorable. I thought the salad was very simple, nothing to rave over. When I think of a good salad, I think of Wildflower's combination salad. This one was just average. \n\n2) Lite Filet Mignon served with Fleming's Potatoes. Rating: 3.5\/5. Maybe it's because I had Sushi Roku's Filet Mignon 4 days prior (which was superb and steak isn't even their speciality). The Filet Mignon was good, I just expected it to be a lot more juicy and tender since it is a steak house afterall. \n\n3) Hazelnut Chocolate Mousse. Rating: 1\/5. The first bite was OK, I had two or three more bites expecting it to be much better but it didn't get better. Our waitress even said it was her favorite... but it was a total disappointment. \n\nOverall, they've got great service and its a classy restaurant. However, I do not think I'll be coming back. All I could think about was this was the most expensive meal I've had in a year and for ~$50 it's a plane ticket from PHX to SAN.
