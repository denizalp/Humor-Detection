With the lunch satchel empty, and in need of cheap calories to get me home after working and running errands, I pulled in to the split drive-thru looking for sustenance.  For the most part..you can find this at any McD's, and this location is no exception.\n\nAs previously stated, I rolled into the split drive-thru and ordered up a jalape√±o burger combo.  Nice enough on the squawk box.  Rolled in and paid.  Bounced to the instructed window and found a very nice worker.  Out I went on to Cheyenne.\n\nThis location is a model of efficiency.  Short was the time between purchase and consumption.  Long were the tears as I hated myself while I devoured the meal heading west into the sunset.
