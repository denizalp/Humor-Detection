I walked through a dimly lit doorway in -13 degree weather to a fully-fledged tiki bar, complete with novelty drinks, awesome music, and a really fun vibe.\n\nThis place was a great escape after a long work day and definitely one to remember. The drinks are all fantastic and not too overpowering. Bring your buds!\n\nTLDR: Order the Tiki Puka Puka. You won't regret it.
