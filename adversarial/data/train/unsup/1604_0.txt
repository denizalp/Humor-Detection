on my second night in the city of saints i looked up \"best dive bars montreal\" on google.  i know that most people who post recommendations for dive bars aren't writing about dingy, smelly places.  by \"dive\" they mean \"non-pretentious\".  in fact, that's how i explained it to the friendly bartender\/part-owner when she asked how i'd heard of snack 'n blues.  i enjoyed several fine pints of a beer which I can't remember the name of.  I think it was called [something] rouge.  there were a few shots of jameson somewhere in the middle.  the people were all friendly and the atmosphere was relaxed.  i would say \"chilled out\", but that's too clich√© and two decades old, even though it was, indeed, a very chilled out place.  they suggested i come back for the sunday live band karaoke, but you know how things go when you're a lonely tourist: you say, \"sure, i'll think about it,\" and then move on.  there's no reason not to go to this place.  plus they have free snacks.
