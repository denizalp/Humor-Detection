I just had the absolute worst experience at this place. After getting some expensive pants fixed with them, I brought them home only to find they had cross stitched the pockets making them no longer wearable. After taking them back, the owner told me all he could do was send them back. I found that unacceptable, he then responded he could have the stitches removed and I could have the holes. I responded letting him know he lost a customer for being so rude, he choose to call me some horrible cuss words as I walked out. I have been going there for a year now and the lady in the front was great, I never knew there was a such a horrible person running the place. I regret stepping foot in there.
