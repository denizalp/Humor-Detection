Sometimes when I have really good sushi I forget what REALLY TRULY ABSOLUTELY THE MOST AMAZINGLY FREAKEN  PHENOMENAL sushi tastes like. Then, I go to Nobu and get schooled on the magic of their fish. It took me many years to actually try sushi and though my mom may disown me for actually saying this but I might actually consider this for my last meal on earth over her chicken mole. That's saying a lot coming from a beaner like me.\n\nDamn, my mouth waters and my palms sweat just thinking about the yellowtaill sashimi with jalapeno and the rock shrimp in the spicy sauce. These withdrawls are worse that crack...
