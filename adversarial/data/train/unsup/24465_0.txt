Got my 15k mile service done here, and was told up front on the phone what services that entailed and for how much, and the payment at the end reflected exactly that.  I requested a complimentary interior\/exterior clean and wash, but they didn't have the staff to do it, so knocked 10% off the service bill instead.  Only gripe was that it took about an hour and a half.. but for peace of mind on your car running smoothly, that's nothing!  Will be bringing my car back here for future oil changes and services check-ups.
