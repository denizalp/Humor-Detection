Probably the worst Chicago dog I've ever had. I could have broken windows with the buns. They were harder than bricks. They do use Vienna but man they were bad. You can see the pic. I had to remove most of the buns from the two dogs so I wouldn't break my teeth. I guess when people that have never been to Chicago try to make Chicago dogs this is what happens. \n\nThe pizza here is pretty good. Especially for Fountain Hills. But I would highly recommend not trying the dogs. Better off driving 12 miles to Portillos.
