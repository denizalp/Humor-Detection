I've been on Yelp for a couple of years, but this is one of the few times I've felt strongly enough to write a review. \n\nWishing I could give the proverbial zero stars.\n\nMy girlfriend's and my experience with this office was literally the worst experience either one of us have ever had with a medical practice.\nMy girlfriend doesn't have insurance, so we paid the the office visit fee of $268 out of pocket.\n\nI will keep it short.\n\nThe doctor walked into the examination room, looked at her chart for about 15 seconds and said, \"I'm an orthopedic surgeon, I don't treat this. Why are you here?\"\nWe told him that the emergency room doctor had referred us.\nHe said, \"ER doctors are like going to QuikTrip, hehe.\" Arrogantly scoffing and shaking his head like we were idiots or something. \nWe aren't medical professionals, we trust what actual doctors tell us. Is that wrong?\n\nHe then said we need to see another type of specialist, which was clearly a wrong suggestion if he had read any of her chart with care.\n\nThen it was just, \"Sorry, bye.\"\n\nI went to the lady I had paid at the beginning of the visit and told her, \"I just spent $268 for a doctor to tell us he's the wrong kind of doctor for this. He saw us for about a minute and a half. Can I please get my money back?\"\n\nOf course she had to check with her manager, who, of course, didn't have the authority to do anything at all. So we are out $268 for basically sitting in their DMV-like waiting room for half the afternoon and looking at a doctor for 90 seconds.\nThe lack of empathy was astounding.\nMy girlfriend is still in pain and I'm out $268.\nCore Institute is all about revenue, not patient care.
