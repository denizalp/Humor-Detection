I had heard a lot about Cabana Pool Bar before going and was stoked to finally go for a friends birthday! I went on a saturday and the weather was sick (although there was chance of shower, it wasn't raining yet, not even cloudy). Cover was $20 which was reasonable but then there was an extra $20 fee for the pool, which compared to their tues-friday (no cover and $15 pool entrance fee) is not worth it. \n\nThe place had a beautiful view and very nicely decorated. It was pretty empty for a saturday but maybe cause there was chances of rain. The staff was mostly hot girls haha, but weren't all that friendly. We ordered a hookah, which was huge and for only $35. \n \nOverall, their attempt at making a miami style pool bar in Toronto was pretty good! It wasn't as great as I thought it was going to be, but I had a good time. I think everyone craving a vacation in hot miami or vegas should try this place. They should definitely get a hot tub too!
