Ever since our UYE Taco Trek in February, I've been planning to come back for one of their seafood cocktails.  Last night, I left the main group of Yelp folks on the Trek #2 and I came here for my seafood cocktail.\n\nI was going to get the mixed seafood, octopus, oysters, and shrimp but I had a language problem last night with the nice senora at the register.  I ended up with a shrimp only cocktail but it was everything I wanted!\n\nI got their small size which is called medium for some reason.  There is no small!  The preparer takes a good sized mug and she puts two and a half ice cream scoops of medium sized shrimp in the mug.  Then she adds some pico, an avocado diced in small pieces and fills the entire mug with a tangy tomato sauce.  The pico is fresh cubed tomato, celery, and onions.\n\nWith this beautiful mug, you get a basket of chips with a half lime for your cocktail.  Also, the required hot sauce, in this case, Tapatio is put on the pick up counter next to the mug and the chips.  OK, you never have to twist my arm when it comes to hot sauce.\n\nI ate the cocktail in what could have been record time.  What wonderful flavors!  Now I know what I'll do when I get the urge again.  There's another Los Tacos on West Sahara, much closer to me.  I'll go there and get the mixed seafood, large this time, and I'll make a stop somewhere else, El Pollo Loco perhaps, for my gringa wife.\n\nSylvia and Nelson, the cocktail was as good as you promised it would be!  Gracias, amigos!
