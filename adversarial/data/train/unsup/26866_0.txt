Got married here on 9\/13\/15.  The staff, starting with the limo driver, the office staff, minister, photographer, were all great.  Helpful and courteous.\n\nThe two stars is because I felt very misled by the online and in-person information regarding video and photography.  When I originally booked the package on the phone, I asked for the \"additional\" web posting of the video for the ceremony.  I received the invoice a few days before my wedding, noticed it wasn't on there, and thought, no problem, I'll have it added when I get there, even though I should have been told that when I booked the package to begin with.  I get there, and am told that no, in order to get the web posting, I have to purchase the DVD of the ceremony for $100, and THEN I'll be able to add the $30 for the video to be uploaded online.  I think, well never mind then, I'll just use Periscope, and am then told, nope, no video or pictures in the chapel.  So I'm stuck.  We pay the $100 - they very kindly waive the $30 for the web post.  Now I'm looking at my photos.  I want to order the photo CD of all my photos for $160 and skip the 7 photo prints that are included in my package.  I call, and am told, nope, the photo CD is $200, the price written on my order form is a lower price as an incentive for me to purchase it on the spot. I press the issue, then am told that if I mail in the order form, MAYBE they'll honor the WRITTEN price - pending the photographer's verification of the price given to me.
