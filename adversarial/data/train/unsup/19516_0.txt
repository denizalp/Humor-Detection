They seem to have a weird system going at their panini counter during weekday lunch hours. Here's how it works :\n\n1. Stand there and make eye contact with the people at the burger\/stir fry counter. \n2. They will completely ignore you. \n3. Stand there for awhile longer. \n4. Continue to be ignored. \n5. Start considering the cold sandwiches in the reach in cooler in front of the panini case. \n6.  Continue to be ignored. \n7.  Realize that those sandwiches have been sitting there all day. \n8.  Continue to be ignored. \n9.  Start thinking about the self serve sushi at the next counter. \n10.  Give up and take some sushi and go join your friends who opted for the salad bar and are now most of the way through their lunches.\n\nI'm not sure what the story is... Maybe the paninis are just for display.   I've tried to ask the other employees I find in the store but, while I get lots of apologies, every time I go there, it's the same story.  It seems an odd way to do business for an organization that considers itself to be a high end service store. As it is now, we often choose to go to Panera ... and I LOATH Panera.  But I can't justify spending half my lunch hour just waiting to be noticed so I can buy my food.
