Went in looking for a chandelier for our freshly remodeled kitchen. Not knowing what we were looking for, or what would look best in the new space. They were patient and worked with us on the style of our kitchen and made suggestions that were all very helpful! We eventually decided on one and are loving the decision we made. No matter how picky my wife and I were, they were kind and truly understood our needs and wants for our kitchen. We will surely be back!
