Taste -WONDERFUL\nIt was my second time going to Backthorne for lunch and loved the food. I'm not sure why there are bad reviews on the food but we thought it was excellent. Maybe they switched cooks since last year. I ordered the grilled vegetable sandwich with goat cheese and my mother got the butternut squash soup and a chicken salad sandwich. What I like about Blackthorne is that they put a nice twist on their food. The chicken salad had pears and thyme in it which sounds different but was very delicious..I managed to grab a bite. The butternut squash soup had good flavors and my mom wouldn't stop saying how good it was. My grilled veggie sandwich was plentiful with a huge portabella mushroom and other grilled vegetables. The goat cheese and balsamic complimented it well. We both got sweet potato fries with our meal...they were great. Only complaint is that I wish they served it with some honey mustard or something other than ketchup. \n\nPrice - EXCELLENT \nFor lunch, you can get a meal for $10 which includes the meal, a side and a drink. You will pay that at a fast food place or Panera. It's described as an upscale place, which I agree..the atmosphere is very chic. But, you can't beat the price for what you get. \n\nOverall, I'll be going back.
