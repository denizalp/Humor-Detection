Came in today to treat my son on his Bday to a good breakfast. Having been to the the other VI in Surprise yesterday for Father's Day, I had a 20% off coupon to use on this visit. \n\nToday is Monday, arrived around 10:30, place was not crazy busy as I suspected and was sat right away. \n\nThe host\/cashier was very friendly upon walking in. His name was Zachary. He asked me booth or table, which I appreciate, as I prefer a booth. \n\nOur server came over within 10 mins of being seated, ordered our drinks. She came back within a timely manner, and then we placed our order. I had the VIB breakfast: 2 eggs over easy, hash browns, 2 turkey sausages, and French toast. Son had the double cheese bacon burger\/ fries. \n\nAs we were waiting for our food, I was looking around since this being my 1st time at this location and glad I did.   Right across from us leaned up against a chair was a broom\/pan. Like someone was attempting to sweep up, then just left. The floor by the broom was visibly dirty. So I looked under my booth and sure enough it was a frickin mess. ** I posted 2 pics ** Like some family with little ones were just there. My table top and seats were clean, but the surrounding areas were a fail. Not very attractive especially when this is a place to eat. \n\nFood came out in a decent time frame, it was what we ordered. Mine was delicious and cooked perfect, unlike the one in Surprise where it came out dry as this AZ heat. Son couldn't even finish his burger ( this says a lot for a 17 year old). He did say the fries were great. Our server came back a few times to check on us as well as refill drinks. I didn't get her name, but her customer service was on par. \n\nOverall, the food was good, the customer service was good, our area was dirty. I'm sure it was just overlooked. So yeah, I'd give it another chance.
