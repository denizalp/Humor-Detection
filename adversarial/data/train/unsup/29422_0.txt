A few years ago I went to Vegas Voice for some throat issues. I met with Linda who owns the practice. After going a couple of times I saw no improvements. They make you do these ridiculous exercises that a 2 year old can do. Go figure they read all these exercises out of a book. Very unprofessional. They tell you to blow bubbles through a straw and say words that start with the letter, \"M\".  And then after this charge you a ridiculous amount of money They say insurance may cover it, but the one office lady doesn't know what she is doing when she  submits the bill. Therefore, you get a big bill and wonder that, you are getting charged so much for this nonsense. The practice is a joke. The therapy is ridiculous and doesn't work. I say beware of the ridiculous therapy that Vegas Voice conducts. Its amazing that they have a license to practice this stuff!. I'm telling you stay home and blow bubbles through your own straw for therapy and say words like MAN and MOM to get you through the day so you do not have to be subjected to this ridiculous sort of therapy and better yet find another therapist that doesn't have to read out of a book to explain or describe your next exercise. You would think someone that has done this for a while wouldn't have to open a book in front of you to tell you what to do. BEWARE!!! Need I say anymore. Its amazing that they are still in business.....
