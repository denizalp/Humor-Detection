Personally, I believe couples would fight a lot less if there were more buffets in the world. This place offered us plenty of options to choose from which was perfect for us because we really weren't in the mood for anything in specific. We headed over to Planet Hollywood to purchase tickets for a burlesque show and had some time to kill before the show so we decided to grab dinner. I found the buffet to be spacious and the spread of the stations were well organized. Honestly speaking, for the price you pay for an all you can eat and you can drink buffet, I was not expecting the quality of anything to be out of this world. The buffet had its hits and misses but overall, we enjoyed our experience.\n\nAt first, it did take my server a while to refill my champagne glass even though every time she came to the table she would ask my boyfriend if he wanted another beer when he had barely even touched this. After the second refills she caught on to the fact that I was the drinker out of the two and she continuously kept my glass full.\n\nWhat I Recommend:\n\n- Crab Stuffed Sole: Absolutely loved these! The fish was cooked to perfection and the stuffing was full of flavor. Definitely couldn't have just one!\n\n -Pesto Penne: While I normally stay away from pasta at most restaurants, I decided to give this one a try and it was delicious without being too heavy.\n\n-Pork Buns: Fluffy buns and tender pork, need I say more?\n\n-Meatballs: I didn't have high expectations for these because most meatballs I've tried in restaurants turn out to be bland and dry. These meatballs were moist and seasoned well.\n\n-Crab Legs: Chilled or steamed, these are awesome!\n\n-Cannoli Cupcakes: These were divine! I'm not the biggest fan of sweets but these were great. The cannoli was perfect! \n\nI feel that overall for the price you do get your money's worth if you drink enough.
