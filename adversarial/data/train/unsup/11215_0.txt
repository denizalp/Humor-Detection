My name is Siobh√°n and I am a bacon-obsessed former vegan.\n\nHad to fly into town for a quick business trip and I booked my AirBnB specifically because it was next door to Rashers. Came for breakfast and mid-order caught the \"substitutions encouraged\" so I requested the apple chutney aged cheddar grilled cheese be prepared with a fried egg on that sucker. Within a few bites the raging hangover I was white-knuckling through disappeared and my suspicions were confirmed: Bacon is magic.
