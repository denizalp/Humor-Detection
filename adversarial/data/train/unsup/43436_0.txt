I had the most wonderful experience at Chili's on Sunday. My faith in humanity was taken to a new level. \n\nI drove around trying to find a place to eat passed up quite a few, finally settling on Chili's even though I had to drive a little distance to get there. \n\nLong story short, the food was great, my server Marissa was excellent and the manager made sure everything was ok. \n\nWhen it came time to pay all I had was a old debit card that I thought I lost the previous week, a Home Depot, Walmart and JC Penney charge. I had accidentally torn up my credit card thinking it was my old debit card. \n\nI was so upset, I talked to the manager\nMichael told him my situation and he was so understanding. I offered to go home and get money to pay, he would have no part of that. He said not to worry lunch was on him. \n\nAll I can say is Chili's I am eternally grateful because this experience could surely had had a different ending. \n\nThank you!!
