Rudy is the man! I called looking for a reservation for a large party, which I know is a challenge in Old Town, and he was super helpful. He was able to get my group booked and all squared away. He was easy to work with, super nice, and we were so excited for our day! We had the best time. The team is awesome, great drinks, good food, awesome prices. Thanks Rudy and Whiskey Row!
