Nice atmosphere, very casual and laid back. However, service was extremely slow and there really is only 3 things on the menu for vegetarians. Our noodles were not  flavorful at all.\n\nOne thing I would REALLY LIKE TO POINT OUT: we were waiting by the cashier area to get a table and I could see into the kitchen and the woman sorting through the noodles was NOT wearing gloves!! She was just opening packets of noodles, taking them out with her bare hands and separating handfuls of them as if to measure how much goes in each plate...you be the judge.
