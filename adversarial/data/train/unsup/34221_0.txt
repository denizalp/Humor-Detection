I went at 7 am on a Sun (east coast jet lag) and there was no line. (Club goers had already cut out I guess?) got the slut and a cold brew. Counter staff were friendly & efficient.\n\nThe slut is fine but I wouldn't get it again. It was well executed - runny egg, smooth potato pur√©e - but the flavors are overall very mild. I'd hoped for a more flavorful yolk-y taste, as one gets from farm fresh eggs. So, it's fine, glad I tried it but not again. And very glad I didn't wait in a long line to try it.
