I finally found a place for Filipino food that's close to the house.  They're a new restaurant and already they're operating well..I'm a fan!\n\nManila service: It took about 10 minutes to get my #1 combo (chicken bbq sticks) after ordering. All the staff I came across were so friendly and gave a great vibe.  Happy eating time at Manila BBQ.\n\nManila cuisine:  My chicken bbq sticks were very tasty.  The sauce was savory and it paired well with the red rice and potato salad.  The combo meals are served in a Styrofoam container with a lid which makes it convenient to bring food home. The cashier area has lined with lots of yummy Filipino dessert delicacies already wrapped to go for you.  I see what you did there, excellent. =)\n\nManila ambiance: A casual open dining area that's very clean with mobile tables in case you need to push them together for a larger group.  The posted menu showcases the combos and prices clearly to make ordering easy.  \n\nIf you're familiar with Teriyaki madness, this is the flavorful Filipino version of that for me.  The food is tasty, they pack it ready to go (I'm always on the go) and their price point is similar if not cheaper than Panda Express.  The Filipino desserts offered is icing on the cake.  I'm looking forward to trying more combo dishes but that's another Yelp tale. Enjoy! =)
