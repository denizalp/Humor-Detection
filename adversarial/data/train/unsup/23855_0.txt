There are a couple of things about this dog park that I really like.  The shade, and that it's large and hilly so my dog really gets a workout.  Me too if I decide to walk the perimeter as he's running around.\n\nThere are several things I really don't like about this park.  There are a lot of inattentive owners here.  While they may be nice people, many of them are talking to each other, or studying, or staring at their phones and not watching their dog(s).  Every time I've been here there are dog bombs all over the place.  I rarely see anyone pick up after their dog.  After all, it's more important to brag about the grandkids, blab away about the latest gaming system, play Trivia Crack on your phone, or get some light reading in.  \n\nThat small dog\/agility area in the middle usually has a gaggle of people around the picnic table, yammering away, totally ignoring their dogs.  And if a dog outside the fence gets close to it, many of the small yappers rush the fence, barking like the insane beings they are.  Ridiculous and annoying.  However, it is mildly entertaining to get a load of the 7-pounders dressed up for the occasion.  Really?   A little dress on your dog?  Man, I'm too much of a farm girl.  I would never do that foolishness to my dog.  But, it is interesting to watch.  \n\nAnd I don't like the street parking.  \n\nOverall, my dog has a good time, and as soon as our other puppy is through his shots I'll probably bring him here too, especially as it heats up around here.  There is plentiful shade and they can get a good amount of exercise in.  Just watch where you step and brace yourself for the cacophony of little yappers who haven't stopped barking since they hit the ground.  I much prefer Paseo Vista's dog park, owners, and dogs, but it has very little shade.
