My first experience here was ALOHOMORA!!!! - I had a blast.\n\n1. First star because I'm a serious HP fan and the ambience in this place is lovely, decorations are spot on.\n\n2. Second star because I did not have to stand in line and I was seated right away and got a great table, service was friendly and quick.\n\n3. Third star because the cocktails I ordered were perfectly made. I personally recommend the Cafe Moscow if you like creamy, sweet cocktails.\n\n4. Fourth star because I could drink 1000 of their Better Beers - try it if you find yourself at The Lockhart and wanna try something HarryPotter-y.\n\n5. Fifth star because I tried one of their appetizers and it was SO GOOD, or at least the smoked salmon croquettes were - the food was the surprise of the evening.\n\nWant to come back to try more food and drink more Better Beer :)
