Books, books and more books. Just when you think you've reached the end, no, wait, there's another corner to turn and more shelves of books.\n\nThe store-wide sale is over, but they have a good deal on children's books. Bummer, because I'm reading scifi these days. So the two hardcovers that I bought (I really have to limit my purchases!) were $16. That's probably a bit much.\n\nFantastic selection and as well organized as it can be in such a tightly packed space. I knew that some of these authors were prolific, but dang! An entire bookcase for some of these folks!
