I don't know how this place has so many stars, because the two times I have been it has been highly unsatisfactory. I counted and we had 5+ people check our table. This leaves plenty of room for confusion, meal and bill errors and just pure frustration. I feel that my tip is being pooled and distributed. Sorry but that is not how it should work. I would like one server for my table for the entirety of my meal. For $9 I was brought a quiche that was flavorless and the size of my iPhone 4. I'm serious, the height and everything. The side was fruit meaning 3 pieces of melon 1 strawberry and pineapple. Kind of lame. Typically in November fruit is not the preferred choice of a side item. The bill was wrong just like it was wrong the time before. Then you have to flag down one of the 6 people you have encountered then ten minutes later maybe it will be correct. Sorry Toast Davidson I am NOT impressed.
