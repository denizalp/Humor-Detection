As far as we are concerned this is the best Animal Clinic in the US\nEach and every Dr. is fabulous and thorough.  They answer each and every question and truly have the animals best interest at heart.  \nTheir staff is second to none, naturally we have a favorite because she was the first vet tech that we met.  She and the Dr were the reason we came back the second time but each and every staff member there is great and we will never go anywhere else.\nThe office is clean the staff friendly and the Dr.\"s so knowledgeable and able to explain everything to us in terms we understand.  We can not say enough about Dr Alber, Dr Freeman, Dr Sunderman, and Heather as well as the entire Prestige Family. We recommend them to everyone we know!
