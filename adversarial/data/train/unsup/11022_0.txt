The prime rib looked so good from the Yelpers photos.  I told myself that I got to try it, but what a disappointment. I ordered my prime rib medium rare. When my dish came, it looked medium rare which with pink color in the center and I was so excited, but it was very tough. \n\nMy husband's chicken fajita was a little bit dry but tasty. \n\nLove the dark chocolate cake. It was very rich and moist. We couldn't stop digging in. I got to take one home. \n\nOverall, the food was OK, but the service was very good.
