As a vegan cafe, it's a five star. As a cat cafe, it's a two star.\n\nThe cafe is lovely and the menu is varied and appetizing. But there was a lack of cats when I visited. It was sad, they were all hiding. \nThe waiter we had was very boorish. He didn't seem to care at all that I was here with my boyfriend. They could have been a 3 star even with the lack of cats but the waiter really ruined the experience. \n\nWhile I was there this group of High schoolers were making so much noise in the cafe, it was obnoxious. \n\nI'll probably give this place another chance, but just because I think they had a bad business day when I went.
