Good: Drinks.\n\nBad: Service, Food, atmosphere.\n\nNot impressed at all. On a Sunday night, the service was agonizingly slow. We got waters when we sat down, but the waitress didn't come back for another 20 minutes to take our orders. \"Oh hey, I didn't want to interrupt your conversation, it looked like you were having a good time.\" Really? Maybe we were animatedly conversing about how hard it is to get a server's attention. We ordered some cocktails and food to share.\n\nThe drinks were very well mixed; between the three of us, we had the Natt Spil daquiri, the Creole Napoleon, and some other drink that had an interesting name but NO DESCRIPTION. Seriously, how are people supposed to order something to drink when they have no idea what is in it? What's in the Kingston Tingle? Rum with a dash of syphilis? Normal bars have descriptions of their drinks; I know you want to be a special snowflake but making it inconvenient to order drinks via slow service + no description doesn't really entice people to come back. \n\nThe food we ordered took quite a while to come out, probably due to the fact that there was only one guy working the open kitchen. The shu mai was a sad travesty of what it is supposed to be. The dumpling skin was rubbery and tough, like it had been steamed too long; the sauce was a brown, gloopy mess. The filling was a lump of mystery meat. (Here's a thought, maybe you could put some more effort into describing what is on your menu! *GASP*)\n\nThe spring rolls we ordered were a) stuffed with literally the most flavorless things you could find (shredded iceberg lettuce, shredded cabbage, what appeared to be clover, tofu, and some other crap) and loosely wrapped with a sheet of rubber. Just kidding, it was rice paper that hadn't been soaked long enough. The spring rolls were ensconced on a bed of shredded lettuce and cabbage and drowned with a sweet chili sauce diluted with rice vinegar. The spring rolls were quite possibly the worst I have ever seen. Not only were they so loosely wrapped they flopped around like a limp d*ck, they had absolutely no taste and no redeeming qualities. The three cup chicken dish should be renamed \"Chicken Stir Fry That Bears No Resemblance To The Actual Three Cup Chicken Dish.\" It literally tasted like chicken stir fry you can get at the Memorial Union (except there you would save like $5 and be able to hear your friends talk, and not walk into tables because it's so  dark.) Here is a link to a great recipe for three cup chicken [http:\/\/rasamalaysia.com\/three-cups-chicken-recipe\/]; even if you are the worst cook and f*ck it up completely, it will probably still taste better than Natt Spil's offering.\n\nLastly, let's talk about the atmosphere that the pretentious hipsters that opened this place are going for. Madison Magazine described it as \"[evocative of] a Taiwanese beer hall\" (and for those of you who need a geography refresher, Taiwan is that tiny island off the coast of China), but I would describe it as \"hipster steampunk opium den.\" Seriously, there is literally a giant a** picture of a person smoking a pipe in the back room. Let's move on to their business model: no phone, no sign, cash only, terrible menu layout, dim lighting, a weird name which means absolutely nothing to most people (apparently Natt Spil = Norweigian for 'night play'),  slow service, and really, terrible food. Your menu is deliberately a \"hodgepodge\" of \"pan-global comfort food,\" but maybe you should limit yourself. Stick to what you know, and what you know apparently is NOT Asian food.
