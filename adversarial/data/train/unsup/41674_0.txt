I'm puzzled by all the rave reviews of this zoo. Most of the enclosures seemed very small and bare. In my opinion, the zoo would be better with fewer animals that had better habitats and living conditions. I think that some people appreciate the zoo because it's a fun free outing for their kids, at the expense of the animals' well being. \n\nThe zoo did appear clean, and it's great that it's free for the whole community to enjoy. However, I would never return--I'd rather pay and go somewhere that offers more space for the animals. \n\nI went on a warm spring day and the zoo was super crowded, mostly with families of very young kids--strollers everywhere!
