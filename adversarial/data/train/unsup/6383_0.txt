I know there are some die-hard Dr. Natura fans out there... and I was hoping to join their ranks... but sadly, I just was not impressed.\n\nMaybe the fact that I've done cleanses before (i.e. I was not dealing with decades of build up) was a factor.... but either way, I saw minimal results.\n\nI read all the testimonials and a couple independent reviews outside of Dr. Natura's site... and I paid the $300+ dollars for the 3 month cleanse and detox... followed it for all 90 days.... drank water til my body wanted to grow gills.... and still, the most I can say is that it did make me a BIT more regular. There was no alien poop (if you've seen the pictures on the site, you know what I'm referring to) or anything of the like. Basically, I just had to empty the bowels and especially the bladder a bit more often. Oh, and it also makes your poop a lot stinkier - which may or may not mean it's working? Or maybe that's just from the fiber? Not sure...\n\nI cannot stand the fiber you take in the morning - nothing masks it. The closest I came to making it bearable was to drink it with OJ and chug as quickly as possible. Otherwise, it definitely made me queasy. In fact, the fiber alone is enough to give me stomach cramps in the morning hours regardless of how it tastes going down. I didn't like the tea either (but then again, I don't like any tea) and keeping track of so many pills was a bit of a hassle. If I was seeing results, I probably wouldn't have minded those things so much. Also - there was barely any weight loss.  I know this isn't a weight loss product, but most testimonials will tell you they lose anything from 15-40 lbs. I lost less than 10 and honestly, I attribute that to drinking so much more water and cutting out the carbonation and caffeine.\n\nNext year's cleanse will be another product, I'm sad to say... but to whoever swears by Dr. Natura, I'm glad it works for you. It just didn't do much for me and seemed like a waste of time and money.
