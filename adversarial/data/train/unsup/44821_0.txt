Well, I've been coming here for a couple of years now... not  very often, sometimes three times a month or more, sometimes I'll skip a month or so before I return.  We met up with some old friends from California the other day, and I thought I would order the macaroni and cheese for my three year old because the sandwiches are all made on artisan bread and a little bit on the tough side for a child.  When the macaroni and cheese arrived, it definitely looked homemade as I can see the oily, curdled cheese mess in front of my three year old.  I told him to eat, and he immediately started crying and saying \"I don't like it! I don't like it!\"  He is NOT a picky eater.  So, I let him \"skip\" this meal because I thought maybe he was distracted by our friends' little daughter.  We boxed up the food to go, and I was going to give it to him later on...but I took a bite of it myself and it was yucky.  I tried to fix it at home...still yucky.  I don't know if I caught it on a \"bad\" day, as we all have bad days, or if it's like that all of the time.  Mac and cheese with Rigatoni noodles???  Oily, crappy slop.  I understand the desire to use real cheese, but every good cook knows that you must use a flour\/milk mixture so your cheese doesn't separate like that.  My review for this particular day is crappy, because I realized that this place is not kid friendly.  And, even the young crowd that comes here will eventually grow up and have kids of their own...and does the main ingredient want to lose their regular clients because there is no desire to create a kid menu?  Simple...get boxed mac n cheese, hot dogs, peanut butter and jelly, chicken noodle soup or even a can of spaghettios!  PARENTS WILL PAY AN INFLATED COST TO KEEP THEIR CHILDREN ENTERTAINED WHILE THEY ENJOY A NICE LUNCH WITH A GLASS OF BEER, OR GLASS OF WINE AND SOME OLD FRIENDS!
