Haven't you always wanted to be in a parade but lacked a float? The float-barrier makes your average parade rather elitist. You are relegated to a spectator even if you know you're true parade material, and this is why I love the Halloween Parade! All you need is a costume, and you too can be IN the parade. You can even win a prize in one of the multiple costume categories. The parade attracts all types from Burning Man veterans to curious tourists to sweet transvestites to families... yes, all types are welcome and all types march proudly! If you're an overachiever, you can create an art car or a float, but it's not necessary. (Although that is on my bucket list: to have an art car or float in the Halloween Parade!)\n\nOf course, if you prefer spectating, that's an option too. There is plenty to look at. This year one of my favorites was an illuminated fishing boat and hooked fish. The fish was built around a scooter, and the scooter was pulling a little trailer with a boat. Ingenious cuteness at its best!\n\nEvery year on Halloween it happens whether it's a Monday or a Saturday, so you never have an excuse to stay at home or be without a costume! It's true local flavor at its best.
