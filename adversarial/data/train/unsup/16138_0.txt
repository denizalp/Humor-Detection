I came here for a late night dinner of fish and chips after hearing so much about his place.  \n\nThe place was packed and pretty noisy due to a U2 cover band playing that evening.  I sat in the dinning area, which was 1 or 2 decibels quieter.  I opted for the fish and chips as well as the home made crisps for an app.\n\nThe homemade crisps were very good.  The sauces that came with them were hit and miss.  The curry was a hit, the other one (whose name escapes me) was a big miss.  As for the entree, the portions were quite generous: three big peices of cod.  The fish were not breaded too heavily and were flaky, but there wasn't too much flavor to them.  Unfortunately, even with the tartar sauce, not too much was added in terms of flavor.  The fries were average, freshly made and absorbing the vinegar nicely.  The cole slaw was nothing special and forgettable.  \n\nService was above average considering there was a bar full of patrons next door and only one waiter.  Overall the tab came out to about $25 with tax and tip, a bit on the steep side for a single diner.  \n\nIf you do come here, you might want to try for one of their specials (eg AYCE fish and chips on Thursdays) to make the price and overall experience a little more palatable.  Also remember this is a pub, so there are drunk people with bad judgement around: when leaving the place I almost got caught up in a brawl between a group of 6 and a group of 2.  Luckily, I escaped any drama by quickly and quietly walking to my car.
