Very disappointing. The funky looking ice cream scooper is kinda cool. When you look in the coolers at all the flavor choices you think to yourself this is going to be good. But then you have a seat and finally try it and....well let's just say it's not all that. My wife didn't like her ice cream and ended up tossing hers out about halfway into it. But the ultimate test was my 4 year old...and he ended up throwing his cone in the trash after about 4 bites. \n\nYMMV: Your mileage may vary but I'm not a fan, my family doesn't like it either and we won't try it again.
