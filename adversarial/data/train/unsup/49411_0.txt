Came in on a Sunday afternoon, it was about a 20 minute wait.. no biggie was able to sit at the bar right across and play a little bit of video poker. When we finally were seated it took about 20 minutes for the waitress to even acknowledge us and take a drink order. She finally made her way over to us (after taking 3 other tables that sat after us order) we went ahead and gave her our drink order as well as our food order. Took about 30 more minutes to get our food, when we finally the fries were cold and looked as if it was something they scraped off the bottom of the fryer. Now the burger was bland and tasteless. Which to me is pretty amazing considering it was a pastrami burger, I mean pastrami, hot mustard, on a garlic bun where could you go wrong... well it seems it was here. Food was terrible, service was worse, if you want a good burger take the trip down to BurGR because this place just doesn't cut it.
