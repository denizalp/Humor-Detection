Can I give 0 stars? Without a doubt the absolute worst Starbucks on the planet, and I've been coming here very regularly for about three years. Our office is close by and it's just convenient to go here to get my morning coffee before heading to work and such.\n\nin particular, this week was the last straw when I, once again, received horrible service, this time, from the Manager, Tiffany, who was a REAL bitch and gave me a crappy attitude about having to get my drink right. It's a shame as I've been going to this Starbucks on a regular basis and have had my Gold card for years... I just won't ever be coming back to this location.  \n\nMy orders are always very simple - Extra Hot Vente Latte, but, they've consistently gotten my orders wrong AT LEAST 20% of the time, and yet, I've always tried to be civil about their utter incompetence. \n\nGo down the street to Dutch Brothers. Better coffee. Much better employees.
