Best buffet I've had on the strip. They have an electronic system that allows you to reserve a spot without having to endlessly wait in line. Smart.\n\nFor $55\/person, it's not the cheapest but it sure is the greatest. Sooo much variety that it takes a minute to soak it all in. Their seafood is incredibly fresh so don't waste stomach space - go straight for the seafood station if you're a 1 plate wonder like me. It's worth it.
