I went to The Pickle Barrel last night for my husbands birthday dinner, it was our first time there. It was five adults and three children, we were seated quickly-no wait at all. All surrounding restaurants had an hour 1\/2 wait..we were seated quickly and the waiter was amazing. He was attentive and knowledgeable. The children loved their food and finished every bit, they got a milkshake on the side. All the adults loved their food, my steak was perfection and my vegetables were great. The chocolate cake they brought my husband was so good and it was a little candle on top, so cute. I loved it and would definitely go back.
