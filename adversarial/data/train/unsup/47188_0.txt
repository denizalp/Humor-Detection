Outstanding stay here last month. We managed to get a great price for our 5 night stay in Toronto. \nThe room was large and plenty of room for myself and my daughter. The bathroom was also large and the usual Hilton standard. \nThe glass elevators ( on the outer side of the building) provide a cool view both day and night and were an unexpected nice surprise to our stay. We over looked Richmond St and the view was amazing of the gardens and city life. \nWhilst we didn't eat in the hotel as we prefer to venture out of hotels, the dining options looked good. \nThe staff were great and very friendly. We ran into the house keeper a couple of times in the hall and she was so polite and friendly and remembered our names.\nThe location of the hotel was excellent being so close to everything and felt safe all times of the day here. There is also a 'real' Starbucks (not just a \"we serve\" !) located off the lobby which was also a bonus to kick start the day!! \nWould definitely recommend staying here and keep an eye out for specials or even become a HH member to get the deals! It paid off for us - only cost us $100 more than a near by 3 star we were going to stay in!!
