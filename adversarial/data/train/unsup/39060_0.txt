Absolutely love this place!\nSo many good things here. Smoothies, fresh pressed juices, coffees, salads, muffins, popsicles, and even a Bloody Mary mix that is vegan and gluten free (I didn't know BM mix had gluten?)\nI have been here several times and have had the Broc this Way smoothie. The Don't go chasing waterfalls, eye of the tiger, shot to the dark, grape balls of fire and the hots stuff baby juices. Today I had the lemon chicpea salad and my friends had parfaits. Every single thing was awesome!!! The service is great, the owner is nice, and I can't wait to try the popsicles and vegan muffins!!! \nThanks for putting healthy and delicious stuff out there!
