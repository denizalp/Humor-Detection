Denny's is Denny's no matter where you are.  They are all about the same.  This one is better than most because it's on Fremont Street!  Not only do you get to eat food you already know & love - you get to watch the crazies walk up & down Fremont.  This Denny's also has a cool photobooth that you can take crazy pictures in.  \n\nBeing in such a touristy place, be prepared to wait a little longer.  It's pretty busy all the time.  The servers are always very nice.  Be nice to them & tip well - you wouldn't want to serve - so don't be an a-hole to your waiters or waitresses.
