We enjoyed an excellent meal in this cozy Quebecois restaurant. The service was friendly, informative, attentive, but not rushed (and very patient with translation). \nWe tried two entrees (appetizers) - a seafood, salmon and corn salsa salad, and a pot of mushrooms and escargot in a rich cheddar sauce - one plat (US entree) - a croustillant (filo pastry) of duck, vegetables and potatoes in another luscious sauce - and a desert sampler of flourless chocolate  cake with pomegranate and Crème brûlée. Everything was delicious. \nWe ordered a la carte, but the 4 course prix fixe looks like a great deal at $49cdn.  The family prides themselves on using all local ingredients. Go here to get a bit off the tourist track and have a good local neighborhood Quebecois restaurant experience. BYOB.
