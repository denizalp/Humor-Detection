I was staying at the Gold Coast for a week and decided, why not get a haircut here before I go back to Cali...Bong gave me a clean haircut, just what I wanted, cleaned me up with a straight blade and treated me to caring service.  He said, \"I look at my clients as the canvas to my art work\", when I got back to my room, showered up and did my hair, I thought to myself, wow! He really did do a great job and I understand what he meant by art work, creating a hairstyle to match the shape of my skull and face.  GO BONG!!!
