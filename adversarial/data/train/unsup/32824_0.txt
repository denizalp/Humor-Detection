A bit outdated but keep in mind that they are going through renovations.\n\nI had a mishap on my 2 days there and when asked to review... I said how I felt.  The manager wanted to make things right and refunded me for 1 night stay.\nIt was much appreciated and I would try it again.\n\nLocated in foodie hub central.
