This was the first time I have ever been disappointed going to Panda Express. I order sweet fire chicken breast, Beijing Beef, and white rice. The amount of meat that I received was ridiculous. There was barely enough to feed my child. I understand, there is only a certain amount they are allowed to give so I was not mad about that. The thing that really made me livid was the fact that my entire order of rice was rock hard. It was like they scraped the bottom of the pot for my rice. I even tried to pick out the good amounts to which I had zero success. White rice is not that difficult to make. I will not be going back.
