I'd just had an awesome dinner, but still ha room for dessert. But the clock was ticking - I needed to get home to my babysitter. This place happened to be on the way and I'd been meaning to give it a try - perfect opportunity!\n\nComing in, I was overwhelmed by the number of options. But the girl behind the counter was friendly and patient. After careful consideration, I opted to do one build-your-own and one cherry cream cheese fritter. \n\nFor the build-your-own I started with a glazed donut, iced it with strawberry icing and covered it with Oreos, mini M&M's and chocolate drizzle. While I really enjoyed the flavor of the icing, over all I thought the toppings were on the skimpy side. \n\nHowever, that cherry fritter hit it out of the park! It was just the awesome, simple goodness of a fritter. And the dallop of cream cheese icing on top was the perfect combo. Honestly, I'll go back just for this!!
