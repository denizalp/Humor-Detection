I don't pretend that I can afford $1200 shoes. (or even the $100+ infant sized Fendi shoes... what the heck - they're going to outgrow that anyway!!!) I was pretty much scared to even look at any of the things you could actually purchase in the store.\n\nThe draw here is the amazingly large interpretation of the Trevi fountain located in the store. It's gigantic and wonderfully Vegas.\n\nOut front, there's an innovative video peephole display of various spliced scenes of Rome. \n\nPlus - they have a great replica of the Mouth of Truth - exactly like the scene in \"Roman Holiday\" with Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck.\n\nLuckily the salesman didn't mind us gawking at all of these cool things in his store. He even gave a little inside scoop of the Rome influenced decor and he helped us take some photos in front of the fountain.
