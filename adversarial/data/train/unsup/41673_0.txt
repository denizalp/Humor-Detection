This place reminds me so much of places I would find down in Redondo Beach CA. Its a kitchy cool surfer\/beach lifestyle atmosphere along with a great selection of food at reasonable prices. \n\nWhat impressed me the most was the huge choice of fillings for their burritos, tacos and such.  Also if you are looking for healthier fare, there are several choices on the menu that will not bust your diet. I have been there twice and both times it has been pleasant, with my food arriving fairly quickly.\n\n In addition, they have a great selection of Ice Tea to drink and provide huge water cups when you don't want to order a drink.
