The best Chinese food ever!\nI took off one star for 2 reasons:\n1) The mall location does not make for a very cozy or intimate setting\n2) The lady at the counter is pretty obnoxious ....no smiles...only glares....rude at times....but i guess that's just a part of eating Chinese food!\n\nIn short, definitely go here for the food....not the service!
