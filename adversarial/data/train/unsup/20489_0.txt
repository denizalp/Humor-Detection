Gen is the perfect Korean BBQ spot for newbies (new to Korean food) because they offer a vast amount of traditional and unique beef cuts, and appetizers besides banchan. \n\nMeat: They have a lot of different beef cuts and pork! LIKE A LOT PLUS SEAFOOD. Some of their items include: brisket, beef tongue, different types of marinated premium beef and pork, pork loin, shrimp, chicken, beef chunk flap, calamari, pork belly, and prime steak (top sirloin). My favorites are the beef brisket, beef tongue (trust me, it may seem weird but the texture is just a little chewier and doesn't get dry even if you accidentally over cook it), and prime steak. All my meats were juicy red and never frozen (places like Tofu Hut will give you the beef tongue with icicles on there).\n\nBanchan: DISAPPOINTING. It really sucks here and they only have 4 items; cucumber kimchi, cabbage kimchi, a mashed potato-like item, and daikon. They don't have any of the  traditional items like soybean sprouts or pan-fried breaded fish. I guess their appetizers make up for it... They have a handful of items like spicy rice cake, jap chae, garlic chicken, edamame, etc. (No more seaweed salad starting July 2016). I recommend ordering rice paper, it's an off menu item and goes great with your meat (think of it as the tortilla to your beef\/pork). \n\nService: It depends. Sometimes their service can be amazing, even on a busy day, but generally they seem understaffed and take forever to get food out. \n\nOverall: I am satisfied and can't complain because they do offer a lot. Lunch is $14.95 a person, and dinner is $19.95 (which is cheaper than a lot of places like Hwaro for example). I wish the maroon ice creams were included but they aren't sadly. It's $3.95 each (mango, strawberry, vanilla, and green tea).
