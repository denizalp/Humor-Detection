What a hidden little joy this place is. We had driven past it a few times and thought it looked interesting, so on a recent date night when we were deciding where to go we thought we would give Eatt a try. French food isn't usually my thing - usually overpriced, and too much butter used all over the place, but this place was different! We have been Vegan for a few years now and there was plenty of great choices on the menu that were very yummy. We will definitely be coming back here sometime soon.
