Yes, my 3 year old spilled salsa not once not twice but 3 times. Our sever happily cleaned it up all 3 times. \n\nProbably only 1 or 2 salsas that are mild enough for kids. Ours enjoyed the cliantro one and the Pico de gallo. She tried a few others but immediately downed water and her face turned a little red. She may have grown a little hair on her chest. Our favorite salsas were the peanut and guacamole. \n\nI had the street tacos. Carne Asada taco was on point. Ranking the 3 I had\n1. Carne Asada\n2. Al Pastor\n3. Chicken\n\nWish I could tell you about the rice but the girl ate it all, so if she ate it I'm sure you will enjoy it too. \n\nNext time I need multiple margaritas. Happy hour, anyone?!?!
