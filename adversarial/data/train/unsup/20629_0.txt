My sister and I were looking for a place for a lunch date and decided at this location for a great lunch. We got there right st opening so the place was pretty empty. We were helped right away. Service was great and everyone smiling. I ordered a chicken salad with guacamole, sour cream, pico, and some salsa. My sister got a veggie salad. Both were so good. I could hardly eat all of mine because it was so filling. Everything was so fresh and we both left happy. Nothing like god food and good conversation to make a great day.
