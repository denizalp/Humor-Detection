We were quite happy with our vet and did not feel we would find one near as good after he passed away. This clinic has great and courteous people from receptionist to techs to the doctors. I can't believe the time they took with us to get to know our dogs. The only thing we've been a bit upset about is the long recovery from anesthesia after teeth cleaning, far longer than with our prior vet. That said, we have already recommended this clinic to our friends!
