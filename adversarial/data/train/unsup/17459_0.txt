The Slo-wich has fantastic bread, the tri-tip is tender and flavorful. I'm also a big fan of the sauce. I'll ask for more on the side next visit. It was tasty, but I couldn't help wishing there was more to it... like cheese or caramelized onions. Still a winner. Interested to see how this place grows.
