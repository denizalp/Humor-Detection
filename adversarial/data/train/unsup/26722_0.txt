My wife and I had a wonderful dining experience last night at Gaetano's Restorante.  The owner came over and greeted us.  The staff were very nice and attentive to our every need.  And our entree's were wonderful.  I had the Cioppino and my wife had the Risotto. Both were real taste treats and enough to take home for another meal.
