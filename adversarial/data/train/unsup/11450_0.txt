Sandbar gives us North Scottsdalers another chance at a casual bar on our side of town!  Located near Scottsdale Road and Shea, Sandbar has a pretty convenient location and is usually a fun spot to go out dancing and drinking.  The DJ is either hit or miss; sometimes he plays awesome music and everyone's on the dance floor and other times the dance floor is completely empty because the music ain't so great. \nI've always wondered if anyone has become so intoxicated while at Sandbar that they have fallen into the little pond outside. Unfortunately, I have never seen this happen.\nBut I have woken up in the morning with a Sandbar server schedule in my pocket with no recollection as to why.\nMy friend was dancing so crazy one night on one of the platforms, that when she jumped off, she sprained her ankle. \nSee? Sandbar's a really good time.\nOh and if you get hungry, there's a little hot dog cart out front, so you can eat a wiener, drink and be merry.
