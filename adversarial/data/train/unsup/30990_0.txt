I was here with my family for my birthday. The music was at the right volume and the place looked clean. I ordered a few pieces of nigiri. The fish was so fresh I actually moaned. Amazing. I also ordered the spicy tune roll and the California roll. It was very spicy but super fresh. My husband had tempura shrimp,  sweet and sour tempura chicken and some beef. It was fresh and very delicious.  I have always loved the open kitchen concept and this was great.\n\nThen they brought out an amazing red velvet cake gor my birthday equipped with singing\n\nThe only downside I had was the woman's rest room had no toilet paper or soap. Kinda gross but I alerted the server and it was resolved.  The men's apparently was clean and up kept. We will definitely be returning.
