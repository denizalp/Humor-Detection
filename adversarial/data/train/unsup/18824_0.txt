when you come here, don't think if you want it. follow these steps:\n\n1. grab it\n2. buy it\n***don't overthink it (like i did)\n\nsadly, i didn't buy anything here because i liked too many products and i couldn't narrow down my choices.... and my baby was very fussy. \n\neverything was 40% off and i didn't have time to figure out which handbag that i \"needed\".\n\nlet it be known... i'm now scouring through the internet to find similar deals or AT LEAST similar prints. unfortunately, i can't find either. there was this one particular gorgeous print that i can't find anywhere (my local Macys) or even on the lesportsac.com website. \n\ni'm depressed.
