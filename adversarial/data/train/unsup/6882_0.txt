I didn't realize that patrons can cook at their tables until I sat down!!! Rut roh--not good for my hair!! This is fine if I wasn't going out afterwards...but I got all dressed up and was stressed the whole time about smelling like smoke, bbq, etc.  That put a kink in the experience for me, but I got through it with the help of a few rounds of cocktails:)!  My food was delicious and the service was fantastic!!!  My only complaint was the ventilation and wasting an hour getting ready.  It was good, but I'm thinking twice before going again.
