When you need an alternative to Starbucks, look no further.  The drinks come hot or cold in various flavors.  My favorite has to be the Dutch Mocha which uses Dutch Chocolate Blend Milk.  If you like coconut you might go for a Cocomo. For macadamia nuts lovers, you might want an Annihilator.  Whoa, so extreme! \n\nThey also offer fruit smoothies, frozen drinks, italian soda, and teas.  I've yet to try.  You can either drive-up or walk to the window when ordering.  The building is easy to spot from the street--a little Dutch-style home if you would.  If you stay and drink, they only have an outside patio.  Workers will get you pumped with your awesome drink with their contagious energy and personality.  \n\nIf they ask you if you ever had Dutch Bros, just say NO.  They will hook you up with an almost-completed punch card that will get you a free drink the next time you visit.  Quit thinking about it, go get some! ;-)
