Rolled the dice one day and stopped in for lunch - payed off, big time.\n\nThey have great Vietnamese soups and vermicelli noodle bowls.  Family run place - nice people.  The owner has a cook book he co-authored on display at the front too - I'd like to try my hand at some soup one day.\n\nThe chocolate lava cake is most excellent.
