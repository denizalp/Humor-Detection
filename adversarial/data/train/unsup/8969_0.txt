Flash back to me being 19... what do I know. I figure they were on TV they must be good right? WRONG. They spend no time with you. No consults. You want the Constitution tattooed in a 3 inch square? Done! They wont bother telling you it wont be legible and will be a tiny blob in a month. You just tell them what you want and they do it. My tattoo (now that I know better) will be a giant black blob in a few years. I got a Batman related tattoo there is no detail left in Batman's face, you can't see what the logo on his chest is, and the little girl is just a blob.\n\nI was told if I wanted the batman logo added to the tattoo I had to get them a printed picture, they couldn't look at it off of a phone or find one for me with their computers. I had to go use the computers at the Palms that cost per minute to use and pay to print out a Batman logo. Really? It ended up costing me $15 to go print them a picture. And I should have questioned there skill right their if they had to trace an old school Batman logo.\n\nThe tattoo cost me $800 and they threw me to whoever was free. Not, \"Oh so and so would be best at this style here is when they are available!\" Nope. Mr. Who the hell ever did it. It scarred badly because I was told to ENCOURAGE IT TO DRY OUT! And to ONLY PUT LOTION ON IT ONCE A DAY! I thought that was such odd advice since I already had a couple tattoos and when I woke up after 2 days with tattoo stuck to my pajamas I did some research and found out what horrible advice I was given. Now I am stuck with a tattoo I will have to touch up every few years until they invent a laser in 30 years that will magically zap it off instantly.
