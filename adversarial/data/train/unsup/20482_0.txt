When visiting Phoenix we were so excited to find some unique place that locals call their own and all arrows were pointing to Durant's. So we went! When we pulled up, I was not sure if it was a shady front for the ol' Mob gentlemen of Phoenix or really a dry-cleaner\/strip club - being adventuresome we continued in! Seemed though we walked through the wrong end of the restaurant because there was a fairly well dressed man that I believe to be the Maitre'd questioned us immediately with an Adam's Family type tone........Do you have reservations? Apparently for over 65 years tradition you enter from the kitchen, I would have never known. There was no one in the restaurant at this point but a cute lil ol couple sitting in the back with dim candles lit - I started to feel a lil Doris Day'ish, so we continued. We were seated, in the \"only\" available seat for the evening. The seating was uncomfortable with a tiny table for two which sided to the typical red velvet half moon booths that were against every wall. I honesty expected a Sopranos star at this point to come in and tell us what the special was. When we were offered the menus we about fainted. A salad, which was not included in your meal was $15.00 and simple 8oz steak with fries no-less was $40.00.....also a nice touch the friendly reminders on every page of the menu, that there is no cell phone use allowed at this restaurant At this point, this when my lover's eyes met mine and we ran like hell. We just knew this place was not for our pocket book nor the experience we were searching for on that particular night. Maybe we will meet Durant's again one night.............
