Every year to boost your kids into the American winter holiday spirit this is the place to kickstart the season!  Usually there are lines to buy your tickets and the prices include a few price tiers.  When you walk inside you are attacked with bright colors and lights and characters roaming.  The staff here are cheery enough to put Disneyland trainee academy to shame.  With soo many displays of yuletide festivity I could almost just barf.  Yet somehow when you see the kids faces and how much glee is simply bustling all over it strangely assimilates even the most jaded parent into a inner-childlike mood.  The train ride is a mandatory ticket purchase, if you are going the cheapo general admission ticket route.  Yet I strongly urge you to just go all out on your kids here and spring for the extra cash & get unlimited ride passes.  It goes to charity, anywhoo. You cheapo.  There is a super cool 3D funhouse that always brings me back to my raver days, lol.  There are the big fun slides and an excellent Carousel.  Get the hot cocoa and roasted chestnuts for tradition and it's colder in Vegas by now.  Take a picture on a premium Santa's lap.  There are so many other things happening here but I would have to say that you should find out for yourself.  If there ever was an amusement park that brought American X-mas to life it is the Magical Forest!
