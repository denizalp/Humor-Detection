I was disappointed with the taste of the food. I would have preferred a \"hole in the wall\" restaurant with great food. The steak and potatoes was very salty. It tasted like straight salt. Even the broccoli was salty which really would have been fine steamed with no seasoning. I did not think it was worth the cost of the meal. Fern is a very cute restaurant with a great atmosphere. I love that they can customize your food based on whether you're vegan or vegetarian. Maybe I just chose the wrong dish but that was hypertension on a plate.
