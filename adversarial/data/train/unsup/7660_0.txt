Yummy!  \nA perfect little dish of kimchees started lunch, its tangyness making sure that I was ready for a hearty meal.\n\nThen I had the Pork Tonkatsu - a dish of beautifully deep-fried breaded pork served alongside a mound of rice and shredded cabbage. I'm not one to wax poetic about cabbage but I'll make an exception this time. I mixed the crispy veg and its sauce with the rice and discovered a whole new taste experience! The toothsome cabbage blended with sticky rice was a perfect counterpoint to the crunchiness of the pork and the satisfying squish of the mozzarella cheese that oozed unctuously from between the slices. OMG So good!\n\nFor desert... No room for desert. I couldn't even finish my plate so at $12 my meal was value for money.\n\nThe small resto is cozy, and was jam packed with millennials. The buzz of conversations was comfortable and gave the place a friendly homey vibe.\nIf you dine alone on a -25C day, make sure to grab a spot at the mirrored bar. The radiator below keeps your feet and belly warm. The food makes your belly a happy one.\n\nService was friendly, prompt and efficient. Can't ask for more than that!
