Service was slow and bad.\nGin martini ordered with a twist came without the twist. \nThe appetizer platter with ca. 7 different appetizers came with 2 spoons to serve them. \nThe fried feta cheese rolls tasted oddly sharp - almost like blue cheese. \nThe fish special was sent back by one of our party and our combo order of steak, grilled chicken and chicken Adana got mixed up and we got twice the filet. \nNow I usually wouldn't complain about extra filet but this one tasted like liver. Maybe it was marinated in some odd concoction? \nOn top of that the floor in the ladies room was sticky. \n\nTwo stars because people did seem to enjoy the beer and wine selection.
