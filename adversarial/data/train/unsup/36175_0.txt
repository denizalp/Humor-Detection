Happy hour on Thursday was delightful. We sat outside at a group high top table. Everyone so friendly and happy to be there. Our waitress was so great, no rush, but drinks and food arrived quickly. The atmosphere and people watching was fun, too.\nGreat french fries and sliders. Thanks for a fun night.
