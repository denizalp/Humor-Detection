There's a new Sam's Club in town and it's right by Turf Paradise.  I was there during their grand opening weekend and it was a little frightening.  There were more sample people than I've ever seen before and tons of tons of people trying to get to them.  \nThe club itself was okay. I mean, if you've seen one, you've seen them all I think.  This one did have a sample lady giving out really delicious strawberries but every two minutes she would yell like this, \nSTRAWBERRRRRRRRRIES\nIt was horrible.  And it was like some kind of subliminal trick because no matter what part of Sam's I was in, I'd hear some poor customer walking by and saying 'strawberrrrries' under their breath without even knowing they were doing it. It was funny. \n\nAlso, a friendly old man stopped me and was just chatting away when my eyes drifted to his cart. He was buying a HUGE, economy pack of KY Jelly.  DAMMIT. Those are the things I just don't want to see.
