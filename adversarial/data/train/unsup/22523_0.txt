RACISTS! If you think white people don't experience racism, COME to this El Pollo Loco to see that we do!\n\nLet's get one thing straight. I freakin' love El Pollo Loco. The salad they have is fresh to death and I've eaten at this location, and recommended it many, many times, but never again will I eat at this location. \n\nLast night, 2\/25\/11, my dad, youngest sister and I stopped in so I could get my usual 2 piece chicken meal with 2 salads as the sides with the cilantro dressing. I get this every time, so I know what I want when I go in. \n\nNot a single customer was in the restaurant eating, nor was there a single soul at the cash register. From what I could see, there were 4 Hispanic workers, 2 girls, 2 guys. 2 guys and a girl were to the left of the grill (or, stage right, if you will)  and the guys were just talking. One of the guys, who must have not been on the clock, kept looking over at us, but not saying anything. The other workers, looked over at us, but ignored us. They didn't say anything, didn't come over to ask if we wanted to order, nada. \n\nAfter 5+ minutes of standing there, being ignored, I was getting ticked off. Clearly they knew we were there, but they for d*** sure weren't going to serve us. The guy with his shirt over his shoulder, the one who looked like he was off the clock, walked past and said, \"oh, he'll get your order.\" Both he, and the guy he was talking to and pointed out, then bypassed the registers and went to stand and talk some more, without taking my order, behind the door that is visible in the picture posted here by somebody else. \n\nF- this place. After waiting and waiting and waiting and NOBODY acknowledging us or taking our order, we all walked out and my dad went over to KFC to spend way more money ($20+) than we would have spent here. \n\nI loved this place and preferred to go to this location because they have carbonated water as an option on the drink fountain, but no more. They can f- their racist, white hating, selves. I'm taking my business elsewhere. \n\nIf I were the manager or owner and I saw this (check the security tapes to verify my story, we left at 8:20 PM, fyi) I would fire every single employee that was working the line during that time.
