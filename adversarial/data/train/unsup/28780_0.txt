I visited this restaurant tonight for the first time.  Was looking for something close to Comerica Theater for dinner.  The staff was very attentive and friendly.  The sushi was good, but just \"good\", not what I would refer to as excellent.  I would have preferred it to be colder.  Was a little too warm.  Not the fried rolls, the California Roll and the Spicy Tuna roll.  (These should be cold).  This is only partly why I give three stars.  When we arrived, (just 2 of us), we requested a booth and we were quickly denied and told that they \"hold\" tables for regular customers.  I can understand that, (to some degree), but this restaurant basically \"holds\" all of the more desired tables\/booths for so called \"regular customers\", so we got placed at the very back of the restaurant at a table where I felt somewhat trapped with no room to move behind me.  There were several empty tables where we asked to sit and were denied.  I'm surprised we weren't seated back on the shipping dock.  From where we were seated, I was able to fill my water cup from the ice machine. (Seriously).  So, three stars for the friendly staff, and the service was good, but I wouldn't eat here again unless I was stuck downtown with a serious sushi need.  I would try another place first.  If you do eat here, I would suggest the \"Arizona Roll\".  Very tasty.
