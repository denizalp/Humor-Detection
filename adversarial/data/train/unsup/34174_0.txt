Second time I have been, we arrived for a late lunch on 7\/13\/13.  Place was pretty empty, but the bar area was very loud.  There is no physical separation from the bar and the dining area, so it will alawys be noisey.\n\nThe decor is VERY dark.  It is not a bright place, and you feel more like you are in a dingy pub.  By the time we ordered drinks, 2 other waitresses had come by asking if we had been served yet.  \n\nWhile this restaurant appears to be suffering from really bad service, I saw the worst example of service ever.  A waitress was hitting on a guy, and would sit in his booth for 5 to 10 minutes at a time.  The manager? finally came over to let her know that her other customers were asking for her.\n\nWhich is how I felt about our waiter.  Inattentative, and unconcerned.  There were almost as much staff as customers, but they couldn't check up on us.  I ended up going to the wait station to get napkins and flagged down miscellaneous staff to get us refills.
