A show you watch with your girlfriends.  If you're an adult, but not quite 21 watch Chippendales!!\n\nIt can by corny and choreography can be somewhat lacking, but it's a fun show you'll remember.  Located in the Rio hotel and the theater is located on the 2nd floor.  There is no photography inside the theatre during show time, but you can meet the guys after the show.  \n\nWould it be a show I'd go see again?  Yeah, sure why not?
