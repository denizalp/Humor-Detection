Slightly horrifying.  I think I've seen pictures of my parent's basement having the same chairs in the 70's.  There was a 40 year old woman with short spiky blonde hair singing Karaoke.  \nA beer is a beer though.  \nI got the perogies, I think they were on special.  They were actually really good.  Beware though, the cottage cheese ones have cinnamon in them. Yuck.   \nIt's Brunswick, you can't expect too much more.  I'd probably go there again.
