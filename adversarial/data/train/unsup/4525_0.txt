Driving up we wondered why it had such a bad review...\nWithin minutes it doesn't take long to figure out.  GHETTO.\nSo many lazy staff it's ridiculous.  Yelling at each other, I watched 2 employees barricade the washrooms with a bench (overhead them not wanting to clean it, so just block it!).\nThe parking lot has too many people with nothing, nothing better to do than stand around\/hang out; depressing.  This alongside Kalamazoo is the worst Wal-Mart I've ever seen.  They need qualified individuals to do a CLEAN SWEEP on this place, it's terrible.\nListening to a mother drop F BOMBS on her '5' kids was a real treat, there are some TRULY awful people in Cleveland, Steelyard Wal-Mart would be the place to round up a LARGE portion of them.  THE WORST WAL-MART, ever..?
