Nice and organized,\nEasy to find a specific product compared to the other competition, but I find the variety lacking a bit..\nA lot of items are limited to one or two selections rather than having a wider range of products to choose from.\nThe layout is a little odd too, from the limited parking space, to that dry depressing walk from the lot to the main entrance going through a freezing tunnel!!\n\nThey also need more cashiers, as there are usually two or three only..the express lane is always closed, so if you only have a couple of things, you have no choice but to stand in line behind big full carts waiting for your turn.
