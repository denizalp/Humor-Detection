Mon Ami Gabi is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. While there are tons of places to get a steak, Mon Ami Gabi is definitely at the top-- from the customer service, ambience, and taste. If you're a fan, you MUST try the French Onion Soup! My favorite dinner dish is the Filet Mignon Merlot--amazing! Come at night and you'll get a good view of the Bellagio Fountains..
