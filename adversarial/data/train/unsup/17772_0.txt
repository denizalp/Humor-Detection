I absolutely LOVE this place!!! \n\n\nI rarely give 5 stars however in this case I wish I could give it 10 stars \n\nMy bf surprised me with a 2 night stay here because he knew how bad I wanted to try this place out. \n\nLet me tell you I was in HEAVEN! This place is like no other a hidden jewel, It's boutique and definitely unique! \n\nSo we stayed 2 nights and he got this package that included the room and breakfast and lunch and also unlimited drinks at their lounge. \n\nLet me start by saying when you walk in its dark and you see art EVERYWHERE. ITS GORGEOUS. The staff is super friendly, and will answer any questions you have. \n\nThe rooms are amazing very unique dark colors lots of art kinda goth a little small but I didn't need it to be any bigger it was just the 2 of us. \n\nTheir lounge is awesome great drinks and an amazing DJ super friendly bartenders and again very dark and artsie.This is where we spent most of our time and even met a few cool locals here. \n\nTheir restaurant is delicious for breakfast I ordered the french toast which was breaded in cornflakes and cinnamon mmm mmm good! For dinner I had a Caesar salad and I believe chicken Marsala very tender chicken and the service was very good. \n\nUnfortunately I didn't get a chance to go into there beautiful pool because it was winter but its absolutely gorgeous and ill have to try it out next time. \n\nI have no complaints about this place I had an amazing time by far my favorite hotel in Las Vegas you must try this place out if you like something different and unique!!!
