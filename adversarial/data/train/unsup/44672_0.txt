Im glad i had found this dry cleaner place. Alot of dry cleaning business over charge for dry cleaning each piece of clothes. I usually need my suits, blazers, slacks, ties and the hard to iron and clean shirts. Going to another place i can be paying double even triple. Last time i came i payed about $40 for 15 garments. I like how they will have your dry cleaning the next day. People are very nice. I have no complaints
