I like the clothing lines this store carries but will never go back.   The last tiime I was there my friend and I were treated so rudely it was almost like a parody of terrible shopgirl attitude.  Coincidentally the two of us had just returned from  L.A.  where we had been pleasantly surprised by the warm and helpful staff at the high-end, dare I say trendy, stores we visited like James Perse and Rag and Bone.  So it made the NYLA experience feel even a little more amateurville.  \n\nAs one example, my friend asked if there was a size 8 in some espadrilles and the sales woman pointed at a pile behind a clothing rack and grunted \"there\".   We were so shocked at this bizarre response that we actually laughed out loud.  \n\nTo my regret I bought a top and shoes.  Love\/like the merch but never again.  Too bad about the humans in the store as it's a good location and I'm sure they would have a nice business of returning clientele if they were more pleasant.
