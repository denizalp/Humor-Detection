Was there on Karaoke Saturday recently.  I came to watch people sing and was waiting for a friend to arrive.  IN THE FEW MINUTES,  I sat down the waitress visited me three times, asking me what I wanted. I told her I was waiting for someone and would soon order.  When my friend arrived, I ordered a drink and he a small meal.  DURING OUR time THERE ,  this waitress harrassed us at least 20 times,  asking if we wanted more!! ....I'm not a drinker but if someone was, they would be enibriated after this visit (does TC offer Uber or TAXI for the drunks??)...she would interrupt us watching the singer that was performing...it was beyond irritating and rude.  IT MADE US NERVOUS!!!  TC will never see us again, in your quest to HARRASS and shove stuff down our throat, you lost 4 customers....
