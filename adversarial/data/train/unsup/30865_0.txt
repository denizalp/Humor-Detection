We were one of those suckers who ordered 2 shaved ices for the 3 of us (2 adults and a 1 year old) since the bottom of the menu read \"minimum 1 order per customer). I think they were referring to anything on the menu, like bbt. \n\nAlas, we came here just to try the shaved ice so we didn't mind... But it was definitely too much for the 3 of us. \n\nWe tried the Mango Tango and Frog Prince. Both were great. They both came with vanilla ice cream on top and a side of condensed milk. \n\nA good thing to note was that take out containers are available! The leftovers are sitting in our freezer as we speak.
