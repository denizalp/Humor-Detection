Perfect spot to watch the big game! Service can be hit or miss. Food is slightly above average for bar grub. But, the beer selection and amount of TVs in the bar area just can't be rivaled! \n\nWe prefer sitting in the bar. Stools are first come, first served and even on the busiest nights, we can usually wedge ourselves into a spot within 5-10 minutes of arriving. From any seat in the bar, you can see no less than 10 TVs. Swivel your head just a bit and TV viewage increases to 20. The crowd here is usually fun and lively, too. You can almost always find someone cheering on your team.
