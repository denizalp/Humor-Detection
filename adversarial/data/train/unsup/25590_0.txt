We went here because we got a 2 for 1 reward and thank goodness we didn't have to pay full price because it would not have been worth it.  If you eat crab then it would pay off as they did a nice job with the crab legs and pre splitting them etc. The bbq ribs were ok but cold, the fried chicken had an uncooked flour taste to the coating.  The salad bar lacked topping selections, but was fresh.  They did have a nice cheese and meat section with some cubed cheese and sliced salami.  They desserts were somewhat creative, but some were tasteless.  I guess if you drank the unlimited beer and wine makes up for the cold and poor quality of food.
