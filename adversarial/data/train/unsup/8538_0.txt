I really wanted to like you Pasta Mia since you were recommended to me by fellow yelpers, but you made it so that I will not be returning.  A couple of my girls were coming from Reno for a bachelorette party and I wanted to eat at a place close to the Palms since we were going there afterwards. It took about 25 minutes for the server to come and even take our order. Since we are all girls and we were going to party afterwards we wanted to share our meals. The server said that they would charge us an extra 14.95 just to split our meals for each person that we were splitting with. REALLY!? I think it was just for us to spend more money, so we all ended up getting an entree which was ridiculous. All of us wasn't even close to being finished with our entree by the time we were full. The service was so slow for not even being that busy...it was 9.30 at night before we even got our food. One of my friends was so upset that she wanted to leave before the food even came out. I was so disappointed that it made me sad that I let my friends down from out of town. The food was very delicious, but the service that came along with it makes me not want to return here ever. SIGH! Hopefully everyone else will have a better experience than 5 of us pretty hungry gals.
