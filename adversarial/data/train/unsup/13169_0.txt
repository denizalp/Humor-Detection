GET IT?!?  IT'S A EUPHEMISM!!!!!!  *PINK*. TACO. teeeheeeee BRILLIANT!!\n\nAs subtle as a fart in a rose garden, there lies Pink Taco on Camelback in Scottsdale, the epitome of style (errr... can you call it \"style\"?) over substance.\n\nThe food here is certainly nothing to write home about.   It's all pretty generic, middle-of-the road mass produced tasting Americanized Mexican food with overpriced theme-y drinks. Oh, and guess what?  It's not cheap.  You're paying for the ambiance (which does include attractive waitresses.... hello, if you're reading this).   \n\nAll in all, save your cash or go to Los Sombreros.   No hotties in tank tops, but much better food, unless you like overpriced mehworthy vaginal-themed AmeriMex.
