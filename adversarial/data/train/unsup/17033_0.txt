This location has very friendly and patient staff and every time I take Shatzy with me they always make sure to give her her treat. They are really fast so even if the line is long don't worry you won't be waiting long. I have not gone inside this location, but the outside and patio area is very well kept so I imagine the inside would be the same. My go to if I am craving a chai tea or a refresher which are perfect for the summer.
