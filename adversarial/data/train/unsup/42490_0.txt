My friends and I met up here on a Wednesday. We were meeting at 8 and they wouldn't let us get a table until the entire party arrived. By the time everyone arrived there was a waiting list. Boo. I really wish they took reservations.\n\nThey have an incredible selection of games and you can spend hours on end (which is why I guess there is always a wait). The $5 cover buys you endless hours of entertainment. The night we went, there was only one game guru so we didn't get much help from him considering the place was packed. It was also pretty hard to get a hold of our waiter - but he was definitely super friendly to deal with.\n\nThe food\/drink was ok. I had the strawberry cheesecake milkshake which was pretty good, other than the chunks of fruit and cream cheese (ew) that weren't properly blended. My friends got the \"colossal\" brownie which was actually huge but more of a chocolate cake than a brownie, but good otherwise. One of my friends was also disappointed that they no longer carry any gluten-free options. Our waiter informed us that their pastry chef who used to make all the baked goods is no longer working for them.\n\nI recommend this place for a nice evening with a few friends but the food\/service etc are nothing to write home about.
