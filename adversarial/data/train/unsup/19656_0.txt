Please come to Los Angeles!!! \n\nI tried the almond cookie coffee and it was delicious. The almond flavor was not overly sweet or overwhelming. You could actually taste the coffee. The almond taste was nice and mild and both the almond and coffee flavors complemented each other. The coffee beans they used seemed premium and was not burnt. The coffee was just so smooth and I wish I had gotten like 2 or 3 other flavors. I can no longer go to Vegas and only have alcohol, I have to have like multiple cups of coffee also! \n\nAgain, please come to Los Angeles!!
