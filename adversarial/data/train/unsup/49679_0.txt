I gave it two stars only because it's close to where I live! Other than that there's really not much to like about this location because the staff don't greet you or acknowledge you when your in the store. When checking out they have attitudes and are very unprofessional. Today I bought candles and spent a pretty penny and the cashier didn't offer to wrap my candles and put then in three tiny bags that were very heavy and not protected.
