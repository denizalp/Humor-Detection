I think shopping for clothes for baby-to-be has replaced shopping for me! I am full steam ahead in preparing for Baby to make her arrival in April and with that comes stocking the closet full of clothes...and boy can that get pricey! However, I was told that Carter's has amazing sales and pretty decent prices so I stopped in for a visit. I was happy to catch them on a day where everything in the store was 50% so needless to say, I did some serious damage. \n\nI walked away with a closet full of clothes for the first several months of the baby's arrival. The clothes are really cute here and they have a wide variety of styles to choose from. I especially appreciate their onesie department because they sell packs of three onesies so you're getting some bang for your buck. I walked away with plenty of onesies, pants and of course dresses! Besides clothes, they also have socks, hats, mittens, bows, headbands and any other child accessories you need. \n\nI'm happy they have a stand alone store in the Valley and also appreciate that stores like Babies R Us sell their clothes as well!
