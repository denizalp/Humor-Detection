Lovely bar in North Phoenix. I was going to say 'little' but it is actually deceptively enormous, going back a long way inside. Very friendly staff and good atmosphere, but not too many vegetarian options. My friend Sage dragged me over here for dinner, so I had to try it. I now live in the north side of town, so this place is convenient. I ordered the grilled Harvarti sandwich paired with Tomato basil soup. The sandwich was good, but I think the soup was warmed in the microwave because the bowl was too hot. The decor is kinda cool though, colorful lighted tires and bar paraphernalia that I am simply not expert enough to do justice to in my description. Parking is not easy, but if you drink you really shouldn't drive.
