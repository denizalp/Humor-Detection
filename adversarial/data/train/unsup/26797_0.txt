Great nail shop in the Centennial area. I always make an appointment with Eric or Lisa. They are the best! Other  nail techs seem to be okay. I see they have a lot of regulars also. Make sure to call ahead or be prepared to wait because they can get pretty busy on weekends especially since it's sandal season! My mom, sister & I have been coming here for 5+ years and they never disappoint. \n\nEric usually does my gel mani\/pedi & it's great! My gel nails can last up to 3-4 weeks without breaking. Recommend gel over acrylic. Makes your natural nails stronger.
