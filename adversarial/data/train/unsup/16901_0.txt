I never knew there was so much of a debate between Montreal and NYC bagels until I read the travel guide and checked out Yelp.  I guess I am just naive because i did a double take and my jaw dropped at another restaurant when I realized the menu said \"Horse\".  wow, that was a shocker.  But anyway, the whole bagel debate is kinda like the chicago vs nyc pizza thing.  They are just totally different and its a tough comparison.  \n\nFirst of all, staying in downtown, I took the metro and walked about 10 or 15 min to Fairmount.  It was nice to actually see some of the town.  Anyway, the chick at the counter wasn't very friendly.  I said bon jour but then started to speak in english.  I think I pissed her off when I asked for a bagel with butter.  She yelled at me and said \"we don't serve butter with bagels here!\"  so sorry lady.  Montreal does serve lil packets with peanut butter at some places (eggspecations) which i thought was fantastic.  As far as the bagel, it's kinda small and it really reminded me of Panera or Au Bon Pain.  like that very brown sophisticated look with the silly lil package of cream cheese in there.  Maybe im the spoiled american who is happy when they cut the bagel for you...anyway I sat down outside in the rain and bit into the bagel, and WOW! It was really good! like really fn good.  just like what they say, crunchy outside and sweet doughy interior.  The only drawback was I should have ordered 4 or 5 of them because they are on the small side.  They are cheap though (1 CAD).  I didn't want the girl to yell at me again so i went across the street for more lunch at this bangin Cuban\/Chilean cafe, which I will yelp later as soon as i find out the name.\n\nIf you are staying in old town or downtown, i really have to recommend checking out fairmount.  Besides the bagels, it's a nice area to see and then you can walk back down St Denis.
