I went to Fez for Foodies a couple of weeks ago (or did I go to a \"Fez for Foodies UYE\" at Fez...I wasn't clear on how I should specify my attendance...one or the other...you pick:)\nI met up with (and met some for the first time) a whole fubar (Jim W...thanks for the sobriquet...so very apt in its description of us:) of Yelper's, gathered at Fez and happily tucking in to a new dish created by Fez.\nI didn't realize that Fez for Foodies was not just a Yelp event...it was also an event at which you can try a new item that Fez is thinking about adding to the menu, write a comment on it, discuss it with the fine folks who run Fez, discuss it with your fellow diners, take pictures of it, rub it all over yourself (the last is optional..strictly optional, despite what Thomas may tell you...I'm not falling for that twice Thomas:), or whatever else you need to do in order to provide Fez with real feedback so that they can make an informed menu decision:)\nI understand that Fez does this pretty frequently! \nWhat a great idea!\nFez gets to try out dishes that they are thinking of putting on the menu...without actually having to pungle up for reprinting menus, re-pricing items, reordering for the kitchen, etc.!\nIf the new item gets good feedback, I assume it goes on the menu at the right time...if the dish is a clunker, Fez gets a chance to either fix it based on comments or give it the AMF treatment, without having sullied their menu:) \nI walked in and I was greeted warmly by Thomas, fellow Yelper and the genial and hilarious GM of Fez.\nIt was great to see my Yelp pals and meet some new ones, but I really think we need something more than just \"hi\" when we greet each other...we need a lodge greeting of sorts...\"yelp, yelp\" seems obvious...maybe too obvious...we can work on it:)\nThe d√©cor and atmosphere at Fez is downtown sophisticate...the colors and lines made me recall a swank little a bistro in Prague...the whole place has a very \"euro\" feel to it:) Nicely done!\nThere must have been more than 20 of us yelpers but the service could not have been better...I wish I could remember our servers name...I would single him out for lavish praise, but I can't and now we'll never know, nor will he...too bad:)\nOh well...our server told me about the Fez Foodies thingy and that they were serving some sort of steak, so I said \"I'll have a Fez burger, please\".\nI had heard and read about the legendary Fez Burger...now I wanted one for my very own!\nI got my Fez burger with fries (regular fries...I'm just not generally a huge fan of sweet potatoes, except in pie:)...good fries and plenty of 'em!\nBut Oh Baby...that is a good burger!\nIt may not be for everybody (the burger has pear slices, cilantro, lemon garlic aioli, feta cheese and onion rings among other things), but it sure worked for me:)\nAs much as I sometimes like just a good old plain burger, when you go for the gusto (burgerwise) you want gusto explosions! \nFez delivers on the promise of a fully gusto'd hamburger with the Fez burger!\nAnd it's huge...too much for me at dinner, but possibly even better the next day:)\nBTW, I don't know who thought up putting pears on a burger (hey, could it have been a result of the Fez Foodies thing?)...but WOW...good idea!\nThe flavors and the seasoning are so complimentary and the burger is so very well constructed (ciabatta bun...needed because this a juicy little sucker:) that this burger is moving into my Top Five Burgers in the USA! (I won't tell you who I had to kick out...oh alright...it's Taylors Refresher in St. Helena...I understand that they've gotten a little too big for their britches).\nI can't speak to the Fez Foodies dining experiment (people seemed happy) nor, really, any of the other menu items...(I'm sure they are delightful).\nI'm sure I will try some of the other items one day...when I tire of the Fez burger...oh who am I kidding..I just found a great burger...I'm not gonna screw around with anything else!
