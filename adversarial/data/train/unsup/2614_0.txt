Rooms:\nClean new remodeled rooms so no built up mold and stains yet\nBathroom is a bit small but other than that it's fine.\nNice flat screen tv, but could have been raised about 4 inches so the drawers wouldn't block the screen if watching TV from the bed.\n\nCasino: \nNice low limit $5 tables for gamblers on a budget\n3-2 payouts on Blackjack like it should be not the 6-5 payout crap they have everywhere on the strip.\n\nRestaurants:\nOnly have been to the buffet for breakfast and it is a good value at $5.99 (show your BConnected card to get the best price) - Made to order omelettes (worth the price right there)\n\nWill definitely be back again if I get a comped room (even if I have to pay) here as it is a good value all around and not too far off the main Las Vegas Strip.
