Stopped by there this morning when they opened at 10.  \n\nThey have two counters, one for meal type orders and another for the deli (sandwiches). A gentleman was at the meal counter ordering and I walked up to the deli counter.\n\nNo one was working the deli yet so I waited. A few minutes passed, people walked in and out of the kitchen, the other guy was still doing a long order.  I passed the time by checking out my phone.\n\nAnother customer got behind me in the deli line.  He also pulled out his phone after a couple of minutes as well.  We were both just hanging out when he strikes up a conversation.  I was surprised to hear an older guy with a heavy accent quoting a line from Ferris Bueller so I give him props for that.\n\nWe fiinished our chat, the meal line was on to the next customer, workers were coming in and out, stocking shelves, Another person got behind us in the deli line.\n\nBy this point I was getting pretty hungry so I left the restaurant to get something to eat.
