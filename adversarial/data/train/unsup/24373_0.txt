Hey kids! Today's review of Encore Las Vegas is brought to you by the color: RED.\n\nIt's perfectly true and I'm not mistaken when I say -- that Stephen A. Wynn consistently raises the bar with every subsequent property he introduces to the world famous Las Vegas Strip.\n\nLet's take a jog down memory lane to familiarize ourselves with this man's accomplishments in Sin City, shall we?\n\n1989 - Mr. Wynn's The Mirage resort opens.  It's the most expensive hotel and casino project ever built at the time at a cost of $630 million (keep in mind, this was '89).  The Mirage is often considered the grand-daddy of today's Las Vegas, for igniting the building boom trend of themed mega-resorts and jump-starting tourism back into Sin City at a time where Atlantic City was becoming the hot gambling mecca in America. Way to turn the tables back around!\n\n1993 - Steve compliments The Mirage with a similar tropical-themed sister resort right next door: Treasure Island.  Featured the first free strip-front live entertainment show and a unique theme that brought kids and their parents in, during a period when Vegas as a whole was appealing to families.\n\n1998 - Opulence and modern luxury is born on the Vegas strip with the most expensive hotel and casino built (again) at the time.  Wynn's magnificent $1.6 billion Bellagio resort heralded in a new era of posh and exclusivity to the strip that 11 years later, is still unmatched by a majority of properties in town.\n\n2005 - After selling off his interests and ownership of his previous properties, he takes the money from the sale and sinks it into what Vegas junkies and visitors now know as Wynn Las Vegas.  Taking the ultra-luxury concept of his Bellagio resort and magnifying it two-fold, his $2.7 billion dollar baby is so influential that room rates elsewhere on the strip are priced accordingly to the rates set here.\n\nLate 2008\/TODAY - Ah. Here we are. To the topic at hand.\n\nENCORE.\n\nand the color RED.\n\nNow, I haven't stayed at this hotel as a guest, YET. This is mainly a review of the casino and its public areas, which I've had the delight of enjoying.\n\nThe first thing I noticed when my eyes took in the grandeur of this hotel's casino was how BOLD and DAZZLING the decor it is. The color red (and other 154 color-palette variations of it) is splashed EVERYWHERE. From the detailed butterfly-print carpeting to the lavish wall drapes, from the lighting fixtures to even the outfits worn by some of the resort employees. RED RED RED.\n\nIt's the polar opposite of the typical gorgeous, but rather vanilla casino  that you'd experience at The Palazzo or Bellagio. Though very elegant, Encore's decor is so loud, that you might just want to put on those shades hanging on the front of your shirt.\n\nEncore takes design cues from her sister hotel with unrestrained use of glass EVERYWHERE. This results in natural light filtering into the casino and public areas, which lends to a very \"airy\" and calming environment. A big stark contrast to casinos like at The Mirage, where you feel like you're betting money inside a dark, monstrous cavern.\n\nSuspended intermittently from the low and intimate ceilings in each of the four gambling quadrants are stunning (and extremely expensive) elaborate hand-blown glass murano chandeliers, custom tailored with a unique color --- Wynn \"tulip,\" created specifically for this casino. I toured a well-known hand-blown glass manufacturer and dealer (specialized mostly in chandeliers) on a trip to Venice last December, and a custom chandelier of similar size easily ran over $20,000 A PIECE (a light fixture that costs as much as a brand new car!). There are more than 179 of those floating around in the Encore casino alone. Now do the math. No expenses have been spared here, people.\n\nJust a testament to how much effort they put into the \"show\" of this place, as I strolled through the Encore shopping esplanade, I was taken aback to see a resort employee on a miniature forklift vacuuming the dust off the leaves on one of the indoor palm trees lining the walkway. WTF? That's attention to detail, to the EXTREME.\n\nThe casino floor here isn't very big. It's got more of a boutique vibe to it, where a smaller and more intimate gambling experience was envisioned and executed, as opposed to a massive sprawling casino floor that stretches on for what seems like miles (like @ MGM Grand).\n\nI love new casinos. All of their slots were high-tech and spiffy, with those little LCD screens that displays slot club information and point balances and were a lot more engaging and interesting to play.\n\nCocktail waitresses are extremely friendly, quick to bring your drink, and part you with a smile. Can't say the same about the wenches at The Venetian casino.\n\nIt also doesn't hurt to credit this casino that I won $200 after a few spins at a 5 cent reel machine. :)\n\nHopefully I'll have the opportunity to stay as a guest here in the near future.
