Disgusting .... this is no lobster roll.  It's a huge shit pile of mayonnaise underneath some yes good lobster but this sandwich roll is the MOST OVERPRICED AND DISGUSTING lobster roll I have ever had in my life.  NYC Maine hell I've had a better lobster roll in Florida.  \n\nI mean nobody I know wants a four tablespoon helping of Mayo dropping into their mouth with every bite. God I'm repulsed.  I literally want to throw this sandwich to the uncaring person in the truck slopping his low quality no effort crap to us in Summerlin. \n\nAre you kidding me look people if you've ever had an amazing lobster roll you will be so angered at the crap they give you here. \n\nThe quality of the lobster is great but plain lobster on a roll with a bed of mayo underneath one more time FLAVORLESS DISGUSTING WASTE OF $17 RUN AWAY FROM THIS CRAPPY OVER PRICED TRUCK ! \n\nIf I pay fkn $17 for a lobster roll I want an overfilled sandwich. Not a shitty sandwich that has a tiny amount of lobster and shit ton of mayo. \n\nGod this TRUCK should be banned from Las Vegas ! Period
