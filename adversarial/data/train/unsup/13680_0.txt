After just one visit, I'm officially in love with the 'Ko-Ko.\n\nI've had so much plain chicken breast in the past few months that I wanted to take a pollo break, but the positive reviews on this place were too much to resist.  The b\/f and I met up with our friends for dinner last night and the Yeeps did not lead us astray.  \nWe were greeted by Sandra, the owner, and another friendly employee when we walked in at 7:30pm.  I didn't do my homework like I usually do, so it took me a while to study the menu and re-read Yelp tips. There are so many items that sound delicious.  I was torn between the Hawaiian Hen House and the Grilled Coconut Curry.  I ended up ordering the Grilled Coconut Curry since I haven't had curry or coconut in a long time plus brown rice and the famous Lychee Lemonade.  \nThe food takes a while after you order it, so just be patient because it's worth the wait.  I loved my chicken, very flavorful and the curry was not overpowering; the Craisins gave the dish a nice twist.  I tried my gal pal's Mochiko Crispy Fried Chicken and, OMG!  That chicken was amazing!  I could have eaten her bowl plus mine.  I also got to sample their fries, which had a nice seasoning and weren't greasy. \nThe bottom line is that we will definitely be back.  I want to have an order of the fried chicken all to myself and the Thai Satay Grilled Chicken and Hawaiian Hen House are still on the to-eat list, as well.\nSandra is a lovely lady who checked on us often and told us that her husband created the menu and that he's Filipino.  Boom!  That's why their food is so good. :)  You should try it.\n\n*Hours:  Mon-Sat  11:00am-8:30pm* (they close kinda early so plan accordingly)\n               Sun 11:00am-4:00pm
