This is by far the worst so called turkish food I have had.\n\nThe cooks are not even from Turkey, they are from somewhere in the balkans region.\n\nWe waited for over 45 minutes for our food to arrive; the food  was disgusting, was very old and had been frozen and thawed over and over. I ordered the eggplant kebab and could not even force myself to take the second bite.\n\nI will not go back to this place again. \n\nCheers
