Been going here for years because it has so much to offer whether its dinner, coffee & desert, or late night chow. Above all the ambiance here is one of a kind; stained glass decor by candle light with dark wooden benches, chairs, and tables. It definitely creates a \"mood\". \n\nThree floors of a converted home linked by a narrow stairway gives it a sort've old world charm that's hard to come by this side of the pond. \n\nEveryone I introduce to this place becomes a new regular so what does that tell ya?
