Poliberto's\n43rd & Glendale\nCost: $1\nService: 1 of 5, DISQUALIFIED BECAUSE WE GOT A BURRITO instead of a taco! \nPresentation: 3 of 5\nTaste 1 of 5, \"not that great\" DISQUALIFIED BECAUSE WE GOT A BURRITO! Seriously?\nIn a taste test of 7 local taco shops, you failed to actually give us a taco the first time, and the tester wouldn't even eat the whole thing.
