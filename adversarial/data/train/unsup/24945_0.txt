Well, color me impressed. \n\nI feel like I drove to the end of time to meet a friend, I was concerned about it's\nstrip-mall-y-ness, but at the end of the day, I left fulfilled and felt like I got some decent bang for my buck! In truth it was a little expensive, 11 bucks as compared to the 6 buck buffet near my house in Tucson, but I'm told city comparisons are a yelpeve ;) so omit that editorial if you're thinking about dining. There are PLENTY of vegetarian options, and because I'm always weirded out by buffet meat, I was thrilled to see chick pea and lentil a plenty! I found it odd that the garlic naan was on the buffet but they brought regular plain naan. Sort of wish those were switched. And the salad is totally pass-over-able (a word?) as was dessert. My lunch date loves the mango ice cream, I'm concerned that it's a color that doesn't actually exist normally in this world.
