I haven't even eaten my pizza yet but this place gets five stars. The level of service and general attitude of Isaiah at the front of the pizza line is enough to make me want to come back. It's great to see a place that puts their talent where it matters. He does great with people, has a great personality, and seems to enjoy his job
