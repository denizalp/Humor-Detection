The food can be quite good at the majority of Pei Wei locations. However, this location seems to consistently get our order wrong or simply not listen when we actually place the order. On numerous occasions we have received the wrong size meal (I.e ordered the full size but it has about five pieces of chicken). The overall feeling from some of the staff is they'd rather be anywhere but there and they don't care about the customers or providing good service. It is a disappointment because nearly every other Pei Wei I have been to has great service and everything comes out right.
