Im in between 3\/4 stars. Let me explain why. \n\nThe wait is kind of ridiculous....BC, the bar seats like less than 20 ppl, AND everything is made or order so it takes timeeeeeeeeeee! \n\nWhen we got there Monday AM at 10:20am, there were exactly 6 ppl infront of us, with 7 open seats at the bar (Im just a party of 2). The 7 open seats needed to be cleaned. Im thinking....we're the 7th ppl in line, we should be seated fairly quickly, right?!!\n\nThey surely cleaned the table, like 5min each for the seat, NO JOKE! I was timing. Someone didnt feel like working monday morning.... I get it. =(\nSo, we waited over 30min to get seated. Im still HAPPY bc i hear the wait is like 1 to 2hrs long. We get seated around 11am and the lady is going around taking orders. She was so friendly and chatty with her customers, but hello?!!! can you please take our order and then resume with the morning news?!\n\nStill waiting...to...order. Finally, after her local news, she takes our order. YAY!\n........................................................................................\n1 dozens of Oysters and Pan Roast, please. \nOysters were really fatty and yea, i like them smaller. These oysters were big-if you like big ones, these are your winning plate. \nPan Roast...so, we ordered and it takes abount 20min for the food to cook. It looked amazing when they are making my bowl....but its not for me. Its for other 5 ppl who ordered it, with different spice level. \n\nWe got level 8. Its not that spicy. The pan roast was DELICIOUS; however, i can't eat more than 1\/3 because its so rich and buttery and creamy and fatty. I'm lactose-intolerant and I was prepared for this pain and suffering. As soon as i ate 1\/3 of it, i died.
