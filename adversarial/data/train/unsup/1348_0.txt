Atmosphere was great. Such a beautiful restaurant! Food was pretty terrible. For sure the worst Italian I have ever had. I felt the prices were high so they can try to make the money back that they spent on renovations . When I was asked if I wanted a glass of wine I really felt that the waiter wanted me to spend more money , he didn't genuinely want me to have wine. Maybe I only felt this way because I was the ONLY person in the restaurant so there was awkward silence. Will not return. If this place stays open for 8 more mothers I will be shocked.
