My daughter has been with Dance 101 for the past 3 years.  The owner, Emily, is a wonderful instructor and she runs a well organized program.  Every year in the summer, the students have a performance at Tempe High.  It is amazing to me how she choreographs and teaches 20+ different routines for 200+ kids of various ages, all the while ensuring the kids are having fun and the parents are satisfied with their child's progress.  Hats off to her....I get tired just thinking about it.
