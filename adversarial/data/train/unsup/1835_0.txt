I had high hopes for The Eggery. \n\nNot because I thought it had potential or was even that hungry.\n\nFor me, the notion of an egg-themed restaurant sounded like the result of  insanity. The kind of mad science you see in comic books and Discovery Channel shows about hunting ghosts. \n\nMy brain had conceived this idea of an egg-obsessed madman, ceaselessly forging egg-based delights so that he may share his much-too-specific love of eggs with the world.\n\nUnfortunately for me and my imagination, The Eggery is not insane like Bizarro or Dr. Weird. \n\nNo, it's a \"Kevin Costner movie\" kind of crazy.\n\nThe menus look like they haven't been changed or updated since the 80's. Which would normally be refreshingly retro, except the 80's weren't necessarily a good decade for eggs. Come to think of it, I don't think eggs and time travel are compatible. \n\nThe omelettes look more like accidents than exquisitely prepared dishes. \n\n\"You got chopped up ingredients in my eggs!\"\n\"You got eggs in my chopped up ingredients!\"\n\"...are you thinking what I'm thinking?\"\n\nThe Eggs Benedict looks like it's mocking you. \n\n\"Hahaha, you could've gotten this same dish at Hometown Buffet, and it would've tasted better, too!\"\n\nThe Eggery has no means of separating their pancakes from their competitors so they just make them bigger. \n\nIf you can help it, avoid ordering the sausage.\n\nIn fact, if it's not made of eggs, don't bother. They won't make it right.\n\nYour sausage will be overcooked, your hashbrowns will be burnt, and your coffee will taste like they used the toilet water. And the carafe of coffee they give you is usually only half-filled.\n\nAnd don't bother complaining to the manager. After all, he's probably the genius who assembled this crack team of apathetic, inattentive doppelgangers posing as a wait staff. Dude probably doesn't even know what eggs Benedict is supposed to look like.\n\nFuck this. I'm going to Denny's.
