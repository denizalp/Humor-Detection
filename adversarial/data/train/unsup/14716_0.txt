When C and I were trying to explore Toronto on our own, we saw this place was still open.\n\nWe decided to drop on in and check this place out.\n\nIt was pretty late at night so a lot of the stores were already closed.\n\nWe managed to find this place called L&M - another imported clothing shop but CHEAP!!!!\nThe sales lady name Rain helped us and got C to buy loads of things.  I didn't see too many things that were my style since I don't like to wear stuff that makes me look like a pansy. \n\nThere's a little cafe in here that sells TEA EGGS for .80 cents!  I love Tea Eggs!!!  I know I know...what the hell are Tea Eggs?  They are eggs that are infused with Tea and has a  marbled appearance!\nThey were so addictive!!!!  But beware the lady there is more into gossiping on the phone than attending to her customers!\nIt's cools if you don't want to make rent!
