The service was incredible and the food was good. While the dinner selections were under portioned and over priced everything tasted fine. I sampled the lamb meatballs, beet salad and a variety of their bruschetta. Olive and Ivy makes a delectable apple martini that was strong yet refreshing. Unfortunately I cannot recommend their cactus blossom cocktail, it was too sweet and had the flavor profile of a mikes hard lemonade. \n\nLastly I have to say bravo to the front of the house staff working on the night of my visit. Fox Restaurant Concepts have mastered the art of customer service and for that reason I'll be returning here.  I'll be back again soon and am looking forward to  trying their breakfast menu.
