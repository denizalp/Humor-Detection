This place is ridiculously hard to book!! Bf tried to book the tasting menu for my birthday but the reservations were all sold out within minutes... he had to resort to buying a reservation off of someone on Kijiji! The overall experience was very good... probably the top 3 dining experiences in my life. They are so hyper attentive that they replaced my bf's napkin for him apparently because he dropped it but he didn't even notice he did! They replace your utensils after every course and never fail to scrape every last crumb off your table. The staff are very friendly and polite except for this one male waiter that had condescending vibes. Whatever. \n\nThe washroom was spotless at alllll times. I almost feel like there's someone waiting outside to clean it after every use lol! Everything was delicious until the course with mussels. Now I normally love mussels and would be ecstatic to be served mussels anywhere else. However knowing the amount of money he's paying here for this tasting and that I can get a whole pound of mussels for 7 bucks at whole foods got me pretty disappointed to be having it at Alo! Anyway, I liked George restaurant's tasting menu a lot more. Alo's portions are too small!! By the time I've swallowed my food I've already forgotten what it tasted like but at the same time I realize I've already finished the dish lol does that even make sense.....
