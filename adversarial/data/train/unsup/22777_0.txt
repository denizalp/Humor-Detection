I was really excited to visit this famous Charlotte patisserie not only because everyone was raving about the their delicious tarts, croissants, & eclairs, but also because it's open ALL THE TIME (24hrs\/day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year) and they are welcoming of all kinds of people to hangout, read, study.\n\nFirst off, the good: \n- Salted Caramel Brownie (5 stars): the PERFECT contrast of smooth sweet\/salty caramel atop a thin but dense (and slightly crunchy) chocolate brownie.  You must try this if you love either caramel or brownies!\n- Their creme brûlée was delicious, and the fact that they flambé\/torch it only when ordered so it's warm, fresh, and crispy was a nice touch. \n- Finally, the chocolate eclair and mixed-berry tart were both very decent and I'd happily order them again.\n \nThe only downside is that it was abundantly clear that those long hours really diminished the quality of at least 2 of their items: \n- The croissant: I had already ordered a few items so I wasn't planning to get anything else, but I'm a sucker for a great croissant and the lady at the counter said it was fresh baked that morning, so I happily ordered it expecting a soft, flaky, buttery snack. Unfortunately what I got was hard and dry; honestly, I've had day old croissants taste fresher than this!  I have no doubt that if it were fresh out of the oven it would have been amazing, but someone definitely wasn't keeping track of how old\/dry these were.\n- The sticky-bun (mini cinnamon roll + raisins & extra sugar glaze on top): it also was was disappointingly \"aged\" liked the croissant, and although I've got a notorious sweet tooth, this tasted way too sugary too me.\n\nOverall, I'd definitely come back for their delicious snacks\/desserts that are not too perishable and to try their famous macaroons.  As for the disappointing croissant,  I'd be willing to try it again if I KNEW it was fresh, but otherwise skip it.
