I'm clunking down five stars on this one. First off, for location. Like the chop and wok, it is right next to my house. This allows for easy stumble home. Second off, the band they have is pretty good. They play the hits, and some dwight yoakam. \nI think its about $7 for a jack and coke. Which, isn't too bad. \n\nThe upside - cougars\nThe downside - everybody else is 50+|\n\nThe owner lady - Gwen (?) she is pretty nice, apparently its her son in the band.
