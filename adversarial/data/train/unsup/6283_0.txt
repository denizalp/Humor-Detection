Love Book and Stage because the Cosmo provides FREE concerts\/sets from some of my fave artists.\n\nChill lounge with a stage big enough to see the artist. Very intimate considering it's in a casino.\n\nSaw Mayer Hawthorne there opening week. Tonight imma see Aloe Blacc.\n\nAND ALLLLL FOR FREEEE-ZIESSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
