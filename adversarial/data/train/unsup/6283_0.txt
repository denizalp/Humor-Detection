Heyyyyoooo, LJ Shanghai. There's a reason the stars are so high here. The food is excellent. I dragged my friend here after drooling over all the photos and basically just having a fascination with Shanghainese. I never met a noodle I didn't like!\n\nI love a place that brings you hot tea the minute you walk in. There's not much ambiance here, but its the no-frills dining experience you'd expect on this stretch of Superior. There are a few street spots right outside for free. LJ Shanghai has a small but mighty menu that consists of maybe 10 appetizers, some soups, and noodle dishes all at inexpensive prices (an entree is in the $10 range). We had the cucumbers with garlic (oddly satisfying) and the dumplings as appetizers, which my friend fawned over. The dumplings are an easy win if you're dining with guests and are served nearly immediately. For dinner, I had the pork noodle, which turned out to be soup and came with huge pieces of pork and a hearty portion of noodle (a box was needed). The food came out lightning fast.\n\nSo, why not 5-stars? The service is still a little off and I hope this is something they're working on. We made the mistake of waiting for someone to come by every now and then. Tip: Ask for everything at once, otherwise, you'll be awkwardly trying to get someone's attention everytime you need a fork, want a water refill, would like to order your entree, want the check, etc. I don't ask for much, just come by at least once during our meal and that would be nice. Other than that, I really enjoyed LJ Shanghai and will be back!
