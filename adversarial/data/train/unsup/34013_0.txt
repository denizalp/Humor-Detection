The best bang for your buck close to the Vegas strip. The place is always packed (for that reason) but they are very efficient in churning out orders. You will probably have to wait a bit to get a table but turnover is high because people don't hang out there for too long. \n\nThe burgers will definitely hit the spot after a night out. I would recommend doing animal style on the fries and not the burger if you get the combo. However, the fries in general were really disappointing (friend described it best as cardboard). The animal style with cheese and onions made the fries more tolerable.
