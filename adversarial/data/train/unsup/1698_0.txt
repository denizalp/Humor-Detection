I think this is the first time I go to a nail salon and have no complaints...odd. It's like I don't know what to do with my life when I have nothing to complain about LMAO. JK.\n\nThis is your \"standard\" nail place...fill and gel polish is $35, which is standard. Pedicures are your standard prices. But what's not standard about this place and what really set it apart than other salon I've been to is the dynamic between those that work there and its clients. It's not every day you walk into a business and you hear people openly cussing at each other, but here you will. And for someone who is TRI-lingual in English, Spanish, and Curse Words, I can certainly appreciate how fun this place is. You can tell that everyone gets along very well and it's that kind of chemistry that attracts people...that keeps them coming back simply because they feel included.\n\nOh also, my nails look AMAZING. The last place I got them done at, I was left with a clumpy polish...it just didn't look the way it should have. But this place did a great job. I'll be returning.
