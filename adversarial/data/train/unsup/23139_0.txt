This is my first time at the original location for Tommy. It has a French allure to it-with fresh greens, flowers and a glass pastry display. I came here after work around 6 pm. The caf√© is a split level with three floors. You won't have trouble finding a space go sit but good luck if you want to plug in your laptop. Most of the outlets are located in the upper floor. I thought the mix and match furniture was creative but the sofas on the top floor looked run down - not very clean. There are two bathroom with very poor lighting and a common washing area.\n\nI paid 13$ for a croissant and a fresh pineapple coconut  juice. It was refreshing but not for its 8$ price. My croissant was stale, which makes senses if it's out in the open. \n\nOverall, I think I would come back here for the change of work environment for that once in a while as it is in the heart of old Montreal. It's nice to be a tourist in your own city. \n\nI prefer the second location on St. Paul.
