Pros- nice ambience, free garlic bread pieces with meal, service is great\nCons- over priced, small portions on proteins (especially considering prices),  alfredo sauce like glue, marinara lacking, salads nothing special. \n\nUnfortunately I have to give this place a poor review after several visits. I love old Vegas as much as the next guy but that's all this place has going for it. The food is below Olive Garden IMO and I have had several different dishes. The lowlight was the chicken angelo- small half breast, no zest, served with an alfredo sauce that turns into gelatin the second it gets under 140 degrees. All that for over 15.00? No thanks. \nThis place is for the older weathly folks with dulled taste buds, folks that come in for the terrific entrainment and younger wanna bes (no offense wanna bes)
