It takes almost everything I have to travel Southwest anymore this former discount carrier needs to rethink their boarding protocol, fortunately I almost always get the \"A Zone\" boarding pass and the few times I haven't I've spent the $40 to upgrade to get the A 1-15 boarding passes, however that still doesn't get you much the planes are almost always completely filled and as the seat backs get thinner the more seats they squeeze in so the leg room is ridiculous unless you score a bulk head or exit row and unless you have a blue boarding card forget about it. It's even becoming difficult for the usually cherrie flight attendants to force a smile on most flights but flying out of this terminal could depress anyone...
