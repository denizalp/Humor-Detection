Amazing Dinner with a large party that allowed us to order many things to share! Cheese and fruit plates were wonderful. Great wine pairings too. I had a very good duck dish, that after almost 2 months I cannot stop thinking about. Eating outside with the soft lighting and warm March weather was special and felt like summer anywhere else.
