Not too shabby, reasonable prices, and ready within 10 minutes of calling.\nWe went to town and sampled a little bit of everything:\nPork dumpling appetizer was delicious!\nShrimp tempura roll was good, but nothing special. This roll seems to taste the same no matter where you get it?!\nGarlic chicken was ok, although kinda sparse on the chicken.\nSesame chicken seemed to be the overall winner.\nGeneral Tso's chicken was ok, but no spice at all.\nThe fried rice is like regular rice with some brown food coloring--disappointing for sure.\nWill continue to try and find a good chinese place on the westside of town!
