From fall through spring the Greenbelt is the best place for a bike ride, jog, rollerblade, Frisbee golf or just some good old people watching!   I have lived along the green belt for over 3 years... moved twice but my home selection criteria included two things \"Pool & within  1\/2 mile of the greenbelt\".   Once you've been spoiled with it, it's a hard amenity let go.   There is water along the path, so you don't need to carry any with you.  On the weekends there are tons of activities and people so if you're going for a long run, it really helps to kill the time.   There is also a small skateboard park, around Thomas which is pretty entertaining.   The path extends from the Papago park area in Tempe all the way to Central\/North Scottsdale, so it's great for bike riding if you want to avoid the street lights. Just watch out for pedestrians and dogs!
