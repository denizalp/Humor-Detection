Place is suck! Since the new management took over, the quality of the car washes is horrible, they always have some poor excuses but they can't never get right.\nI usually go for the platinum service but to be honest, at the gas station around my house for $6.75 I get better quality service than the $34.00 plus tip platinum service I get from Green Valley Car Wash.\nI always had to wait extra because they never do it right the first time. While waiting for my car I saw some of their worker go behind the building and smoke marihuana.\nSketchy people working on our cars, I had money missing from my console and the last was my Radar detector missing from my glove compartment but their manager will tell you, they're not responsible for personal property.\nThey overcharged you for the poor work they do, I can tell you they won't last much longer, I seen their customers at the new car wash I now go to and by the way for $17.95 I get your version of Platinum plus they washed my car mats.\nNo surprise, is done right the first time and no extra waiting on my part.\nAnd by the way the annoying windshield people that are so disturbing every time you stop for your car wash, we are here for a car wash if I need it glass work, I will go to Safelite Auto glass to get done right.\nThe place needs a new management, until them I won't be back.\nBravo they opened a new car wash on W Sunset rd. and Arroyo Grande for $35.00 monthly unlimited car washes and free vacuum cleaning also. Now for the price of one Platinum service you can get unlimited car washes, big savings.\nGood buy Green Valley Car Wash....
