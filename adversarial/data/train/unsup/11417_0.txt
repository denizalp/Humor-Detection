HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!\n\nMy husband and I decided to come here tonight, as he has had this pizza before at work. Big mistake.\n\nWe walk in and the guy greets us and is very nice. He tells is we can sit anywhere we want, so we do. We look at the menu and wait for someone to come by to get our drink order.  Doesn't happen right away, as the guy and girl that seem to be the only 2 working, continue their conversation.\n\nA group of people come in and the girl comes out to their table and jokes about how she's the manager (I sincerely hope not!). Then she asks them what they would like to drink.\n\nApparently, serving your regulars\/friends takes priority over guests that were there first. That was our cue to leave. Not spending time and money at an establishment with such rude service.
