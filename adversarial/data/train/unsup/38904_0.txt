Mike and team at Fresco are the best, I cannot recommend them more highly. For starters, Mike and his family have been in the business for at least two generations, and with that comes extensive international experience of all the most exotic flooring types imaginable. \n\nThen there is the carpet cleaning itself - with the just the right balance of techniques to make the job last. They are honest, too, and what you are quoted is what you will pay, unlike many others in the business who generally 'bait and switch,' with unrealistic initial prices, coupons and other worthless promotions...\n\nAnd don't forget that Fresco does air-ducts and dryer vents too, as well another area of special expertise - concrete cleaning, which we used. Not as easy is it looks, and they did a great work. Give them a call and you will not be disappointed.
