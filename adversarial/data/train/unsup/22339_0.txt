Got wrangled into coming here for a business lunch.  I know it's Chile's, but you would think that a major national franchise would be able to produce uniformly bland food.  I got the sliders, which come in and order of four, and ended up with one totally unseasoned greasy mini-burger and three salt licks.  (So, great place for lunch if you're a deer . . .)\n\nI appreciate that we took up the table for more than an hour during a busy lunch, but I used to be service industry, and would have tipped accordingly if our server hadn't been so obviously pushing as hard as she could to get us out of the table.  \n\nCh-ch-ch-chile's!  Babyback Sucks!
