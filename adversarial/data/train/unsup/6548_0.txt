You have to laugh every time you come here over the fact they put a Five Guys next to a Healthy Home Market. \n\nFive Guys is my guilty pleasure when I want a quick burger. I usually skip getting fries and instead opt for a grilled cheese on the side. I mean, if I'm going to be bad, why not just go all out. If you're in a big rush, get online or on their app and place your order ahead of time. If you've never been to a Five Guys, don't get carried away with the toppings or else your burger may become impossible to eat. \n\nThis location is really clean and the workers are always in a good mood. Shout out to the guy on the grill during my last visit who gave me some kitchen gloves so I could cut jalapenos at home the next day. You da real MVP.
