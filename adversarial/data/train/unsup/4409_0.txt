\"Twerk!, twerk!, twerk!, twerk!\"\n\nThis guy puts on a show! He's extremely talented with balloons and crafts just about anything you can dream up. I met him at an adults only pool party at Luster Bar in downtown recently, I'm guessing this was quite the change of pace for him from the normal birthday party.\n\nDizzie crafted a dancer out of balloons, right before our eyes, attached her to a hat and it was passed from person to person for the next few hours. I then saw him create an intricate hat weaved, twisted, and sewn from seven or eight different balloons. No swords and basic hat's from this guy. From there, he went on to create a few more balloon sculptures, and had I kept up with him I would have spent the whole party watching; I decided to move on to the pool.\n\nWhile swimming I saw him from across the pool, wearing a life guard t-shirt, and he was all too excited to join into my humorous shtick. At one point he saved me from \"fake drowning\" in the three feet deep pool. If I ever throw a party, I know who I'm bringing for entertainment. Dizzie, You're quite the entertainer!\n\nHappy Yelping Phoenix, this guy is a man of many talents.
