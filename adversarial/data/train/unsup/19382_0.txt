When my brother received word that he was going to be released from his two week hospital sentence, I decided to bid my farewells and depart for a steak, beer, & some Sunday NFL action.\n\nWithin a mile of Southwest General Hospital is this brightly displayed restaurant, so I turned in and was immediately pleased by the wide selection of TVs displaying softly muted NFL games. I knew that this would be a fine place to eat & view the sport I enjoy so much.\n\nMy highlights:\n\n-  New York strip steak dinner\n-  22 oz. Blue Moon draft beer\n-  Friendly & attentive staff\n-  $25 plus tip\n\nGeneral highlights:\n\n-  Saturday college football\n-  NFL Sunday Ticket\n-  TVs of every shape & size displaying NFL football\n-  Semi individual game selectors & volume controls \n-  Drink specials\n\nThis is a chain restaurant that I would willingly visit again, but preferably somewhere closer to the 93035 zip code where I reside.
