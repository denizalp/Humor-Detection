While the first time I came here was a solid 3 stars, the second time was very enjoyable. This time I ordered the cheese board and just like the last time, there were like 3 cheeses, pistachios, another kind of nut, jam, bread, etc. Very good and plentiful. Last time, we ordered the warm mixed nuts that were really good but I couldn't eat too much of it. My husband ordered this pork dish that had hominy, and I don't remember what else but it was freakin awesome. I kept eating out of his skillet. Yum. My $10 specialty cocktail was knock me on my ass strong but good. I gave it to my husband after while because I would have been drunk just off the one. I guess that is a good problem to have. The service was top-notch. She was just the right amount of attentive and did a great job. The decor was bright and modern. I really enjoyed this last experience.
