Despite what I've read in some previous reviews, I found our pizzas arrived super quick, even though the place was close to full. I ordered the cremini mushroom pizza which was fantastic - loved the fresh rosemary sprinkled on top! I ended up taking half of it home as I couldn't finish the whole thing. I finished it later that night, cold, and it was still delicious (who doesn't love cold pizza, amiright??). Looking forward to stopping by again in the future!
