My favorite yogurt place in vegas (aside from McD's soft serve)... yogurtland on Flamingo.   It has a large and unique selection of flavors .  My top choices are: coconut, pistachio, pineapple, taro, peanut butter cup and their new flavor of the season Lychee. The yogurt is creamy and delicious.  The reason why I love this location is because of the 1) seasonal flavors and great selection- they probably have 12-14 flavors and 2) the yogurt is dense and cold, unlike the super busy Town Square location where it's so packed that the yogurt doesn't get enough time to chill. Yum yum yum
