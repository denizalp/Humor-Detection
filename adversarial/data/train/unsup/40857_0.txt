I am still a big fan, Another good rice bowl, and a po-boy this time.\n\nIt was the firs time I ever ventured to the sandwich side of the menu wand I was pleased.  We had a Argentinean po boy which was basically mock steak peppers and onions. The mock beef as great,  the veggies were a bit over cooked and the bun was toasted but nothing special for $8.\n\nWe did start with the egg rolls, aside from the small noodles inside they were decent as they were fried but not greasy but again nothing special. $4\n\nWe also split a \"diablo red\" bowl $7.50 despite the name we had to add some hot sauce to up the level of diablo to it. The veggies were fresh and well cooked, the mock chicken was great and the brown rice served it's purpose well.  \n\nOverall I like the format of this place, and the fact I can order anything on the menu.
