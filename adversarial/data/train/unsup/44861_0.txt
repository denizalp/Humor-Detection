Nothing really stands out about Lee Chen Asian Bistro. Their food is okay, nothing special, and they are a little more pricey on a dish by dish basis than the average Asian restaurant. Tried the Xiaolongbao and shu mai, both were below the normal dim sum standards. Also had a rice dish, noodle dish, and chicken dish which were not too memorable. Decor is nice, the actual restaurant is tucked away sort-of underground. Service was a tad slow. Overall was  okay but don't think I would go again.
