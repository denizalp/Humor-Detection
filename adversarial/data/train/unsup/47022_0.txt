I had a facialiacious facial last week by Angela at Chinook. It was by far the most amazing and relaxing facial that I have ever had.  The facial bed was so comfortable and Angela made my Skoah experience one that I didnt want to end. Product purchased and my skin still feels amazing. Thanks to Angela, I will be back. Appointment already booked!!!!
