Arrived here 5 mins before closing and was turned away by the teenage girl working, even though there was 5 other kids dining inside. All we wanted was two slices. Very disappointed by this, especially since we enjoy their pizza very much. Perhaps the owners should give this teen proper training in customer service. Maybe then, she wouldn't have all her teenage friends there hanging out after hours. Make sure to go here during lunch hours, when actual adults are working.
