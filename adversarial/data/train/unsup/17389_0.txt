Where else can you find an adult playground in Vegas? I've been here on weeknights only so I'm not sure how weekends are (I'm assuming extremely crowded) but I enjoyed coming here the past two Monday nights. Ambiance is very chill and relaxed as opposed to a fast-paced, obnoxious crowd on the strip. I liked that it was away from the loud music on Fremont street.\n\nThere are bean bags, comfy beds, chairs to lounge in. A bar with attentive bartenders. Play pool, foursquare, jenga, giant beer pong, etc. It was a nice getaway from the chaos on the strip & Fremont street, for sure.\n\nI don't recommend parking at their vicinity though. Just find a hotel, get it validated or simply pay half of what you'd pay for the Gold Spike parking, which is $10. Say wuuuuut. No thanks.\n\nOverall, it's a nice place to relax, drink, play games & hang out with good company.
