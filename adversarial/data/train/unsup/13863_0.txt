I've been to Windsor enough now to \"get it\" and to have let them address some of the observations of other customers. \n\nI'll start off by saying that there is nothing fatally flawed in the place, and the concept is quite good. Combined with Churn and DeMarco's I consider it a hipster urbanist interpretation of a  shopping mall food court for the 30-50 demographic. Everything in it speaks in some way to those who were in high school or college in the mid-eighties through mid-nineties. Let me take a moment to gloat: My BROTHERS AND SISTERS! WE ARE IN THE RICH PART OF THE NOSTALGIA CURVE NOW! ENJOY! Anyway, the concept and decor is great and just works.\n\nWhat's wrong? Well, the food. Everything I have ordered off the appetizer menu is either too salty or not quite there in some way. Portion was too small or was over\/underdone. I don't mind the fact that they don't really have any happy hour specials to excite and entice, but  if there's no discount to convince me that I am somehow getting a deal, the food better be terrific. And it isn't. The groups I've been with have left half portions of small plates that should have been wiped clean.\n\nWhat else? The service was noticeably slow and a bit cold each time I was there. Yes, I get it: You're young, attractive and hip and are probably working on a screenplay that will sensitize all of us to the ecological plight of the pygmy eskimo wombat, and working this mind-numblingly-dull waiter job is such a condescension. Just bring me a beer.\n\nAlso, the music is too loud. I didn't like most of that stuff the first time around, but I'll indulge it for nostalgia's sake. \n\nAnyway, not bad but not quite a destination. Needs some work.
