I originally came here for acupuncture but was told what I really needed was massage , after $140 of course. I did come back for massage but privacy was an issue from discussing medical concerns in the hallway while other clients were putting on their shoes to hearing moaning from the next client getting a massage in the \"room\" next door (there are no walls just curtains). The three stars are for the therapists and honestly they deserve five as they are great. Another concern is restrooms.......I don't think there are any.
