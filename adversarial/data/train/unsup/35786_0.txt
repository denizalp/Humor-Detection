This is pure Philly in Arizona.  Having been to Philly a fair number of times, I enjoy a solid cheesesteak, and this is where I go to grab one in Arizona.\n\nThere is only one problem.  Though not as bad as it used to be, there were a few guys working the counter that were complete jackasses.  Yes, I understand it is a place to grab a Philly cheesesteak, but I don't want a side order of Philly attitude, I get that enough watching Eagles games with some of my friends.\n\nOn the plus side, they recently merged with an old pizza place that used to serve the best pies in the area and they now sell his recipe pizzas and they are amazing!\n\nFood is good, but some of the older workers at the place need to check their Philly attitudes at the door.
