Came here for the first time to see Garth Brooks. I was a little nervous about the parking so I bought 2 reserved parking in different garages just in case one was full. Traffic was not a problem. It was so easy, we just pulled in and hit the Aria garage first and decided to try it. The girl said they had plenty of parking. We got a great spot and when we walked out we were right at the entrance to the arena. Amazing!!\n\nAre tickets were supposed to be picked up at a special window because we used our credit card. But they had people at the main gate that were able to scan my card right there. Woo Hoo.\n\nOur tickets were floor seats and I thought that would be amazing. They were good, don't get me wrong. But it was a little hard to see with the extra tall people in front of us ( I am pretty tall). I think it would have been better to sit up a little higher.\n\nThe concert was great of course. But I am giving 4 stars because the prices for drinks are OUT OF CONTROL!!!! 2 small wines and a beer $38. WHAT??? OMG people totally not worth it. You are better off getting wasted somewhere else. The wine is crap and the beer was Coors Light. \n\nThe venue was really clean and is beautiful. There were plenty of restrooms and no wait. I will def. go back but just won't buy the drinks. Happy to have this in Vegas. Going to be great for hockey.
