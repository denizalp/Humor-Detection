Started using Dry Bar products and was excited to find an actual store in my hotel. \n\nI didn't know they actually blow and style hair!\n\nIt's a small shop with several stations to get a blow job. They have a full line of products, yet at Vegas prices. I took a look at what I use and they are $10 more than what I pay. \n\nJust from the short time I was there, they did make the clients beautiful and Sin City ready!
