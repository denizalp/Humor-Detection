The Akropolis pizza was so delicious -- flavors compliment each other perfectly. And to top it off, the crust was awesome and a nice deviation from traditional pizza dough.\n\nKind of a small place, but nice. I was just picking it up to go, so I didn't explore much.\n\nI want to try other items too, but I'll probably get the same exact pizza one more time before I start to get alllll crazy!!! \n\nIt's a great starting point if you're looking for a unique pizza, I highly recommend it.
