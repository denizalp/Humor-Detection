I stopped in for lunch during a weekday. It was my first time at Kouskous Express. The staff was very helpful in explaining all of the options and what options compliment each other from a flavor perspective. They have three different options for your base of the bowl. There are numerous protein options and various toppings! With the staff's help, I was able to construct a very delicious Moroccan bowl! The flavors were unique and I definitely enjoyed a delicious lunch!\n\nThe only reason I took a star away from my review is that it is a pricy lunch option for the amount of food you get. Other than the price, I don't have any complaints!\n\nI would return in the future to give it another shot and try a new combination!
