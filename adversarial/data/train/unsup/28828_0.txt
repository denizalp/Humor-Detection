Mom's been wanting to pick up a bibingka from here for a while now but I always seem to but this place on the back burner. Finally took the OG's to Vegas for the first time since forever so I mentioned this place to mom and she was stoked to check it out. I enjoy navigating away from the strip because that traffic is always ridiculous. Checked the GPS and booyah were turning into the parking lot. \n\nAll we came here for was the bibingka but they were all sold out. Fair enough we did come here later in the day so I was not surprised. Figured we grab some food to bring to the hotel room and save some money on dinner. Grabbed a combo plate for pops and waited for the rest of the family to arrive. A couple of days out in Vegas can definitely get ya craving for some rice. Everything is right on par with the Pinoy spots in San Diego.  Nothing  different from the norm.  \n\nIs that TFC on the tv?\n\n Yeah now it feels like home.
