I have been to their different branches across a lot of cities and I am amazed by the consistency of their food. It's like the food is prepared by the same person, everywhere \nAbsolutely love their food and service. I have tried their seafood trio that consists of 3 items that you can pick from a list of items on the menu and a bunch of main course dishes having shrimp and the taste is amazing. I can say that is one of my favorites for my seafood cravings.
