Head upstairs at the D for a better bar experience than Long Bar. It's smaller, but the experience at Vue is significantly better. Drinks are cheap, service is friendly, and there are a couple of TVs to watch a game. You'll have to multitask though, because all the seats at the bar have built in gaming. There are a couple of high top tables if that's not your thing.\n\nThe biggest draw here is the balcony, with a great view of Fremont Street- you don't even need a drink to enjoy it, and it's just far enough above the chaos observe for entertainment without actually having to interact with the unsavory characters in the area. Good spot to grab a drink before dining on site.
