Never having been to the Texas Roadhouse  I didn't know what to expect.  I loved the peanuts.  It made me feel right at home.  My server, Keisha was the best.  She gave great service and was very social.  I like that in a server.  She never neglected us and I love the before six $9.99 dinners.  I had the six oz. steak and it was cooked just right--something that I rarely get.  It was so much better than the usual happy hour--value at a great price.  I will return to this Texas Roadhouse.
