My favorite barbershop in Pittsburgh. Nothing fancy, but cheap. I get an easy cut so it's not hard to screw up, it's also hard to do well. The barbers at Anthony's do it well. \nI typically go during off hours (not around lunch) when I opt to work from home. I have never waited more than 10 minutes. \nThe barbers at Anthony's also clean me up well enough that I don't feel the need to immediately go home and take a shower.\nTip: they only take cash.\nTip: take a $20 get a haircut, tip well, grab a coffee at the nearby Starbucks.
