Jury duty appearance and have to say that it was  not bad at all. The waiting area was huge, like airport huge and there were televisions everywhere to watch. Now if I could just schedule my next jury duty when there is a game on, that would be great. There were vending machines and free coffee and cookies, but snacks were gone quickly. Staff was very informative and kept everyone updated throughout. They may have been a little too informative for my liking and at times I got tired of hearing the same message over and over again. Par for the course I guess. Overall though, not bad.
