Best wine bar in Montreal!  A lot of selection by the glass of unique stuff.  Somm does a great job there of changing the offerings.  \n\nAll the wines and food are written on a black board on the wall.\n\nThe food portions are small but very tasty and creative.  Very busy, highly recommended if you are in town
