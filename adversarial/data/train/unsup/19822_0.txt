Do NOT come here for a wax. The girl who did my eyebrows yesterday burnt the shit out of me-and I am NOT on retin-A. Not only that, during the wax I had to constantly have her clean up areas she missed that were obvious. She did not take her time at all and was very careless. Now I have this atrocious skin right before a special event. Horrible.
