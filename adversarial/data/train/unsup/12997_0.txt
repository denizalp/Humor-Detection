\"Everything is awesome.\"\n\nThe Lego Movie?  No.  That song is actually about The Yolk.  \n\nGet brunch here.  You will love it.\n\nA few things to know:\n\n* There is a long \"community table\" in the center of the place.  This is first come, first serve.  The booths along the walls have a sign-in sheet.  This is confusing for first-time guests, but, works well once you understand it.\n\n* The place get super busy on Saturday morning starting around 9am.  Kids got you up at 6am on Saturday?  Go early to the Yolk!\n\n* For parents, Rock Hill has a great playground to visit after b\n\nIf you haven't been here, you should know The Yolk's prior location had a huge # of 5 star glowing reviews.  The Yolk moved a few blocks after a fire, and Yelp created a new listing for the new location instead of updating the address on the original listing.
