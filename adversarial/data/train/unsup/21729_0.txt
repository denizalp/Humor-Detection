This is usually first stop on my way to work. Sometimes I go through the drive through and Becky is always on point. She's very sweet, friendly and patient.\n\nSometimes I order via the beta app and pickup inside. \nMario and\/or Zoey usually take care of me inside. \nBoth are always amazing. They remember my name and always have my order ready when I walk in. I feel like they take that extra step to ensure they provide a quality experience. They make my morning caffeine run much easier. I used to sometimes stop at the Starbucks closer to work but because of these employees I've pretty much made this location my exclusive stop. Yay for good customer service! It has taken me a while to update this review because I wanted to make sure I had their names correct.
