Great for Packer's games! However, I don't think I would go there for anything else. They actually have a pretty nice selection of tap beers and from what I saw, the food looked pretty standard. We had the nachos, which really didn't distinguish themselves from any other nacho platter I have had at a bar. The service was decent, given the fact that they were running a pretty full house during the Packer game.
