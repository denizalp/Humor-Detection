Plenty of good time here\n\nMiller Ale House is situated in the Town Centre shopping and entertainment complex.\n\nThis place is a tight sports bar that has great food for lunch and dinner to boot. The Ale house has all your draft and bottle needs with a decent range of 50 to 90 beers at one time.\n\nI recommend the wings while watching some hockey or basketball. They use to have moose drool beer which is my jam but they unfortunately took it off the menu.\n\nThe service here is always decent and beer is cold. I don't have any real complaints other than the location kinda of caters to tourist market, if they opened in Summerlin somewhere it would an awesome local hang out spot for sure
