I don't normally go to Pho places but after trying Vietnamese sandwiches more often in the past month i decided to come here. The only other place i've had a Vietnamese sandwich was a place on Spring Mountain and all I can say about that experience is, well meh.\n\nMy family felt like getting some pho, but i didn't and felt like a sandwich so i chose to come to this restaurant as I knew they had the sandwiches but never tried them. I ordered 2 Grilled pork subs. When i saw them being handed to me, I smiled. They were bigger, Looked more fresh, and after tasting it, it tasted a whole bunch better than my previous experience. \n\nAll i can say is that as of now, This place has the best vietnamese sandwiches i've tasted. And for less than 4 dollars it's a great deal.\n\nService could be a little better. The People working there look like students attending UNLV. It doesn't matter the age, but I just think service was just meh. Definitely come check it out.
