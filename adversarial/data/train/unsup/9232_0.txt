My friend and I came in here while we were waiting for a table at Bachi Burger a couple of doors down.  Check out my review of Bachi, it wasn't worth the 30+ minute wait.\n\nThis is a cool a$$ candy and soda shop.  All types of unique candies and sodas made with real cane sugar vs the fructose and other crap that most sodas are made with nowadays (pics).  There is also a location in West LA.  \n\nMy friend and I walked around, grabbed a bunch of stuff like Zotz, ABBA ZABBA and other $hit I shouldn't be eating.  I also personally bought some candy necklaces.  I am not sure why I like those damn things, other than I used to give them to the girls back in grade school before hollaring became hollaring - LOL.\n\nToo bad all things were not all \"sweet\" that night.  We should have went some place other than Bachi Burger for dinner - lol!
