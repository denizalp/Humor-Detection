I wanted to check out one of the many nail salons located between Yonge\/Bloor and Yonge\/Wellesley.\n\nMost of these salons are cheap but minimal in terms of service and decor....And you just sort of pray that they are clean.\n\nI stood outside the Shining Nails salon looking skeptical.\nInside, there were customers, so I decided to try it out.\n\nThe selection of nail polish was decent.  I selected a China Glaze brand polish which is my second choice next to OPI.\n\nI hung up my own coat and took a seat in a massage chair.\nThey didn't offer me a magazine while I soaked my feet, but that's okay, I was too busy scoping the place out.\n\nThe Good\n* The girl doing my nails was attentive and did a good job\n* She gave me a nice leg massage and hot towel\n* Metal tools were clean and I saw her take them out of the heat-cleaner oven..thing\n* They have nail dryers for hands and feet, some of the salons around here don't have them\n\nThe Not-So-Good\n* The products they use aren't scented, meh...\n* I'm not sure if they clean their nail file\/buffer stick\n\nI was absolutely horrified when she started filing my nails since I wasn't sure if the files were cleaned or not.\n\nIt may be strange, but I was extra horrified because of the dudes there getting pedicures.\n\nWeirdly enough, there were two males getting nails done.\nAnd I'm sorry, but they had the UGLIEST feet ever. \nLike, they grew up without shoes living on a construction site and grew special feet to walk on rocks.\n\nIt made me sick to accidentally look over and see the piles of shavings on the floor, the yellowed toe nails...\nI was scared by the thought that feet like that could have been at the station before me.\n\nSo yeah, not the worst pedicure I've had, but I don't think I would go back.
