I like this airport.  It's always clean.  The car rental desks are right across from the luggage carousels, so you can often have your rental car keys before your luggage comes out.\nThere's a cute lounge with comfy chairs for people to sit in if they're waiting for an arriving flight.\nIf you're on your way out, there is a crap shop and snack bar up by the gates for those last minute purchases.  I don't recommend ordering a coffee more complicated than \"coffee\".   Those new-fangled espresso drinks can stump some people (what year is this?).  \nThe only thing is the TSA people take their job VERY seriously here.  Once I accidentally had a leftover bottle of water in the bottom of my pack.  Totally an oversight but you'da thought I was a bomb-toting terrorist.  When I used to travel with a light-weight Combi stroller they would literally dismantle it looking for ... drugs? firearms?  I don't know.  More times that I can count, my husband has been detained for an extra thorough search.  He travels rather frequently.  Internationally.  He knows what's ok and what's not and never has a problem except in Madison.  He does not have white skin.  I'm just sayin'.\nIt's nice having the rental cars right across the street in the parking garage.  It's not nice if you arrive late at night in the snow and your car is in the lot NEXT to the parking garage.
