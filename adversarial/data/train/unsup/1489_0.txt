I've been here a few times in the past and although the food is fair compared to others around(Chinatown doesn't have good food anyways) the service is one of the worst I have ever seen.\n\nThey pride themselves on the old newspaper reviews written in the past(mostly by white people who don't know what good Chinese food) they don't value customers. They serve you the bill before you even finish your meal(a message saying, hurry up and eat your food then get out).\n\nIt is worth a try but don't be surprised if they rush you to leave.
