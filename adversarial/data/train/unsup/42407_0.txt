Pretty good spot for a quick pizza. Ingredients are of a good quality and taste proved it. It took longer to pick what I wanted and get through the line then I did waiting. \nI did find the crispy thin crust a bit too crispy. May be how they do it or I just got one that was a little extra done. \nOverall a great place to take the family for dinner or lunch. Clean place and the staff is nice.
