A godsend if you're trying recipes that call for some exotic spices. Got a big bag of Sichuan peppercorns from here which I use all around the kitchen. I wanted to make salt and vinegar almonds one day and they had powdered vinegar and citric acid on hand. Incredible. Not having to buy in huge bulk amounts makes this place cost effective when you're comparing to amazon. It would take me 20 years to use a pound of citric acid from amazon, while they had 2oz of it I could buy.
