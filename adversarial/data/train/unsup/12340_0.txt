I have been hooked on Uber since finally trying it for the first time almost a half year after the launch.  In the last month I have taken 6 rides with only one not making a 5 plus star rating.  In contrast I took a cab on Saturday that was too busy working on his iPhones play list with ear phones (possibly illegal?) while driving to pay attention to the road.  Chatting with the Uber drivers they were all family men just trying to earn some spare cash.  Although none were ecstatic about the rates they all talked positively about their time behind the wheel and experience.\n\nAs advertised all cabs showed up accurately with their countdown to arrival.  Only one was picky about the minimum trip but decided it was forth the $20 dollar ride.  Over all they are quite a bit less on the regular fares, around 60% of a full cab ride.  (Don't quote me, it could have been other factors effecting the rates from night to night).  I have recommended it to friends and even used it when with friends.  Personally I am behind anything the decreases the chance someone will get behind the wheel after a couple drinks and the ease of use and cost of the service is a huge benefit.
