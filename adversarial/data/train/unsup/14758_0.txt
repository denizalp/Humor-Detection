I alternate between Danforth and College.  For some reason, I like Danforth much better!  I have no reason as to why but I like the little parking lot beside the building and the waiting area is a bit warmer and comfy than the College St. location.\n\nI'm a total sugaring convert.  Most of the technicians work at either location.  Today, a booking error turned into a miracle.  I usually go with Cailey and she is awesome and does a great job.  Something must have gone wrong when I booked, because I was given a different person than usual.\n\nHer name is Cricel and she is the most thorough sugarist ever!  First off, she is super thorough.  When I got home I looked and there were no strays anywhere (and I have fine, blond hair so that happens often).  This was by far the fastest and best brazilian I have ever had.  Definitely give Cricel a try - she is awesome!
