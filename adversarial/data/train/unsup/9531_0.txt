I'm not gluten intolerant or living gluten free or anything of the sort. I'm just one of those people who finished eating a giant meal of noodles a couple doors down at the Thai place and wanted to see how much more I could eat, so I wandered in to GFC with my coworker. \n\nThe ladies were so so sweet. All smiles and had no issue explaining and recommending different things they loved. Also, there were samples of different brownies next to the front door. These pushed us over the edge - I would never know they were gluten free. VERY good.\n\nSo we ended up walking out with a little lemon cream cheese bundt cake under the ruse of giving it to our boss. It was drier than anticipated, but was absolute perfection with tea. Would definitely buy all the cakes and brownies.
