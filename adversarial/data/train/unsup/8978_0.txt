Came here for lunch with my manager yesterday- love that they put the calories on the menu. Naturally shot for the lowest calorie salad, which happened to be the Seared Tuna Superfoods Salad- seared ahi tuna over spinach, organic quinoa, cucumbers, avocado, grilled corn, edamame and tossed with green goddess dressing for 520 cals and $16.90. It was a large enough portion for 2, but it was so darn good that I ate the whole thing! My manager has the chicken tortilla soup and the Colorado Chicken Salad- chicken, mixed greens, bleu cheese, dried cranberries, green apples and a raspberry chipotle vinaigrette. The salad looked absolutely to die for- 910 cals and $14.25. She highly recommended coming back at night to try out their steaks! Very much wish there was a location closer to me in North Scottsdale\/Phoenix!
