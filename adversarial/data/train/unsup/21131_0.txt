I love Barcades!! I have been to a few in the Chapel Hill\/Carrboro\/Raleigh\/Triangle areas. I was super pumped to see reviews popping up for Abari and couldn't wait to check the place out. \n\nDecent selection of pinball machines and 80's arcade games! Decent draft selections!\n\nManagement does ask that you get a membership (only $1) as it is considered a private club so they can serve liquor (they do this in Asheville a lot); it's good for life though. I like that they ask you what kind of music and beer\/drinks you like, so they can as the Kinks said \"Give the People What They Want\"!\n\nThe music is well selected and I love the freestanding beer holders for while you're playing pinball.\n\nIf you ever get a chance to visit a place like Baxter's in Chapel Hill, or even the Asheville Pinball Museum, you'll understand why I could only give this place three stars.\n\nGlad to have them on the scene! Hopefully my membership card won't be revoked after posting this review!!!
