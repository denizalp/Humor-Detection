This place is amazing!  \nI visited cyan a couple of times and each time I loved it! \nI think they did an awesome job in designing the place, giving it a very unique, modern look!\nI really like the different types of seating available, you can choose between dining at the tables or just lounging on the couches and enjoy their amazing shisha.\nThey have obsoletely the best tasting Mediterranean cuisine I've ever had (I've been to many places) \nI think this is a great place for Richmond hill. Will definitely come back again!!
