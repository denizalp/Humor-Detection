We came here on New Year's Eve for a nice dinner before hanging out with friends. We have been here a number of times previously & always had wonderful experiences. We made our reservation for New Year's Eve about 10 days in advance, knowing that it would fill up quickly. We arrived 4 minutes before our reservation time and we were told we'd be seated \"closer to the reservation time.\" We waited until 10 minutes past our reservation time to ask if we were going to be seated soon, while in the meantime multiple parties came in and were seated before us (other parties of 2 as well). Once we were seated, service was good, a little slow, but it was a busy night so that's to be expected. My husband ordered the chicken dish, which included 2 pieces of chicken, and the second piece was completely raw & inedible. We alerted our server & the dish was taken off of our bill. We were glad the dish was taken off of the bill, but this restaurant is too expensive and nice to get a piece of raw chicken.
