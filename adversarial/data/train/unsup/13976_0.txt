City of sin. What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. Mafia. Gambling. Topless shows.\n\nIf that's your only idea of Vegas, Mac King is the antidote to all that. He proves that you can get good entertainment with clean humour, an affable character and let me tell you as a magic fan, he's no slouch with the magic either.\n\nHis afternoon magic\/comedy show may also be just about the best value for money along the Strip, especially with the many deals you can find\n\nThe only downside is that the seating seems to be done by the people at the door and obviously the bigger the tip....... I think seating should be allocated by the box office rather than necessitating another bribe to get a decent seat. Besides this, the show was great and very entertaining\n\nThere is a level of audience participation but nothing emabarrassing or dangerous. In fact, the only moment of worry for the kids may be when he 'eats' the goldfish!\n\nDefinitely worth it for families but also adults with a free afternoon and some spare dollars
