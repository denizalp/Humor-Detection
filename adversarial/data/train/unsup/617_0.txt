I hate coming to this airport for the following reasons:\n\n1) Planes are never on time leaving here. The last 5 times I have either flown through here or caught a flight it's been either late or cancelled.  \n\n2) TSA is horrible here! Not friendly,inconsistent, slow and exactly the opposite of what any good kind of customer service looks like.  \n\n3)The amount of distance you have to walk just to catch an Uber or Lyft. Come on this is ridiculous you should make people who still take cabs this far! \n\n4)The lack of anything good to eat...there is seriously nothing worth spending your money on besides a Starbucks. Everything is over-priced, bland, usually luke-warm and just not worth it.  Their are other airports like Seattle, Portland and others where I look forward to eating at a place just because it's in that airport.   \n\nIn summary outside of my other least favorite airport Jackson-Hartfield in Atlanta when I find out that I have to travel to these places I get completely depressed.
