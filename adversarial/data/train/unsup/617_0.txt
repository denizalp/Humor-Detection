This has been one of the best hotel experiences I have had. Door staff is incredibly friendly, as is the front desk staff. Rooms are essentially new and are incredibly well decorated (wish my house looked this nice). While I didn't get an opportunity to eat at the Blue Hound, I did have drinks there and it was definitely a nice environment. Will be back in Phoenix this January and I will definitely be staying here again.
