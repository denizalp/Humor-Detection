This place is horrible.\nFirst time I went the bartender stole $100 from my boyfriend and then acted like nothing happened. When my boyfriend confronted him he said he never got the money and brushed it off. F-ing idiot, that's called STEALING. It was a very frustrating situation.\n\nSecond time there were more bartenders acting rude and even tried to get my friends kicked out for a misunderstanding. I was standing there watching the whole thing, the bartenders had serious attitude problems and go figure, they were all guys. Maybe I should have whipped out a measuring stick to settle the dispute.\n\nBoth times it was overly crowded and people were being herded like cattle.\n\nThe pretty venue is not worth the bad attitudes and ego trips. There are SO MANY other better clubs and lounges to go to, you're in LV after all. If you still decide to check out all the hype, be wary of the bartenders!
