I haven't played bingo since I was in elementary school.  So I thought this would be funny to go and be like the only people under 75 in the room.  Holy crap!  THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU LEARNED IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL!\n\nMy friends and I decided to go play Bingo since none of us have.  We thought it would be just like school bingo and you would pay like a buck to play.\n\nOh hell no!\n\nThis is serious bingo!  And you don't just get your numbers in a row bingo.  You have to pay attention to what bingo they are playing.  And some of the games, you use your card more than once.  *slaps head*\n\nSo we got there at like 8:45pm and almost every seat in the place was taken.  There was a line where you get your bingo cards.  So we got in line.  The line moved really fast, which was nice.  We got to the front and the 4 of us explained that we had no idea what was going on.  There are different level cards you can buy depending on how much you want to gamble.  So 3 of us got the $15 cards, where you play 6 games at a time out of 5 pages. With the biggest money payout.  Plus the $1 jumbo card.  My husband was the wise one and picked up one of these portable computers that you play on.  More on the portable computer later.  \n**Did I mention that it is CASH ONLY?!!?!?  yeah.**  \nWe then asked where we get our chips or markers.  The lady pointed to a vending machine.  The markers range from $1.00-1.75 depending on how fancy you wanted the marker.\n\nWe then took all of our stuff and tried to find 4 seats together.  We found 3 chairs and then found a random one that we moved so we all could be together.\n\nWe were all like deer in headlights when the game started.  They were going really fast.  And you use a special card for the first game of the hour.  Luckily, we had a set of 4 pros sitting next to us that guided us through the process.  By the 3rd game we had figured it out.\n\nBack onto the portable computer: when the bingo lady calls the number (ie. B 5) the computer marks it for you.  Where the 3 of us were scrambling to use the marker on the sheets before they called the next number.  The 4 pros next to us were laughing with us and telling us to use the portable computer next time so we can sit and chat and drink.  Yes drink.  You get free drinks (like 3 or 4) while you are there.  No tipping required!  The ladies that walk around asking if you want drinks (not in skanky outfits either) are extremely nice.  Example: she came around and I asked for a vodka cranberry.  She asked if I placed my order when I came in.  (I had no idea what she was talking about)  But when you get there, you should place your drink order right away and then they bring it to you.  So instead I got a water.  And within 3 minutes she came back with a vodka cranberry for me!  How sweet!!\n\nNone of us won any money.  One person in the room won $20,000 and one of the pros won $500 and the other $10.\n\nMy husband and I were actually talking about going back tonight, cause it was kinda fun, definitely low-key and cheap for an hour's worth of entertainment.\n\nIt kinda ruined our buzz because it was a little stressful for the first time going. I caught myself a couple of times, with my mouth wide open and a confused look on my face.  Oh how I wish I could look back and see what the 4 of us looked like.  haha! \n\nWith SO many people being there, the chances of winning are extremely low.  The pros told us to go at like 7pm.  I guess they double your chances of winning or something during the week?  I still don't have it figured out.\n\nShout out to the pros next to us.  One of them wrote down what the colors meant (colors refer to the letter being called) and the other took my card and marked the numbers for me because I was so behind.  The other made sure we marked each of the numbers and described the games for us and the other laughed and offered insight.  (Hi Dan-o if you read this!)\n\nAfter all of that, my recommendation:\n-get there like an hour early, get your seats that you want, get a portable computer, place your drink order and enjoy your time!  \n\nWe are excited to go back and do this again!
