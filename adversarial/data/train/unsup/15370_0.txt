Went here for lunch today and it was good! The sour dough bread they give you prior to your meal is phenomenal!  I ordered the Campanelle Carbonara and it was delish! Enough to share, especially if you order it for lunch. The Campanelle Carbonara had chicken, crispy bacon and spinach in it, YUMMY!\n\nThe only thing I would change on my end was the friend who I had lunch with, that's about all. :)
