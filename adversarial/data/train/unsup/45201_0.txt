This restaurant offer a mix of Persian and Arabic menus. Compared to similar places it is less expensive though. The staff are friendly and helpful. I tried Koobideh beef and it was acceptable. A bit salty I say but not irritating! The food comes with a choice of soup or salad. \nYou can order dessert and tea if you'd like to. The desserts are mainly Arabic (sweeet !) \nThe place itself is so simple but clean and inviting. There's no music and most of the time you can watch soccer on TVs there! Not loud however. \n If you plan a party and want to serve some kebab they have an option by which you can by a kilo of koobideh say and it is cheaper than ordering equivalent number of sticks.\nThis is not the place for a date or family weekend getaway but a grab-plenty-of-good-food-for-less place where you can have lunch in your break at work or order out and enjoy it at home.
