Bought a deal from Livingsocial for a \" Haircut, Blow Dry, Color and Conditioning or Partial Highlights Plus $25 Gift Card\". I got the Color and conditioning instead of the partial highlights. A male stylist did all the coloring, shampooing, blowdrying, etc.. I loved the results. When i was getting ready to leave, I gave the stylist my tip, 20% of the original price of the service. He gave it to Eli, and he was like \"what's this?\". Eli said I owe $60 since the color was for the full head. i said yes that's what it said on the deal, He said it was only for touch up or partial coloring. I didn't get the partial highlights, it clearly said on the deal \"color and conditioning\", it didn't say partial color or touch-up. I didn't wanna argue since i was also in a hurry, so I just paid the $60 and left and i will never go back again.
