I've been here twice when I was craving bubble tea. The milk green tea and the milk tea are both overly sweet and nothing to rave about at all. If I have water with me, I would've water the drink down without a thought. It's that sweet. \n\nAlso, the service is horrendous. First we had to wait forever for them to come and ask us what we want. Then they forgot our order of chicken. So we decided not to bring it up and just enjoy the super sweet drinks as much as we could. It was so sweet that we asked for water when we managed to flag a waitress down. And then, of course, it never came. So we gave up on that as well. When we tried to ask for the bill, they saw us and then proceeded to ignore us. WTF. \n\nI ended up going up to the counter myself. If you do that, please do not wait until someone notices you (my mistake). Just go in front of a waitress and start doing jumping jacks clutching the money in your hand until she decides you can't be ignored anymore.
