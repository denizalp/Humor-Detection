Don't waste your money. We were excited to eat here, and up until this point all our dining choices were excellent. Then our LAST DINNER OF OUR TRIP happened. Our server was nice and knowledgeable, offering recommendations. We ordered a BIG drink, and then our food. The drink was good. Then the food came after a while of waiting. My wife's brisket nachos were average, but my \"best burger in Vegas\" was cold. Along with the fries. I brought this up to our server, and he took it away. 10 minutes later he arrived with a new burger, albeit warm, was bland and not worth the $20. We also hardly saw our server after that. The bus boy kept our drinks full. When it came time for the check I was shocked to see no discount or anything for the cold burger. Nothing. No apologies. I'm not one to complain, but if I'm at a \"celebrity chef's\" restaurant paying a premium for the food I expect more. We were way underwhelmed and left us feeling robbed and bummed going into our last night. Save your money and go to Hash House. You'll be glad you did.
