I'm a Saint Louis resident that travels way too frequently for work to a city I hate: Vegas. It's like a big, fat, Walmart. Immediately upon my first trip years ago, I searched high and low for good cocktails. (Psst: St Louis has an amazing cocktail scene a la Chicago). Everything in Vegas seems so \"corporate\". Velveteen Rabbit fit the bill.\n\nI've been here now about 15 times and taken many visiting friends. It's my favorite place in Vegas, by far. The drinks are innovative, the art is fantastic, decor beautiful and ambianceâ€‹ perfect. They also have a couple gaming machines at the bar if you get the itch.\n\nAntique sofas, unique chandeliers and art work that's right up my alley. I think they also have music and\/or DJ regularly although I've never made it during any. There is also a decent patio for smoking, tanning or stargazing.  Velveteen Rabbit and the Neon Museum are my favorite places in Vegas.
