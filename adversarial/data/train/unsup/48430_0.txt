Have been to a panera breads and they are pretty much the same. Love the the menu. They have great sandwiches, soups, salads, yummy breads, and cookies, muffins and basically just good baked s***! Love their breakfast sandwiches and the amazing selection of breads they have to choose from. Definitely a healthier version of a normal sandwich place or other places like it. This location  has an outside area to eat which is nice. I would say they need to be a little cleaner at this place.
