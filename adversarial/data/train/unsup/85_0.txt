HOLY HELL. I just had one of Kathy's lemon bars. That was the best goddamn lemon bar I have ever had in my entire 25 years of goddamn life. \n\nYou are probably now thinking, \"Well that's not saying much...it's still just a lemon bar. How good can it be?\" Well, if that is what you are thinking, you clearly have never had one of these babies. \n\nJUST A LEMON BAR?! GET THE HELL OUT. \n\nIt is the thick but still crumbly cookie bottom crust topped with a tangy custard layer and then another lemony-sweet layer on top of that, topped with the largest dollop of the freshest and most delectable whipped cream you can imagine. It is the absolute apex of the trajectory of human development from the beginning of time until now, having progressed in such a perfect and divine way as to finally manifest in these not-so-tiny delectable treats, the sweet, dreams-do-come-true, transcendental little wonders of the world that are Kathy's lemon bars. \n\nTHANK YOU, KATHY!!!!!
