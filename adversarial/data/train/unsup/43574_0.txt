Aye this place right here is the SHIT!!! I'm 20, I went in there with my little nephews and we had the time of our life's. I got the 60 minuets jump and at first I like like \"Man this isn't enough time\" fats forward 20 minuets later, I was tired ASF from jumping!!! I swore I was in there for about a hour & a half but it was only 20 minuets. Those kids had me in there running around like I was in a basketball workout or something. But anyway the place this great, staff is cool, and you'll lose about 5 pounds if you decide to jump. Highly recommend
