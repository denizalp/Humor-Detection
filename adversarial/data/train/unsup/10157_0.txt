Where there is smoke, there is usually a fire.  Avoid Mirage Limos at all costs.  Walk, ride a skateboard and tow your guests...anything is better than the frustration of hiring these knuckleheads.\n\nWe hired a party bus to drive 25 family members 2 miles for a rehearsal dinner.  As straight for as it gets, 3 hours in and out.  Rude driver, dishonest owner, and you will get nickeled and dimed no matter what.  Just bake a shenanigan charge of 25% into whatever estimate\/quote you are given.  \n\nYou'll ask to dispute it, owner will call you back...for no other reason than to argue with you about the contract.  Zero concern or interest in making it right.  Save the frustration, and hire ANYONE else.\n\nInteresting side note, got a call 2 days later from the Phoenix PD... that same party bus was impounded later that same night. My wife's lost\/stolen credit card magically appeared on the impounded bus...now considered 'evidence.' \n\nStay classy and client focused Mirage Limousines, and enjoy all of repeat business.
