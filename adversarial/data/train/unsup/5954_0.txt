The perfectly balanced cappuccino -- skim milk, extra shot --warmed the cockles of my heart.\n\n$9.49 for an aromatic pound of Italian Blend espresso beans lovingly roasted on premise had my wallet  -- and then our espresso machine -- singing \"O Sole Mio.\"\n\nNattily dressed coffologists -- sporting plaid button-fronts and page-boy caps -- ignited the same butterflies that drove my obsession with \"Newsies\" in middle school.\n\nSo many reasons to love this little independent wonder.
