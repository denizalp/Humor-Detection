I dined at Wild Thaiger last night with two other people. We were seated on the patio right away. We ordered three dishes and a couple of drinks. The food was great. The flavors and spice level were more authentic than a lot of Thai restaurants I have dined at. \n\nThe four stars I am giving is for the food. Unfortunately, our service wasn't great. The server was very impatient and wanted us to order right away. My drink took about 10min as well. Thankfully the food was the redeeming factor.
