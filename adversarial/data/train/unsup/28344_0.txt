During my trip in Vegas I was contemplating between this place and the juice place they have at Aria. Even though the one at Aria has a special where you can pick 3 juices for $20 I ended up choosing this place over them since they have some more interesting flavors. After browsing through their bottled juices I asked for some samples and got to try their bee happy and bee chill. Bee Happy tasted like chocolate milk despite it not containing any milk and Bee Chill was watermelon, cucumber and lemon. Little did I realize that not all their bottled drinks are equal in price. I paid $14 for bee happy and $12 for bee chill. With tax my total came out to over $28! FOR 2 BOTTLES OF JUICE! Good grief I know this is Vegas and all but charging an arm and a leg for some juice even if they are using organic ingredients is just outrageous. Fortunately I was able to redeem some points onto my Identity card for this purchase.\n\nThe juices were delicious don't get me wrong. I like how they use glass bottles instead of plastic which was one major factor of me choosing to buy juice here over Aria. Dunno if I'll get juice here again though. Definitely worth a one time try though.
