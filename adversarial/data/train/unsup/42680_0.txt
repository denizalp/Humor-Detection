I was stalking the Pizza People Food Truck all week to get a couple passes to Street Eats on Saturday and finally found the truck on my side of town. Drove over to 48th St & University around 1145am and there was already a line formed. Perused the menu board and honed in on the Popeye - spinach, garlic, mozzarella, and tomato sauce. MaryBeth was busy taking orders and taking pies out of the oven. She is very efficient and quick and had a smile for each customer. I had my pie in 10 minutes or so. I could smell the aromas thru the sturdy cardboard box while she handed me two passes (thanks, MaryBeth!). As I was driving back to the office, the smell overtook me and I couldn't wait and carefully removed a slice while I was rushing back over the highway - she pre-sliced the pie too! Gooey yummy mozzarella and the spinach was fresh, as well as the garlic pieces and tomato chunks. The crust was perfect - crisp on the bottom and pillowy crisp on the edges. Sooooooo good.
