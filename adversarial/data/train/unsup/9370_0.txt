I wanted pancakes but I also wanted Eggs Benedict. You see, this is the problem when you travel by yourself. You can't get two plates and share. Well, you *can* still get two plates but then you're just being a pig.\n\nSince I was so indecisive today, I got a \"Benny Duo\" where you can have one Benedict of one type and one of another. The first was with smoked salmon on a slice of pumpernickel. Tasty and excellent. The egg was perfect. The second was with green chile and a potato base of some sort. Also excellent. The chile had a little bit of a zing to it and it improved with a bit of Cholula.\n\nService was excellent, sitting at the breakfast counter. Coffee was refilled and it was good coffee.
