What a joke. I went to this mall and it was a pain to find a parking spot. It was during winter so I helped the mall out by parking onto a snow pile. I ended up getting a parking ticket by a security named D. Aguilar. I called the security office and spoke with him afterwards and he just kept on saying that I took up two spots.
