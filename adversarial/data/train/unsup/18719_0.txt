Best Hotel in Vegas!!!\n\nOK, well maybe not the best but it is for me.  I am not one for the Las Vegas Strip, everything is expensive and nothing is close together.  But there is Old Town Vegas, and the Fremont Street Experience and let me just say it is certainly one heck of an experience.  \n\nThe Golden Nugget is a great Hotel, with plenty of restaurants, bars, slots and table came they even have a night club.  The only thing that can get a little rough here is the smoking, it can get really heavy on the casino floor and it can be a disorienting.  I forgot to mention they also have an amazing pool, and this massive fish tank with large fishes.  \n\nThey have a great bar right outside on Fremont Street where they have great pricing, awesome bartenders, and the best people watching you have ever seen.  If you haven't been to Fremont Street and people watched, well you really haven't experienced Vegas the right way.  Loads of pan handlers and amazing drunk people for hours, it is just spectacular.\n\nWhen ever I come to Vegas this is where I stay, it is my best.
