My favorite buffet on the strip! I particularly like their breakfast. Plenty of everything, they are always putting out hot food. I've had great experiences every time I've gone, and I've gone quite a bit!\nPro-tip: Arrive about 30 minutes before dinner starts to pay the lunch price and be there when they put out the dinner food.
