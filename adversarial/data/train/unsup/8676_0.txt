Staying at the Radisson, we arrived a tad late to do anything but order in.  The front desk handed us several menus and we chose Mineo's.  We ordered Italian Wedding soup, a mini Pepperoni pizza, and an Italian Calzone.  After waiting for 45 minutes, I was given the honor of treking down to the front desk to get my order.  The pizza truly was a mini and had a mediocre taste.  The crust, sauce and toppings were fairly flavorless.  I went over to get some of the soup but I think there must have been a divorce before arriving since there appeared to be some missing items (meatballs) from the bowl.  The broth and noodles had a decent flavor and were not overly salty.  The calzone was burnt on top and so I abstained from eating any of it.  My friend didn't have a smile.  \n\nThanks Radisson!  I think they are getting a kick-back.
