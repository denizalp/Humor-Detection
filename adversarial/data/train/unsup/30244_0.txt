I have to say I'm not sure that some of the other reviewers actually ate in the same place I did but I had a great time here and the food was really good. Starting out with the chips, they do it right. Nicely salted to a point where you will always ask for another basket. The people were great, welcoming and happy. But the one thing that will really get your attention is the ceiling which depending on which room you go into has so many wonderful things tacked on to the ceiling. Hubcaps in one, cameras in the other and then of course there is  . . . Elvis!
