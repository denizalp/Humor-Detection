I really wanted to give this 1 star, except they have a great deal on bottomless mimosas.  We have been going here since the place opened.  It use to be our go to place.  Service has gone down hill.  I was told I can't order the hashbrowns with cheese (I know I can I have many times in the past).  When delivered I asked the food runner \"when did they stop doing them without cheese\". I was told by him 100% can be done without cheese and went back and got a fresh order.  Bartender took forever to come over to us (too busy cutting limes to even look up at the only 2 people pretty sitting in front of her).  Another server told the a bartender \"a lot people are now at your bar\"  he replied \"they can wait\".  This was Super Bowl Sunday.  Get with the program. They even opened 15 minutes late.  Three people were waiting to get the price for the Super Bowl party and we could hear the phone ringing and they never picked up.  I rarely write reviews.  Felt I had this review was needed.  So many place in Vegas to go, I would avoid this one.
