We almost couldn't find the place. It's on the 2nd floor, and it has one of the smallest and most unattractive signs I've seen in downtown Toronto. Anyways, the reviews here made me come here. Being a massive cheapo, I'm always on the hunt for good food at decent prices.\n\nWe had Macau chicken (so called Portuguese chicken but it's not actually from Portugal) and the ground beef casserole. My partner didn't like the ground beef casserole because the sauce was too sweet. It doesn't taste like meat sauce. I tried a little and I agree. It's edible, but not something I'd order again. The Macau chicken is one of my favourites. Here, it's just OK. This dish had several problems. First of all, the rice was separate from the sauce. This is a dish that tastes much better when it's a casserole. Secondly, the chicken pieces were full of bones. I went to Cafe Arc De Triomphe and their chicken was way better. \n\nWe both had the corn chicken soup which came with the meal. It's again, edible. It's not something I'd crave. I'm getting a different soup next time.\n\nLike most Chinese places, don't expect much service. But like most Chinese places, their menu is very extensive. \n\nFrom a purely food quality perspective, the food should be 2 stars. But I'm bumping it up to 3 because it makes me feel like I'm in HK and the prices are ridiculously cheap. They have daily specials at $6.75 and the food portion is large. Comes with soup too. I'd actually come here again just because of how cheap the food is. I like trying new foods and HK cafe food is something I haven't tried much of.
