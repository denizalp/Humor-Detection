My new favourite market.  Brings back some of the old laid back atmosphere of the old Currie barracks location.  Having the pub downstairs is a great way to kick off your grocery shopping. \n\nThe layout is casual and spacious with a few great vendors you won't find at other markets.  Sure, there's your usual suspects such as Sylvan Star and Simple Simon's.  But there's also many other vendors that have a \"small local guy\" vibe. \n\nSince Calgary Farmer's has become a little hectic and overpriced, this will be my new go to. Stoney makes for easy access from the SW.
