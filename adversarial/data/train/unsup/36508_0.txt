The food was pretty good and they give you pretty big portions for the price. The only thing I noticed was the restaurant seems kind of dirty. The menus had dried food on them and looking around they needed to wipe down the light and seats better. I ordered the pollo Rico, it was ok. The chicken was flavored well but a little dry. The burrito was supposed to be crispy but just the top of it was slightly crisp. The rest was just a warm tortilla. I would probably come again, just not my favorite Mexican place. I think Tia Rosa is much better.
