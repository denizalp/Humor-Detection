This place was awesome. The food blew me away honestly. \nIt's inside of the MGM Grand so you have to walk a ways to get there, but the atmosphere is nice. \nThe service is stellar. Super attentive. My water was constantly being refilled and whenever we asked for anything it was there within seconds. \n\nI ordered the prime burger and it was amazing. The meat was primo and cooked perfectly. \n\nThe only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars was because the host podium was poorly organized and became over-crowded. \n\nBut definitely would come here again and would absolutely recommend !
