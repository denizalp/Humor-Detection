This supermarket is where I discovered the caprese sandwich and I will never look back. \n\nFresh bread, pesto mayo, light evoo, plump beefsteak tomatoes, thick bocconcini cheese and a few leafs of basil. Mmm, mmm, mmm. Over a span of a month, I'd say I dine here about 12-15 times with my bff... it's just that good!\n\nEverything else is good too, but I only want to rave about the caprese.\n\nIt's a caprese revolution!
