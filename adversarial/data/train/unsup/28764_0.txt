I order from them a few times. I noticed the ribs are very pricey. I got the half rack of ribs, it's a big piece but for the price, I think it should be more ribs. I actually had my food delivered to me, Amazing customer service. The pizza is fantastic, and I like their chicken fingers and pasta. If you love lots of fries, don't expect to get a lot of fries, with the chicken fingers or any other combos you order. So make sure to order extra fries on the side, cause in the combo meals, they don't give a lot of fries. Other than that, I truly do recommend this place and I will be ordering from them again.
