Ended up here on a mid-week dinner date after a failed attempt at getting a table at Grand Electric (hyuk hyuk). However, this turned out to be one of the nicest Plan B's a girl could ask for.\n\nThere are only a half dozen tables here and some seating at the bar. I can see it getting packed, but it was still early so we were fine sans-reservation. We sat at the bar which was A-OK.\n\nMy date had already been here several times so I trusted him with the menu ordering. Considering there are only 6-7 menu items, it seemed fairly easy to navigate. Items are meant for sharing and we split three.\n\n(Excuse my unusual lack of food photos, I was being polite in front of my date by keeping the phone tucked away)\n\nSpicy Popcorn Shrimp - was actually large shrimp battered in real bbq spiced popcorn. Sounds bizarre but was quite fun.\n\nBeef Tartare - made with peanuts and wasabi. Served with \"shrimp chips\" aka prawn crackers and very delicious.\n\nLettuce Meal - Wow. People need to try this. Braised beef served with large bib lettuce leaves, sticky rice and a plate of kimchi and other goodies. Self-assembly required. Really tasty and fun (reminded me of chicken larb\/laap dishes sampled in Laos and Thailand)\n\nThey had a nice cocktail and wine list too. I had some kind of a gin & tonic concoction. \n\nFriendly bartender and staff.\n\nOverall, I'm a fan of simplicity and this place hits the mark perfectly. I have zero regrets over uneaten tacos from Grand Electric.
