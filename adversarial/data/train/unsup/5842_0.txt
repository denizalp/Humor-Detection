Spice Buffet is located in Planet Hollywood. They have stations split by cuisine from italian, mexican, american,  Mediterranean, seafood, and more. Don't think I ever tried from the italian. I pretty much stick to the rest of the stations, mainly seafood. At one time was my favorite buffet, but each time we come here the food has just been ok. On the bland side really. I like the fact that the crab legs are already kind of cracked for you. I could eat my weight in crab and the prime rib is delicious!
