So I live in Las Vegas, I go to the D for breakfast a couple times per week.  I went there this morning.  Food was so so.  But I was in the mood to drop a 20 in the slots after I ate.  \n\nI went to the ATM to get some cash.  The lowest amount it would allow me to get was $60.  The ATM fee was $5.99 to get that.  \n\nNo.\n\n want to drop a 20 and play for a while that is my choice.  I can take 60 out and still drop a 20 in your machines.  But, I am not going to pay a 6 dollar \"cover charge\" for that privilege.  I cancelled the transaction and left.  \n\nThe reason I am writing this is that I really wanted to tell the D that the so so food on top of a $6 transaction fee to access my money is simply not acceptable.  You lose.  \n\nYou have ATMs in your lobby.  You can control how much is charged.  If it is a buck or two people will pay it, three or more and we will just not do it.  If I cannot access my own cash without feeling ripped off then you will not have a shot at it.  I walked away.  \n\nBut, the most important thing to note is I have to bitch about it here because The D has NO FEEDBACK LINK!  \n\nBy the way the eggs were scortched to the point of not edible.
