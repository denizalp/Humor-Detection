This place does not have filtered water or even water from a tap.  So, don't forget to grab your drink and pay for it with your food.  I didn't realize I could not get a cup of water when I ordered\/paid for my food, so I ended up drinking a bottle of warm water in my car when I was done eating.  Meh.\n\nThis restaurant is down a street I would never drive down.  Most people would probably never pass this store in their commute to any place in the Valley.  The restaurant itself is located inside of a middle eastern (maybe Islamic\/Kosher\/?? as there are no pork products in this store) grocery store.  You will not see the name \"Al-Hana\" on the outside when you drive up, so don't be confused.\n\nI had lunch here last week with the Yelper lunch UYE group with Rand H. I tried their chicken schwarma and the fatoosh.  Both tasted very good to me.  I thought the chicken was over cooked, but the flavor was still there and exceptionally good.  \n\nThe fun part about eating here is exploring the grocery store and standing out like a sore thumb.  I loved checking out all the products.  The herbs and spices you find in whole foods for astronomical prices are not so expensive in there.\n\nI would love to go back and try this place, when I have cash on me.  I hope the 2nd time is the charm!\n\n----------------CASH Preferred.  Credit Card -- $10 minimum---------------
