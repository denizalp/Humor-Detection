Another incredible experience at rocket burger. This is the ultimate dive spot! Food is amazing and like no other. Perfect comfort meal. It's a small quick place so you wouldn't expect the quality of food that comes out of here! I love the wall of the fun soda brands you can't find anywhere else. Always got to get me a sarsaparilla when I'm here! \n\nI love the philly cheese burger. Caramelized green peppers, onions with melted provolone cheese on top. My mouth is still watering!!  There fries are good too! They could be a little crisper but overall they still have a lot of flavor. We got a chilly cheese hot dog too that was very good. Good size hot dog. \n\nHighly recommend! Perfect place to take a friend, family, or even boyfriend\/girlfriend for an amazing casual comforting meal.Thanks rockets! (:
