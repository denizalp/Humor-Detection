The baked goods are fantastic. They have a great selection of scones, cookies and creative desert bars made in-house. They also sell goods, like stromboli, bread and cakes, from other, well-chosen independent bakers. \n\nThere is a small lunch selection as well with soup, chicken salad and both Polish style golumbki and Romanian style stuffed cabbage. It does a Slav's heart good. \n\nThe only problem with this place is the clientele. The average customer is a well-coiffed, Pendleton wearing, fifty\/sixty something, Vera Bradley type who is willing to push, elbow, step on and otherwise maul you so that she can get her pumpkin crumblies first. Seriously ladies, I have a cast! Have mercy!! It's happened every time I've been in there. It doesn't help that the staff helps their friends first, regardless of how long you've been waiting. \n\nSo go get your yummies, just be prepared to fight for them.
