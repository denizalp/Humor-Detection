A fine establishment all around from service to atmosphere. The decor is inspired by the Greaser culture with lots of crucifix and taxidermy for some reason. The real cool thing is the vibrant atmosphere and camaraderie you become a part of when you sit on the barber's chair. There's lot of fun uncensored guy banter going around not any of the pathetic small talk you get at the salon. To set exceptions straight, this is a manly place where people that cut your hair are barbers not stylists. They look at little bit more like Tom Hardy in Bronson and little less like Tom Hardy in Marie Antoinette. The place smells like petroleum and barbicide not lavender or tea tree oil. \n\nThe work was top notch, as good as it gets really. I am definitely going back for seconds soon even though I'll be missing the sensual scalp massages at the mall salons.
