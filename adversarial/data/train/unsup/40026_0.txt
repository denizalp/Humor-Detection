My husband had been telling me about this bread of his childhood for years. We finally visited Pittsburgh and I got to taste it for myself. I totally get it now! This is the best bread on the planet! I don't know what their secret is but it melts in your mouth! People are lined up on what does not look like a busy street - for what is the most amazing bread from people who seemed willing to go the extra mile for their customers. No wonder my poor husband gets homesick for this bread!
