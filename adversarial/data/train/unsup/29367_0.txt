I was driving home from work and the transmission was slipping,it died on Atwood avenue just before 4 in a 4 o'clock no parking zone, up pulls a parking cop and behind her a tow truck from Schmidt's towing,I thought it's only going to get worse. She said looks like your having a bad day ( No Ticket ! ) Schmidt's towed me into a legal parking area around the block ( No Charge)  investigated the problem, I needed a tow. Who am I going to call yes Schmidt's towing ,nice people nice price,nice day!!! Next review the transmission shop.
