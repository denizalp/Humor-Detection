I was so disappointed in my treatment.  You figure that if your spending $160-$190 for a 50 minute massage it should be great. Mine was not.  First of all, the therapist took me in 5 minutes late, but did not compensate on the other end and only ended up giving me a 40- minute massage. About 5 minutes during the massage was spent walking around the room getting heating pads and cloths.  At their cost, you are paying $3.20 per minute and I was cheated 10 minutes which is not an insignificant amount of time. Complete waste of money. And to make matters worse, I told my therapist where on my body to focus and had to reinforce that request TWICE during the treatment because she was not complying.  When I went to the front desk to explain my unsatisfactory experience, they only offered me a 30% discount on my next service. The last thing I want to do is go back to this spa to get ripped off again.  Unfortunately, for Joya, I am a local and will tell others about my experience.
