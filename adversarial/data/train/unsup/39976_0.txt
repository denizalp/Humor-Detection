The food was actually half decent, but the service was terrible, and I say this as someone who has been a server most of my adult life. It takes me a lot to actually rant about something like this. Long waits, a complete lack of \"caring\" by the waitstaff. They pored the wrong beer twice. I have a picture of all of the employees standing around, talking and eating while the restaurant was mostly full but don't have the heart to post it. I won't be back.
