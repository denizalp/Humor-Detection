Spoke with Bill on Thursday (7-5) after my garage door started to separate and bow in the middle (originally found them from one of the fliers you receive in the mail). Had a great conversation and he gave me his best price including all what comes with it.\n\nAfter calling three other garage door contractors who were less personable and more expensive with each call (plus needing to wait 2-3 business days to get on the schedule), I called Bill back and he was able to get me in the next day! \n\nHis two techs were friendly, had my new door installed in about an hour, and did a very good job of cleaning up after themselves. \n\nMy only negative mark is they showed up about 1 1\/2 hours later than my scheduled time, and I had to call the office to find out when they would arrive (it would have been appropriate to get a call near my appointment time to say they are running behind), I could have stayed at work another hour or so instead of leaving as early as I did. Other than that, they did a great job and I will definitely us them again and will recommend them for sure! 4 1\/2 stars
