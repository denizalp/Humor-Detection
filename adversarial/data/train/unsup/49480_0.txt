Mediocre at best. Had my car detailed and after over 80 dollars in charges, the cup holders still had coffee and tea spills in them and the back seat still had dirt\/sand on it. The rest of the vacuuming was okay but I definitely wouldn't call the service a detailing. See the guys at Doctor detail in the SW instead - they do a great job every time!
