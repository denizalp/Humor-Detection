Perfect Hang Over Dinner consisted of:\n\n(1) Mac and Cheese Bits - Tater tots with amazing cheese dipping sauces. I can eat these all day.\n\n(2) Grilled Steak - I did not like the sides (where were they), but the steak was decently portioned and grilled medium-rare.\n\n(3) Donut Holes with Caramel and Chocolate Sauces - I love friggin donut holes so these were the perfect finale to the Hang Over Dinner. Carmel was awesome, didn't care for the chocolate.\n\n$36 prix fixe menu? Hook it up. Wasn't bad at all.\n\nAfter dinner, went to bed and crashed out. Good times.
