I'm restoring a '63 MGB and it was time to move it from my grandpa's garage to my own so that I could finish restoring it. My dad and I rented a two wheel dolly from U-haul to tow the car over, but about half way between the garages the rear wheels started locking up. I called City Wide to get a flatbed sent over.\n\nThe dispatcher I spoke to said it would be \"within the hour, if not sooner if a driver frees up\". I was fully expecting to have to wait a full hour but the tow was there in about 20 minutes. The driver's name was Dwayne(?). He said it was our lucky day that he was sent because he's had a lot of experience towing classic vehicles.\n\nThe driver was extremely friendly and courteous, but most of all, he was careful with the car. He watched the tow cable carefully when pulling the car up on the bed, stopping when the cable was going to hit and possibly scratch the underside of the bumper, to put some cardboard between the bumper and the cable.\n\nUnloading the car was the same deal. Slow and steady getting the car perfectly placed in my garage, not just dumped off and calling the job done. Excellent service.
