I have been here a million times. \nEach time I love it.\n\nWhy not five stars? The ordering \"line\" or lack there of is...weird. Everyone is staring at the food behind the glass and people then cut in front of them. It's a free for all.\nMaybe have several people !at all times! taking orders instead of guys randomly walking up and asking for your order to type it into the iPad then the cashier has to reiterate everything all over again.\n\nI have had several vegan daily specials and have ordered the standby vegan burger. Everything was well prepared and flavorful.\n\nTheir iced almond drinks, almondmylk lattes and other drinks are amazing.\n\nI really love their iced black tea. Perfectly balanced, needs nothing but another refill :D \n\nI will continue to love PublicUS as much as possible.
