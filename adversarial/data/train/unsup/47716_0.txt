Tried this car wash for the first time today.  The machines gave my car a shine that no other wash in the valley was able to pull off.  All the machines in the tunnel looked brand new and the air hoses dried my car efficiently.  I got the 15$ wash and next time I come back I will be signing up for a monthly plan.  After taking a look at my car outside the wash I was greeted by Adam the manager who asked me if everything was okay.  Great service!!!!  I am bringing my dirty hog back every time!!
