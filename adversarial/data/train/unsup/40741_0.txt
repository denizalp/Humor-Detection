Bland food, tiny portions - dinners looked like appetizers - and big price, not a combination for a positive review or a return visit. Our server was the best part of the meal - by far.\n\nWant good Mexican? Go to Juan's Flaming Fajitas on Tropicana, off the strip a few miles, well with the trip ......see my review of Juan's for more info.
