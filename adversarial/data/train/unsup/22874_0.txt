I discovered I-naba maybe in May of 2013, not quite sure the exact date but nevertheless, I love this place.  \n\nEvery time I am in Vegas I have to come eat here.  \n\n5 stars for the food.  I love their soba, it's delicious whether you get it hot or cold and their udon is good too.  I mean who doesn't love a good soupy dish when you're nursing a Vegas hangover?  Their salads that they give you before the meal is really good too.  I love the sesame dressing and unlike other Japanese places, all the times I have been here the lettuce was never wilted and the salad was always fresh.  You know when you go into a restaurant you can obviously tell when their salads been sitting there and they try to cover it up with dressing?  Yeah, never at I-naba.  Their combination specialities that they have on a separate  piece of paper when they give you the menu  are probably your best choice.  It comes with salad, choice of udon or soba, hot or cold and an entree.  \n\nSo far I haven't had anything bad here.  I love it and force everyone that comes with me to Vegas to eat here.
