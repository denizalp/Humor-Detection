This place is always consistently decent. A nice atmosphere, and friendly staff. Its great to find traditional Irish pub food in a fun and friendly place. I love that they have games outside like cornhole and I always have a positive experience here. \n\nMy favorites are the shrimp platter with lobster sauce, and the guiness short ribs!
