I love the ice cream bars and sandwiches here. I have only had the vegan ones but jesus lord they are great. They are so creamy that I gave one to an unsuspecting friend and he loved it and couldn't tell that it was vegan (ha, mission accomplished). Their cakesters always look so adorable too, I can't wait to try more items!
