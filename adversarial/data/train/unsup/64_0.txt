One of the best bars I have been into! What a gem for Charlotte! I was in town for 3 days and this was hands down the best bar we went to. \nThe decor and ambiance you can not beat. Love love loved the hand painted ceiling! And the chandeliers and paintings were all very fitting with the decor. They played great music! And it was just music over a speaker and it was better then the live DJ we saw earlier in the night and the live band we saw the night before. We even made our own dance floor. \nThe drinks were great! I had everything from a martini to a Margherita to a Moscow Mule and they were all delicious and well priced. Nothing was over priced like all the other bars in Charlotte. I unfortunately did not eat here but after looking at the menu I wish I would have. Will definitely return to try out the food. \nThe service was the best part! Everyone was so attentive. They were so busy but we still never waited longer then 3 minutes to get a drink. We talked to 3 different bartenders and they were all great. Even the back of bar staff was friendly and noticed we were standing and tried to help us with seats without us even asking!\nCan't beat the location either it was right beside my friends apartment in a great neighborhood downtown.
