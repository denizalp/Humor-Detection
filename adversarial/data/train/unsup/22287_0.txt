If you're looking for a cheap, no frills gym, then this is the place to join.  Fairly clean facility, though women's showers have had mildew lined shower curtains.  At peak times it takes a bit to get checked in, but I've never waited more than 5 minutes and it is usually because the front desk seems understaffed.  Plenty of treadmills and ellipticals to hop on and they are iPod ready with neat built in headphone jack.  I typically like to use the free weight section of the gym, but this is definitely the meathead hangout.  Can be challenging to get a bench during peak times.  Biggest gripe with the club is that they have clearly posted rules about what you can and cannot wear or else \"you'll be asked to leave,\" but this never happens.  Plenty of people in there lifting and wearing jeans with Timberlands.
