The only reason we tried this place is because I bought a groupon (without checking yelp first let me add) but regardless, I didn't want it to go to waste so we stopped in. We called for a 6:30pm reservation only because the groupon said we needed one only to be told they couldn't accommodate us until 7pm. That's fine but we got there at 6:50pm and there were 3 tables hmm...  Anyways, onto the food, the salad bar seemed that of a banquet or like someone's graduation party like it's been sitting out all day. I didn't think it was horrible though. \n\nThe meat wasn't anywhere near on par with the likes of Fogo de Chao or Texas de Brazil and it wasn't awful but it wasn't good either. My boyfriend absolutely hated it though and he's a steak dude. \n\nAlso, fried bananas were literally just that, fried in breading. They tasted like a mozzarella stick with a banana inside. Just weird. \n\nOur waiter was really nice though!  But he also added, like literally wrote in a \"suggested tip\" price. I work in the service industry and tip 20% always but this was just funny to me. I would NEVER write this on a guests check. \n\nUnfortunate because the decor and set up of the restaurant is kind of nice but needless to say, we won't be back.
