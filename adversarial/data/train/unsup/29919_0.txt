Lied to my about getting a second key fob for my vehicle. When I went to pick up Reg. Papers and fob they acted like I was from mars and no one knew about the second fob. \nApparently not much has changed in the car game. Funny thing was, I was going to purchase a 2nd car there that same day. But once you lie to me, I am done with you.  So for the lousy $ 100 fob you lost a good customer.
