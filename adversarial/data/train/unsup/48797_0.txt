I never drive through the area without  stopping at Lucky's for some shrimp pakoras and chilli chicken.  The place is the epitome of consistency.  The warm tantalizing pakoras are always perfectly fried with the right proportions of dough, shrimp and green chilli peppers.  The staff are courteous and on the ball.  Another location further west would make my life easier and fatter.
