Here's what a REAL experience at Parker's is like:\n\nParker's has been Queenie's place for daycare (and lots of overnights!) for close to 8 years - and they are truly amazing! Queenie's excitement every single morning is proof. I'm just thrilled knowing my girl is so well taken care of and is always happy when I pick her up at the end of the day. Everybody from management to staff is wonderful - they are knowledgeable, passionate, professional and so attentive. It's clear they take the time to know your dog so they can provide the best quality care. I could not imagine our life without them, and I know it would be impossible to find another kennel that could even come close to offering the experience we are so familiar with and ever so grateful for....Thank you to everyone at Parker's for always ensuring Queenie's care comes first.
