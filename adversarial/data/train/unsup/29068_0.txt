First and foremost, I live in Texas.. San Antonio to be exact.. And I was visiting CLE for work. When my coworkers wanted to take me to a taco joint for lunch I looked at them like they were crazy. I live in SA where tacos are their own food group where they are eaten for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert. But, I decided to pursue the adventure. I figured I can't knock CLE tacos without trying it first.\n\nWe arrived on a Friday during lunch time. It was a beautiful 60 degree sunny day and the place was packed. We sat on the patio within minutes and I was getting a crash course on the menu from my coworkers. Meanwhile, the waiter never.. I repeat never.. Came over to ask us for water or help with the menu. If it wasn't for my coworkers I would have been lost on what to order\/how to order.  \n\nMoving on, 15 minutes later, the waiter still never came by for our order or drinks at least. I was very disappointed and this was my first impression. We finally get up and ask for our waiter. He came by and gave us water. He didn't ask if we wanted anything else to drink or asked if we had questions with the menu. I did not get his name as he never introduced himself to us. Nonetheless, We gave him our orders and the food was promptly served. I will say the chips and salsa that are provided are amazing! Tangy, but sweet with a hint of spice. We ordered the pineapple guacamole and queso. Both items I highly recommend. \n\nThe tacos are delivered to the table wrapped in foil and with a fork on the side. In Texas this is not common, but I pursued onward. The tacos overall weren't bad, but they were messier than I was expecting. I was impressed with the \"stoner\" which is a flour tortilla wrapped around a crispy taco with queso and chorizo in between (let your mouth finish watering after that comment). \n\n1 star for ambiance and patio - If I wasn't there for lunch with coworkers then I would have definitely enjoyed a margarita or two. \n\n1 star for pineapple guacamole, queso, chips and salsa.  \n\n1 star for the \"stoner.\"\n\n0 stars for service - Overall, they need to improve on their customer service.\n\n0 stars for serving tacos with a fork - This is just not necessary. \n\nWould I come back for appetizers and drinks after work?: Absolutely!
