You want to stop here to try their tacos for a while finally have the chance I ordered to lingua and two asada the lingua was not good taste like they didn't clean it very good I don't really chewy not soft and tender like it should be it had a weird aftertaste now the asada was was just ok it tasted old or could have been just over cooked may give another try not too sure though
