I LOVE me some Cafe Rio. So after a long day at wet n wild we were excited to come to our favorite spot. I understand this location is fairly new, so I'm giving them a little learning curve. I ordered cheese enchiladas. The rice is super crunchy and I had to ask for fresh guacamole because the one on the line was brown. I was going to get a salad, or tacos but all the meat looked dried. The drink bar was really dirty. There's was a hair on the straws even. We'll try it again this summer, hoping for a better experience.
