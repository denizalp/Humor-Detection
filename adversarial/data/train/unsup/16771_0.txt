The perfect bar hangout for Caesars, sports and popcorn. Free popcorn for patrons, might I add?\n\nVery Quebecois vibe and with a name like L'Barouf, no one should expect anything else. During World Cup festivities there was \"le football\" on the TV and plenty of fans watching intently.\n\nNot me, I was fascinated by the drink in front of me, with Clamato juice and a Montreal steak salt rim. Yes, a good old fashioned Caesar had my full attention.\n\nBeyond the obvious drinks and sports, there's ample seating at the bar and in the booths. Probably a good spot for tourists and locals alike to enjoy the simple things in life. And there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.
