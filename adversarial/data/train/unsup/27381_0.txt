I only wish that I had come to Yardbird when I had more time to enjoy more dishes.  I highly recommend coming here if and when you have the chance.  \n\nThe service was friendly and quick but without being made to feel rushed.  \n\nI had a local beer, a red (can't recall the name of it) that was very good along with my meal.  \n\nI started with the Warm Farmers Cheese and Watermelon app which was light and tasty. \n\nFor my main dish I went with the Shrimp and Grits which have to be the best I've had.  It wasn't easy skipping the chicken that everyone raves about but this is one of my fav dishes and I'm glad I went with it.
