The key word for Fuzzy's is bland. This is some of the most taste-free food I've ever had. Earlier this year I purchased a Groupon worth $10, and on my way home from Art Fair on the Square I decided to stop in. \n\nFuzzy's is inexpensive, so I ordered the taco plate (2 soft shell - chicken and shredded beef, with Mexican rice and fried potatoes for the sides), chips & queso, and a soda to bump me up past the $10 mark. \n\nThe signature of Fuzzy's is their unorthodox toppings - in addition to your standard lettuce\/tomato\/guac\/etc, they include feta cheese and garlic sauce. At least they claim to, anyway. On my tacos there was maybe three little crumbles of feta (which in combination with the other cheese is enough, but not really enough to add any flavor), and I didn't taste any garlic at all. \n\nThe tacos are heaping and meat-heavy, but again - little flavor. I probably could have closed my eyes and not been sure which taco had chicken and which had beef. The rice was okay, and probably the most flavorful thing overall. The fried potatoes had a slightly undercooked generic potato flavor. The chips and queso is ridiculously large - for $3 you get five or six servings of chips and somewhere around 1-1.5 cups of melted cheese. This would be an awesome deal if the queso wasn't so blah. \n\nFuzzy's seems to be going for some sort of Tex-Mex\/Mexicali hybrid, and for me it just doesn't work. What little flavor the dishes did have was not a flavor profile I enjoyed. I had hope for Fuzzy's being that it was a Texas chain -  while living in Texas I had plenty of cheap, chain Mexican food that wasn't great but was miles above Taco Bell. I was hoping Fuzzy's would be in the same category, but the only part that reminds me of the food I enjoyed down south was the fact they had Dr. Pepper and Fanta on tap.
