Never going back, terrible experience.\n\nThings wrong with this restaurant:\n\n1) Service: I almost never complain about service, but sometimes it's just over the line.  We ordered an additional salad with our entrees not knowing that they had come with them.  Twenty seconds later, they brought us our free salads, and we tried to cancel our other salad.  \"It's too late, cannot cancel\", our waiter said, and briskly left our table.\n\n2) Salad: the salad was horrible.  The lettuce chunks had lots of water on them (at least they were washed I guess?) and the sauce was thick and salty.  Not at all appetizing, and we couldn't even cancel the big one that we ordered by mistake (see #1)!\n\n3) Sushi: fish aside (quality of the fish I can excuse, since they all taste the same at low prices), the rice was completely wrong.  The rice was cold and dry, and there was not a hint of vinegar in it.  Rice ball with fish on top does not equate to sushi.\n\n4) Soba: the soba noodles looked light green instead of brown, and tasted like white Chinese noodles.  The soba tsuyu tasted like watered down soy sauce.\n\nThat was the worst \"Japanese\" food I ever had, I would be ashamed to even call it Japanese.  The AYCE sushi down the street is much better.
