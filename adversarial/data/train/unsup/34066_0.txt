First...\n\nTHE FOOD:\n\nPre-fixe pay structure: \n$32 for 2 courses (main + app, or main + dessert) or \n$39 for 3 courses (app + main + dessert)\n\n-add a $6.50 glass of merlot (only option by the glass) and the total, including tax and tip = $50\n\ni had the main+app combo. \nfor the app, i chose the grilled portobello mushroom with balsamic and shaved parmesan (quite passable) and for the the main, veal described as lightly battered with a lemon glaze, vegetables and roasted potatoes. everything about this entree reminded me of the 'special holiday meal' a workplace cafeteria might offer employees, come christmas or thanksgiving -- except that I'm confident that a cafeteria version would've been better. the veal had been pounded into oblivion so as to be paper-thin, yet was still rawhide-like in texture, completely void of  taste, including any hint of lemon flavouring. the vegetables and potatoes were...string beans and... potatoes, doused with oil and salt (and the potatoes accompanied w\/  -- I'd guess -- a  'clubhouse'-type chicken gravy)\n\nTHE EATING-IN-DARKNESS EXPERIENCE:\n\nthe initial cheaps laughs that came from being in absolute darkness (e.g. trying to connect glasses for 'cheers-ing', constant din of glassware breaking, using ones hands to locate and paw food off the plate after giving up on the fork-stabbing) wore off pretty quickly.  And, sure, it gives pause as to how it would feel to be visually impaired\/blind but, of course, only in a fleeting way (having the comfort of knowing sight will be yours again very soon).  \nSoon enough, my thoughts turned to\na) the racket they've got goin' on, since they've a captive audience (no other place offering this experience in TO) and considering the price and how sub-par the quality and quantity is (not to mention the money saved on d√©cor and electricity), this joint's a goldmine\nb) wishing someone would open up a place with the exact same concept but with decent food -- a little competition would have 'o noir' down and out within 2 weeks. \nand that would make me happy -- partly because the food on offer is  COMPLETELY incidental to the gimmick of eating in pitch-darkness but, mostly, because it's insulting to diners everywhere to serve cafeteria-grade slop but merchandise it under the philosophy of 'thoughtful\/exotic dishes created to challenge your palate as you use your remaining 4 senses to distinguish flavours perhaps otherwise unappreciated.'  Eesh.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: save the (minimum) $50\/pp this'll cost you for patronage at establishments that actually attempt to deliver what they're trying to sell(!)
