I would give this place zero stars if possible. Where to begin?\nA waitress who died and came back to life miraculously.....as regulars we were all genuinely in mourning, when is service, where to send flowers, etc. Turns out she was in jail.... And this seemed to be a great cover story.\nVery inappropriate shenanigans going on among staff....sexual favors, God knows what else, etc. \nOwners drunk barfly wife calls a black friend of ours \"house bigger.\" I changed the first letter....I kid you not! \nWhat is more disturbing is that she was so drunk she mistook our friend for a different patron who it was apparently OK to say that to....\nOwners son is a punk fight starter. \nJust about every regular who kept the pkace in business its first few years has been 86'd including a regular band that played there...lol. Dysfunctional. \nSometimes you can't take the former hockey player out of the gutter. \nOh, but the food is pretty decent!
