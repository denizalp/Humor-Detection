Define: sage  \/saj\/\nNoun: \nAn aromatic plant (Salvia officinalis) of the mint family, with grayish-green leaves that are used as a culinary herb.\nA profoundly wise man.\nAdjective\nHaving, showing, or indicating profound wisdom.\n\nThis place totally deserves its name!  We didn't do the tasting menu (which I regret a little), and also didn't get any cocktails (also, a miss - they looked amazing and I overheard people at the table next to us praising them). I think that our menu choices weren't really \"sage\", we got some wine, I got catfish dish and my fiancé got a Kobe steak.  Both dishes were great - presentation, taste, just the right wise combination of spices, perfect portion size. However, I must say that I liked the sides more than I liked the proteins - I had amazing pea puree and my fiancé's parsnip puree made me reach out to his plate a few times.  \nHowever, the reviews of dishes in this restaurant are irrelevant - their menu keeps changing... The dishes from previous reviews are not longer available. But I am sure, that if you take a tasting menu, you will not regret!
