Went to AAA Army Surplus a while back in the hopes of finding a marine captain hat for my bf and his giant head (or more accurately his gelled Luke Perry hair circa 1992.)\nWe had been searching for a hat that fits all week at places like Exile and King of Kensington with no luck of finding a big enough hat.\n\nWe start looking at the various captain hats hanging from the top of the racks and were immediatly asked if we needed help. I explained what we were looking for and it turns out what I wanted was actually an airforce captain hat and not a marine one (which is usually white). These guys were super helpful and although the price was a bit higher than what were were wanting to spend (the hat was %50 and our budget was $30) it was an actual authentic hat that looked far better than anything else we were able to find. \n\nI would totally recommend these guys for a costume party, halloween or your kinky uniform needs ;-)
