I love the fish tacos here...actually i'm kind of addicted to because I always crave it. I prefer to have it without the cilantro because it's kind of over powering. The batter on the fish is perfect! It's light, crispy and not greasy. The tuna poke is okay sometimes it's too salty. The burgers look amazing but it was just okay. The rest of the menu looks good but I've never tried it yet because of the darn fish tacos! The service is pretty fast and I will be done lunch in less than an hour.
