Per my last visit, CAS,  you changed my oil and washed my hoopty.   So. Goddamn.  Good. (minus the fire and brimstone lecture). \n\nWith high hopes I came back with my  new albeit extremely economical ride, but somehow you couldn't figure out how to get the crumbs outta my cavernous cup holders (Big Gulp \/ Polar Pop accommodating).  My shit was sparkling on the outside , but  after I looked under my  floor mats (anal-retentive, I know) it became obviously I 'choose poorly' concerning the 'basic' car washy package.  Maybe, next time, move the floor mats around a bit? - let me know you tried. I thought about re-vacuuming when I got home, but I'm lazy and fat - hence me paying for the suds.   \n\nWhat a' Picard face-palm' of a 12.99$ 'Basic' car wash - ain't doing that again.  I'm sorry I refused your upgrades when it came time for me to hand over my 'whip'.  I'm cheap, but you don't haveta punish a man for being frugal.
