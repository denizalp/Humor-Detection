I hate to complain but the first time I ordered from here, the food was so good. Ordered the Teriyaki Burger and it was amazing! Worth the $1.50 up charge because it had the lettuce, tomato, and onion. Today was disappointing because it was just bread, a broken burger, 4 pieces of pineapples, cheese, and teriyaki sauce all wrapped up in brown paper (spent $10.75 for the meal and $1 for delivery). Called to confirm that burgers come with lettuce tomato and onion. She states yes they do and offered to give me a side of it. I am NOT waiting for sides that SHOULD be on the burger. There was no offer to make a new burger and expects me to wait so I can enjoy my cold burger that is no longer appealing. Thanks for the motivation to bring my own lunch.
