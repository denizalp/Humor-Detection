This was a fun event and a great Burstday!  Yes, Nikki was celebrating her one (1) year anniversary and she did it with an event that I believe was enjoyed by all.\n\nI liked the table of four (4) setup and the games of cornhole and exaggerated cup size pong as I feel it encouraged interaction with fellow Yelpers...the libations from Sailor Jerry and Serra Nevada helped too.  While all the food from Pinky's is a little heavily weighted toward the fried side, it was a perfect compliment to the available beverages.  I appreciated receiving the nice red tumbler, which is a perfect addition to my Yelp collection (and my desk at work).  \n\nI would like to give a big thanks to all the sponsors, including Poprock Photography who captured the event.\n\nFinally, the biggest thanks and shout out goes to Nikki Wolfe for being an amazing community manager this past year!  I look forward to her next Burstday and another Yelp-tastic year!
