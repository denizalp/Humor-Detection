There was nothing redeeming about our experience here aside from the company we were with! Party of 12, bill $1,000+ no auto gratuity and they charged $10 for a birthday dessert??? \n\nFood was mediocre on a good day - steak = blah, sea bass = tasteless (though will say it was a decent portion size, but for $40 I expected a bit more), sides = bland & over priced for size of the dish. \n\nAll in all I could have spent $90 less (ended up being $100\/pp) and been content with a $0.99 cheeseburger from McDonalds and a $10 bottle of wine from the store! \n\nI do NOT recommend and will NOT go back. Many other places in the valley and in Old Town to get a phenomenal dining experience for the price vs this place. Be forewarned...
