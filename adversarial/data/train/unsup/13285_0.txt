I've been back many times for lunch, and finally had the opportunity to come for dinner tonight.  It was AWESOME!!!\n\nGreat beer selections and awesome menu. We had the beet salad, steak, fiddlehead ferns and duck fat poutine.  The fiddlehead ferns were delicious...I probably could have done without the poutine LOL (also delicious though!).\n\nThe service was great - very attentive, they addressed us by name from our reservation, Chef Connie stopped by to make sure everything was OK with our meal.  I love Charcut!
