This is a little \"hole in the wall\" which makes you feel you are in Italy.  A must place to get good italian food in Vegas.  They even have an accordian player that travels from table to table while you are dining and his is very entertaining.  The price includes salad\/soup, entree and cappucino.  And best of all....all the wine you can drink!  Love this place.  Took friends there for first time and they wanted to go back every nite.  Good is plentiful and good.
