This was the worst salon I have ever been too. The stylist spent the whole time talking about how drunk she was the night before and how she wasn't feeling well. When I left the salon she didn't show me my whole cut and when I got home I realized that there was a 2 inch difference from the left side length to the right. When I emailed management a picture of my hair, I never got a response. It took me over 6 months to finally have my hair fixed from her cut. It was unbelievable. I would NEVER recommend this salon to anyone.
