I've been here 3 times on the last 2 weeks. I've enjoyed all the sandwiches I had so far. The staff are efficient and polite. Premises are clean. I love the decor and the outside sitting area. It's a pity all the young guys with the navy blue tops, hanging outside and been loud. Iit takes the chic factor away. A sandwich with ciabatta bread just over $7 and full of flavour!
