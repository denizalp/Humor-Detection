Buy a cookie!\n\nFarm is basically like a Denny's or iHOP, which a smaller menu and some of the best cookies you'll ever eat in your life.\n\nI frequent Aliante quite a bit, and when I'm tired of the food court options or TGIF's, I'll stop by farm. They have a $4 lunch special daily, which is enough to keep you going (minus the 6 chicken wing special). The food is nothing that you'd crave and write home about. Just basic diner cuisine. \n\nThe have a small selection of baked good that you can pop in and purchase. The first time I went in I was appalled by the fact that they only have one type of cookie, but then I tried it and it made total sense. The cookie is a chocolate chip, oatmeal, walnut cookie. It's soft, big and chewy, and you get a bit of each ingredient with every bite. It's one of the best cookies I've ever eaten. A must try.\n\nCookies - 4.5 stars. Everything else - 2 stars at best.
