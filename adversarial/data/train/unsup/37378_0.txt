Great customer service! Irene was so nice. She picked out beautiful dresses for me to try on. She was very helpful. They didnt have the dress that I wanted to try on from their catalogue, but she pulled out a very similar bridesmaid dress. I ended up buying that dress and it saved me a lot of money. The only reason why Im giving them 4 stars is because the some of the dresses I tried on were dirty. But all in all, the experience was great.
