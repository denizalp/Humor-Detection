Wow...these guys really built one classy pizza joint out in the northwest boonies! And I mean CLASSY.  Beautiful free-standing building.  Inside spacious, bright, with large tables and comfortable booths. A large, inviting looking bar took up most of one wall, and the open tile kitchen with the visible ovens is another touch of class.  \n\nTo call this place a pizza joint isn't really accurate because they have a fairly extensive menu.  But of couse, it all comes down to the food and service.\n\nThe day I was there, both were very good. My wife and I ordered a house salad and large saugage pizza. I'm a pizza minimalist...to me a pizza is New York style, topped with sausage or pepperoni, plenty of cheese and sauce, and thin and chewey crust.  And that's what I got.  Its almost as good as the pizza in Metro's Decateur location, though it was slightly sweeter and less spicy.  I'm sure it'll all even out in time.\n\nService was fine even though our server announced he was \"In training\". All in all, a delightful dining experience and I'm sure they'll be seeing more of me.
