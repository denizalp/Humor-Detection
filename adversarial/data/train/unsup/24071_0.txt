I was very disappointed. 80$ for two people and here's my break down \nFood- not as \"AMAZING\" as everyone says it to be. My fav was probably the salad because ya can't mess a salad up\n\nService- the people that work here only take responsibility for themselves. An old man was struggling to remember where he was and no one wanted to help him they were pushing each other saying no you do it no you poor guy finally found a nice server to help him. Then the people working in the kitchen while refilling food would be so full of attitude. Well jeez I'm sorry you have to cook more food.... \n\nOverall you're paying for the name Wynn and Encore that's it. Not worth 80$ or 40$ per person
