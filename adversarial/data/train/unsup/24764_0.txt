My husband and I used to play baseball for this bar I love Tom and I love his wife they have expanded the bar .... Now when you comin you don't feel like a can of sardines but I will tell you first time back since I've been in Florida and it took 3 tries to make me a BLT on rye now my girlfriend ordered a hamburger with a garden salad her food was perfect my disappointment is it a sandwich I'm not asking for a steak or pasta or seafood apparently their wings are to die for I've not had them in a while but I will tell you what the reviews when I was there were incredible so I guess next time I come I order their wings...... For anyone from the United States that's considering coming to Canada I ordered two glasses of wine a BLT with a salad on the side the salad actually comes with it my bill was $42 crazy !!!!! 9 ounce glass of wine so all I have to say to any of my friends from the US  stop at duty free before you come here ... you are aloud one bottle or one case of beer that's it xoxox although I'm moving my mom and dad wont back here I'm ready to count down to get back to the United States of America cuz it rocks
