With so many Bubble Tea choices on Bloor St West, it's hard to choose a spot.  Sharetea is popular not only because of its vast menu (so many good options plus seasonal) but it offers more than just your run of the mill sugary stuff.  They do have some gimmicky cute events ... light bulb shaped cups?  \n\nI arrived on a Saturday early evening and the place was clean.  There were more than enough tables for someone to grab.  I only saw one other group sitting down.  The service here was quick to say hello and offer their thoughts on which one was the better flavours.  They do have their most popular ones listed but always check out the walls to see their newest seasonal offering.  \n\nLike most newer places, you can choose and customize your drink.  Freezing cold, moderately cold, or no ice? No sugar, some sweetness, or 'so much sugar you're not going to breath while talking really fast' sweet?  They also offer several different toppings... you can have your regular black boba but they also have coffee, lychee jelly, red bean and a lot of other items.  \n\nToffee black tea - I have to admit, I couldnt decide.  There were so many great flavours.  I went with one of their popular ones.  A caramel rich flavour in a very nice and strong black tea.  It wasn't artificial but reminded me of brown sugar.  I got mine half sweet and it was a good balance between the stronger black tea.  I think more sugar would be too sweet.  Boba was cooked very well and generously given. They were nice and chewy without being gummy or too hard.  4\/5\n\nI think with the large and interesting menu, I would be coming back to try more.  With it's quick service and well made drinks, I found it to be one of the better places I've tried.
