Great little vacuum store on the east side - they'll try to sell you a Riccar vacuum, which is kinda pricey, but believe me, they're right. Best vacuum I've ever used. Forget Dyson. Oh, and they'll demo the vacuums for you and explain everything. Really nice guys and worth checking out if you're in the market for a vacuum that's not a piece of junk.
