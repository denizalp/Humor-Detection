AWFUL SERVICE!!!  We have ordered from them a dozen times with no problem. Mostly because they are the only place that delivers to our area.   HOWEVER, tonight, our order took twice as long, and the delivery person was lost as she called our house a few times. I called the store to let them know we hadn't received our dinner yet - and was told it was on the way.  They blamed ME for giving them bad directions (i gave them our address).    I called back to speak to a manager -PAUL-   just to explain that we were disappointed.  Instead of an apology, he HUNG UP ON ME.  My husband called back and PAUL got belligerent with him and threatened to \"come over and bash (my husbands) head in\" and used multiple curse words.   I can not even make this up.   Safe to say, we will no longer be ordering from them.  And you shouldn't either.  Unless you want to be threatened.
