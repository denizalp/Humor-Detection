This spot is a definite dive bar. It's cash only. It's never too too crowded. They have regular drinks specials. There's pool, darts, and Big Buck Hunter. It's just a little sticky and smoky in that classic dive bar way.\n\nWe came in here to kill time after visiting the Hoover Dam. Why sit in bumper-to-bumper traffic when you sit at a bar instead? $6 pitchers of beer and Big Buck Hunter kept us entertained for quite awhile.
