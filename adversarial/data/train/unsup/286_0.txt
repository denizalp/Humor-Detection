Find A beautiful place, and get lost in it.\n\nNo truer saying could be used to describe Tivoli Village.\n\nYou wake up on a lazy Sunday mid-morning. Throw your hair up and put yourself casually together. Grab your husband, your lover, of maybe your closest girl friend and head over.\n\nIt's warm, but slightly overcast. The type of weather that urges you to drink something that warms you to your soul and get lost in hours of conversation.\n\nYou find parking, easily, and take your time strolling up the cobblestone paved street ways lined with cute eateries and shops. Each window you pass pulls you in with the promise of unique jewelry pieces and delicious treats.\n\nYou come across the Leone Cafe, order the Leone Latte Especial and have a seat out on the patio so you can really enjoy the entire village. The hustle and bustle of the people enjoying their day. Eating good food, spending decent money.\n\nThis really is a wonderful place to come and get lost in for a few hours. \n\nHighly recommend.
