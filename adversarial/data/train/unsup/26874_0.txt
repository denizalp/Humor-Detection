Had lunch here and it was very quiet. The server was more concerned about getting the TV to work than wait on us. There were several flat screen TVs  and fish tanks against the walls. The restaurant has incense  burning (possible issue if patron has asthma). \n\nFood was average. I found it to be too salty. There was a wide range of Chinese dishes to order and then a dim sum menu. The Chinese menu had no descriptions or photos to help if the patron isn't familiar with the different types of noodles or other items.\n\nThe seating is booths and tables with armless chairs. It is wheelchair and scooter friendly.
