We stopped by here two Sunday's ago in the morning for brunch with a group of four and found plenty of open tables on the patio and in the dining room. We were seated promptly and greeted right away. We started with an order of monkey break and a few cocktails. the monkey break is very sweet but super tasty. I ordered the chorizo and eggs which come with Schreiner's chorizo in link form, which was new for me but enjoyable. My fiance ordered the chicken and waffles, which is not on their online menu but is worth asking about. The chicken was glazed in almost like an Asian sauce and was very moist, he really enjoyed it. Our friends ordered the notorious big burger and biscuits and gravy. We found the biscuits to be very dry but the chorizo gravy was very good. My friend did not enjoy the big burger as much and found it to be very messy. Based on the service and location I think we will be back to explore more of their menu. The building itself is decorated in a hip hop hipster theme and is trendy without being uncomfortable.
