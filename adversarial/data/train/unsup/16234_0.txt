Last minute souvenirs are essentials when returning from any travel right?\n\nI stopped by the Hudson on a Thursday, 8\/3\/17 on a early morning flight. \n\nI stopped by here pick up a few souvenirs for my family and they had the perfect selection of gifts for every age. \n\nThe customer service was stellar to say the least.
