Best local theater I have ever been to. My daughter got us tickets for A Christmas Carol for my birthday. I have previously seen it once at Herberger where we paid a lot more money than this theater. This was just as good if not better. The seating arrangements are great, not a bad seat in the house. I really like how they go up each tier enough that you can see over the person in front of you even when you are as short as me! The actors were amazing, the scenery is fantastic. You really feel immersed in the story. They do such a great job with the small space. \n\nThere is a check in offer for a free drink at intermission. That was a really nice bonus. We bough some cookies as well. They were fresh and tasty and only $2.50 each. The prices are really great for the snacks and drinks. Clean restrooms, nice waiting area while you wait to go in. We will be back for many more shows. Already got tickets for 9 to 5 and Footloose. Great theater!
