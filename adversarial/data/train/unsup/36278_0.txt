I give this location 5 stars because compared to other McDonald's and the fast food across the Hwy, it is managed very well.  They are a machine in the mornings trying to get people through the drive thru.  Employees have always been super friendly and professional.  I couldn't imagine how hard it is to find good help in fast food.  We go to this location once a week and I can judge from a consistency standpoint.  Also, appreciate the support from there employees for buying Girl Scout cookies!
