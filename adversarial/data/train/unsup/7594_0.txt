Ohhh yes. My kind of place. Raggedy, but some pretty delicious duck. I'm an avid patron of this 'restaurant' as I come here and order full ducks often. If you have never had duck, I would recommend you to try it out as its just tasty.\n\nAnyways lets get to it. This place is located right off central in a little corner across the street from the gas station and such. It's a very small spot as its truly just a take out spot. Not quite a dine in place. They have pretty authentic Chinese dishes as when you go in you can see their menu of some bizarre things. \n\nAlso, I wanted to note their sanitary score. Even though its an A, it's not an high A. I think it's not bad considering what they prepare. Stick to the duck, and you will have no issues. The prices are very reasonable as I have been to other duck restaurants and it seemed to be really expensive.\n\nOverall, this place is a pretty good place for some authentic duck with a reasonable price. Take out, take home, and eat it with rice or bread... Awesome.
