The first time I went to India Palace I had to chuckle a bit because, well, it wasn't very palatial. My how the times have changed! India Palace has undergone a major facelift, and it looks marvelous. The entrance has a nice stony fa√ßade, and the interior is simply gorgeous. I was so enthralled by the new interior that I just knew the food was going to be tasty.\n\nUnfortunately, the food was not quite as tasty as the interior. It is a very generous buffet with several vegetarian options. I sampled the korma, chana masala, and a spinach dish. I also tried what I thought was a malai kofta, but I did not see any kofta. The malai kofa dish was very sour, so I did not go back for seconds of that. The other three dishes were good, but were missing a little something. They just did not have the savoriness and complexity that I enjoy. At $11 and change, it is a moderate to expensive buffet, and I have had better luck at a couple of cheaper options in town. \n\nThe staff is very sweet and attentive, and I definitely appreciate that. Although it is not my favorite, if you are on a quest to try all of the Indian Las Vegas has to offer, it should definitely make your list of spots to try. Maybe something will tickle your curry fancy!
