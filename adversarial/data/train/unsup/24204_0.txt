I don't know why they decided to put Vegas' first Golden Corral on the east side, more importantly right next to Home Depot. I guess the thought of buffet food and home improvement go well together?\n\nAnyways, this place is always crowded with family and children. I mean most buffets are pretty loud, but if you're looking to stay away from a mass amount of children then try not to go here.\n\nThe food is alright. It's your basic buffet food - nothing really sticks out. They have your salads, soup, Chinese, American, etc. I did not enjoy the pasta here. It was too bland for my liking. The only good thing I had was the steak. I asked for medium well and it came back medium well with a lot of juice to it. They have a dessert section mainly targeted at candy like M&Ms and gummy worms. They do have a chocolate fondue fountain, but I stayed clear from that because the area was a bit too messy for my liking.\n\nThe part that grossed me out the most though is the workers cleaning out the food section with the same towel. You see them cleaning the section where the sauce from the pasta spilled and next thing he's over there cleaning the Asian section with the SAME towel - smearing food across. It just doesn't seem sanitary to me.\n\nYou can try this place out just to get it off your bucket list, but don't expect much.
