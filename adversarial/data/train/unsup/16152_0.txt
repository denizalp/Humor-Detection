Alcohol, Alcohol, Alcohol!! If you're looking for wine, wine coolers, beer, mixed drink mixtures, or just the hard stuff, you'll find just about everything you would ever need. When I'm looking for a bargain, I always come to Lee's. They always have what I'm looking for and at a good price. \n\nPros:\n1. Friendly and knowledgeable staff - Almost every time I've come into Lee's, someone says \"hello\" as soon as I enter. If I have questions, they're very knowledgeable and are able to help me out in a very timely manner. \n\n2. Large selection - They always have so much to choose from. It's sometimes hard for me to decide what to get, especially if I want to try something new. They always have in stock the items I specifically go there for.\n\n3. Prices - The prices are competitive. I find that many of their items are cheaper then Walmart, Target, Albertsons, or Vons by several dollars. I'm always out looking for a good deal, so anywhere I can find it, I'll buy it there and continue to\n \n4. Location - Conveniently located at the corner of Flamingo and Pecos-McLeod, a straight shot from my house. \n\nCons:\nAt this time, I really don't have any complaints for this location. I've always had a positive experience and look forward to returning to fill my alcohol needs.
