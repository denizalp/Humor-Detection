\"Go shorty.. It's your birthday. We're going to party like its your birthday.\"\n\nThat will most likely be the song you'll be wanting to sing after getting your lady bits taken care of here.\n\nMy friend invited me along to this particular location only because we both live in the southwest area. I much rather prefer this location because I can avoid Las Vegas Blvd and anything near the strip.\n\nNow, if you're considering this place for your first time.. You might be filled with jitters and nerves. I know I was and even though I got a ton of advice from friends.. I still couldn't shake off the nerves. My advice would be to bring a friend along that has gotten it done before to allow for moral support. \n\nThe great thing about this place is that for first time clients it is ONLY $20. It's a steal and a good price to at least try it out and see if you want to continue this particular \"grooming\" treatment. Before you're seen, the staff has you complete some paperwork. My bet would be to keep track if you're a first time client or established. They're pretty prompt on calling you back. I was brought into a room about 2 minutes after returning the paperwork My waxer was named Vanessa and she was completely understanding and sweet throughout my whole experience there. She could tell I was nervous and did her best to ease my nerves. She coached me through breathing when she would pull the wax. I really have nothing to compare the type of wax used here. I do know they use hard wax which is without the paper strips. They let the hot wax dry on you and pull it from there. She was very quick and professional.\n\nAll in all, I am as smooth as a naked mole rat and couldn't be happier with the results. I definitely see myself returning again and again.\n\nThanks Birthday Suit for popping my Brazilian wax cherry =)
