Being Hispanic and a So. Cali native I know authentic good Mexican food. Let's just say Las Vegas is lacking in this area. As a vegetarian it was kind of hard shopping here because at this time of year Christmas homemade tamales is a staple for Hispanic food for the holidays. A lot of people make their own tamales. Carde√±as has prepared masa, dry masa mix and homemade tamales. Most every shopping cart included huge amounts of pork, corn husks & masa. I went for the homemade prepared tamales. I got 3 chicken & Chile, 3 pineapple, 3 strawberry & 3 Chile & cheese for $15.99 +tax. Every tamale is marked so you know what they are. Steamed in a big pot and ready to devour. I like to add red Chile sauce. Delicious.
