Stopped in today for some lunch.  They have 3 different types of iced tea and 3 types of bbq sauce.  My friend had the brisket philly steak and he said it was very good.  I enjoyed the burnt rib tips.  They actually could have been burnt a little more for me but it was good.  I added 2 of their homemade BBQ sauces to it.  The collard greens had little pieces of bacon and was just as good as their macncheese.  The only reason I gave 4stars is that the company apparently only has wifi that can be used by 5 people at one time which is pathetic in 2016.  They had 5 employees so only employees can use the wifi and the guests who pay money can't use it.  The nice lady at the counter told me about the 5 people limit.  Both of us tried to get on wifi and we couldn't even when all the other guests were gone??  Makes no sense to me.
