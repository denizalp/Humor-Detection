This has quickly become one of my favorite places to eat in Charlotte. I have visited multiple times for the dinner and have also gone for the Sunday brunch. The food is outstanding. Well prepared, well presented, with excellent portion sizing and condiment compliment. The prices are very reasonable for the quality you receive.
