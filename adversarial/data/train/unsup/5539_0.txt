Do you own a Forever 21 sequin crop top or pleather skirt that's been sitting in your closet for 6 months?! You can finally wear it here!\n\nI came to Omnia last Friday to see Calvin Harris and it way exceeded my expectations. I come to Vegas for work once a year but don't usually get to 'go out' because my co-workers are all old. This year we brought our 21 year old intern so I forced her to come out with me muhaha. I bought the female pre-sale tickets for $30 each. I knew my work event wouldn't be over until past midnight so I wanted to be on the safe side. We didn't end up at Omnia until 1:45 which was perfect because Calvin had just come on (we're on a first name basis.) My intern and I wandered the first floor but it was packed. Down there it was about 70% fratty looking dudes fist pumping on each other. So, we decided to head upstairs because it looked less crowded. We get up there and see that it's only groups who bought tables that can see from the second floor. We didn't mind too much because it was less crowded so we stayed up there and joined in on the fist pumping. Then, some nice guys from Kansas invited us into their table section so we could see better -- so nice! Once I could finally see, the interior of Omnia is awesome. From the alien spaceship chandelier to the confetti and light show, it was perfect. Calvin was perfect.\n\nIf you don't buy a table or don't think you will get invited to one, I would get there early because it was packedddd. I found it worth it to buy the pre-sale tickets, but it looks like you can also wait in line fo free. 10\/10 will go back.
