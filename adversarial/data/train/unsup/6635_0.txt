FTR! (First to Review).\n\nAre you tired of the same-old same-old when it comes to what you do on your lunch break? Enter Lunchbox Theatre, a curiously compact cultural calling. Running Monday-Saturday, shows start at 12:10 and run about 50 minutes. If you're thinking your stomach won't last a whole 50 minutes, bring your lunch with you! Had I known before I went, I would've tested the pre-order lunch feature for an extra $10. Next time!\n\nRecently, I watched a play called Wanda's Visit. It was fun and quirky, perfect for a midday pick-me-up. The theatre itself isn't all that big, although I bet you could fit upto about 100 people in there. The seats are just regular cafeteria-style chairs (how appropriate!) placed on risers. \n\nSidenote: Lunchbox Theatre is located at the base of the Calgary Tower. The entrance looks like it should be outside, but don't be fooled by those doors, you actually must use the doors to the west and enter the theatre from inside.
