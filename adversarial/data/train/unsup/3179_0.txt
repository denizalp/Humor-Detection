So after I wrote a great review about this place I came back and was extremely disappointed with the produce. I went in after work to get a few things to make salad for dinner and I was seriously appalled at what I saw. The bagged carrots were slimy. The few cucumbers that were left were deformed and bruised. All the strawberries looked brown and the pre-packaged fruits were expiring right before my eyes. The pre-packaged lettuce had like 2 days before it's expiration and was turning brown. You know that section they have in all stores where the stuff is like 75% off or whatever cause it expires that day? That was the quality of all the produce except they were still charging full price. Like does anyone even check to make sure the items are of sellable quality? It certainly didn't seem like it. I will still shop here for other stuff but definitely not produce. Fuck that shit.
