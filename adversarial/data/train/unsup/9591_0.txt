Blinds were nice but extremely over priced. A few days after i bought my blinds I  found a 20% off deal in the newspaper which I asked about. I was told the deal was already applied to my purchase. If they were giving me 20% off why wasn't I told or why wasn't that written on the receipt? Very shady. At this point I realized I was haggled and over paid for my blinds. \n\n I just can't believe I was talked into spending hundreds of dollars on fake wood! Two starts because the installment was fast and easy.
