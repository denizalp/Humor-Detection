Last time I went healthy and got grilled chicken and dry [no butter] broccoli.  It was very good!\n\nThis time I ordered a steak and a potato with a glass of wine.  I remember when I was younger I thought the steak here was pretty good! This time not so much. It was tough and fatty, not so bueno. Didn't like it much at all. My friend ordered steak too! His was over cooked as he wanted M\/R but got M\/W.  \n\nIf you go, I'd shy away from the steak, just eat the bread and drink some wine!
