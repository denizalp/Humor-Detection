Went here cause we saw it on TV and I have to say, NEVER AGAIN! We shoulda walked out when we opened the door, it smelled like puke! It was the dirtiest, stinkiest, hole in the wall bar I've ever walked into to. There was trash cans lined up against the wall, the locals weren't very nice and that Bacon Martini, OMG! That martini is the worst thing ever. We did have the Bacon Bloody Mary and it was freakin' phenomenal! That was the only thing good about this establishment. If you're lookin' for a place where miserable locals hang out this is it. I don't recommend it for 1 second.
