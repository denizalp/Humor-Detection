Let me be one of the first to say the burgers were great ! but the absence of fountain drinks or free refills man that hurts. Being charged  2  dollars for 6oz coke. and 4 dollars for plain iced tea is not good. The cost of our drinks cost more than the food we ordered . PoshBurger more like Cash Burger
