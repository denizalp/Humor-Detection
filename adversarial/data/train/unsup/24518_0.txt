While the food in the bar was very tasty the service was just all over the place. This actually started to get stressful as we were supposed to see Kathy Griffin at the Dodge.. we did manage to get the check in time and made the show. However charging us gratuity in the bar was fucking bullshit since they would not do separate checks.. we should have pretended that we weren't together! With this kind of shitty service I would have NOT tipped 18%, maybe 10%, if they were cute!
