Well, it's been two years since my original review, so I thought it was about time to stop by and see what's new at Gertrude's, and update my review.\n\nFirst of all, I completely stand by my original review, which I've included below.\n\nAs I mentioned, Gertrude's is the adorable restaurant café at the Desert Botanical Garden in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nJust as a note, you don't need to purchase tickets for the Desert Botanical Garden to get into Gertrude's.\n\nGertrude's is still charming, and it was super busy, especially for a late lunch on a Wednesday afternoon.\n\nI found a nice spot at the bar, and the bartender\/server, Jimmy, greeted me and made me feel completely welcome.\n\nI started with the Matcha Bramble, but with vodka, instead of gin. Super Scrummy!\n\nI tried two appetizers: poached shrimp and jicama, and the morsels cheese plate with accoutrements.\n\nThe poached shrimp was a fresh spicy salad with jicama, cucumber, watermelon chunks, feta, and roasted pumpkin seeds.\n\nThe morsels plate had a nice mixed of cheeses, brie, bleu, and a spicy cheddar, and was served with dates, pickled cauliflower, beets, carrots, cranberries. It was very, very good.\n\nI then tried the Cactus Cosmo, which is a gorgeous drink, but a tad dry, so I had Jimmy add a bit of berry syrup, which made it perfect.\n\nFinally, I had to try the fresh cobbler. It takes about 15 minutes to cook, so make sure to order it ahead of time, or be prepared to wait. It was definitely worth the wait. Although, it was served with a bitter lemon sorbet, which was delicious, albeit an odd choice.\n\nDuring my visit, I had the chance to meet Chef Mark Bookhamer, and local gardener, Carl Seacat, of Seacat Gardens, who Phoenix New Times calls his designer vegetables \"pure art.\"\n\nCONCLUSION \n\nGertrude's is a lovely, lovely, upscale casual establishment, with consistently superb and creative selections, and a staff dedicated to fine dining service.\n\n5\/5 RECOMMEND \n\n***************ORIGINAL REVIEW***************\n*************************************************\n\nBACKGROUND \n\nGertrude's at the Desert Botanical Garden is amazing!\n\nOkay, let's start at the beginning...\n\nI took my mom to the opening night of Las Noches de Las Luminarias and the Bruce Munro exhibition at the Desert Botanical Garden. \n\nImmediately to the right is Gertrude's restaurant.

The decor was charming and edgy.\n\nTHE WINE\n\nThe wine list is very interesting. Although not extensive, it's has all the current yummies that all compliment the cuisine.
