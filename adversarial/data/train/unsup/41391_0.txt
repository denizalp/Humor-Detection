Amazing and fun experience. I felt first a bit worried about my dress to be messed. The hostesses were very kind and have me an apron to cover my shirt. My server DANI was fantastic and very thorough about the whole process from A through Z. I never experienced eating on total darkness but especially when dressing well. I will come back again with more friends.
