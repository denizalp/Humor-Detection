Sweet home Wisconsin is the perfect mix of classic Midwestern flavors spiked with a modern and creative twist. Colton, at the bar, immediately greeted us and started mixing specialty cocktails tailored to our liking. The Samsquanch was similar to a Margarita but with a smooth and fresh finish. We also had the Joint Juice which was a refreshing change from the usual smoky bourbon cocktail. This mix was a good balance of spicy and fruity with a tang of ginger. We had the jalapeno poppers and the cheese curds with a siracha ranch dipping sauce. Both appetizers were incredible and as a Madison native some of the best fried cheese curds I've ever had! The sauce really pushed these curds over the edge, I can't even explain how amazing they were!! Chef Jon works in the open kitchen just behind the bar, so you can see the magic in action. We had the Rhythm and Rye Reuben which had the juiciest pastrami and tasty Madison Sourdough rye bread. The pub chips that came on the side were not greasy and subtly seasoned to perfection. We cannot wait for the summer patio and more amazing things from Sweet Home Wisconsin!
