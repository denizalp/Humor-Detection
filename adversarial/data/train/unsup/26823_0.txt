Awesome joint! My friend and I split the nachos and macaroni and cheese burger...  both dishes were phenomenal and left us in a food coma! We learned at the restaurant that there is a special chef that specializes in just cheese for the nachos... it's a must to try this app, you won't regret it!\nThe waiter was also very friendly and helpful in making our food and drink decisions; he told us what beers went best with each dish we were considering. Would highly suggest!
