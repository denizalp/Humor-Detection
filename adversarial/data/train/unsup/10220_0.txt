Just don't. \nFor few hundred dollars I'd expect good food and service \nWe were charged extra for ordering French onion soup with our meal- that came with soup or salad, when we asked about it, the response was that \"French onion is and upgraded soup, it comes in a crock\". Why wasn't that mentioned when we had a conversation about it with the server when it was ordered? \nMy son had to take his steak home to flavor it. My daughter in law had to take her steak home to not only flavor it but continue cooking it  (the server did send it back to be reheated after it was brought to his attn when everyone else was done eating) \nHusband asked for Demi for his ribeye after he realized it was flavorless  and was told they don't have a Demi--- the three other meals that were ordered all had a Demi..W. \ndon't waste the extra $3 to upgrade to a wedge salad \nI ordered the filet medallions- if you want these, Montana meat company has a great medallion appetizer as well as  great service \nApps-- lettuce wraps were ok. Wouldn't order them again. The philly steak rolls (according to rest of table) weren't bad but didn't taste like philly steaks. \nThe chicken fired steak bites were good. IMO the only good thing from the entire meal \nI must not be educated on lobster Mac (had no lobster)but the Reg Mac and cheese was better which isn't saying a whole lot (save your $20!)\nEveryone loved the bread. Had a sweet hint to it\nThe baked sweet potato was good\n\nSo recap - \ncons- all the meals, most of the appetizers, and most of the sides..May have all been better had we had drinks with the meal to cover up the lack of taste\nThe bathroom was pretty foul. The only clean-ish toilet stall didn't lock. \nAnd the service was subpar. Expected more from this place I guess\n\nPros- chicken fried steak bites. Baked sweet potato. \n\nSo if you want good service head across the street to Montana meat company. \nIf you want a better steak (sadly) head to outback
