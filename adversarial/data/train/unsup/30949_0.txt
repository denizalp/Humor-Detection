I ordered a veggie burrito without cheese for $5, which ended up being just less than $6 after taxes and card fees. The portion size was worth its cost, and, with jalapenos, it tasted on par with other veggie burritos I've had at other places. I'd buy more food, but the 50Â¢ card fee held me back. I'll definitely order more next visit, however. Keep in mind I was looking for something to eat at 3:30 A.M., so the convenience of this 24 hour restaurant adds to its value.\n\nThe only drawback was that the bar next door, which has an open doorway connected to the dining area, has annoyingly loud party\/dance music. Considering how late it is, I'm more sensitive and irritable to such sounds, and I'd prefer if the door was kept shut to turn down the noise coming into the dining area.
