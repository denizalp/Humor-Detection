Timothy Sauter and his staff are real class acts.  He's now delivered two wonderful boys for us and has a real down to earth gentle approach.  During both deliveries I got to cut the ambilical cords and be a big part of the delivery.  Real professional and knows what he's doing.  He also made it a point to do a personal follow up visit to my wife at the hospital once the delivery was over.  Highly recommend!  Las Vegas could use a few more of these real mccoy's.
