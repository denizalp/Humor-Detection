I don't get Chinese food often, however, when I do, I get it to feed a lot of people. I placed my order for carry out. The woman taking my order over the phone was very friendly. She reviewed my order and let me know total amount on phone. She gave me a 15 minute wait time. It was ready when I got there. The food was so delicious!! Everyone was happy with all. Our favorite dish was the crab rangoon appetizer. We will definitely use this rainbow garden next time we want Chinese food.
