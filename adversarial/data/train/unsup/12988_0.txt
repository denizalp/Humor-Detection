Well...this was the best time of my life. Only getting 4 out of 5 because I am almost 100% sure that the stripper took my friends $20 after the dance (since she was paying for one) and then asked me to pay, thinking we didnt pay her. I was a little drunk so I didnt complain or argue and paid her again.\n\nVIP room was pretty legit. No less than $100 but it could get even more pricey depending on how much more you want. But there are plenty of girls to choose from. Music was pretty great too!\n\nSitting in the front as the girls walked by was pretty dangerous for my wallet. I could not say no and every time they asked, I had to get one. Definitely got 2 at once a few times. \n\nI am coming back. NO doubt about it.
