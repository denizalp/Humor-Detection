This place has definitely improved since it was Imperial Palace, but many things have not changed and therefore still earn this place 2 stars.\n\n1) The check in process takes FOREVER, as they will probably have 2 people on staff to check in over 20-30 people into their rooms.  Expect to be in line for 30-90 minutes depending on time of day.\n2) The rooms are not very clean, and they are very basic with no amenities whatsoever. The TV is also archaic.\n3) There is quite a bit of vandalism in the rooms.\n4) There is no bathroom lock\n5) The hallways are long and confusing, with a messed up numbering system.\n\nI'd stay away if I were you.
