I came here with several of my co-workers hoping for fun lunch. While the decor was unique and interesting, I felt the black was a bit overdone. It also seems they designed their own chairs and they were really uncomfortable when you sit back. There is some kind of triangular design on the back and it kept digging into my lower back. It forced me to sit on the edge of my seat. Other than the interior decor, the service was prompt and friendly. But there wasn't anyone else in there at the time.\n\nEach of us got a different ramen noodle soup, an order of the waffle with korean beef, edamame, and the sliders.\n\nThe edamame was awesome. Super garlicky with some good dipping sauce. The ramen unfortunately didn't live to my expectations. I had the sesame tonkatsu and the broth felt way too thick and it wasn't hot at all. Maybe room temperature. the noodles were a bit warmer but not by much. I couldn't finish the ramen because it was too thick and it wasn't appetizing because it wasn't hot. My other co-workers agreed that their ramen wasn't hot either. The waffles were okay but not something I would order. I didn't get to try the sliders but they said they were just alright.\n\nI hope for the best for this establishment but it's not a place I would return to.
