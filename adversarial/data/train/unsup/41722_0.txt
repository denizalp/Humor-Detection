If you are looking for an excellent realtor that is also an great person you will find that in Tom. He focused on our needs and stated requirements. He dedicated time to research and show us properties making us feel like we were his number one priority.  Our time looking was made to be efficient and effective and his knowledge and advice are excellent. I've bought several homes over my lifetime and have to say I've not dealt with a better realtor and I would be happy to call him a friend.
