It took me two years but I finally tried something beyond the spinach dip and prime rib!!! The bbq ribs are wonderful. Tender, perfectly cooked and really good bbq sauce. I have never had bad service here and the food is always perfect. Charleston's impresses me everytime I go. I even stop for takeout for dinner sometimes and just get a spinach dip. It is pricey but for great food and consistently good service it is worth it.
