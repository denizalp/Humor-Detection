I wish I didn't leave Fremont for my last day in Vegas! The downtown casinos were a great place to have fun once I was cash-strapped from being robbed at the strip. Lots of old-school cheesiness and tacky neon signs, but I'm pretty sure this was the best part of my vegas experience. I got 2 free decks of cards- one from 4 Queens and the other from Binions (stop by here to take a free picture with $1 million in cash!). At this point in my trip, anything free and cheap was a good thing. \nPlenty of good buffets and other dining options available here. I found an all-you-can eat steak night joint for $12.99 on a wednesday. \nLots of street performers and vendors, and after dusk on the top of every hour is the famous fremont street light experience which was what I really came for. WOW- so cool and easy to be entranced. I wish they did this every 30 minutes or so and not only on the top of every hour after dusk, because I don't think I would get tired of it. Unfortunately, I only got to catch 1 show- American Pie. The music and visuals were great and I wish I could've stayed for the next showing (it was going to be a tribute to Queen) if I didn't have to catch my flight. Definitely will be going to downtown earlier and more frequently next time I am out in Vegas, it is on the top of my list :)
