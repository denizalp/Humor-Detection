Like many other reviewers, we had a spring break on our garage door and called Lodi based on a recommendation of a friend. I was very happy with the service; not only did they replace the springs, but they also tuned up the rollers and such so it opens and closes silently, a big improvement over before. Final price was actually one cent lower than the estimate. The only thing keeping it from being a 5 star rating is that the first technician wouldn't move my workbench out of the way so he could have access to one side of the garage; no big deal, I moved the bench and he came back out the next day.
