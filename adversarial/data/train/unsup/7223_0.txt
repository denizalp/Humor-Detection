So I am sitting here... First time ever, after passing by this place millions of times every single day and I am first greeted by my server with \"we close in 30 minutes\". This automatically puts us in a bad mood... We order a ton of food because we eat a lot, and this guy ignores all the nigiris we ordered because he thought it was too much for us to eat. I had to repeat the order of all the nigiris again (!!!) and assured him that we can eat everything (lol). I haven't even received the food yet but it wont make up for the bad service we've had already. I live close by and could've made this place a regular spot but prrrrrrrrr sorry guys. Actually the food just got here as I was typing this, and it IS pretty good. But still two stars.\n\nAlready edited review (minus 1 star) due to not being able to order tempura ice cream because kitchen is closed (before the actual posted closing time of the restaurant).
