I never ever write these reviews (I literally had to sign up to yelp to write this) but I'm not at all impressed with our treatment here. Last night myself and 4 of my girlfriends (who are all very well dressed, stylish, affluent women who live in the city) wanted to have a couple drinks here as we had just finished dinner in the area.  The guy at the front door said we could not get in unless we were getting a bottle.  We said well no we just wanted to have a couple glasses of prosecco and enjoy the night.  He said no that couldn't happen and said \"we expect to get really busy later on\". So we would be taking up space in your bar for the \"other people\" coming later on?  The place was totally dead, nobody in there.  It made zero sense to turn us away and we felt very disrespected.  Why even open if you are not going to allow paying customers the opportunity to enjoy your bar? Very silly business mentality.
