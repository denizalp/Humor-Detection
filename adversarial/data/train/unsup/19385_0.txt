Received an impressive 16 shrimp per pound ordered. My bag was full of nice, big '16-20 count' head-on shrimp (not live but still firm and tasty) with 4 corn-on-the-cobs in the bag. It's what I always get when trying out a place like this. House spice at the 'hot' level is as flavorful and spicy as Hot And Juicy Crawfish's (HAJC) 'medium' but not as 'fermented' or 'stinky' and as a result my clothes didn't smell like old garlic when I got home. None of these types of places have live shrimp. But I have to say the shrimp here were bigger and firmer than the average shrimp at HAJC. Sometimes the shrimp at HAJC are borderline mushy and you have to speak up about it.\n\nDon't get me wrong I am a fan of the unique HAJC experience, but I think Cravin' Cajun is much cleaner and the atmosphere is much, much better. Large HDTVs all on different channels, really good service (prob cause it isn't very busy) and a brand new and beautiful no-expense spared build-out with high ceilings and lots of space between tables. Not claustrophobic at all. A more West coast experience. You don't feel like you're crowded in a Boston wharfside chowderhouse. It's relaxingly spacious - you won't get squirted on by crawfish head juice by the table neighbors behind you. (It happens ALL the time at HAJC!)\n\nThe row of hallway sinks for just washing hands is a really nice touch. I'm sure it's a 'why didn't we think of that' feature that will make their competitors jealous.\n\nYes, the heat doesn't linger, but I think the flavor is just as good without triggering post-meal stomach acrobatics (happens all the time at HAJC!)\n\nWould go back again tomorrow! I have been scoping out the right cajun seafood restaurant to take my visiting family to over the Xmas holiday. I pretty sure this is the one!
