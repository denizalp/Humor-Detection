They say when one door closes, another opens, and this is true even in the desolate underground labyrinth of the Aura building. While Kaiju, the plaza's shining star, has now closed (RIP), my favourite little massage therapy place has expanded.\n\nBut just a little, since the storefronts are tiny here. Mu Dan has acquired the space next door to it so it is now more reasonably sized. There's a new, well-lit, proper reception area and a small comfortable room for services, with a secondary massage table in a curtained off area.\n\nI highly recommend Helen for massage therapy - she has a lovely friendly demeanor combined with the strength of Iron Man.
