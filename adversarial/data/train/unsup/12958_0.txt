I've only done this a couple of times. Breaking my rule of writing a review for a non-business.\n\nI'm leaving the City of Scottsdale, but I figure it was a 4-Star experience.\n\nThis town get's a lot of guff from people who think it's \"too pretentious\". To those people, I say, get out and see the world a little. I've lived all over. Salt Lake, Los Angeles, Las Vegas. I've even spent the better part of the year traveling on business going from city to city, hotel to hotel.\n\nScottsdale has nice restaurants, a decent nightlife, great golf courses and an interesting mix of people: young professionals who just got their first real job, wealthy folks who enjoy life, seniors who are wondering why they are still alive. This place has it all.\n\nThe city is run like a well-oiled machine. The library system is very good. It's easy to pay your utilities. Construction can be a pain, but ends pretty quick. \n\nIf you like sports, stick around for Spring baseball. The Giants, Diamondbacks and Rockies play here. \n\nSome people like to hit the poker table and, there are casinos nearby for that. If that's not your speed, hit the spa. Plenty of those to go around.\n\nI'm glad I had a chance to experience the best of Scottsdale. If you are a visitor, stay in Old Town, but make sure you venture out to the north. There are some pretty cool things up there. Like Taliesin West.\n\nLastly, if you are looking to live here...it's not that expensive. You can buy a decent 3BR home for 150-200. At least right now. It might be tougher to sell it of course. But that's with any place.\n\nGood luck.
