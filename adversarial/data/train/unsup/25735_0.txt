I had such an incredible time at Elite Bridal today! I said Yes! to a beautiful David Tutera gown and I couldn't have done it without Mervet's expertise! Even the other Consultants who were walking by complimented me and truly made me feel like a princess. \n\nMervet took her time with me and even had me try on earrings, necklace, veil and bouquet so that I had the ultimate picture of walking down the aisle. So much fun! I would absolutely recommend going to Elite for your big day!
