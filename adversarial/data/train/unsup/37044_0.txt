I was looking for a bite to eat for lunch in Market Square and was curious about checking this place out, plus I love Greek food.\n\nI was a little skeptical of another \"build your own\" type place when I first walked in, but The Simple Greek delivered.\n\nI was surprised that they were actually visibly roasting the lamb (much like in other authentic shops I've seen while traveling). I ordered a salad bowl and the staff seemed to encourage you to add as much stuff to it as possible. They had an enormous variety of topics, well beyond the basics--3 choices of cucumber\/tomato mixes and grape leaves for good measure.\n\nThe interior was decorated minimally, but had various seating options inside and out. The staff wasn't too friendly and this place is definitely a cafeteria style-clean up after yourself type place. Maybe it's just that it's not ANOTHER Mexican restaurant in its spot, maybe a little refreshing to get a little fancy with that salad bowl, but the food was 4 stars for a lunch joint!
