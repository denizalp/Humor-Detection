This place is really trying to be upscale, but it's not.  To me an upscale place is where you can't afford to bring your little brats.\n\nFirst, the good.  The staff was friendly and prompt.  Refills kept on coming.  I ate here for 6 meals over my 2 day stay at the resort and I never ordered the same dish twice just so I could try a variety.\n\nHere is a rundown of what I ate and the quality:\n\n-Chicken Quesadilla: So soggy it was falling apart, inedible\n-Arcioech (sp) Scallops:  It's Arizona, there are no fresh scallops.  They were overcooked and the seared spices were a soggy mess.  The potatoes and Dijon dressing were great though.\n-Eggs Benedict: Very good, cooked perfectly.  They do it a little different and give you smoked salmon instead of canadian bacon.  Not a bad change but they were a little cheap on the quantity of salmon.\n-Matador Hamburger: Fantastic burger and they will cook it rare.  If you order one well done, you shouldn't be allowed to review any red meat.\n-Center Cut Filet: Obviously not a prime cut.  Perfectly cooked and seared.  Veggies were also well seasoned and not overcooked.  Good choice.\n-Salmon: Great seasoning, slightly overcooked and bizarre sauce with the consistency of pudding under the garnish.  The sauce added nothing to the fish.\n-Creme Brulee: Very nicely done, maybe a little too much heat on the sugar, but still delish!\n-Caprese Salad: Tomatoes were flavorless and old (dried out appearance). Mozzarella was obviously a Costco purchase (not bad though).\n\nIf I wasn't eating here for free, I would balk at it just for the prices let alone the mixed quality of the food.\n\nNo hot waitresses here, but the server staff was great.
