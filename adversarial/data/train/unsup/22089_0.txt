I went there today to check out the Hatch Chili Throw-down that was starting at 1:00pm. \n\nWe got there and noticed that is location is just like the market on Power Rd. named Guadalupe Farmers Market Too. \nThen the light bulb goes off \"ding\"...wow talk about a blond moment. I guess the names give away the relation. Anyway.. \n\nThe cook-off was no where to be seen, but they were roasting fresh Hatch chilies. I was not really impressed with the selection inside and the prices were a bit high. We ended up getting some delicious smelling chilies and fresh tortillas. (Food City has cheaper roasted Hatch chilies on the weekend). \nIt was a nice trip but I'm not sure it is worth a second try.
