After every catering service under the sun turned into a horrible domino effect of awful food tastings, over priced down payments, and rude staff; Kirbie's came highly recommend to my fiance & I. \nLet's just say it was some of the worst food I've had in a long time! I was surprised at the reviews since they are 4 to 5 stars across the board- but keep in mind that it's for items people bought & cooked themselves, not catering!!!\n My fiance & I tried their cheesy potatoes (way too salty & the flavor was like eating a raw onion), the beef brisket (super dry & flavorless), stuffed chicken (was like a microwave chicken dinner with stove top stuffing shoved inside) , etc... disgusting! And what added to the bland food was the lack of cleanliness. Our tasting was set up in their little wine  area  & we were sat at a dirty table :( In fact, when I started looking around for something to get the horrible taste of onion potato out of my mouth- all the tables were dirty :\/ \nReally disappointed! However, the store itself is cute...
