Ok, I swore I would never be one of those pretentious people who put there kids in a private pre-school - After a bad experience at another private preschool -  well, people I changed!  I found this amazing school (that just opened) two blocks from my house.  The owners (A husband and wife team are such lovely people with twins who also attend the school).  He was the former head master at Kachina.  My son has flourished in less than a month.  The change in him is amazing. He is clearly challenged there both mentally and physically.  He comes home happy and tired (which is a good thing!) Teacher Melissa and her Aide Teacher Tania are wonderful.  I couldn't be happier.  My favorite part, is the other Mom's are nice and friendly - no pretense here!  Our family is so happy!  The location is a little different - it is shared space with a Jewish Temple. This is a non religious school which is great for our family!  It is also VERY affordable! We all know, I loves me a bargin! Ha!
