Fantastic Thai food!\n\nI ate here last weekend and have been thinking about the meal ever since. As other reviewers have mentioned, this is definitely not a place you go for the ambiance - tile floors, few decorations, picnic quality tables. That said, there were 11 of us for dinner and our service, if bare bones, was polite, efficient, and timely. You could do worse.\n\nIn future I will get take out and love it. We had a bunch of dishes (noodles, rices, curry, spring rolls, sweet and sour chicken, seafood, veggies) and everything was delicious. Except the pad thai. The pad thai was actually pretty abysmal and I'd skip it if I were you. Get anything else - all of our other dishes were great. There was variety in the flavours of the dishes, just the right level of spice, and plenty of meat\/veg in everything.\n\nThis place is a total find. My new go-to Thai place.
