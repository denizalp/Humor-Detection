Came here to see Markus Schulz on Friday of EDC Week, so I don't know if the experience is any different during other times of the year.  The ticket prices were kind of ridiculous for guys ($50), but for girls it wasn't that bad ($20).  They didn't let me bring in my empty water bottle, but one of the guards told me I could hide it in a bush and come back for it later.  \n\nThey do have lockers available to rent, but I don't know how much they go for.  I was fine with staking out a spot by the pool and leaving my stuff right behind me.  The main pool they have is kind of small and got full very quickly, so come early if you want to sit at the pool.  It was my first day club experience, so it was very cool to see the pool get turned into a watery dance floor! I thought it was weird that the DJ booth wasn't positioned in the view of the pool though, and a few people were wondering where it was.  \n\nDrinks were typical Vegas club prices.  I asked the bartender for a Vodka Cranberry ($13), and I guess she mistakenly heard Vodka Soda because that's what she gave me...oh well, it was still good.  There was also a cabana in front of the pool that was giving away free beers, so my annoyance at paying $13 for a drink was soon forgotten.  \n\nBy the time Markus Schulz came on, we moved out of the pool (by this time, the water was pretty gross) and onto the cramped dance floor.  The majority of the space is taken up by cushy VIP areas, so I wish there was more shade\/dancing space for us peasants who can't afford to spend $500 on food and drink in order to claim one of those couches for ourselves.  \n\nI do want to commend the security at the stage, because he was so nice and offered to hold up my sunglasses so I could get them autographed! I asked him if he liked the music that was playing and he said, \"naw man this shit is too cheesy for me\" haha.  \n\nOverall had a great time because of the music and the people, but there are definitely better venues.
