TLDR: a little pricey, good service, par to good food. This is a place if you're desperate or don't want to go anywhere else. \n\nWe came to this place because we didn't want to eat at Burger King. We were seated quickly in the wee hours of the night and out server approached our table without delay. Our quaint table of 4 individuals were comprised of locals as well as family visiting from the nearby kingdom of California. Fantasized by the soups, we asked if we could get a sample of the beer cheese soup. Our request was obliged and our server brought us over souffl√© cups to taste. I would say that it wasn't the most appetizing thing on the menu, but it wasn't dreadful either. \n\nWe ended up ordering the sliders, which contained thick pieces of meat and were actually not that bad. If you think the price is ok then I would recommend it, especially to our friends that need food after a night of debauchery. We ended up getting a dessert of a chocolate cake with a thick layer of fudge all around. We requested the dessert to be warmed, but apparently the limitations of the fudge do not allow the food to be warmed as it melts the cake, according to our server. The cake was paired with a nice glass of milk. I recommend the short cup. \n\nAll-in-all I would give it 3.5 stars.
