I was in a car accident on July 29, hit from behind at a stop light in Stow. Without my contacting them at all, on August 3, someone from this law firm showed up uninvited TO MY HOME while I was out of town. They left a packet of info including a video and some play money. I guess since my IQ is so low I cannot figure out how to hire an attorney on my own should I need one that would make me stupid enough to hire a tresspasser to a property registered with the City of Stow as a no solicitation condo community. Such intrusive behavior from obviously skeevy, creepy ambulance chasing vultures.
