I am going to start my review by saying that we went for a late lunch. Therefore, we had no crowds, and good prices.\n\nIt's rare that you go to a restaurant and like not only everything on your plate, but on your dining guests' plates as well (yes, I snuck a taste of everybody's). I got the fish tacos, which were quite good. Also on the table was a burger served with sweet potato fries (delicious), and another sandwich choice. Everybody was happy, the atmosphere was fun, and conveniently located for some shopping on the strip. A great choice.
