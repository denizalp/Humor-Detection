Realizing that this was near kitchen closing, on July 4th, but... \n\nService: terrible. Bartenders didn't realize i had sat down the bar for 3 minutes, although i had been seated by the host. Understandable, they were in conversation. Get delivered my beer, then ignored for 10 minutes while they continue their conversation. Receiving my food was the last interaction i had with both of them, aside from needing to flag them down so i could pay my bill. Conversation from when i walked in continued the entirety of my meal\n\nFood: Lazy. Ordered a med rare burger, received a well done burger that had sat on the edge of the grill for (roughly) 15 minutes (side note: i was a cook for 8 uears, and ran a burger grill for about a year. I know how they operate, which is why i asked for med rare, so it would be freshly cooked) \n\ni realize that it sucks working service industry, especially when its a holiday and you're stuck at work, but that's no excuse for bad service
