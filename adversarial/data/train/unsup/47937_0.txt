I absolutely love Nexcare Urgent  Care. I always get in fast and get treated so well. Their diagnosis is always spot on and the prescribed treatment works every time! So far my previous primary care doctor misdiagnosed me and my son, prescribing unnecessary medications and treatments. \nI am so grateful for every single doctor I've seen so far (and we've been there a lot!) as well as the front office staff and nurses, etc. \nI recommend Nexcare every chance I get!
