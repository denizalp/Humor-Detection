Tried this place based upon the Yelp reviews. My girlfriend & I had hamburgers. I also had a salad with the best 1000 island dressing I've ever had.  My girlfriend did not want onions and her burger came out with them. They quickly brought her a new one. We finished up with a huge Turtle sundae we shared. Caution: this sundae is not for only one person.\n\nOur service was satisfactory and we arrived before the dinner rush (430pm), so seating was easy. At 6pm, the place had a significant queue, but it was a Saturday night and the Barrymore had an event. \n\nOverall, the fare, the cost and the atmosphere make this a must try.
