I really enjoyed this place! Service was on point, the atmosphere was perfect! It was a beautiful day and got to enjoy it by eating outside while sipping on some mimosas! I ordered the steak and it was delicious! Prices were a bit high for a cafe but then we are in Vegas plus it's the Wynn! But totally worth it!
