I was in Las Vegas. I was also looking for a Wii. I started seeing people walk by with Wii's. My radar turned on and suddenly we were on a mission. We got to the Game Stop and I asked if they had any Wii's. THEY DID! They got in a shipment the night before. Awesome! We bought it! I'm happy now. Thank you Soerha!
