Let's not get carried away with these reviews, OK? This isn't Sept-Iles. Rein it in a little. \n\nThe coffee is passable. The sandwiches\/snacks are decent and inexpensive. Staff is friendly. Beer is cold. Pool table in back makes it \"A-OK.\" Do I hang out here? Did the desserts change my life? No. Seems home to a lot of misfits (which is a good thing as far as I'm concerned). \n\nMaybe its the decor. The big open feel and those huge windows are pretty nice. But it has all of that late-1990s \/ early 2000s boring modern feel that essentially strips it of any character. \n\nRating Scale:\n1 Star: Avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe.  \n2 Star: Risky at best. \n3 Star: I'll try it again or consume here in a pinch.\n4 Star: I eat here regularly if financially and calorically feasible.\n5 Star: I'm comfortable taking other chefs here.
