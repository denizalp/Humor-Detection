Terrible.  If waiting (and waiting...and waiting) is your cup of tea, then make an appointment here.  The concept of time means nothing to this group.  Have a 2pm app't?  Plan on spending at least 45 minutes waiting only to be told they are really backed up, cannot see you and, oh, would you like to reschedule?  Don't waste your copay, your time, your dignity by feeding the egos here.  My gripe is not a single occurrence, but this latest episode of \"Waiting for Stockton\" was my 3rd time being inconvenienced.  Do they give a rats arse about the sick leave I burned, or the distance traveled on a hot day?  Apparently not.  Stockton schedulers:  Don't book appointments for folks in the afternoon if you know the derm's consistently run over their morning appointments.  And then, don't give me advice that I should book appointments in the morning to avoid such inconveniences.  How about you stop booking folks in the p.m. instead?  But, I'll give the schedulers a break as I know they have to work and revolve around their Derm Master's egos and ineptitude.  And it's not just Stockton, it's the PA's as well.  Poor service culture here.\n\nMy advice to anyone reading:  Got a rash?  Dash off to another firm.  There is a clearly a culture here that favors vanity treatments over legitimate skin cancer concerns.
