I'm lucky I checked in here on Yelp, I can never remember the name of this place. \n\nBuk Chang brings the heat on the cheap. I'm definitely a fan, even if it isn't my very favourite hot pot and pho stop. \n\nMost recently I partook in their spicy veg soup and the dumpling hot pot, and both were tasty. The dumplings break apart in the hot broth. It's oddly comforting, like hamburger soup. The pho comes with a raw egg you get to crack and stir in yourself and a mountain of sticky purple rice. I have a high respect for Korean cuisine, I love playing with my food at the table. \n\nAlso apparently pho is pronounced Fa. Who knew!? \n\nPEPPER POINTS for serving $3 beers!\n\nPEPPER'S PISSED: How come I can't get a side of dumplings if you make them and cook them in the soup?
