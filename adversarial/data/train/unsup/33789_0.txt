DO NOT GO HERE!!!! THEY DO NOT CARE!!!! I came here & was being treated by Dr. Jung. She never called in my prescription luckily I had some extra from a dosage change. I called in last week to tell them I still need my prescription. Here it is a week later & still no prescription. I called and the BITCH on the phone told me that they sent it a month ago. I told her my mail in pharmacy did not receive it & that I ran out of medication 2 days ago. She told me they sent it & your just going to have to wait until Monday because there is no one here to fill it. Why the hell are you making me suffer when it's your office that made the mistake !?!?! Why is there no doctor there on a Friday? Why does your website say you are open Friday until 6pm?????? If no one can help me? Thanks for caring about my mental stability!!!\n\nOh and btw, not the first time they didn't send a prescription. \n\nNow I have to go to Urgent care to get a prescription so I don't lose my mind!!\n\nThanks for making someone with mental health issues even more upset than I already was!!!!!
