As some previous reviewers have mentioned, Ginger China Bistro is reminiscent of the restaurant formerly known as Fate in downtown Phoenix.\n\nI popped in for lunch this week as I was nearby due to GangplankNW http:\/\/search.twitter.com\/search?q=%23Gangplanknw\n\nTo get my ginger party started, I ordered up a \"Ginger Palmer\" (ginger iced tea + lemonade). Man, what a unique and tasty beverage!\n\nFor my entry, I ordered up the \"Tofu puffs\" with seasonal vegetables dish, which comes with white rice. This dish (and probably all of them) come served in a generous amount of sauce. The food was tasty & filling. Ginger Bistro is a good spot for some flavorful, not so traditional Chinese cuisine.
