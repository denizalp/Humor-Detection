Interesting...not necessarily in a good way. It's quieter - far from the hustle of the casino. The menu is the same as the Irish restaurant next door. I ordered the fish and chips and was underwhelmed. They have a good (cheap!) drinks menu - $5 wine, martinis and craft beer. I found an awesome beer here (Unibrew) for $5, which was pretty awesome. The bar tender was a bit hoity, telling me that I wouldn't like it. Listen buddy, just because I'm a woman doesn't mean that I don't know my beers well! \nAlso, maybe it was because I was there on a Wednesday night around 10 PM, but the clients were also sort of weird...
