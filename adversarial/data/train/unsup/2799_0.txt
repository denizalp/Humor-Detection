My husband thought this was a great idea.  So did I, until we got on.  Did I mention I hate roller coasters?  I give it 3 stars because I'm sure its ok if you like roller coasters.  I spent 2 minutes screaming, and then the next hour trying to realign my head and shoulders after getting my shit rocked on this ride!
