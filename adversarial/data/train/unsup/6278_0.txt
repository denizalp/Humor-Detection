Even though I don't drive, I still come down here periodically to get my State ID renewed and always get exemplary service. They even let me change my party affiliation during my last visit, which I didn't know could be done on the spot.\n\nWell, I just got my new voter card yesterday and am now officially a Green.  G'bye duopoly.
