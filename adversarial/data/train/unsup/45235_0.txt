Yes! I'm first! lol That's important to me, you know.\n\nJust wanted to give my recommendation for Gracie at Naturaltress....she's awesome! \n\nThe salon opened almost a year ago. Gracie is really knowledgeable about natural hair (she's been loced for 11 years, I think she said). I went to get to get my big chop today, and I was the only one in the salon. The salon itself is designed nicely--it's a nice open space and the stations are sectioned off, so you won't have a room full of people glaring at you while you're getting your hair done. Personal preference, but I always hated that ...lol\n\nThe salon provides services for loose hair, locs, and weaves, too, so it really is a one-stop place to go to. I live in the DC area, so I hate that there isn't somewhere like this back home. We have some great ones, but they're so hyped up it's hard to get in, there are a zillion rules, or they're overpriced. \n\nAs far as my service was concerned, she chopped, washed\/conditioned, and flat twisted me in about an hour. $30 for my chop, and an additional $40 for the twists, since I added it on at the last minute.\n\nIf you're looking for somewhere to go, I recommend you try her!
