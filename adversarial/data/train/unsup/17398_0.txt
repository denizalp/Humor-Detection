Great if you like your Pizza Crust almost raw.\n\nMy wife is in Savannah on a trip with the local Y so it's just me and the Corgi.  He likes Pizza and so do I and it's been awhile since I've had Litle Caesars so decided to give them a try. Have never been to this store since it's inside a Kangaroo Expres.  I've had the $5 lunch special at the Little Caesars in Statesville and it was pretty good so I expected more of the same.\n\nAlas, was not the case.\n\nI ordered a large three topping pizza and the person at the counter asked if I minded waiting for 6 minutes.  I said no because from my younger days when I worked part time at Domino's, I remembered it was more like 8-9 minutes.\n\nApparently still is because when I got home, the crust was so undercooked, it was almost raw.\n\nWould not recommend this particular store until they learn how to properly cook a pizza.
