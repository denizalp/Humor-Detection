Why am I giving a chain mall store a five star review?  Because of the employees inside, they were very knowledgeable and helpful beyond belief.\n\nI walked in to get replacement earrings for myself.  After a recent visit to my doctor's office and a recommendation to stop wearing the particular kind of earrings I was wearing, I was lucky to stop in here.\n\nI made a b-line for the case that housed gauged spacers for ears and was immediately greeted by a staff member.  I was asked the obligatory question that every person that ever worked retail is to ask a customer.  For once, I really did need some assistance.  I explained to her my situation, and then she looked a little puzzled.  Lucky for us, her coworker was nearby and overheard everything I said to her.  His recommendation was better than my doctors, if you can believe that.  My doctor recommended going for an acrylic spacer.  However this gentlemen who was helping me at the time knew more than my doctor.  He suggested that I used ones that are made of titanium, wood, glass or bone.  He also let me know to rarely use the acrylic ones due to the fact that they can harbor bacteria more so than other earrings.\n\nOn top of all the nice information that this fine gentlemen bestowed on me, there was a deal on the gauged earrings.  Buy one and get the second one for $1.  Bonus!\n\nDuring checkout, I was given more information about another type of earring that unfortunately Spencer's doesn't carry.  In the future, I will probably stop back here to look for other needs on this.
