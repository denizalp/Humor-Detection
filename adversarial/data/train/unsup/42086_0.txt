Why cant I give this place zero stars!! it was a bad experience right from the beginning. we were sat at our table and waited a good 15 to 20 minutes before somebody came over to talk to us (they weren't even that busy). that was too long and we even had the little machine blinking meaning we needed service. after somebody came over, we ordered the dollar long islands which were disgusting, then finally we asked if we could have some water since it wasn't offered. after that we had a long wait for our food which wasn't even that great, the menu made it sound better than it was. A person at my table ordered steak and it took the cook 3....3! tries to cook the steak to medium which took forever they just got it to go. we asked for the manager to come over atleast  4 times.. then finally somebody else called him over and which he was basically giving us excuses to what was going on. The only plus was he compt the steak and nasty drinks... Most def wont be coming back, ever!
