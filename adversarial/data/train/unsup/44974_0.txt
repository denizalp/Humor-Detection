This review would have been a 4 + star if the food was better\n\nPros-  I did not registered for the conference and did not have a ticket for a special order meal (gluten free) and was willing to go without.  The serving staff got the chef to make one fresh and it took some time, but they were so accommodating .  \nThe hotel itself is huge and very pretty.  Lots of rooms for breakouts. Tech guys were readily available.\n\nCons: We froze- the air conditioning was way too cold.   Food- They served my co-workers the worst Lasagna I've ever seen and so many of the people at my table left 3\/4 of it on the plate they said it was so bad. The only time in my life I was glad to be gluten free
