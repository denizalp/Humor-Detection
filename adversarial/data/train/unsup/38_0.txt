I just received a \"compliment\" tonight under the \"You're Funny\" heading from an individual named Leonardo M. concerning my review for this restaurant.  The \"compliment\" stated in whole:\n\n\"I guess your review was meant to be funny. Frozen pizza and Birdseye frozen vegetables? Iceberg lettuce?Italian from San Francisco? You may have been in Olive Garden or better yet Buca di Beppo. My mother is from Naples and my father from Sicily. We've spent time in both places. Maybe Italian food in SF has been too Americanized over the years. Sorry you had a bad experience?\"\n\nThis Leonardo character has no reviews, no Yelp friends, and just started on Yelp this last September (2013).  A person with such stats wouldn't have any business or interest making a comment like that to me unless he was the owner, so I'm going to address this \"compliment\" to me as if I came from the owner.\n\nSo, no Leonardo, I wasn't trying to be funny.  Yes, I got a warmed-up frozen pizza for my entree and a tiny salad composed of iceberg lettuce for an additional $5.  My wife's mediocre meal had tasteless frozen vegetables on the side.  That's not funny.\n\nYou know what the sad thing is?  You didn't even try to make it better.  My family and I get one of the worst Italian meals of our lives, and all you felt motivated to do was insult me and my taste in food.\n\nI grew up on restaurants like Westlake Joe's in Daly City, Bertolucci's in South San Francisco, Banchero's in Hayward, and a host of incredible Italian cooking from the North Beach area of San Francisco itself.  If you went to the owners of these restaurants and told them that their food was \"too Americanized compared to yours\", you would either end up with a spiffy pair of cement shoes, or at least with a horse's head on your pillow next to you the morning.  Okay, NOW I'm trying to be funny.\n\nIf this was just an off night, and you wanted to show me how good your food really was, you could have seriously apologized to me.  You could have invited my family back, served us up a wonderful meal, and I would have been back here on Yelp telling everyone to never mind about the previous bad review.  I would have been HAPPY to do that.\n\nBut no, you decided to insult me instead.  That's a shame--far more of a shame than just serving me a bad dinner.  All I can say now is that it appears that bad taste goes far deeper in this restaurant than just the food.\n\nUPDATE 1\/30\/14:\n\nThe morning after I put up this review update, I received two more \"compliments\".  The first was by a man named \"Robert K.\" from Chandler, someone who has no Yelp friends and about 40 reviews, who thought enough about what I wrote above to call me a \"butt-hurt little child\" at 6:27 am.  A response from Leonardo came about an hour later (and his name mysteriously changed to \"Leonard\").  He claimed that he wasn't the owner--just a \"patron for several years\" who never had that kind of experience at Lo Cascio's.  I won't buy that story any more than I'll buy food at this restaurant again.\n\nUPDATE 12\/6\/14:\n\nBy this point, I have received a total of  five messages, \"compliments\", and even a counter-review, all negatively responding to this review and its previous incarnation.  Apparently back in September of 2013, another reviewer named \"Denton S.\" from Tempe wrote a review for this restaurant where he called me a \"condescending jerk\", reacting with outrage because I had the temerity to call the bread \"not authentic.\"  Again, another sock puppet Yelp account--one review and no other Yelp activity.  Thankfully, the review went straight into the \"not recommended\" section.  Another communication I got even seemed to imply that I had some kind of deep-seated anger issue, and with a \"namaste\", tried to tell me that my bad review was somehow harmful to my emotional and spiritual well-being.\n\nPhew!  Look guy, I don't give bad reviews because I'm mean at heart--I give them because a business gives me bad service or a bad deal for my money.  You gave me and my family a sucky meal for $60+ bill, and for the past couple of years, you and\/or some friends of yours have been finding ways on Yelp of insulting or belittling me because I gave your business a one-star review in return.\n\nIf my negative review were the only one, it wouldn't mean much.  However, my bad review Is one of a number of them from some quite upset people who disliked your food, your service, or both.  That's not my fault--it's yours.  Bad reviews are feedback telling you what you are doing WRONG.  It's supposed to tell you where  and how you can IMPROVE what you are doing.  Instead of doing that, you send me multiple messages calling me a jerk and a tool.  You sent it to me, and now I'm posting about it here for all to see.  Hope it's been worth it to you.
