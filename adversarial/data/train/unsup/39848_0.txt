Quite simply, this insurance company is a scam. One of their customers hit my car and totaled it. They would not even pay me the WHOLESALE trade-in value of the car let alone the KKB or NADA retail value. They will only pay me what a dealer pays for the car MINUS about $2000 dollars !!! Craziest thing I've ever heard. They try to get away with it and if they can, they pocket the extra money. To top it off, the representative hung up on me when we were discussing it !! Terrible all around !
