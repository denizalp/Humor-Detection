Very nice pub. Great collection of beer . Even the cocktails were really good . My friend told that was my the best mojito she had in a long time . The long island ice tea cocktail was great too! \nThe ambience is really nice . If  you are sitting on the terrace ... its a great place , very beautiful location to have an evening beer with some friends and hang out . \nI would definitely come back to this place .\nAwesome hospitality as well . The waiters were really nice to us. She suggested us whats best ! And She told if u r too hungry, i wil take the orders for food first cos there is a big gang  waiting on the other side .. so before they get started i wil hav yours done :) \nThe prices are reasonable  too.!
