Stopped by Retablo after lunch to take a look at the local artists' work; and boy their items are impressive! Huge selection of tables and bigger furniture items outside, and smaller pieces inside the building.\nFun little stop since we couldn't bring anything back with us, but if we could, we'd buy half the store!
