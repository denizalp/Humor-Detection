Ruths Chris, Ruths Chris, Ruth Chris..you never and i mean NEVER EVER disappoint me.\n\nWhen i heard they were opening a Ruths Chris here in cleveland i got so giddy, all my memories of Ruths Chris is Weehawken, NJ and Princeton, NJ came rushing back.\n\nSaturday night and feeling fine, it had just opened so it was jam packed. But long hair dont care because i knew it was worth it\n\nThe intimate atmosphere, dim lighting, exceptional service, all led me up to the best meal (steak wise) ive probably ever had!\n\ni always order the porterhouse medium well, the combination of filet mignon and new york strip is my sinful combination. Pair it with some creamed spinach, the candied sweet potatoes and you literally have heaven on a dish.\n\nmy favorite thing about this establishment, and trust me i can name 1000s, is that they serve the food to you on piping hot plates, to keep your meal hot for the entire duration of your meal. GENIUS.\n\nThe menu has a little bit of something for everybody, even children. The service at this particular one was outstanding. My cup didnt even reach halfway before our server was on her way to fill it up again. \n\nPrice wise you better come prepared to shell out a pretty penny, but its 100% worth it. You get amazing service, and the best steak money can buy. Of course they sell seafood and other items but how do you go to Ruths Chris STEAKHOUSE and order a salad? NO THANKS!\n\nThey do take reservations so i highly recommend this feature.\n\n10\/10 Ruths Chris Cleveland!!
