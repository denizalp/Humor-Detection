They aren't kidding when they say it's Authentic Colombian.  A Canadian wouldn't know Authentic Latin American if a Taco truck rammed in to their Toyota... which is why I saw not many Canadians here which is too bad, they should come.\n\nI am a man of the meat and not to betray my core, I ordered the Picada \/ Meat Platter, with grilled beef, chicken, Chicarron, morcilla, Colombian sausage, fried plantain.\n\nLet me focus on what's different here, the distinguishing feature of Colombian food from what I ordered.  The Chicharron \/ Bacon is a super thick set of slices of bacon cut with a jagged sawtooth style and super crispy fried.  This is the highlight but eat it fast-- it's one of those things that due to crunch factor level is only good when freshly arrived.  Don't touch the skillet amigo-- super caliente.  The other new one morcilla is a black blood sausage but don't let that scare you off.  It's a much more accessible variety than others, it's filled with fluffy rice and herbs inside.  The fluff texture and savory flavor have won me over.  \n\nAnd a liter of Sangria later we were done.
