The Academy of Scuba, whether it be the PV or Metro location, have been an excellent experience. I started at the PV location over a year ago to obtain my open water certification and trained with AOS ever since. The staff are very friendly and knowledgable when it comes to educating customers or potential prospect clients. I appreciate how the Academy of Scuba will adjust your training around your schedule to ensure you have the best experience possible. The dive professionals at the Academy of Scuba are also fun to train with and take a personal interest in your development as a diver. Getting involved with the diving community through this business has formed many new friendships that will likely last a lifetime. The community is very close and we often dive with one another regularly. They have monthly dive socials and are at the lake every weekend to give anybody a chance to dive with them. They also organize underwater vacations, my favorite, which provide affordable vacations to exotic places!!! These trips can cater to any budget or lifestyle. Finally, I want to end on the training aspect, you can take any type of class with the Academy of Scuba. They train open water certifications to instructor certifications. As far as specialties go, you name it, they train it!!! This caters to any type of dive goal you may have or dream dive you have been wanting to pursue. I highly recommend this shop for ANYONE!!!
