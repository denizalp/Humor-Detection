Great entertainment!  Drink specials are awesome though I wish they were free like Vegas but hey...next best thing.  Good variety and lots of options in gaming tables and slots.  I'm just sick of the 2cent slot thing in Phoenix.  Come on...really?  What's that about?  But otherwise, I stayed int he new nice rooms and found them comfortable and friendly staff.  Enjoyed a concert and again...no complaints.  I'll be back!
