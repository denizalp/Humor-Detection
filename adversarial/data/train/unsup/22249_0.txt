Excellent coffee for a coffee stand. If you like sitting at a bar or in a massive unfinished space, this is perfect. If you prefer something a bit more comfortable, you may want to move on.\n\nYes, the coffee is truly good. Way better than the sludge from *$ or the reasonably decent brew from Caribou. But I think Dilworth Coffee is smoother and richer. And it's a better experience.\n\nIf you want a coffee purely for drinking, you can't go wrong with Not Just Coffee. But if you're looking to hang out for a bit, this isn't your place.
