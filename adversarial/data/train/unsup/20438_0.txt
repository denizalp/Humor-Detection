Wondeful!   This is the kinda place where you walk in..... order at one end of the counter....and pick up your food at the end.   Its my favorite kinda place because you dont have to deal with servers or closing out tickets at the end of the meal.  You just claim your table...eat...and go.....\n\nBBq was some of the best Ive had in Charlotte.  I likenit because it is pulled and not chopped.   The BBq is not fatty at all....and there are no \"questionable\" pieces on the plate.  Sometimes...when you eat BBq ...you might get that one sketchy piece that turns you off.  \n\nI had Baked Beans, Corn Pudding, and Creamy slaw.  All in all they were pretty dang good....I felt like all 3 could have used a little more salt.   \n\nIf you are looking or a scrumptuos place to eat with no pain in the ass service....this is it.   I really really like it.\n\nPrices are a bit high....but not over the top
