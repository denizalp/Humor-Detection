Ask people where to go for the best tacos in town, and most of them will have one answer. After a long overdue return visit (of sorts), I have to concur.\n\nTacos El Gordo is a Tijuana import by way of California that's slinging some of the best street tacos around. I visited the Strip location once a couple years ago, but in comparison to some other taquerias, it's not as convenient for me to visit either that restaurant or the one here on Charleston. Not to mention the prices here, which are equal to if not higher than the others, with sales not ever appearing (at least to my eyes or ears). But if you want delicious tacos with all the proper fixings, and price isn't too big a concern, then choose these guys.\n\nLike some of its close competitors do (or used to), Tacos El Gordo has a system where you order first, then pay last. The meats are divided by station, with asada taking up a huge grill to itself on the left, al pastor (adobada) occupying a vertical spit to the right, and the rest of the meats enjoying a bath or sauna in the center. You may have to line up 3 times (and you probably should), so it's nice to bring friends. Luckily, they work quickly enough that I was able to handle it myself during Monday lunch rush.\n\nI tried all of the meats in taco form, and I will list them from best to worst (per my impression):\n\nAsada ($2.25): I used to think Taco Tijuana had the best asada, but this is on par and perhaps even better. With the pico and guac, this beef is juicy, acidic, and just so freaking good even when it gets cold after you've been waiting in lines. It might be just a touch salty, but that's nothing a slice of radish or two can't take care of.\n\nAl pastor ($2.25) was excellent, just a touch shy of my favorite (ever \/ in town). The dude actually waited for the vertical spit to turn to just the right spot to cut the caramelized meat. Make sure to get the pineapple, complimentary and available upon request. They're a must-have topping, and they lend the perfect sweetness even though these relatively large slices were a bit clunky.\n\nBuche ($2.25), flavorful, tender pork stomach (not belly) served with red sauce. This is at least as good as what I used to consider my favorite buche in town, but I felt that I was able to taste more of the pork here.\n\nLengua ($2.40): I confused this with the cabeza at first, but this is definitely the superior head meat. This beef tongue was flavorful despite it being one of my last bites of the meal, and the green tomatillo sauce is the perfect acidic complement. it's certainly one of the better lengua tacos around town, and although it comes at a premium, the price is not _that_ much higher.\n\nSuadero ($2.25): beef shoulder, served with red sauce. It's pretty salty and a little dry\/tough, but the marinated flavor and meatiness make this a great option. As with other salty dishes, a bite of crunchy radish (available at a cart near the fountain drinks) helps to take away the edge enough.\n\nTripas ($2.25): crispy fried beef intestine w\/ red sauce. It's definitely overly salty\/intense. While it's serviceable, it's not one of the standouts here. There are at least two local taco places that have better tripas.\n\nCabeza ($2.25): cow head meat with tomatillo sauce. It's tender, and while the first bite was delicious, the rest of it fell flat as I've noticed cabeza sometimes does. Perhaps it was lacking some of the fatty, cartilaginous pieces that would make this a standout.\n\nCesos ($2.40): cow brain, served with tomatillo sauce. Subtle flavor that I could just detect. I know it should be soft, but this one was a little on the mushy side. This texture concern and the extra cost are why I'd say it's the least desirable meat here, but it's still worth a try if you have the stomach space.\n\nFor delicious Mexican street tacos, Tacos El Gordo really should be at the top of your list. Assuming I get a taco craving and don't wanna wait for special sales, this would be my first recommendation for tacos in general, and for asada and buche in particular. Choose this location if you're in the area or otherwise really wanna avoid Strip traffic.
