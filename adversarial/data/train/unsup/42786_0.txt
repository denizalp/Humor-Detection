Been here a few times now since they've changed the menu (I added pics of the new menu to the photo album on here) and it's just amazing.\n\nEverything there is so good. Both of us have tried a bunch of different menu items and have been super delighted by each one. The pulled pork eggs benedict (added a pic), the chorizo hash, the regular breakfast, the huervos rancheros, you name it. \n\nService is still a LITTLE slow but with such a unique menu and delicious dishes, it's totally worth the wait. Love the wait staff too, friendly and adorable.\n\nA staple for us now at brunch.
