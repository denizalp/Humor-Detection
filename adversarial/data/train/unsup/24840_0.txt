I first came to Grimaldi's on a third date, where I was an innocent victim, not realizing I walked into the crossfire of two boys and their pizza food fight.   One boy tried to hit the other boy with the pizza as it mistakenly came flying over to hit me in the arm.  Covered with sauce, their father came to my \"rescue\" with his filthy napkin and wiped my saucy arm.......clean???   \n\nGreat start to a date hey!  haha  \n\nI loved the pizza so much this became one of my favorite places and favorite stories to tell.   The decor is always nice, the brick walls and wine bottle light fixtures are a great touch.  For the most part, Grimaldi's has been excellent at all of their locations.  For some reason, the Scottsdale Quarter location has been quite disappointing.  I usually order a large pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and extra basil and I love it!  However, it has been burnt the last few times and I don't mean a little burnt.  I mean where you bite into the pizza and it is really dry and crunchy kinda burnt.  Not sure if they have been overcooking the pizza or not putting enough sauce on it, but it has been exceptionally dry.  \n\nMy favorite locations are Old Town Scottsdale and DC Ranch.
