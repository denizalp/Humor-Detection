I got my mba there. My degree was worth almost nothing, better than nothing but not much, by employers. I was stupid and started my doctoral program.  The qualifications for their phd program are twofold to be barely literate and a person of color. And ideally a person who learned nearly nothing in undergraduate school but that's an extra. My program had people  dressed in evening clothing and people who fought over seats like two year olds.  I cannot imagine why this school is on business.
