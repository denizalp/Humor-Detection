If you like the Tiki room at Disney then you'd enjoy this place, ambience reminds me of it and they have alcohol and gaming! (main purpose of my visit). You walk in and the first thing you hear is the \"YO HO YO HO A PIRATES LIFE FOR ME!\" through their entrance speaker.\n\nThe place has tiki decor and memorabilia all over the place, down to the clam lounge chair and Polynesian masks on the walls. The drinks taste great, be forewarned they sneak up on you, especially the pain killer. My favorite is thier Mai Tai, although they do have a huge selection on their menu. \n\nThe place has really dim lighting which I prefer when getting away from the hot bright sun we have in this town. There's a private VIP area in the back for private functions and plenty of booth seating and bar space. They have dole whips! YES the same ones they give you @ Disney for a price of course but totally worth it. \n\nThe ONLY drawback is there's no TV's, so if you want to watch the Rebel game that's a no go, it would definitely be a plus, even if it was muted, people like there sports, and I much rather watch it here than a PT'S up the street. Prices are very reasonable on the drinks and they have cool garnishes, from flowers, lil pirate flags and mermaids hanging off your glass. \n\nOverall definitely be coming back, much better than Little Macau that used to be here, if it wasn't for the TV situation I'd give it 5 stars, it would go along with alcohol and gaming. If your not into the fufu drinks defenitly pay a visit for the dole whips!
