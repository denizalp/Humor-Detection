Very impressed with the food; So yummy! Was kind of bummed that the 30% Happy Hour only applies to the Sushi Bar area, not the restaurant. Had I known that, we would have sat at the bar. Staff was friendly & more attentive as the night went in. The prices aren't bad but not cheap. Maybe start offering AYCE more days of the week along with drink specials? Just a suggestion.
