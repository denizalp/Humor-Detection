My friends had come here a day before us and we mentioned we wanted oyster bars too.. so they brought us back for round two the next day.\n\n$1 happy hour Oysters 2:45-6:00pm.  \n\nWe came in around 4ish.. and were seated quickly.. however we were seated behind a pillar thing and it was hard to flag anyone down... after about 15-20 minutes we finally got someone's attention and apparently they were in a middle of a shift change and he wasn't aware he had a table to serve.  Once he finally acknowledged us service was great.  We ordered 4 dozen oysters and 2 ultimate bloody marys.\n\nThe oysters were fresh and delicious.. there were some that were some that were on the small side.. and some where there were shells in the oysters that it hurt my teeth when I accidentally bit down on it.  I also like my oysters with plenty of lemon juice and a platter of a dozen comes with one lemon.  Our server was very kind to bring us a another plate of lemons.\n\nThe ultimate bloody mary actually tastes pretty goood (for someone who doesn't like tomato juice)  I tried it and wasn't revolted by it.  It does cost about $15 each.. I would rather have 15 oysters over one bloody mary but hey it's vegas and drinks are steep and people come to drink.\n\nThe mint after eating a bunch of oysters is also a plus.  \n\nWhen i'm in vegas and looking for good oysters for a good price I will be back.
