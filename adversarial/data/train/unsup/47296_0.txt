Let me tell you friend, Maizie's is the ultimate in local eateries! I live within walking distance from the cafe and try to the best of my ability to make it for brunch every Saturday. \n\nThe menu is simple, which I love because you aren't overwhelmed with a ton of choices. \n\nThe bartendress Tina is the best of the best!! Everything you want in a good drinkslinger... great conversation, sass and personalized attention. \n\nMaizie herself works in the restaurant often and you can tell she has a real drive to make her restaurant a success. \n\nMy recommendations: \n\nBrunch: The Classic On Central. Two eggs any style, home fries, spicy Italian sausage or bacon and toast. \n\nLunch: Tri Tip Steak Salad. Bed of baby spinach, tossed with some kind of vinaigrette dressing, kalamata olives, feta cheese crumbles and a decent portion of Tri Tip sliced on top of the salad. \n\nDinner: Any of the stuffed burgers or even just the classic Bistro Burger. Always cooked to perfection. Don't forget to ask for the Chipotle mayo to dip french fries in!! \n\nYou will love it!
