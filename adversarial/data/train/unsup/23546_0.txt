I'm visiting family in Arizona, I have very strict dietary needs for health reasons. I was pleased to learn that this restaurant offered a gluten free hamburger and sweet potato tater-tots that are not cooked in corn or soy oil. I got my order to go, and called ahead to place it so when I arrived it would be ready. I show'd up 15-20 mins later and my food was ready in the time they quoted me. The staff was helpful although it did take longer than I anticipated to pay. \n\nThe burger itself was nothing special, it was bland and had absolutely no flavor, they just grilled a meat patty and put it on a gluten free bun, which also wasn't that great. It's hard to find good food that tastes great when you have special dietary needs. All in all I would have been better off making the burger at home. This is a place hyped up by the locals and over all is OK for the price. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone that wants a really good hamburger. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for bland mediocre food that will fill their bellies but put their taste buds to sleep. Also if you have special dietary needs, you should be ok to eat here, just don't expect anything spectacular.
