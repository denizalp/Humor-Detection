Being inside Chasers is horrible. It's packed, you'll never ever get a booth and worst of all its incredibly loud. Better brush up on your sign language if you wanna talk with your friends. There is no single sane person inside the bar, but outside is another story. This patio is great. Lots of seating and the music is at a pleasant volume. This is my favorite place on campus to hangout with friends during summer. And the best news is they just added a tent with outdoor heating and some small tv's, so fall doesn't mean goodbye Chasers, but rather hello football!!\n\nChasers has decent priced pitchers and they dont have cocktail servers so thats the way to go if you're going to be outside.\n\nWord to the wise, don't ever do anything thats even borderline in the eyes of a bouncer. These guys are pretty douchy and will use excessive force at the slightest inkling. I have been shoved and yelled at to clear the way for perfectly calm individuals being escorted out in a deadlock. Really? REALLY?
