A downside to this location is parking. Either street parking or there's several spots in the midst of the condos. However, I must warn you that parking there is much more expensive than street parking. I can't remember if it was $1 or $2 per 15 minutes, yikes! \n\nI had gone after the lunch rush and it wasn't too busy. We ordered spicy tteokbokki, bulgogi kimchi rice, and udon noodle in soup. I regret ordering spicy, I should've gone with regular. My tongue was on fire. The bulgogi kimchi rice was delicious but the portion seemed a bit small.
