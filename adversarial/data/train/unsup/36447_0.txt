Outstanding!   What an awesome meal!  Great service, great atmosphere, outstanding food!  I ordered the Poutine for an appetizer (amazing), my friend got the matzo ball soup - he loved it...I got the chicken meat ball with cheese tortellini and pesto (to die for!) and then to top it off got the ricotta doughnuts with cream cheese icing - oh my god, they were the best doughnuts I have ever eaten!  Truly amazing.  Great local find!  Check it out- you won't regret!!!!   And by the way, I got a Moscow mule too...was great.  10 out of 10!
