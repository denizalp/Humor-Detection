Completely. Totally. Utterly - UN-impressed. \n\nI am not going to bother to nit-pick my lame experience through 5 'courses' (yes, 1 of them on a tiny spoon - maybe we took Thumbelina's table).  \n\nSalad: \"OK\"\nSteak: CHEWY (spat out several pieces - gross, i know)\n(with hash browns for DINNER?!?!)\n\nsourdough bread served with olive Oil (!?!) combined taste = acidic\nsmurf blue cotton candy  (WTH?!?!)\n\n1 star for a yummy dessert - but by then i was pissed off, so it only counts to actually write and insert this reveiw!\n\nended up a pissy nite with us blaming each other who's stupid idea it was to choice to waste our nite (and MOOLA !!) here.
