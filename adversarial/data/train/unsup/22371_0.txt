When I recently visited the Greater Toronto Area, the buzz word was \"cronut.\"  Launched by Ansel Bakery in New York about 5 months ago, the cronut is a hybrid of buttery layers of a croissant & crisp fried crunchiness of a doughnut.  I asked GTA Yelpers Wayne C. & Jennifer K. where to get them, & they directed me to Maple Bakery in the suburb of Maple in Vaughan. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/maple-bakery-maple?select=46IGxAXqcmMxhvAH-G0ZTg \n\nNot knowing how popular cronuts were, I was surprised that they were sold out when I got there. Regular flavors were $3.75 each (sugar, cinnamon\/sugar, chocolate or vanilla or maple glazed) & custard cream filled at $5 each. I was told to pre-order, even if it was only for 1 cronut, to ensure that I get one. I then placed an order for 2 cronuts, their most popular flavors being cinnamon\/sugar & chocolate glazed, for pick-up the next day. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/maple-bakery-maple?select=PjD5pl2i_IoVZy33WbbSmg \n\nThe cronuts were delicious!  The outside was crunchy, & the inside layers were light & airy. The cinnamon\/sugar mixture made each bite so flaky delicious, with the cinnamon\/sugar crystals falling all over me as I ate; & real dark chocolate was used which made the cronut so creamy and rich chocolaty w\/ each bite. Don't know how the taste compared w\/ the original cronut, but those from Maple Bakery were very delicious. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/maple-bakery-maple?select=l3gNX4Z2FTcaENirE9ujhA http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/maple-bakery-maple?select=NH3EcNAvy1MG8tv2Pj9kFQ \n\nBut what made the trip to this bakery that was so interesting was not only the cronuts, but that the bakery was more than a bakery.  Opened in 1983, Maple Bakery is an authentic Italian bakery owned\/ operated by the Russo Family, w\/ recipes handed down by many generations. It started off as a small bakery and gradually expanded over the years to include breads, gelato, sandwiches, hot table, deli, and grocer. In addition to cronuts, some of its offerings, which are made daily, include:\n\n- Fresh Italian-style breads\/buns - Calabrese (relating to Calabria, a region of southern Italy) breads, Panini,& many others http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/maple-bakery-maple?select=-Kd0sECcx8gJjBQQuNJu1A \n- Custom cakes - birthday, wedding, baptism, baby blocks shower cake, & many others http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/maple-bakery-maple?select=slUZqasUrMCjHjLtfNlEuw \n- Cookies - shortbread, amaretti, church cross http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/maple-bakery-maple?select=-e_sL53t9iKXJ7GEO_7MgQ \n- Fresh pastries - cartocci, cannoli, & many more http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/maple-bakery-maple?select=Fo2cBvVrZGzXQSAN_P4qZw  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/maple-bakery-maple?select=CjtrVvSE7Glj4Ld8CSN5Aw \n- Homemade gelato - lemon, hazelnut, chocolate, & more\n- Deli - Italian cold cuts (salami, prosciutto, sausages, etc.) & cheeses http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/maple-bakery-maple?select=1el8HcJJ9cHdm-VnGUb1GQ \n- Hot table - gourmet pizzas, veal sandwiches, steak on a bun, lasagna, chicken\/eggplant parmigiana, & more\n- Grocery items - breadcrumbs, oil, antipasto, soft drinks, coffee\n\nThere is a dining area where you can have any of the above as a snack or meal w\/ coffee. During the 2 times that I was there, it was a homey feeling, as community residents knew each other by name, eating what they ordered, & chatting about the local happenings; there was no rush to be anywhere but here.  A real business that you felt like it was your family. In fact, all of Maple Bakery's employees are either family or long-time employees who know the community well. As the city of Vaughan has a large Italian community, this Italian bakery fills the needs of that community. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/maple-bakery-maple?select=X1hEaqqJaTRolJETbeiljg \n\nI enjoyed the pretty decorated pastries, which I could tell contained real butter & real chocolate. I loved the cartocci (cylindrical doughnut filled w\/cannoli cream & chocolate chips) & the cannoli (Sicilian tube-shaped pastry shell filled w\/sweet, creamy ricotta cheese filling). No skimping of real ingredients here. Truly Italian!\n\nIn trying to decide which pastries to get, I noticed that names of the items were not posted & because I was not familiar w\/ Italian desserts, I could only point to what I had wanted; however, as the customers are predominantly Italian & from the local community, they know what they want, & there is no need to post any names to identify the items. (I guess I need to get up to speed.)  \n\nThe bakery is located inconspicuously in a small plaza just north of Major Mac on the west side of Keele Street, w\/parking available in the private lot.\n\nMaple Bakery not only has Italian baked items, but also has hot food, deli items, gelato, and grocery items. It's also a casual restaurant. And it sells cronuts. Love to go back to try the rest of the items!
