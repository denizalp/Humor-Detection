first time staying here.. this is a nice hotel but they get one star because of all the bull crap we had to go through.. first of all.. it took a long time to check in.. they messed up on our reservations.. we were suppose to get a junior suite with a pull out.. once we got to the room.. it was pretty much a regular room.. we made due.. they also SAID! that they were going to switch our room the next day.. we did call in the morning and the room was of course not ready.. the only good thing was the bellhop.. kept me entertained while all this was getting sorted out.. also!!!! the valet guy did not give us a valet ticket which of course we didnt notice till we were going to check out.. oh yea also they told us valet was full when we got there without asking if we were checking in.. so we had to go all the way to the back.. and that valet guy told us that we should go back to the front. sigh!
