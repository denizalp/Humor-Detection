The B in Banjara actually stands for BEST. Seriously, dinner here a few weeks ago was just so delightful, flavourful and filling that I can't think of another word to describe our experience.\n\nThis place runs like a well oiled machine and the staff (whom I might add are in abundance) are all about top notch service. My beer, not my water glass ever went a minute without being topped up by someone.\n\nFor dinner we went with their butter chicken and the palak paneer, and shared a side of Jasmine rice and garlic naan. We shared everything and I really wish we hadn't because I selfishly wanted all the butter chicken to myself, it was so good. I did think that the portion side overall was a bit on the small side, but maybe that was my desire for more that got me flustered.\n\nThere aren't a lot of great Indian spots in the city, and Brampton\/Mississauga is sometimes just too far when you want a quick fix, so I'll definitely be back here.\n\nEatcrest Out
