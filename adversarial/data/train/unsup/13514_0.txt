Maybe the best part or reason for coming here on game days: happy hour specials, aka 50% off, on all appetizers, which on Football Sunday's is essentially all day.\n\nTo balance that, for non-smokers, is well, the second hand smoke from all the generous smokers enjoying packs and packs of their cigarettes of choice. Sharing is caring I guess.\n\nThe Football Burger Special is what I ended up ordering (1\/3 pound burger with side of fries), which is the most popular item to order with my group of friends. For $5.50 it is a decent burger, while you watch in agony or serenity as your team implode or dominate on the field. But even better than this classic burger is their crispy fries.\n\nAfter watching the second half of this week's afternoon games, we walked out while the sun is still up, but smelling like I personally smoked 3-5 cigarettes. Glad I left my jacket in the car, even though it is brisk 57 F degrees.\n\nUntil next time. Maybe.
