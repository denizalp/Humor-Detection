Make sure you Touch this Club! Wow was that lame. Touch Supper Club on the other hand, is not lame. The moment you walk in, at least when I walk in, the adrenaline just starts pumping the moment you walk in to the I Got 5 On It party (last Saturday of every month)! The gist of details (main one is a cover charge after 10 pm and I feel like I've been charged anywhere from $5 to $10, FYI) is pretty standard. You are greeted to chill 90s hip hop and R&B on the first floor. There's a full service bar and large tables across from it. It's narrow up there, but it's spacious compared to the real party downstairs! You'll eventually bounce between the two floors to get a breather, believe me! Basically the chill 90s music upstairs is turned to the all the top hits from 90s hip hop in the basement! There's a bar down there too, about half the size as upstairs. It really is a basement party set in the 90s. There are a few lounge areas down there, but everyone is up and dancing. If you're claustrophobic, you'll most likely not be a fan of the downstairs craziness. But if you love everything from Biggie to 2pac, from TLC to SWV, you'll have a blast!\n\nI can really only vouch for the bar and dance experiences. I remember they used to have sushi deals (good sushi!) each Friday as a happy hour promotion, but I'm not sure if it's still running. If you're trying to pivot away from the standard 25th bars and need to switch it up, you really can't do much better than making your way over to Touch!
