I really enjoy this place. The people are friendly. And they have a rotation of flavors each month! They also seem to have different flavors depending on the weeks. That said I'm sad when they tease me with a flavor I enjoy only to come back and not find it again. But that's ok because they have tons of other delicious flavors to try!
