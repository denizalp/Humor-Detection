Terrific service this morning getting my oil change done here. I made an appointment online for the first of the day and when they opened, the service manager took me first. I left the car with them and walked up the street two blocks and had breakfast.\n\nThey called not 30 minutes later and my car was done. There was a brief attempt to upsell me to get the fuel system cleaning for an additional $60 but I booted that until next time. They have a number of \"e-coupons\" for auto services so if you're a AAA member, check them out.\n\nWhen I returned to pick up the car, my eye spotted a San Francisco \"pocket guide\" on one of the shelves, so I picked that up and paid for it as well. The very nice gal who rang me up also gave me some recommendations for my trip.\n\nI do like being a AAA member!
