Over the years, before I became a member of yelp, I dined at this buffet.  It used to be fabulous. but now....'not.  We had tickets to the Penn & Teller show and thought it would be nice to eat at The Rio before the show.  Back in the day, there were lobsters, but now, there are \"lobster\" tails.  They are not lobsters.  I think what they are serving is langostino, and, after I brought a couple of them to my table, I could not eat them.  They were mushy and tasteless.  Do not believe the hype that they serve lobster, because they do not.  They did offer very large crawfish, which would have been terrific for this Louisiana native; however, someone (please!) needs to teach the chef how to cook them.  They had no seasoning and were bland and again nearly tasteless.  The crab legs were skinny sticks, and there were NO oysters.  All in all, the food was not EVEN mediocre, and the service was awful.  We originally added a 20% tip when we paid for the buffet, but we cancelled the tip and left a few dollars.  Casinos are raking in a lot of money.  They could at least offer decent buffets.  Making the trip to the Rio from the Strip is a little journey, but, now, there is no reason for us to go again.
