Nothing but Noodles has become our go to place with the kids. There is something for everyone. They take Mac and Cheese to a new level. My wife gets the Asian Salad or the Spicy Cajun Chicken each time. As a tip you can get extra noodles for a few dollars more. \n\nDo not worry about seating when you walk in. Service is fast and people will be done by the time you order and look for a seat.
