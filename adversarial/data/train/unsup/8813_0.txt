Beautiful modern interior. Customer service was very helpful since this is only my third time having a poke Bowl. She explained everything very patiently. It was nice to see that it was very clean in there the food was very presentable filled neatly. I was also offered to a sample of the spicy tuna which is so nice and also delicious! \nCan't wait to try more of their choice. \nI do wish they could have given me a little bit of ice to take home to help preserve my poke Bowl .\nI also have to add when I got it home my poke Bowl was amazing everything was  so fresh and I loved everything. she even put the rice in a separate bowl for me to take to work the next day. I can't go back  to try the lobster!!
