As far as safeways go, this is pretty standard, fresh bakery, deli counter butchery and aisle upon aisle of a vast array of products. Safeway has a reputation for being expensive, but I have noticed lately they have reduced prices quite a bit on some items. Also they often have buy one get one free...a great deal. \nThe thing I like about this safeway is the spacious aisles and it never feels crowded to me. The one downtown that I usually go to can feel a bit insane, this one isnt like that.  The only thing I dont like is the security guard they sometimes have standing guard in the produce section entrance that leads to the mall, it always seemed accusatory to me... I understand that maybe they have to do this..I just never really liked it. \n. For the longest time they didnt have the self scan, but now they have followed the trend and added them.  \nThis is a nice safeway. I like it.
