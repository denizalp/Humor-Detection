Good atmosphere, delicious food and great service.\n\nWe came here as a party of four and all new to this restaurant. We were greeted by a warm and welcoming server who explained some of the dishes, cocktails and what she recommended. \n\nWe started with a few cocktails including the Peter Rabbit and Bad Bad T-Roy Brown. I loved the Rabbit... I added the gin to it and it made for an easy to drink refreshing cocktail that was a little sweeter so the alcohol didn't overwhelm you. Definitely a hit.\n\nAs for the food, we ordered the kale and romaine caesar, potato fries, JP's chicken wings, jalapeno-chorizo corn, brussels & walnuts and eggs and bacon. \n\nMy favorites were the potato fries, corn and brussels. The fries were so delicious fried in duck fat! They were crunchy, salty and had more flavor then a regular french fry because of the oil. The chipotle ketchup they are served with was also good fit and we asked for an extra serving of it. The brussel sprouts were roasted with a nice char on them and were tossed in lemon and walnuts. I loved the extra crunch from the walnuts and the tangy zest from the lemon. I could have eaten the whole dish by myself. I felt the same about the corn, spicy and sweet. It's a dish I wouldn't normally order but I am glad we did. \n\nWe also had the pb & J dessert and chocolate s'more dessert. I think they were both hits but the preferred the s'mores. \n\nWe had great service, the dishes all came out in a timely manner one or two at a time which I appreciated so we could take our time and our table wasn't packed to the brim with dishes. Thanks for the experience Searsucker!
