Horrible. That wasn't even a massage. She just lathered on coconut oil over and over and over again in quick movements , barely even massaging. I kept thinking what the hell is she doing? Sad because I see soo many good reviews but I got a bad masseuse. \nBest Foot Spa ...? Not even good foot massages. I could have massaged myself better than That. But go figure, this place is cheap prices Its normal to get a bad masseuse here
