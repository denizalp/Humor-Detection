health food sells. cost $$ but keep in mind cheaper food is not as healthy so treat your health to this. food is delicious not heavy. tried a new organic drink kombucha like yogurt it has cultures - good for digestion. wanted more from the menu but takes self control if you wanna get on the right track. the selections are almost like a fusion but take a wiser choice of food types. \nrestaurant offers salad buffet also. there is a shelving section for vegan organic products from supplements to books.\nbooth seating and garden relaxing tables are available. \nstaff is pleasant. order with a smile :-)
