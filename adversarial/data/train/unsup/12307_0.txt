Yelp 365 Challenge #152\/365 (Las Vegas Adventures in July) \n\n\nThis was my tip as I checked in: DJ Angel has a voice...make sure you know how to sing too...\n\nIt's true, you better know how to sing because this DJ can SING. However, call me bias but my niece who sang the last night we were in Vegas rivaled the DJ's voice. \n\nAnyhoo! My husband and I don't do karaoke not because we do not drink but because we just never did care for karaoke. However, our family has some talented singers and musicians. And this is what the older crowd chose to do while the younger crowd decided to take on the rides at New York New York.\n\nThis place is a filipino owned business (hence, the filipino name). Around this area is what I would call asian city because right across the street there are various asian eats (thailand, japanese, korean) with Kapuso beckoning across the street for anyone to sing after eating. \n\nI almost missed Kapuso and was about to whip my rental car around the parking lots but my husband pointed out that it was across the street.\n\nI gritted my teeth, smiled nicely and drove into the little parking lot. As I stepped out of the car, the sign blared up brightly at us. My first thought was \"Ugh...a karaoke BAR\" but hey...last night with the family that we may not see again for awhile, so we stepped in. \n\nYour typical karaoke bar with a dance floor *eyebrow raised*. Our nieces and nephews waved at us from the back. All I could think of is \"I'm hungry..is it just filipino pupus?\" \n\nOur waiter didn't come right away to where my husband had to grab menus. \n\nI was not in the mood to eat filipino food but I chose their shanghai lumpia when I was actually craving for...pulehu steak, fries, soybeans, and chicken! But, I settled for the shanghai lumpia because you can't go wrong with that appetizer.\n\nAs we listened to everyone sing, we found out that next door was for dancing. As we sat there and was wowed by our nieces and nephews, I noticed that they have a great list of  songs from different genres (filipino to contemporary pop, rock or R&B). Another thing I noticed is that the DJ would deliberately place herself on the lineup list for individuals who were singing. \n\nIMHO...if there are alot of people coming here to sing, can Kapuso minimize the amount of times that the DJ sings? Yes, granted she is talented but I don't know. It started to seem like she was showboating especially after I noticed she would deliberately sing after anyone who sang really well just to try and \"one up\" on them. I kept thinking that hopefully someone will nominate her to be on \"The Voice\"\n\nAnyhow, overall experience was okay. The family time spent there is what upped my rating to four stars.\n\nIf you like dimly lit karaoke bars, this is a place for you.\n\nIf you want to listen to everyone including the DJ sing, this is the place for you\n\nIf you are craving filipino food and want to sing Dahil Say Yo afterwards? This place is for you\n\nIf you want to dance the favorite filipino party dances (macarena, ocho ocho, electric slide), then yes, this place is for you!
