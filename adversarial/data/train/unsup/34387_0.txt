My husband says that the carrot cake cupcakes are out of this world. I haven't had one that I'm that in love with yet, but I'll keep trying. The best part are the absolutely amazing cakes that they turn out. I have no idea what they taste like, but they are gorgeous and super creative. Good luck to this new business!
