I have always had great experiences at MEC. The staff always seems to know what they are talking about and they definitely aren't trying to sell you on the most expensive item. I have a sleeping bag from MEC that is 10 years old and it is still as good as new. My hiking bag is about 5 years old, has been through hell and high water and when i throw it in the wash - it looks as good as new. \n\nSeriously, the stuff you buy from here will last forever. And the prices are really good, like wayyyy better than north face and all that jazz. \n\nAlthough I am not quite as adventurous as I once was, MEC still has useful items. The most recent purchase? These insane little nalgene type containers that are small enough to be in a liquids carry on bag. Leak proof and break proof with a wide mouth. They are perfect. I sense a collection coming on!
