So my inner Vietnamese woman (iVw) has been seriously craving some yummy cookery and who am I tell a lady no. So we grabbed the mister and shuttled off to Kinh Do to satisfy her deepest cravings. \n\nService was quick, friendly and efficient. Our meals arrived with 5 minutes of being placed which made me think, can rushing a good thing comprise quality. At Kinh Do, no way! Hot fresh and ready to chow!\n\nBun Bo Hue - deep rich brother with a nice amount of dark red annatto oil over the top. The meats were incredibly tender with a nice amount of fat to add to the richness. There were a few pieces of blood cake which taste like liver and pennies. The killer  broth and the thick noodles satiated my iVw in no time. \n\nBanh Mi - Vietnamese BBQ Pork. The issue with the banh mi wasn't with the tasty ample meats and veggies but with the bread which was dry and crumbly. A good banh mi is only as good as the bread its in. A great use for the bread was dunking it into the bun bo hue. So good! Like a Vietnamese French dip!\n\nMe, the mister and my iVw were all very happy with Kinh Do and cant wait to go back and try a big steaming bowl of bun rieu. Crab and pork for the win! My iVw sleeps now until she's ready to feed once more.
