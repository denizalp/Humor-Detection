I was highly disappointed in underground butcher.  If you're only looking for cured meats or nice cheeses its great.  But there is absolutely no information about the butcher on their website. ( both me and my husband had to back to google and search for just the butcher part) and don't think this is a butcher.  Butchers are people who are literally cutting your meat off the whole animal.  That's what I was expecting and was severely disappointed.  We wanted to get some steaks and what was in the butcher case was a small selection and it looked disgusting.  It looks dry and crusty and disgusting.  Not to mention there is no sign out front except for a tiny chalkboard.  Plus the staff wasnt super friendly or anything.  basically my husband andni stoo there awkwardly in silence as we waited for our sandwiches.  Also our sandwiches were just okay.  The bread had huge air pockets in it and was basically had a burnt crust...it was not good bread for sandwich making.  My husbands pastrami was undercooked to where he didnt want to finish his sandwich....it was a disappointing experience overall...don't think I'll go back unless I need cured meats.
