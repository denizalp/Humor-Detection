I've spent a lot of time studying here recently for a pretty crazy test.  it's not the biggest library but it's the most convenient for me (right on the way home from work).\n\nThey've got some comfy chairs and a great selection of movies and cds as well. \n\nAll that being said, what has happened to our library system these days???  I feel like nobody respects it anymore and people talk on their phones, scream at their kids and have incredibly personal conversations at a loud volume in the study areas.  I wish the public library system would hire me and give me a nerf bat to beat overly loud strangers with.
