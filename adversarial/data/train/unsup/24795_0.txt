Run-down hole-in-the-wall bakery, you wouldn't know it's here if you don't stop in the plaza for one of the other businesses. They have a surprisingly large selection of pastries and desserts, but cakes seem to be their specialty- hence the name. Several whole cakes on display for purchase, and they have several delivery trucks so I suspect they mostly deal with special orders.\n\nNoteworthy items they have here are Mexican wedding cookies, Napoleon cakes, and various guava pastries. I found their lemon and pineapple turnovers to be overly bready with minimal filling, unfortunately. Their tres leches cakes get a lot of love, but I have yet to try them as they don't seem to be available in individual portions.
