+1 star for super cheap car rental rates.\n\n-2 for disorganization, wait time and skeleton staffing most times of the week.\n\nThe story:  Flew into Phoenix late at night and took the shuttle over to the massive car rental facility.  I looked around and only saw one tiny little sign for Fox rent a car next to the elevators.  Out of order.  Took the escalator to the bottom floor and followed more sign  to a bank of computers.  \"You have to check in up stairs sir\".    #%$#.  Up escalators out of order.  Double #$%#.   Trudge up three flights of stairs.  Four people in line in front of me, first three average ten minutes each.  The last one starts mouthing off at the guy at the front desk and asks for a discount.  Gah.  Adds another fifteen minute of non-haggling since the guy knows they're already the cheapest you can get in the area.  \n\nBottom line is I was in line longer for my rental car than the plane flight from LAX to PHX.  \n\nThe return was slightly less of a hassle.  Longer line, but shorter wait time.  Go figure.
