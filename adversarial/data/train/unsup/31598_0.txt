I had eaten ramen before but wasn't a fan until I tried this place.  Other aficionados might be able to guide you better if you are on a quest but as a white guy with little previous exposure to proper ramen, I think this place is amazing.\n\nIt is near work and we go about every other week.  My coworkers love the TanTanMen (the one with ground pork) so much it is the only thing they have ever ordered there.  In fact, this is the only place we go together for lunch as a group.\n\nI've tried about six of the soups and each has been delicious.  The smaller bowls leave me stuffed.  \n\nService is usually very quick and efficient.  They don't seem to mind giving us separate bills.\n\nRecommendation: if you are going for lunch on a weekday, you may not get a table if you don't show up before 12, especially in the winter.
