This place is the best! I can't even remember how many times I've been here. The staff is fabulous! You can tell that they are happy to work there. You won't sit through your meal without a few table touches from either your server or the owners. So rare of many restaurants nowadays, so refreshing to see owners care about their product and customers. \nOne of my favorites on their menu is their Truffle mac and cheese with bacon and mushrooms. This side dish blows my mind. The best mac and cheese ever! Please take my word and order it. Their jerk fried calamari is also excellent. \n\nAll of their desserts are great except for their red velvet cake. It was incredibly dry and disappointing. I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt that it might have just been a bad day for them. I ordered this at night so it might have been the last piece of a cake that has been out all day. \n\nRegardless, it would be unfair to give DW anything but 5 stars.
