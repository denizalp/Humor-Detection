I've been craving their food since last time I was in Vegas and it was just right that I came back ... craving for more!\n\nSince the friend and I were running low on energy... plus we had to watch a show in an awkward time... why not load up now!?\n\nWe did just that...\n\nI finally tried their Adobo Fried Rice Omelette with a side of spam masubi... with coconut juice... HEAVEN. I ate 75% of the omelette... it was honestly delicious! I also inhaled the spam masubi!\n\nFriend got the loco moco (since he never had it before...) and he devoured it. He wanted to trade when we got our food... I said no. Yes, I'm mean... but when a girl is hungry... you don't mess with my food!\n\nOur total for all our stuff... $20+ = our cheapest meal this past weekend!\n\nDefinitely try it out folks... it's so close to the strip... you won't get disappointed!\n\nPS: they had tapsilog for $4.99... was so tempted to get it but that would be gluttony overload. Next time... hopefully they'll still have it!
