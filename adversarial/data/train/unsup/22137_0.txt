This is the second Dollar Tree that I visited so far versus the Dollar Tree located on Freedom Drive. \n\nThis is a very active store with lots of customers. The aisles are narrow here but there is a lot more selection when it comes to candies, snacks, and other supplies. Shelves were stocked up and staff members were unloading merchandise and filling up with products. Here on a Wednesday mid-morning till noon.\n\nOne can always find something here at the Dollar Store. Only thing, I am not crazy about is the traffic on Pineville Matthews Rd.
