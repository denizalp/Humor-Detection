Last night my friend and I decided to stop by this bar for a quick bite. The evening started off with our server Yazmine, taking our drink order. I voiced my preference to draft beer and asked what Sam Adams seasonal was on draft. The server didn't know and went to ask to bartender, when she came back she said \"Yes we have the seasonal\" to which again, I had to ask what the name of the beer was and she still didn't know. In the end I ordered the regular Sam Adams and got it in the bottle *sigh*. At this point I have let this error go and did not say anything. Next, we ordered food; my friend got the chicken parm sub and I asked for the philly cheese steak with no onions or peppers and tomatoes on the side. When the food came, Yazmine asked if the order was correct and that I wanted everything on the side: bread, steak, cheese, tomatoes. I told her no, I just wanted it with no pepper or onions and tomatoes on the side. She proceeded to tell me that she repeated the order to me when she took it and this is what I wanted but she'll go and fix it for me. Later we also asked for waters which came after we were already done with our meal. Working in the food and beverage industry myself, I have never come across someone so incompetent. How does a server not know what beers are on draft? And if you were unsure of the accuracy of the order why not just double check? I mean, who would order a sandwich with everything on the side in the first place? Seeing as Yazmine had no other tables whatsoever, there is no excuse for the simple mistakes that were made. \nThe food was delicious so kudos to the chefs! This is the only reason I am adding 2 stars to this review.
