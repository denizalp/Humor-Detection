Ehh it was ALRIGHT ! The honest were very nice. I chose this place because of the what seemed great prices, then when I started ordering I realized it's one of those places that charge you for every little thing. I got charged an additional $1.50 JUST for some syrup. Like you're a breakfast spot cmon who does that? And if you're a syrup lover like me it's kind of a big deal. I'd probably go back but VERY rarely
