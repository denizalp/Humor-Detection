WE were here in Las Vegas to play in a  All World's Softball Tourney for the weekend. This place is a nice place to play at. They have replica fields that include Yankee Stadium, Crosley Field, Angels Field as well as others. The ball park is spacious and very clean, They have Batting cages for baseball and softball.  Food and drink can be found around the park, they are a little above the average price and the food is ok. They great fields to play on and they do keep the park clean, This was a great place to play in and we will be back for the next event here.
