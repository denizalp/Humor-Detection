Great experience! I was trilled to find a dress that was unique and to be able to take it home with me that day. The staff was friendly and fun. I had ordered my dress from another shop and it came but was the wrong dress, I was panicked with only 2 weeks to go before the wedding. I ended up with a dress that was perfect for me and even cheaper than the first. The alteration shop (A Stich in Time) they recommended was fantastic as well, made the tweaks to the dress in plenty of time. Thanks for saving the day.
