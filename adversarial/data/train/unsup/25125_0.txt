This is tough because you expect long lines but this location seemed to have exceptionally long lines while being understaffed. The photo license center was worse. The people there are nice and this is the reason I gave it 2 not 1 stars but they are overwhelmed and it shows. Perhaps if they hired more I'd rerate them higher...
