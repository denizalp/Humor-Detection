You can find bad service anywhere in vegas.  I don't like it but I try to grin and bear and just get thru it.  I will not however put up with people yelling at me.  \n\nI've heard for years how this sandwich shop is so good so on a whim I decided to try it while making some errands.  So I go up to the counter and they guy says \"what's your order, MAN?\".  \"I want a capastrami.\".  \"do you want anything special on that, MAN?\".  \"no\".  \"your order is $10.58, MAN\", then when he gives my change he starts rattling off some gibberish which I couldn't understand.  \n\nI was supposed to make a phone call but it was impossible in this place because it's so small and noisy so I went outside but they have this music blasting over a speaker just outside the door, so I gave up and went back in.  I took a table near the order desk and my name was called fairly quickly but when I got up and walked two steps over to the counter, this woman is still packing my order.  So I not only have to stand there and wait but I also have to dodge the people coming out behind the counter to deliver orders inside.  Really?  If I order something to go, I have to wait for them to call my name and then wait while they pack my order but if I order it inside they deliver????  Geez, really?  I didn't say anything; I'm not telling anybody how to do their job.   I took the order and started to walk out and I guess this woman behind the counter didn't like my attitude and so she says \"have a nice day\", and then again \"have a nice day\" and by the time I got out the door she was shouting it \"HAVE A NICE DAY\". \n\nTHERE'S NO FRUITY EXCUSE FOR THIS NONSENSE FOLKS.  I DON'T WORK FOR YOU AND YOU'RE LUCKY I DIDN'T LOSE MY TEMPER AND MAKE A SCENE OF IT. The sandwich was way over priced but it was pretty good, however, this chain of stores can go FRUIT themselves before I ever go back.
