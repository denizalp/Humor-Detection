When they advertise this as \"the cheapest zombie run in the nation\", they aren't kidding. You get what you pay for. For $20 (c\/o Groupon), you too can show up early only to wander the park looking for the event. This is the most disorganized \"organized event\" I have ever experienced.\n\n-No packet pickup the day before, everything is day-of only\n-No signage on streets or within the park directing participants to the sign in area\n-ONE person signing people in on a clipboard, taking down confirmation numbers without referencing any sort of confirmed list while SIX!!! pass out t-shirts?\n-Trail is a joke, dirt path around a dirt hill. The original trail around the lake we were supposed to use was full of families feeding ducks, fishing, and having picnics. Clearly no one affiliated with this group bothered to make any formal arrangements for us to be there.\n-\"Professional makeup artists\" turning people into zombies were few, seemed like they didn't have any \"zombie volunteers\" to take peoples flags, either.\n-Didn't start on time, at all. Reference my picture below. Cut off for sign in was 3:30, race was supposed to start at 4:00. By 4:15 no one had made any sort of announcement about what was going on or when we could expect things to get going.\n\nI'm only glad I didn't pay full price. As Cassandra B put it, \"This was the worst 5K in the history of 5Ks.\"
