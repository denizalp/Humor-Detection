Have you ever wondered what heaven tastes like? This place .. Let me tell you this place is like none other. It's like a quorum of sushi gods gathered together and personally hand crafted each and every sushi piece. From the divine baked oysters with cheese to white tuna that melts in your mouth, each item will have your taste buds orgasm. Their crème de la crème has to be aburi, which is blowtorched sushi, can only be described as food of the gods fit for king - an epicurean delight.\nUsually at all-you-can-eat you order and wait 10 min, but here we barely waited 3 until they started firing delicious dishes our way. Our order was fairly big, but the staff and chefs weren't even remotely phased. I know this because on top of bringing item after item a guy came and told us \"small order, you should order more\" - and so we did. The saying 'you don't stop eating when you're full you stop eating when you hate your self' does not apply here. If I went into a food coma and died it would be with a smile on my face.\nThe only negative to come out of this is that once you tasted best there's no going back to mediocre. I will no longer be able to go to a sushi place down the street it just won't be the same. I will order white tuna and spit it out like 'wtf is this shit, it doesn't even melt'.\nWill be back hundo p
