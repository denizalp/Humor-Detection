I have ordered from this restaurant several times, but will not be ordering again. Yesterday I ordered thru Grub Hub their pesto pasta, spinach calzone which I asked for extra spinach and a large cheese pizza. Yesterday I was nursing a backache and is why I ordered three items. The cheese pizza was okay it was cut really strangely not the usual triangle slices but it tasted okay.  Later that night I heated up the pasta and it was way too greasy to eat. That dish went straight in the garbage. Today I heated up the spinach calzone. There maybe five leaves of spinach and the rest was yucky onions and tomatoes. It was horrible   I called Grub Hub and complained. They contacted the manager who refused to issue a credit for the lousy food.  Having ordered  their spinach calzone several times I can tell you there were NO ONIONS before. There also no tomatoes either. The manager is a liar saying that the spinach calzone comes with onions.  DO NOT ORDER FROM TONY BIGS.  You will be ripped off. I spent over $60 last night for lousy food.
