Lol, Gold Diggerz...\n\nWell it should be spelled with a \"z\", it was pretty cheesy. I was with a group of people and we needed a quick drinky and dancy to end the night. Diggerz was right there so we said WTH.\n\nAside from the patio with its fun view of Fremont street, this place is a typical cheesy bar\/club. Service is good, but the crowd and music is um... dated, to be kind. I like pop music, but only if its fresh. When I hear something 70s or 80s come on though, forget about it. Totally lose my mojo with that. Think \"Margaret Thatcher naked on a cold day\" sorta limp. \n\nThen the older crowd walks in, and I learn where they get their name. Theres a queue of real-deal gold-diggers lined up at the door waiting to get some big spender to spend on them. Seriously? At least they are obvious about it. I can't imagine what guys go through at Caeser's or Luxor - where the real money is. \n\nAnyway, you get what you pay for and I paid nothing on my night at Diggerz. Cheers!
