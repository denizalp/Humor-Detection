So this is what normal looks like with great shops, restaurants, farmers markets, and community events it is all here to see in Summerlin. The scenery here is great with places where one can walk along paths with or without their fury companies. The people here are on a different vibe from the rest of Vegas, it is nice to take oneself of the neon bliss that we are usually surrounded around and we can experience that here surrounded by beautiful red rocks.
