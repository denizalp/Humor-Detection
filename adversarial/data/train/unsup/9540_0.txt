I don't know WHO thinks this is real BBQ. They must have either 1) never eaten real BBQ or 2) never had food with flavor before.\n\nThis CRAP is disgusting, bad location, no flavor. Brisket sandwich had NO flavor or bbq sauce and all fatty meat. The TriTip was just a few slices of fatty meat with no flavor.The hus puppies were OK, kinda burnt. For $25 bucks I'd rather eat anywhere else. What a waste of time and money.
