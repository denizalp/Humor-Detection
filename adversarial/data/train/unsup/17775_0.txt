Just not good\n\nToday my lunch companion and I were  in the mood for Chinese cuisine so we thought we would give Hong Kong Kitchen a try.  I realized Hong Kong receives many positive reviews but to be honest, it just wasn't good, in my opinion. Maybe I caught them on an off day.\n\nThe service was good. We were seated immediately, given menus, and our beverages were served quickly. So we choose our entrees, Sweet and Sour Chicken and pork, eggrolls, crab puff, rice, and refreshments.\nPrior to our entrees we were given a complimentary bowl of egg drop soup, however I just didn't like the taste. \n\nThe portion sizes at Hong Kong Kitchen are large, and the prices are fair, however, the food just isnt very good. The taste of the of the sweet and sour chicken\/pork was too sweet\/salty, and the liberal usage of corn starch made for an unpleasant taste. Both our dishes were smothered in sweet & sour sauce, to the point of being soggy. The entrees just weren't good. The same could be said about the rice and eggrolls.\n\nMaybe, I will revisit Hong Kong Kitchen, and give them another try, however, this visit wasn't very good.
