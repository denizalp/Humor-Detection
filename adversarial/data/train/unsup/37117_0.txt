Simple and Easy, this is the restaurant in the nut shell, this place has been around for ages. and they do 2 things well, Buns and chili oil beef cold dish. The Chili oil for the beef cold dish is perhaps the best thing here. it is flavorful and not too spicy, and feels perfect with the beef. The Buns are fairly big size, and will be a good lunch for most people. The fried bun on the other hand is not very good, it is definitely not one expects when they order it, and i would say stick to the steamed bun. the Pickled cabbage pork bun and spicy beef bun are recommended.
