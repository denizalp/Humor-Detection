I can't believe I'm just giving a Cirque Show and MJ 2 stars! I don't even know where to begin - was it the annoying child actors? was it the lack of dancing? too much gymnastics? the random stripper? the overpriced tickets? the unfamiliar songs? the too-far-off-the-strip hotel? \n\nBefore One, I saw Beatle's Love the year before and I was ahh-mazed with the coherent storyline, the creativity, the flexibility, the songs (which I didn't even grow up listening too). It was truly magical and the producers are geniuses! Unfortunately, I didn't even feel an ounce of this with the One. \n\nThe only pros: the very flexible, moon-walking dancer, the hologram, and the wall dancers. Everything else was depressing, slow and don't even get me started with the sound. I'm 30 years old, and I thought my ears were going to combust. Yikes!\n\nI truly think Mandalay Bay hotel is hurting and they came up with this show with no direction, no \"ah-ha\" production, and are trapping tourists (like me!). Ohh can't forget the $40 picture they sell from your step-and-repeat photo-op before the show starts! Please pass on this.... and the show!
