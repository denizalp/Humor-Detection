I really wanted to try stir-fried ice cream when I visited New York City back in August 2015, but did not have the money. To my surprise, a year later, a rolled ice cream shop opens in my hometown of Chandler, conveniently located in the former Popcornopolis' spot!\n\nI ordered the Romantic Bangkok consisting of Thai tea rolled ice cream. Though I wouldn't call the service slow, it does take time for the employees to prepare the ice cream and others' (I was behind two other customers). I hope they attract more customers and stay around long, because people were mostly passing by and barely stopping in. I really enjoyed the texture of the rolled ice cream and how creamy the flavor is in taste. I look forward to trying their Macho Matcha and Strawberry Graham flavor in the future.\n\nMy only suggestion to improve their business would be to use plastic lids for covering the ice cream, because I was taking it to go. Otherwise, I highly recommend this place.
