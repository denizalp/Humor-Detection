This review is for Emporio, the first floor restaurant in this building. My boyfriend and I enjoyed lunch here. We had wonderful service, the food came out quickly, and it was absolutely delicious! \n\nI give it a 5 star review because on top of everything, this restaurant has excellent gluten free service. I have celiac disease, and sometimes it's hard for me to eat out. But not here - everything on the menu is \"a la carte\" and extremely customizable. Each gluten free menu item is clearly marked, and they have a turkey parmesan meatball that is gluten free. I was worried at first that I would struggle to find a way to eat meatballs without having a sandwich, but our server was very knowledgeable about how the food was prepared and offered numerous suggestions for how to order the meatballs safely. I ended up ordering one turkey meatball over gluten free penne with the spinach almond pesto sauce. It was absolutely to die for! I also had a side of tomato risotto which was heavenly. So gluten avoiders, just tell your server, and they will help you come up with something delicious and safe to eat! \n\nMy gluten-eating boyfriend had a grinder with the spicy pork meatballs, pork bolognese sauce, and smoked gouda cheese. He enjoyed his food so much, he barely spoke throughout the meal! We will definitely be coming back.
