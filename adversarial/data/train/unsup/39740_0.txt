This place was great- $20 bottomless mimosas, and i had a carnitas breakfast burrito that was good but the carnitas was really dry so i do not recommend getting it with carnitas. My boyfriend had the prime rib philly cheese steak dip and it was amaaaaaaazing! I wish i had ordered that for myself but he shared! Service was good but not great (had to flag our server down a couple of times for drink refills) but i think it was because we went on a Sunday for brunch so they were busy. We can't wait to go back on our next vegas trip!
