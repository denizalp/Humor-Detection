We originally planned on going somewhere else but I'm glad we chose Urban Crawfish. The food was great, the music was great and the customer service was great. My friend and I shared the Cajun fries and a pound of shrimp with the sauces all mixed. It was so good! You get about 15 shrimp by the way.\nWe also both ordered a pound of snow crabs with corn and sausage, same sauce as shrimp and again, not disappointed. The next time I come to Vegas I'm going there first!
