One of the Tip Top dining establishments in LV.  For that, 5 stars.  \n\nTasting Menus for EVERY palate.  Stunning wine tower & frightening but gorgeous marble staircase.  \n\nFor the techie geeks out there: the electronic wine tablet was definitely one to behold.  VERY cool.  \n\nI have a pictorial of a majority of the evening, but I got too excited in the beginning, so I devoured everything in sight, hence the missing photos.\n\nAmuse: Butternut Squash Soup, pretty good, not clumpy and not too sweet.\n\nC1: Trio of Tuna\nHamachi Sashimi-Manton's Lemon Vinaigrette, Big Eye Tuna Tartar-Mongolian Vinaigrette & Toro-Smoked Shitake, Spicy Cilantro-Ginger Glaze.  Hamachi was fresh, but the lemon overpowered the fish, Big Eye, was like a light Hawaiian Poke, very good, the Toro blew our minds.  YES that good.  \n\nC2: Green Tea Smoked Moulard Duck Breast\nCreamy Parsnip \"Risotto\", huckleberry reduction, super fatty, slightly crisp, seasonal sauce & oh so good.  Love when Chef's surprise you with a veggie version of a starch.\n\nC3: Free Range Utah Bison Tournedo\nVanilla scented Hudson Valley foie gras torchon, black winter truffle, applewood smoked bacon & celeriac puree.  Huge hunk of lean meat.  Topped with all sorts of flavorful decadence.\n\nC4: Lady Gala Apple Frangipan Tart w\/a Salted Caramel Ice Cream.\nPuff Pastry Apple Pie Ala Mode-Haute Cuisine Style.\n\nAll tasting menus need to be ordered round the table, Chef was happy to substitute the trio of tuna with seafood gnocchi for our pregger's guest and nix the wine pairing.  They actually docked half the listed price.  AWESOME.\n\nMy dining partners appreciated the consideration, esp since many don't do substitutions.  It's nice to see restaurant's cater to their client's needs.  \n\nWhat is surprising to me most is how humble & almost boring the resto looks from the exterior.  Inside, it's modern and strikingly demure.  The food follows in the footsteps of the decor.  Aureole definitely has kept up with the new restos sprouting up all over Vegas.\n\nRiedel Anniversary Tasting Menu $195\/pp including four glasses of wine paired specially by Chef Pouessel and Master Sommelier Sherer.  All wine was served in Riedel Glassware, which is part of the permanent collection of the MOMA NY.  \n\nHonestly I couldn't tell if the glasses were from IKEA, but the wine, coupled with the ambiance, stellar service & expertly prepared cuisine were enough to make me come back for more.
