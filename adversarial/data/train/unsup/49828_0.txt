Went here around 9pm, restaurant was about 40% full.  We were tired of the food courts and wanted a decent meal without spending $200+.  \n\nAfter being sat, someone came by and filled water glasses for us, but it was at least another ten minutes before someone talked to us.  I still don't know if he was our actual waiter or not.  He didn't introduce himself, didn't ask what we wanted to drink and didn't mention any specials.  All he said was, \"were you ready to order?\"  I've had better service at Steak n' Shake.  No, we were not ready to order, but the beer I was going to spend $9 dollars on all of a sudden didn't seem worth it.  Also, changed my mind on not getting the $36 meal and just sticking with an appetizer.  After realizing the service was going to suck, we wanted to get a snack and get out.  So I got the crab cakes, wife got a salad and we shared the bleu cheese chips (that they forgot about and brought out after everything else).\n\nWe left satisfied with the food, all of it was very good, but what a service disaster.  I would expect this is not the rule here and would go back based on the quality of the food.
