The Key Exchange offered a $59 special a five-lock rekey, with $10 for each additional lock.  For $70, I got six locks rekeyed, on-site, and four new keys.  One of the doors didn't lock cleanly (because of the way the door was mounted) so they took off and re-seated the latch for me, no charge, no asking necessary.  Communication was good - called when they were on the way - and arrived on time during the scheduled window.  The time from arrival to paying the bill was 45 minutes.  If you place any value on your time or money, use this company.
