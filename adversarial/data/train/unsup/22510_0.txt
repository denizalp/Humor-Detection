I love beer gardens like this.  Just a lot of people, good food, and the beer is like angels pissin on your tongue moses :).  The parking is a bit crappy because its crowded here all the time.  Dinner time 5-8 is when this place is super crowded.  Around 9-11 is when the crowd dies down.  This place is super loud from the live band and the open dining area.  The waitresses are dressed in traditional German attire with the dress and their (.)(.) hanging out.  \n\nThe venue itself is very big.  There is a outside part as well but this place hasn't been that crowded that I've ever seen.  Restroom has a bathroom attendant on the weekends, and valet if you don't want to park yourself.\n\nThe food is excellent.  I had the sausage, with the dunkel.  Ughhh the Germans know how to brew some beer.  Theres a few to choose from but most German restaurants are the same in this aspect.  The band is always engaging with the crowd and playing traditional German songs with some American songs as well.  This place is fun and has so much going on.  Worth the time to check it out.
