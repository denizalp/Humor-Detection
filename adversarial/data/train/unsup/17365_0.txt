I'm a 25 year old grown-ass woman, and I just got my first pedicure.\n\nNow wait, its not like I have the worst feet ever, I just usually do my own maintenance.. i'm not a 'salon girl'. HOWEVER, I needed to spend some quality time with my mentees and they wanted to get mani-pedis. I shrieked. \"ughh okay, I guess I should probably try it\".\n\nI walked in to City Nails like a deer in the headlights. \"What would you like? Pedi? Gel? Choose color on wall?\" And i'm staring at a giant wall of OPI products thinking \"which one is pink?\" [enter 60 shades of red-pink-purple]. I did an eenie-meenie-mini-mo and grabbed something that resembled a normal color, and sat down on the chair.\n\nThe Pedi was $20 and I paid an extra $5 for callous treatment because if I was getting my feet touched by a small Asian lady I might as well go aaaaall the way. We clearly did not speak the same language but she smiled the whole time and was incredibly diligent with my feet. I was surprised how pampered I felt by the whole thing: Massage chair, hot stones and lotion on my legs, warm bubbling water at my feet, did I mention the massage chair? I was loving that thing so much that the picture I took was shaky from all the wobbling around.\n\nI got everything done within 20-30 minutes, which I did not mind because she was super thorough and nice. I was able to put her tip in my card and I was on my way. \n\nAs soon as I got home, I tripped on a rock and scrapped the nail polish off my toe. Fuck. Is this like, every woman's worst nightmare? I FINALLY GET IT NOW.
