First time in the shop, was not greeted. Sat for 15 minutes, than was greeted. Instructed that I had an appointment. The barber was surprised, realized at that moment an appointment was booked. First impressions are everything, I walked out after 20 minutes waiting for a beard trim. The purpose of an appointment is to adhere to it. I'm\nOut. Good luck. You never who can walk through the door.
