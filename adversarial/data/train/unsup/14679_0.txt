I still dream about the bone in ribeye I had here.  Best creamed spinach ever (Peter Luger's being #2).  We went on a pretty slow Thurs night so our waiter was cool enough to bring us several samples of the huge wine list they have there at no charge.  I imagine very few places are better than this downtown.  You can't go wrong with this place!!
