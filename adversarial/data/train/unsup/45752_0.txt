There isn't a bad seat in the house.  And the Great Hall is nice.  But the stadium is fairly generic.  I also don't like the fact that the Steelers have to share it with Pitt.  A team with the following of the Steelers should have a place of its own.  I do like the way it sits on the river.  However, if you compare PNC Park (Pirates home) with Heinz Field, it's quite a drop down in ambiance.  And getting through security is very unorganized and is a tremendous hassle.  Getting in and out of the stadium area before and after games is also a chore.  Arrive way early and prepare to wait after the games.
