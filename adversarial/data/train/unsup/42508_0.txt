This is the second time I have been here.  Both experiences were superb.  Cheri Petroni is very skilled and professional.  Today I had the raindrop therapy and was so relaxed I fell asleep.  I would recommend this treatment.  I did not know what to expect and was thrilled with the result.  My daughter had a facial at the same time as my treatment and came out glowing.  I highly recommend this gem in the Northwest.  I will make regular visits here
