They're under new management, and the buffet is DELICIOUS! They've added a poke bowl station, added great selections to the sushi, and the diverse fares elsewhere are always fresh, hot and very tasty! There's a number of new specials too, for both lunch and dinner. .. no surprise they've become our favorite buffet!
