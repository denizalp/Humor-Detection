Spa Botanica\nMy husband has been booking our 'spa days' here for about 4 years now. Always a pleasant experience and we get what we want. I always get the hot stone massage, he gets the deep tissue. I would recommend Bahar K. & Megan K.- they were great. Could have stayed for another hour!! After the treatment it was off to the pool for cocktails & a swim, then got cleaned up & walked to Westgate for dining & bar hopping!
