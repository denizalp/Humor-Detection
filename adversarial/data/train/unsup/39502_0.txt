My advice: don't waste your money going to this place! I have been here a few times and the last time was so bad that I will never go back. My last experience, I was taken back to a chair by a man for a pedicure. He roughly rushed through the pedicure for about 10 minutes, talked to his friends the entire time and did a bad job of painting my nails. I was so stressed out by the time he finished. This was not relaxing at all and I left with a bad experience and a ugly looking pedicure. \n\nThat was my worst experience but my other couple of visits weren't much better.
