With as many resorts and spas there are in the Valley, Aura Salon has a lot to compete with. For me to continue to go there time and time again, when there are hundreds of other options in a 10 mile radius, you should know how how simply outstanding this place is.  I go there for all of my beauty needs. Hair styling, hair dye jobs, waxing, and massages. *Side note, ask for Mindy when you get a massage. She is by far the best masseuse I have ever been to. \n\nWhen I first moved to Scottsdale and I was trying out different salons, someone had recommended this school for stylists. \"You get a high quality hair cut for practically nothing.\" I know, why in the world would you trust  a student to give you a good haircut? Let's face it, when it comes to hair, you get what you pay for.  After walking out of there with my newly styled Sean Hunter hair (Boy Meets World anyone?) and practically bawling, I dashed over to Aura, and frantically cried, \"I GOT A BAD HAIRCUT!!!\" They hooked me up with one of their best, and she fixed it, or at least made it look better and charged me next to nothing for it. Since then I have been a loyal customer and will continue to go to them as long as I am here in AZ.  The staff is courteous, their prices are reasonable and it's overall a great experience from the minute you walk in until you leave.
