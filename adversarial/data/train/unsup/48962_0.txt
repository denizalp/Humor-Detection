A.I. Root Company, you take the sting out of bees!\n\nFrom honey, to candles the Root Co. takes the cake.  (Honey bee cake to be specific).  The A.I. Root Co. has been a staple in Medina for YEARS!  They have expanded their flagship store from the old Root that I grew up with (am I dating myself?  I hope not!) to a large showroom and showplace.  For the candle snob in you, head into the main store.  Even if you plan on just browsing, you'll probably end up walking out w\/ a little something...if not a lot of something.  \nMake sure to try the honey made by Root.  Even the White House uses over a gallon a month of Root's honey.  (yes, it IS that good.)\n\nFor the cheaper, less-snobby you....be sure to visit the \"Outlet\" around the back of the building for a less-than-perfect candle but with all the great Root scent!  You'll be sure to find a bargain here.\n\nThis is an ideal place to pick up a gift, wedding present, or a little something for yourself.  As I sit typing this now I am enjoying Root's \"Cinnamon Buns\" candle.
