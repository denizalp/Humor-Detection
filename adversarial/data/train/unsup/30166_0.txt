After my first visit I have to say the most interesting thing about the Dandelion Market is the origin of it's name; after a famous market in the Dublin city center started by a single guy selling sheepskin coats from his door step.  First, it was $25 for a bottle of wine or $7 for the house special.  So, on the spot I went for a cosmo.  Weak and watered down.\n\nWe just wanted a small snack so tapas seemed appropriate.  We ordered the spread with pita.  Of the 3 spreads the hummus was the best but my husband thought it had too much garlic for his taste.  The olive was a variety of olives diced small and hard to apply to the pita unless you put the hummus down first.  The roasted red pepper was a watery mess of pepper and feta.  Perhaps they should try to puree it?\n\nThe stuffed zucchini was dry and per my husband \"pedestrian.\"  He ordered the steak tips.  He gave them a 3.5 stars out of 5.  Mostly for the sauce with had a little Asian flair.  \n\nSeems like we missed the mark on this one a little bit though because it seems the focus is the craft beers not the food.  Based on the other reviews and the $3 pints on Monday, I'll go back to give that a shot but if I want wine I think I'll head over to Press and keep searching for better tapas.
