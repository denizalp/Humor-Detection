so i'm a cupcake girl.  i make 'em, i love 'em, and everywhere i go that has a cupcake bakery, i'm there.  cleveland seems to be getting a wave of this culinary phenom of late, so i was glad to try out the neighborhood's cupcake experience.\n\ngranted, part of me is a little bitter and dead inside they opened one in tremont since *i* wanted to do that, but that's ok, i'm ok with it.  i've made my peace.  and grabbed a piece.\n\naww snap.\n\nmy usual tell-tale of a good cupcake is the red velvet.  if it's dry, i don't care about the rest.  cookie & a cupcake's red velvet is ok.  i wasn't blown away, but i wasn't crying.  \n\nwhere i feel the baked goodness showed its face was the chocolate cupcake flavors- the german chocolate was pretty darn good.  super moist.  yumminess in ma mouth.\n\nbut these things are dense.  one cupcake is like a meal.  it makes you think twice momentarily.  the reason?  they inject the icing to the middle of the cupcake.  not bad, but man do these things feel heavy.  it's one thing to take a small piece of cake, it's another to know that weight in your palm is going directly to your ass.\n\nregardless- you're eating a cupcake.  of course your butt's gonna feel the burn.  \n\nso here's my recommendation:  get yourself to the gym, and try some of their cupcakes.  especially those chocolate ones.  \n\nyum.
