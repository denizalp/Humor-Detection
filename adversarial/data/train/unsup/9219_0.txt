For Neapolitan pizza enthusiasts like myself, you will be glad to know there is another high quality authentic Italian pizza maker in town besides Inizio's, which as of right now is all the way in Indian trails. Went with some friends and tried a few of the different flavors they offer, but as a purist I can't help but laud their  Margherita D.O.P. The crust is crunchy and soft, the sauce is scarce yet pure, and the basil garnish makes for a pretty pizza and a clean, pure taste. \n\nI echo what has been previously said of the comparison to Antico's in Atlanta. Definitely the same causal feel, although they don't have byob, plenty of drink options, and more to come from what I'm told. Great place to come with a group of friends or family. They even brought out some pizza dough for the kids at the table next to mine to play with. Was definitely a nice touch. \n\nAlthough I came during their soft opening period, I am confident that Desano's will only get better with time, and solidify itself as a Charlotte staple for the foreseeable future.
