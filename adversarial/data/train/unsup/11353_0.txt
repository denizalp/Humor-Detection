So the owner reached out to me and I'm dropping my rating due to poor customer service. \n\nShe claims that the sauce indeed has vinegar and it's supposed to taste this way. So I can  accept this even though I'm more convinced that it accidentally has vinegar or was spoiled. \n\nI would have been satisfied with this however it feels like a slap in the face that she hopes we come back and she will assist me in making a reservation. -_- we know what this means.... She's asking me to come back, waste my money on an overpriced dinner, know that it's my table and tell her staff to treat me a little better so I can fix my review. \n\nI may give this another chance in a very distant future but I'm more hopeful to have a better dining experience when I try monofuku NYC. \n\nAlso, let me know if you start selling your pork Belly online, I'd purchase that for sure.
