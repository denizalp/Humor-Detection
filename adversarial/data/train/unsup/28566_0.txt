Comparable to the style of Panera Bread except lower quality. Great upbeat customer service, (5\/5) but food was subpar. (2\/5) I got the crab sandwich and lobster bisque combo; both were EXTREMELY salty and not really any flavors that stood out except the salt. I was quite disappointed and hope they fix this issue in the future. I love little cafes, so hope to go back with some improvements in their food.
