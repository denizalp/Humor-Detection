Pappadeaux. What can I say? You are DELICIOUS! \nOur waitress was probably the best waitress I've ever had. Carrie was enthusiastic, really attentive without being overbearing or annoying, and just overall super awesome. \nWe came in for lunch around 1 p.m. (their lunch is until 3), and I ordered the sampler platter, but I don't really like tilapia, so I asked if I could get some calamari instead of tilapia - done, without a hassle. Mum got the crawfish lunch. The bread they bring out is amazing, by the way.\nOur food was out in probably ten minutes. Not only did I have an abnormally huge portion of calamari on my plate, but our waitress brought me out all the sauces that go with the calamari - their spicy marinara and a lemon aioli that you will stare at for several minutes and wonder how an aioli can taste that good. Yup. Several minutes.\nOur waitress checked in on us often, and when we were done, boxed up our meal for us while we got our check. \nIt was really hot out, and I was dreading walking to the car to sit on sizzling black leather seats, and before I know it BAM! There is a take-out cup for each of us, filled with our respective drink choice, our food bagged up and extra sauce for my leftoevers in little plastic take-out cups... Has anyone ever seen such awesome service?\nIf you go... you better ask for Carrie. If you don't, you will be incredibly and horribly jealous that you did not get the best waitress I have ever SEEN.
