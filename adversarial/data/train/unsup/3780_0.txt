I really wish I could give this place 0 stars. Prior to today I've been here about three times and the food was decent but the service was always mediocre. But today definitely takes the cake for the shit service. We walked in, sat ourselves, then 8 minutes later someone brings us a menu....I should mention that it's hot as hell in here and feels like their AC broke...so we look at the\nMenu and are waiting for them to take our drink orders, but no the TWO servers they have just keep walking by. The table next to us was there before us and they didn't even have their drinks so I knew it was going to be awhile. Another 10 minutes go by and nothing!! Worst service ever, so we get up and walk out! Do not come here unless you want to be sweating while you're eating and get mediocre service.
