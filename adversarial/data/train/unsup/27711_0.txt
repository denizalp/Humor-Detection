Great spot for breakfast! Ended up here twice in one week since it was close to a conference I was attending and had lots of variety and options.\n\nThe service was great. Attentive, quick, and the food came out fast even though the restaurant was quite busy on a weekday afternoon. \n\nThe first time I ate here I got a lox benny, but substituted a bagel for the toast. The bagel was Montreal style and delicious. The lox was tasty as well. On my second trip, I opted for the Montrealer -- smoked meat, eggs any style, and toast. It came with a huge heaping portion of fruit. I also had a green smoothie - it was perfectly made. \n\nEggspectation isn't anything special, but it is a solid breakfast option with lots of choices (including healthy ones) and snappy service.
