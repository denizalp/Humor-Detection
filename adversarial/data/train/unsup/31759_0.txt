It's about time I write a review for this wonderful sushi place. My wife and I have eaten there about a half dozen times and we've yet to be disappointed. Yes there are rolls I wont order again because I don't like them but, there are also rolls I will order every time I walk into Tokyo Lobby. The fish is fresh, delicious and overall great. The owner obviously takes great care in procuring his product. The yellowtail scallion roll is my favorite on the menu. Chunky pieces of yellowtail are mixed with spicy mayo in side with slices of yellow tail and scallions on the top. The sushi is so good here that my 40 weeks pregnant wife decided to end her caring about food rules when it came to sushi here. As long as we live in this area this tiny little find will be our sushi joint.
