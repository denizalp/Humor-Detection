I was referred to Aaron Mazza after dealing with slow and sluggish realtor friend of mine.  It felt like I had to poke him with a stick in order to get him to even show me a house.  After I gave Aaron Mazza a call he was very quick, open, and enthusiastic to help me find a new and best fitting home for my family and I. From the very first call the the moment I was given the keys to my new home the entire process took roughly 5 weeks. This man is no joke when it comes down to business and goes far above and beyond  the call of duty is his field of work. From taking time off his personal life to hand deliver me documents to referring me to a more proactive mortgage company, Aaron Mazza is definitely the the realtor you want to consult in your next home buying experience. Aaron Mazza has lots of knowledge of all areas in town and what seems to be an unlimited amount of resources for any situations that may arise during your home buying process. Aaron Mazza is defiantly one of the finer top tier realtor I have ever had the pleasure to work with he showed a genuine caring and concerned attitude along with aggressive and determined negotiations skills to better suit my needs as a consumer. I definitely recommend you give Aaron Mazza a call and consider doing business with him before you think of setting with any other realtor. Thank you very much for all your help and time and i look forward to doing more business you in the future Aaron Mazza.
