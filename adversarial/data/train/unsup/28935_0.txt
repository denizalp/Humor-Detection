I think this place deserves a three star mainly because of the girl who rang up my order. She didn't smile and wasn't very friendly. There's not that many places to sit, people are usually camping here. If you need to charge your phone it'll probably hang off the walls and don't order an iced Oreo latte because it is very watery, or at least ask for milk instead. I like the feel of the place and they play jack Johnson which is very calming. Might not come back here for awhile.
