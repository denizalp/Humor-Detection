The doctors here are amazing. I came in at 8 centimeters dilated and even though I had a previous c section, the doctor on staff was willing to allow me to try a VBAC. Unfortunately after I received an epidural my heart rate and my son's heart rate dropped into the 50s and I had to be rushed to the OR to receive an emergency C section. The doctors worked quickly to get my son out safely. I ended up staying in the hospital for three days. Most of the nurses were great. I did have one nurse who seemed to be cruel to my baby, uniformed on breastfeeding, and she ignored me when unneeded her assistance. I would have given this place 5 stars if the nurses actually made sure that the patients ate (I literally had to ask for food. I was shown a menu that I could call in my order to the cafeteria. The problem is I was so drugged that I didn't even remember to order most of the time.) One day after my surgery I was informed that I could shower (still not sure if that was true) but the nurse didn't even offer to help me. I could barely stand. \n\nThe best thing about this hospital was the celebration dinner and the discharge class. I appreciated that the nurse running the class took time to explain everything someone who had a baby needs to know. I also had newborn photos taken at the hospital. The photographer had a great attitude and she was very patient with my children. I bought the digital set that cost $150. \n\nHonestly, if I could choose to have my next child at St rose Sienna or this hospital...I'd choose Sienna.
