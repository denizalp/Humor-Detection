Conveniently located near the Q, this is a pretty good place to go with friends after attending a sporting event. We've only gone after hockey games and it usually isn't too crowded, but I can't speak for baseball or football season. It was much more packed after the Monsters Browns Night, so I suspect it'd be crazy after more popular sporting events.\n\nFood is standard Wink fare--solid, nothing too special other than the fried macaroni and cheese. I go for the beer selection, which is always fun and enables me to try a new beer each time, which I love.
