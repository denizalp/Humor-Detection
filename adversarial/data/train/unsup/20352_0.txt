Got a call from some friends asking me to meet them in Tremont for dinner. Immediately when I heard the words \"Tremont\" and \"dinner\" I prepared myself for a underwhelming and overpriced meal as I had gotten three times prior before swearing to never visit the area again. BUT they insisted that this \"Southside\" place was the place to eat there. So I read the reviews and was SHOCKED to hear that the food was of poor quality and overpriced *gasp* Better warn my friends... and of course they wanted to go anyway so away we went craving beer and dinner.\n\nThe service was shockingly average. Yes it was a little on the slow side for the limited crowd. I can see the service aspect of this place devolving into a giant mess if a crowd hit on a weekend. Most of the problem stems from cramped and limited seating in a no frills bar building. Which is made even more limited when the frequent bad weather in Cleveland makes outdoor seating unrealistic.  \n\nThe food was slightly worse than something I would expect from TGI Fridays. Left me with a queasy feeling even while I write this. I felt that it was wayyyyy WAYYYY overpriced for what they put on your plate as previous reviews had mentioned. I guess you are just paying extra for that grungy hipster college vibe they try to portray? Not sure.\n\nThe cumulative problems generated a few complaints from my friends.BUT they get no sympathy points because fair warning was given as any good Yelper would do.\n\nWell what more can I say about this place really? I went in with major concerns and got what I expected. I can at least thank others for warning me to brace myself for a bad experience.
