This is a very nice facility -- climate controlled, clean, secure.  We were checked in by Glenda, who was very friendly and efficient.  She explained all the features and personally escorted us to our unit to show us how to use the elevator (which requires a code) and how to unlock the door to the unit.  You are required to purchase a special lock.  We would recommend this facility.
