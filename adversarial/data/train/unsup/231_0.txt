I am not really one for Burritos. I know that sounds suspect, but I never really got into them. That being said, the Burritos at Chino Locos are ridiculous. Un real, and have completely turned me into daydreaming about burritos and running down Queen towards Greenwood on a regular basis. There is a location on church as well, which i reviewed here http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz\/chino-locos-toronto-2#hrid:G4lYzYC0uv6G14kmMYhmyQ but I prefer this location - for some reason it just tastes better. \n\nIt in tiny, really only seats 3 and is better for takeout. Sitting at the bar you can chat with the super friendly upbeat staff and watch them prepare everything from fresh ingredients. The best is the daily special which is always changing. \n\nI've tried the  Biggie Bean, the Vegan and the White Fish but the Basa White Fish with Chow Mein made spicy is literally off-the-hook - they are right about that. It is unique, tasty and incredible and not at all what you would expect.\n\nby far the best burrito I have ever eaten. soo ooooo good. Get the fish with chow mein, I am serious.
