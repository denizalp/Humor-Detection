My fiance is obsessed with a good breakfast sandy and one night scrolling through insta he shakes a photo of Joe and Nosh in my face and says, \"Baaaaabbbbe, we have to gooooo.\" Finally, we made the pilgrimage to Joe and Nosh and it lived up to the highly anticipated expectation!\n\nWhat makes coffee shops so intriguing? Is it the different roasts? Makes people watching fancier, only because you have a cup of joe in your hand? Well, Joe and Nosh is all of the above and more! Their breakfast sandwiches are on point! Their biscuits are buttery and flaky, paired with eggs and a protein makes it one of the best breakfast sandwiches in Charlotte.  Fairly priced for the create your own option, but even not getting a meat added it was on the pricy side. \n\nMy one complaint is that the nitro coffee was more than my breakfast sandy. That is outragous. Words to the wise, find that somewhere else. \n\nThe atmosphere was great and compared to other similar coffee shops, Joe and Nosh is superior. Their seating is great and with the rocking chairs outside, makes you feel like you're in the country, sipping on your Joe and Noshing on a sandwich. For the cold days, they have heat lamps and you can bring your dog if you're sitting outside.\n\nOverall a win-win.
