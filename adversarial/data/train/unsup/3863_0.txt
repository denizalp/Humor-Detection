4 1\/2 star review. But ultimately, the food earned themselves that extra half star.\n\nThis whole online reservation wait-list option was glitchy. Since I'm old school and have trust issues with technology, I decide to call directly. Hostess said she will put me on the waiting list (this was on a Saturday for 11:30am). \nArrived on time and my bf and I had to wait about 10-15 minutes. Waiting area is small and cramped. If you have a party of 4 or more, please don't all congregate in this area; there will be no room.\n\nService was average. Had to repeat our requests a few times. This restaurant isn't that new anymore, they should have gotten their customer service down by now. But...my bf said they're just overwhelmed with the amount of tables and how busy they are. \n\nWe ordered the following items:\n*Sausage Corndog. Comes with three per order. I would've gotten two orders of this as my entr√©e. YUM!!!!!\n*Bacon Pancakes. Bf order this....he said it's good but be prepared to be in a food coma because you're eating carbs on carbs on carbs.\n*I ordered the Chorizo Frittata and OMGGGGG......my ideal breakfast\/brunch item! There's chorizo, manchego, roasted tomatoes, greens on top. This was big enough for two more leftover servings the next few days!\n\nAlso ordered an iced lavender coffee with creamer. Perfect pep and flavoring! \n\nNot sure why all of a sudden everyone is all about \"brunching.\" Maybe it's those basic IG peeps but whatever it is, this is a solid brunch restaurant. I wouldn't go out of my way JUST to come here as there are PLENTYYYYYY of other really solid brunch restaurants around the city. But I still enjoyed it very much. Just wish they work out the whole reservation situation.
