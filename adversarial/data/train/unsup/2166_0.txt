This store seems to adhere to the notion that middle-aged housewives are yearning for a chance to go breezing through the meadow in $300 cotton dresses (made in a Chinese sweatshop). It seems to be specifically successful among that age bracket because I saw these women all. over. the. store. \n\nRiddle me this, however, -in a city as diverse as Toronto, how is it that not a single employee is of a visible minority background? I've heard about their Abercrombie and Fitch-like practices in USA but I didn't think it was allowed in Canada.
