Great little meat market. They sell the best cuts of meat as well as homemade sausages. They have dog treats made from smoked and dried beef and pork.\n\nWe picked up some bratwurst and natural hotdogs and wieners for the grill. I love the jalape√±o cheddar cheese brats. we got a pig ear for our dog. She devowered it. The ones we got from other stores she would just carry around then burry. They have so much good stuff here we are excited to try more. You pay a little more for things here, but the quality is worth it.
