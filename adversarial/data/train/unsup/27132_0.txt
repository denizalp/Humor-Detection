I bought a table from thus place in 2010 and i still have that table to this day. There store has moved around on the Rural Rd side of where they were...i recently broke my glass table top I check other places for a replacement but OTHER  places wanted close to 200.00. I remembered them at furniture Creation told me to come and get a replacement if it broke. I did and it was only $76.00 for a beveled table top..not 200.00\nI recommend coming here...stuff happens but don't hold it against the store....
