I am a regular here and they are always good to me!\nVery reasonably priced. My shellac mani lasts 2-4 weeks every time. \nOf course some of the people who work there like Mary and Kevin are the absolute best nail techs in the city, they are very experienced and I recommend booking an appointment if you want a specialist. \nI've only had one crappy manicure in 2 years here and it was the person not the place. \nBest nail place in the city by far. :)
