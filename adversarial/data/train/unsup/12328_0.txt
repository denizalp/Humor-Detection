Unless you're looking for a shampoo and blow dry...avoid this salon!  For $200 bucks I got color that could have been accomplished with a box of dye from Walgreens for $10. Nothing at all like the pictures I had showed the \"stylist\". In 30 years of hair coloring and cutting I have not once complained about the outcome. My philosophy is its hair, it will grow, plus I like to try new things with my hair. My experience at this salon, however, is too awful not to write about. From walking in the door and not being acknowledged for five minutes, even though I was the only customer, while watching the entire staff eat pumpkin bars 20 feet from me to walking out with the most lifeless, drab, monotone hair (after it was \"foiled\"). \n\nMy \"stylist\", jackie, has most likely not learned a new technique for coloring or cutting hair in many years, so I got the 1997 treatment after telling her I wanted something new and current. I feel like she had no clue what she was doing and just improvised instead of telling me that she was incapable of doing what i had wanted and had showed to her. She also made many remarks about how she can't believe how much grey hair I have. Rude and judging by the customers I saw...grey hair is typical for this salon.  She seemed to be unsure of what she did...even telling me it was a \"crapshoot\". Hahaha Huge mistake going here. I should've trusted my gut and walked out as soon as I walked in.
