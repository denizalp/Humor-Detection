Tasty and rich americano here and free wifi while I plotted my morning in Uptown. It's a comfy space with good club chairs and a couple of tables plus a counter with stools that goes around two walls. a few tables out front, too! A great way to work with a laptop if that's your thing.\n\nYes, they also have drive-through.
