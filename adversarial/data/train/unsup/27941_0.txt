The cleanest cut of my life. Gladys must have some kind of doctorate in mathematics because my hard part looks calculated. I'm not sure but i think I saw her numbers projected in front of her \"a beautiful mind\" style.   You know when you look in the mirror mid-haircut and think \"wow I'm really ugly\"? That doesn't happen here, every part of the cutting process looks like it could be a haircut on its own. I almost stopped it multiple times thinking It can't get better than this. And as I heard the clippers go off and I saw my glorious fade take its final form, I started to get up, as I'd done so many times in the past, collar ruffled, hair clippings over my forehead, disheveled and vulnerable. Gladys pulls me back into the chair, rubs her hands together, much like Mr. Miyagi about to heal Daniel-sons wounded leg, and she applies the warmest lather, of what I can only describe as god's shaving cream, to the back of my neck and part. And just when I thought my lines couldn't get any cleaner, she pulls out the Sweeney Todd straight razor and goes to work. Making hair angles like Michelangelo carving David's jaw (she even straight razored the hard-part Y'all). At this point I'm already thinking she's doing the most, but I would not have been surprised had prince Akeem's servants laid flower petals at my feet. She then takes this brush made of clouds and dreams and lifts the hairs off of my neck and forehead like magneto sucking the iron out of that guard in X-men 2. And then, after all this pampering, I get the greatest head massage of my life, one that can only be compared with the feeling you get when you bite into the part of the burger that has an equal part of all condiments\/toppings  in it. I would have fallen asleep had it not been for the fear of waking up looking like a million dollars and not recognizing myself. Please check this place out
