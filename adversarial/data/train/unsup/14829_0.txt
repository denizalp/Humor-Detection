This place is still amazing, but I think I may have overhyped the hot and sour soup. I think it was especially good the first time I've had it, but ever since then it's just been pretty good but nothing spectacular. The search for a perfect bowl of hot and sour soup continues...\n\nOh and definitely get the coleslaw. Really yummy.
