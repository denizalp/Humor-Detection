I would have to say that the setting is below par for the type of restaurant they are running. I felt like our server was a little short with us because we were young, but who knows... The Crab Cakes were very nice and the sauce it was served with was also pleasant. Went with the Peppered and Grilled Onion Fillet which was awesome, but it is a steakhouse so I wouldn't expect anything less. We also had the Salmon that had a Crab Sauce on top of it. Pretty good, but you're better off going with one of their aged steaks. Potatos Gratin was very good also. Overall a nice place to go if you're willing to spend some cash and get good quality food.
