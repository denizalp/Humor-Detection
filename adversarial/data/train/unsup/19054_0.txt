Every time I come here I'm less and less impressed by the food. I normally order something a la Coca Cola because those dishes have been my favourite so far. Decided to venture into the lunch special menu for a tostada. Extremely disappointed. If I want a fried tortilla bowl filled with a little beans and meat and packed full of ice berg lettuce, I can find somewhere else to get it a hell of a lot cheaper. It was all lettuce. Ridiculous.\n\nLindo needs to step up their game. Food is more bland every time, service a little slower. Oh, and their table side guacamole. Can we talk about the amount of onions?! Lord Almighty, it was like I had a little avocado in my onions! \n\nNot impressed lately. Will be a while before I come back here.
