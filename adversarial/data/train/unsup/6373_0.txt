Can someone please tell me why beauty supply store workers have to be jerks? Is it that when you express interest in opening one of these stores, you have to complete several D-Bag classes? \n\nLady, all I wanted was setting lotion, not an attitude. \n\nIf it weren't for your ridiculously large selection of ethnic hair care products, I wouldn't bother.
