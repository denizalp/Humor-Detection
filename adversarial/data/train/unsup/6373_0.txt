What an awesome park.  This park has everything except a bunch of pavilions and picnic tables.  I don't think that it is a good park for having a BBQ or a church picnic.  but could be ok for a small kids party.\n\nThere is a pool, a splash pad, a senior\/community center, a skate park and 2 separate play areas for kids under 5 and kids over 5.  \n\nI love the fact that play ground area has the nice seats all around for the parents to sit very close by and watch their kids.  The play ground area has a huge sand box, so bring your \"beach gear\" and play on the splash pad and then go to the sand box area and dig for seashells or whatever you dig up.\n\nThere is ample parking all around the park.  Follow 48th Street all the way south until it dead-ends into this park.
