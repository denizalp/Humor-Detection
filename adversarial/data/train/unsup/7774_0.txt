This is a review of the groupon deal dinner.\n\nThe Skinny: fusion Peruvian Japanese dishes left me unimpressed (3) service: excellent service despite the disappointing cuisine (5) value: for the Groupon, it is still overpriced for what it is. So you can imagine what I have to say about full price ... not worth it (2.5).\n\nSo here's the deal. We spotted the Nobu groupon for $95\/2 person (regularly $150) prix fixe menu and we thought \"how can we pass this up?\".\n\nWe went and were seated prompty. Our server was great at giving us time and space to make some decisions on the menu. We ended up getting in addition to the prix fixe an order of their vegetable tempura to round out the menu. The specials that they offered didn't really appeal - there was a lot of fruit\/candied nuts mixed in with sashimi which sounded overly sweet to me so I passed on those.\n\nStarting with some simple edamame with Maldon sea salt (love those flakes!), it was a nice way to start a meal.\n\nCourse 1) yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno\/cilantro (6 slices): this was a good dish but not exceptional. Although I have had different versions of this before, this is one of the better renditions given the quality of the fish and the strategically correct amount of heat. My only thing with this dish was the actual slices of sashimi itself - the slices were a bit thin and ragged along the edges which surprised me given the supposed caliber of this place.\n\nCourse 2) selection of nigri (6 pcs) and a california roll (6 pcs): the nigri was okay - the slices of fish were decent sized. I was despondent when I realized that the sushi rice was a little too overcooked and sticky.\n\nCourse 3) rock shrimp tempura: the first bite was good however as we ate, the spicy aioli began to slowly permeate the batter leading to a soggier batter. I think it aioli would have been better served as a dipping sauce rather than dressed on the tempura to retain textural integrity. Flavorwise, this was a nice dish and we loved the mixture of chive and togarashi.\n\nCourse 4) miso glazed black cod: candied black cod more like it! Overly sweet, the piece of fish was smothered in the sugary sauce which became more unappetizing the more we worked to finish this. I have made this at home using his recipe with 1\/2 the sugar and it is much better.\n\nCourse 5) vegetable tempura (added to the Groupon): the tempura was okay nothing special. The batter was slightly spongier than what I like. I think it would have been better if the shredded daikon\/ginger was provided to us so we could add as much\/little we wanted.\n\nCourse 6) normally this would be mochi ice cream except it was my birthday so I got a molten cake with a tiramisu and green tea ice cream. All of them were very good however there was nothing that really wow'ed me to think that it was exceptional.\n\nPerhaps 10 years ago, the level of this fusion cuisine would be considered cutting edge. However time has made his dishes appear quite dated. The signature dishes of rock shrimp tempura\/yellowtail jalape√±o sashimi\/miso glazed black cod are easily found elsewhere - one might argue that this location's rendition is rather lackluster considering the price. Given the many issues with the dishes mentioned above, I cannot recommend this place given the Groupon price let alone full price. Although our server was truly exceptional, that doesn't make up for the food. 2.5 rounded up to 3 starred review.
