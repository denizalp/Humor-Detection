Came here for dinner tonight and it was incredible. I've gone to a few of Wolfgang pucks restaurants and sometimes it is a hit or miss. I ordered the gnocchi and it was so amazing like exceeded my expectations. My other half ordered the burger and it was amazing. 5 stars will totally come back! & great service!
