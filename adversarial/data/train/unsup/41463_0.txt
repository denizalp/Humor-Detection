Gluten-free review:\n\nI stumbled upon this place by chance. I was early for my dinner reservation and decided to go look for a place to grab a quick drink and this place was just across the street. I had never noticed it even though I ride past it twice a day on the streetcar. \n\nThey had four ciders available, all in a can (not a issue for me) and all Ontario craft ciders (YESSSS!). I sat at the bar and the bartender, who I believe is one of the owners, was really friendly and attentive. The whole vibe of the place felt warm and inviting. I definitely want to come back and have a meal here. \n\nTL;DR - 4 craft ciders, friendly staff
