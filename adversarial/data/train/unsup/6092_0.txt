Didn't see any reviews on this place on yelp so thought I'd add one. Found out about it on restaurantica where it has some decent reviews. Went for Saturday lunch with some mild traditional Canadian-Chinese food (spring rolls, chicken balls, fried rice and noodle) loving family members and were not disappointed. Lots of food for a very reasonable price but flavour was pretty plain and similar across the dishes although between the food allergies (nuts\/fish) and spice version of our party, we didn't experience the full palate of the kitchen. Reviews on restaurantica spoke highly of the weekday lunch buffet which is like $7 or something. Our $60 worth of food for a party of five will yield a full second meal in leftovers. \n\nDuring our visit there was a lively and loud domino game going on in the small front bar area along with a couple other guys enjoying a few cold beverages. The stack of beer empties by the washroom indicates that this place may get a bit more interesting at times than your average Asian strip plaza restaurant. \n\nThe fresh food and fast, friendly service bods well for taking a more adventurous dive into the menu which features some spicy Asian options as well as Indian and Caribbean variations as well. If you do visit, please post so when I am back in the area I can order at least one adventurous dish while my family noshes on their chicken balls and fried rice. I think it has potential.
