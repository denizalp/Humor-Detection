I've known a lot of pizza snobs, and do not consider myself one. I don't know why, but Fuel doesn't do it for me... and I'm secretly saving all my Papa John's door hangings and junk mail for a big backyard bonfire, in which they will be sacrificed to the gods of Real Pizza. I've been looking for a cheap NY style pie since we moved here, and I think I've finally found one. \n\nGreat pizza, great prices, quick delivery. YAY.\n\nThe Margherita (mozz, roma tomatoes, fresh basil and olive oil) runs $12.50 for the 16\" and was VERY good. Chewy thin-ish crust, not pizza soup (as often happens when you put fresh 'maters on a pie) and fresh, bright tastes of sauce, basil and garlic. Add mushrooms and you have awesome, veggie pizza heaven.\n\nThey also do calzones, (I saw one coming out of the oven, looked huge and tasty) strombolis, and baked pastas. Since the half-pound of cheese on our pizza wasn't enough, we ordered Mozz sticks as well. Wow, they were almost as good as the pie! Thick, perfectly breaded and sprinkled with parmesian, not greasy at all. The marinara they were served with tells me I've got to try the baked ziti one of these days.\n\nThis is take-out\/delivery only, as there are no tables in the place. But they have a huge delivery area! Try 'em! \n\nHours: 11am-10pm, closed Sunday. Min delivery amount is $10.
