You can't bash something when you get it for free, unless it's like one of those inflatable clowns with a weighted bottom that when you hit it falls over but then bounces back up...because those are designed to be bashed so that's what you'd do even if it was free.  Sorry got distracted.\n\nAnyway, if something is free you can't be too hard on it and I had continental breakfast at Le Castillon included with my stay at the Hilton.  I went twice and enjoyed the food and the service, and most importantly the coffee.   \n\nThe continental breakfast included a cold buffet (meats, cheeses, fruit) along with oatmeal, pastries, bagels and bread.  Everything was fresh and tasty, although the bagels looked anemic because I'm used to those big honking NYC bagels.  These were the Kate Moss of bagels.\n\nThe waiters I had both days kept the coffee flowing and it was good.  Then when I was ready to leave, they brought me a to-go cup, so I could take some away with me.  Aw, thoughtful!  \n\nFor breakfast, this is nice.  Especially if it's included.  I checked out the prices and as they say in Boston, this place is \"wicked expensive\" so I am not sure it's a good value, but if it's free, it's for me!
