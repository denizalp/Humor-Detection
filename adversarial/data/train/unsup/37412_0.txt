Sweet party for the summer!! \n\nWe came here around noon and there was barely a line (which means it was perfect). I got in for free and got two free mimosas by going through Kayla's invite (2017418419). She is a super reliable promoter. \n\nFreaking awesome pool area with a fun crowd. Once the splashing started, it was all going down! \n\nKaskade was not the best DJ though.
