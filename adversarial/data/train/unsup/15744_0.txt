Came here after a long day of work. I wanted the Oysters Rockefeller. These take about 30-40 minutes, so please be patient for the deliciousness to arrive.\n\nI think the half order of Oysters Rockefeller could have been my meal. I'm sure the dozen would have been a meal and still enough to share with others. It had spinach, bacon bits and some sort of cheese sauce. All baked so it gives it that extra flavor profile all together.\n\nI also got a corned beef sandwich on rye. Nice thick slices of corned beef, but I got over it after half the sandwich. I'd probably get something else if I were to do a sandwich.\n\nGreat drink selection as well from domestic beers, craft beers and a full bar. Great place to hang out!
