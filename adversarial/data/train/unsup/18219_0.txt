So this is really 3.5 stars but not quite for a few reasons...\n- if you are not at the airport they accept COINS only. $10 worth of coins\n- if it's the middle of winter, the driver may opt for a smoke break, while leaving the bus running, heat pumping, and door OPEN so said heat can escape and instead you can get awesome cigarette aromas...mmmmm\n- if you didn't have the exact COIN change, the driver may under her breath (and i'm speaking french the whole time) say to \"see her\" at the terminal. no problemo. i did. asked her what to do, never had clarity. went inside to buy a ticket, she kinda disappeared. STILL ended up buying my ticket (so honest am i) but then was double charged on my VISA!!! GAH!!!\n\nBut the good thing is there is a bus to downtown Montreal from the airport. About time.
