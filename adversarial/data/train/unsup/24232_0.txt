My 2 girlfriends and I headed to the Palms for the first time to check it out. We'd heard Rain and Moon were the hot spots and walked up to the bouncer at Ghostbar by mistake. He let us in right away and we thought that was a little too easy. \n\nTurned out that we had more fun at Ghostbar... killer views and cool staff. We met a VIP host that had us escorted into Rain and Moon. After a couple of quick visits, we were ready to return to Ghostbar to hang out with the bachelor party that we'd met. \n\nThe bartender gave my friend a free drink for her b'day, and the host offered a free limo home to the bachelor party because they'd had bottle service. The DJ was spinning a fun mix of music that was great to dance to, not just dance club tunes.\n\nYou know I had a great time because I think I lost my license there! I called and left a message and haven't heard back. Ghostbar, if you're reading this, please let me know if you have it! :-)\n\nOh yeah, I almost forgot... some random girl there was dipping her hand inside the fly of a bachelor party guy! (It wasn't clear whether this was included with the bottle service...)
