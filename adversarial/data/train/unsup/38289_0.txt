Big Daddy and I had a wonderful date night Saturday at Fat Ox. We have enjoyed Chef Matt's other ventures- The Mission and Zinc Bistro for years. This was a completely different experience and we also loved it. The atmosphere almost made you feel as if you were in San Francisco or somewhere else wonderful. Beautiful space, open air, all of it. Jennifer and Anthony made our dining experience excellent. Attentive, yet not hovering, allowing us to take our time and enjoy the experience.\nAnthony made a great table side caesar that we shared. It was delicate and delicious. The white anchovies made it really special. My hubby does a great caesar and this one has him beat.\nWe next enjoyed the white truffle, speck garganelli. SWOON! Absolutely lick your spoon delicious. \nWe also enjoyed the Filet with the Porcini sauce. It was appropriately crispy on the outside, mid rare inside (perfect) and we loved it. \nWe  were too full for dessert. \nWe felt it was the most enjoyable meal out in a very long time and will be back. We will try a whole new set of tastes next time.
