Got food twice due to circumstances and wouldn't recommend it. Food is greasy and the menu doesn't accurately represent what you get. \nWe ordered eggs benedict and got a fried egg. Ordered a pot pie and I got a greasy, fried tortilla in the shape of a hat with the stuffing floating in some white cream 'sauce.' As a Hoosier I was disappointed. My husband's steak was under cooked on both occasions as well. I would recommend taking a cab or the shuttle to another resurant.
