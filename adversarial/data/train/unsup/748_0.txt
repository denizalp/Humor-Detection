I have seen them a number of times and each show is different. They are always funny and sometimes perhaps a little political. Advise coming early as you can go up on stage and examine some props plus We were treated to Penn playing Jazz on a standing bass. He also let the audience in on a hilarious  gag which developed later in the show. After the show Penn & Teller meet and greet everyone who attends signing tics and photo ops...and yes Teller will speak to you. Highly recommended, enjoy the show.
