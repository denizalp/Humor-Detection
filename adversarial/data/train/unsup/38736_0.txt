My husband and I moved into our home in July 17 and we have had multiple issues since we bought it. Our laundry room light switches and a lot of outlets do not work. We have contacted harmony homes multiple times and we have been promised and email or a call from someone to get it fixed but here we are 4months later and we have not received a call or email. Also during our home inspection we marked items in blue tape (mainly paint fixes) and we were told that they would fix them before we moved in and they never fixed them. I am appalled at the quality of service I have received.
