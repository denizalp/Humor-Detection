If you need your carpets cleaned, I recommend going with anyone other than this guy... He's completely unprofessional. \n\nI texted to schedule an appointment and he called me back right away saying he could clean my carpets later that afternoon (around 5pm). 6pm rolls around and I haven't heard anything, so I contact him wanting to reschedule because I obviously don't want a carpet dude at my house at 9pm. I end up rescheduling for the next day with an 11am-1pm window. \n\nNext day rolls around and I get a call from him at 12:15pm saying he's running late and will be at my house at 1:05pm. 2pm comes and goes and I decide to cancel because this dude is clearly unorganized and needs better time management. His excuse (and a bullshit one at that) was that he had a flat tire AND his battery died. \n\nTo top everything off, he calls you at all hours of the night  for whatever reason (see screenshots of missed late night calls and lame excuses because they're attached).\n\nOh, and he wanted to charge me $150 for one 12x11 foot room. RIP OFF.
