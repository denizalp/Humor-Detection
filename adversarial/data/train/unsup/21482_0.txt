WOO HOO for Habachi!!! Yo I have had my fair share of teppanyaki and Ohjah serves up a pretty good one. Now I know some of you might not find this too exciting but forget all that if you would to have a go to local habachi or sushi steak house here it is. I have to say this location didn't seem or look like it has a big enough space inside for this but it did. Located next to Lee's Liquor and Papa Murphy pizza it also doesn't look like there is much parking. But have no fear there is plenty on the side and in back. \n\nUpon entering you will find yourself in the restaurant\/sushi bar side. They have a completely separate room for habachi next door. Our service girl was nice and the chef was really entertaining, I was very stoke we got the guy we did because the cook before him didn't look like he wasn't having such a great night. We came here for my Birthday celebration and everyone got a mix plate and I ordered the Ohjah Boat with sashimi, special sushi rolls, nigiri and seaweed salad.\n\nThe lobster, filet and shrimp teppanyaki was cooked and seasoned so perfectly. Meat was tender...not dried and tough like (Benihana's) and the shrimp and lobsters had great texture as well not chewy or fishy. The fried rice was yummy very garlicy just how I like it. I also got the Sushi and Shashimi boat for myself. Which is pretty awesome and more then enough food! come with 3 specialty sushi rolls of your choice and 10 pcs of nigeri 6 pcs of shashimi and a side of seaweed salad. BOMB!\n\nAll in all I loved this place and will be back and how cool is getting your sushi served on a freaking Boat Man?!?!.....Super cool!
