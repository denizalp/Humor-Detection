I've never been to a worse medical facility in my life. Over two hour wait EVERY TIME. I came in to the er one specific time for severe back pain due to fractures, the \"Dr\" was a tall goofy Fuck with blonde hair, he accused me of being a liar and implying I was hunting for pill prescriptions even tho I hadn't had any meds for over a year and a half, I'm glad my wife was there so I have someone who was by my side to verify what that Fuck said. Parking is terrible the employees are fucking lazy and act like YOU'RE the problem not the system. Fuck the va.  Fuck the employees. And a huge FUCK YOU to the drs. You should be fucking embarrassed of yourselves.
