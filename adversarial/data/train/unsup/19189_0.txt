PROS\n+ Tons of sales\n+ Replacement plan lets you trade in anything that breaks\n+ Some great deals like ponchos for $2.50 (compared to $8 at other stores, $2 zip ties, and $5 packs of bungee cords\n\nCONS\n- The smell of rubber is overwhelming and, to me, nauseating\n- Clerks are few and far between, and the one we did see looked at us and kept on walking\n- On a 50 degree day the AC was blasting, making me rush through\n\nI'm not in the target demographic for Harbor Freight. They aren't doing anything to win me over, but I'd stop back in if I was looking for a deal on a few items.
