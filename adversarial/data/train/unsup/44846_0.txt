Came here with my wife and inlaws for dim sum. We just waited about 5 minutes to get a table. The restaurant is spacious and the tables are not crowded together like other dim sum restaurants. We arrived around 12 so we did not get the specials, so it was a bit more expensive. The food came quickly and was quite delicious. The har gow was big.  The staff was also friendly. Will probably try it but before 11 to get the special
