While staying at the Palazzo in Vegas during the CES & AEE convention's I had a great dinner at Delmonico's with a few new friends on a Friday night.\nWe did not make a reservation for the 4 of us, but the maitre' d Marty put a table together for us in about a 5 min wait. The place was packed!\nI guess it's the perk of being with \"high rollers\" aka \"corporate cocks\".\nNo, but seriously we had unbelievable service thanks to Marty's personal touch & our beautiful hostess Corrine. \nOur C.C's did the pleasure of doing the ordering for us ladies. I must give my C.C's credit because these 2 men had great taste!\nWe started with a very nice bottle of Pinot Noir, Emeril's New Orleans Barbecue Shrimp, Truffle Parmesan Potato Chips, Lobster Bisque, a really good salad that was not on the menu per the request of my C.C friend Richard.\nThe lobster bisque was interesting, the chef bakes the lobster into a tasty biscuit that you can dip or crumble into the creamy bisque. \nWe also had Butternut Squash Ravioli both dishes brought me back to Delmonico's for 2nd's on Sunday night. Again, I was lucky enough to have Corrine as my hostess the 2nd time around. Thanks Corrine : )\nOur main course we had a very fine bottle of Cabernet not on the wine list but one of our Maitre' d Marty's personal fav's!\nWe each had the Bone In Ribeye Steak's they were huge!! Gigantor!!! \nI ate maybe a 1\/4 of it!! \nTo compliment our BIG juicy rib eyes we had Vegetables of the Day & New Orleans Creamed Spinach. D'lish!\nWe had sooo much food I thought I was going to burst!\nAll though we were all stuffed some how we managed to end our meal with some coffee & dessert's,  Emeril's Banana Cream Pie (my personal fav. FYI I love cream pies ; p) & Chocolate Peanut Butter Torte. So sinful..... but not as sinful as two women in vegas baby!! \nWhat happens in Vegas stay's in Vegas!!!\nLet's just say our date's were not cheap and our bill was not small $$$$.
