A great, comfortable place to have a glass of wine and some tasty food. The wine list is generous, and the food is good. The lobster nachos are reminiscent of a deconstructed crab rangoon, the strawberry balsamic flatbread is bright and delicious, and the cheese plates are adequate but nothing special. \n\nMy only downside is that it's directly inside Crocker Park. Shoppers, loiterers, and people everywhere, and it won't slow down until well into the evening.
