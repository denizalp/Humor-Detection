Picture this: you walk into this beautiful dining venue with Mozart and Beethoven playing on the high ceiling speakers. The hostess leads you straight to one of the best tables in the restaurant; right smacked center with a perfect view of the famous Bellagio fountains. \"Whoa...\" I thought to myself. I'm going to be in for a fancy night.\n\n\"Jasmine, a traditional Cantonese cuisine\" is what the Bellagio billboard advertises it to be. Yes, it's traditional alright. Completely takes me back to my hometown in the San Gabriel Valley...heart of all traditional Asian food.\n\nMy party of 6 ordered a couple of bottles of red wine. All the dishes we ordered, we shared. This is more of a family style entr√©e plates anyways. We ordered the bbq duck platter, fried rice, two orders of the dim sum platters, two orders of walnut shrimp, two orders of seabass, eggrolls, lemon chicken, kung pao chicken, veggie plate and last but not least....a variety dessert platter. Food was fantastic but yes, it's very very expensive. Don't come here expecting Chinatown prices. You're paying for the top notch service and the ambiance. It's a small but intimate classy restaurant.
