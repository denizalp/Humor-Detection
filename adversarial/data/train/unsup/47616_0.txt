this is one of our favorite restaurants.  we go every year for my husband's birthday and order the surf and turf.  both the shrimp and the lobster are well done, not watery and fabulous! and one of the best cooked steaks ever.\nit's not a huge restaurant but seating has enough space so you are not cramped and the atmosphere and waiters are very pleasant.  you can watch the activities at the pool while eating.  reservations are suggested.
