This location always seems to be busy. The staff tries to keep up but they don't always do so. Other than that it's a typical grocery store.\n\nHowever, Robert in the produce section is awesome! He has introduced me to new apples that have totally changed my apple game! Now the traditional Gala or Fuji just won't do. If you are ever in there and you enjoy good apples I highly suggest you find him and try some new ones.
