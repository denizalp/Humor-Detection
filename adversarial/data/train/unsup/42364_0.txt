Excellent first experience for restaurant week! Between myself and 2 friends we tried everything on the restaurant week menu. The portions were good and each meal was outstanding. Highlights were the gorgonzola bleu cheese souffl√© appetizer and spoon bar and poached pear desserts. All 3 breads served were excellent, but the cream cheese and chive biscuits were amazing! The servers were very attentive and the atmosphere was upscale, but comfortable. I can't wait to go back and try their regular menu!
