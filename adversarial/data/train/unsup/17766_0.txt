A fantastic breakfast\/lunch spot that supposedly caters to Vegas power brokers...whatever those are. Lots of signed headshots on the walls, that kind of thing. Patio dining looking out over a quiet parking lot, extensive menu, great food. I dig everything about this place except the fact that it closes at 3pm. Who the hell wants to weigh themselves down with a ginormous meal that early in the day???\n\nStill, highly recommended. If looking for a good breakfast spot on the West side, it's a toss-up between this place, the Omelet House, and the Egg &I. The food at all 3 is of equal excellence, but Coffee Pub has the edge because you can dine al fresco, and the view\/atmo is better than that of the Egg &I's patio.
