I've seen a lot of negative reviews on Yelp about this buffet. Have I had better food in Vegas? Sure. But you can't complain about the food here when it comes free with your hotel package! And what's there to gripe about anyway? I thoroughly enjoyed the prime rib and kielbasa sausage, as well as their seafood dishes. The enhanced water they serve is healthier than the soda options but still provides a sweet kick. The salad isn't bad and the crab legs come aplenty. The only items I would stay away from are the Chinese dishes and pizza -- but hey, if you want pizza, there are obviously places that specialize in that on the strip. Finally, the dessert is well-presented and equally tasty. Needless to say, I will be returning here each time I stay at MGM.
