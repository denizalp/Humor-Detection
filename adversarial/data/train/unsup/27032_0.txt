The food was pretty good. \nOrder the \"Bucket of Bacon\" for and appetizer, really how can you go wrong,  a bucket of bacon! Awesome! The bacon was thick slices and cooked, than covered with a brown sugar type candy coating. It was great.\n\nThe rest of the meal was likewise good, and well prepared, but it really is a bar \/ pub. So there were not a ton of choices on the menu. \n\nThe offererd several beers on tap and promoted some local breweries.\n\nAll in all not a bad experience
