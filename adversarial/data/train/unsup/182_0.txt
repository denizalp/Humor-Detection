Located at 48th and Chandler Boulevard in Ahwatukee, I have driven by this coffee shop about a thousand times. I guess what confused me is the sign on the side that states they \"buy and sell gold.\" According to the other yelpers, this is also a gold buying and selling facility. Upon entering, I'm immediately struck about the cool and calm vibe this facility has. There are a couple of couches, lots of tables, lots of chargers, music that is not too loud, and people in their own special corner just relaxing and enjoying a hot cup of Java. Ording was simple,and easy.  The foam was foamy.  The coffee was hot and had a mild roasted flavor.  They have soy and almond milk, which is a huge plus.  The only negative is the cappuccino was served in a paper cup. We were not offered a mug.
