Surprising Little Spot at SLS. (See what I did there?) \n\nIt's not so little but I was surprised by how much I like the food here. Yes it's perhaps pricey but it is inside a Vegas casino. You can't compare these prices to a diner or going directly to chinatown. But then you can use comps here if you gamble so it's a wash. They have a nice variety of food; and it's interesting that they also have Chinese food. I'm pretty sure that it's to cater to Asian clientele who only eat Asian food (like my mother). \n\nI'm sorry that I didn't photograph everything that I've tried here, but I did share all the dishes we have tried between the last two visits. We have had the wings, fried rice, salt and pepper pork chops, wonton noodle soup, huevos rancheros, steak and eggs, and waffles. I wish the quality of the steak was a little better, and the waffles I got had way too much whipped cream. Like I scraped all of it off and it filled up another plate. \n\nIf you're already staying at SLS\/W, this is definitely a great dining option.
