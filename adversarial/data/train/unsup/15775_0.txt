This place is literally a DUMP!!! I stayed here for MAYBE an hour at the most tonight on business before I left. It's a motel and my room was right by the pool. I could hear everything outside and in all the rooms around me. The room was sketchy and creepy and I couldn't get the AC to stay on. To make matters worse, the walls were so paper thin I could hear the people in the next room having sex SO loud and they were banging on the wall. I immediately packed up and left. This was easily the worst hotel experience of my life. DO NOT STAY HERE
