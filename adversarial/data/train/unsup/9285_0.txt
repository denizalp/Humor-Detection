I came for the Mat Franco show and the show was AMAZING!  But the hotel itself was frustrating to get around.  \n\nFirst of all, that parking structure is the most unorganized, terribly managed with the most confusing signs.  The worst experience in parking a car (worst than European tight streets with no parking space!)\n\nPicking up tickets for the show was terrible!  The guy couldn't find my name on the list.  Then he makes fun of my name while chatting with another employee about someone asking for Mat Franco's autograph and laughing that they signed the card instead of Mat.  Very tacky!  At least don't behave so immature and unprofessional in front of patrons.  \n\nAs we waited for the show, we decided to play some machines.  While playing, the waitress came by with her ipad to take a drink order.  My husband and I ordered Pina Colada and it was disgusting!  Overly sweet and thick.  One sip and it was trash!\n\nWe did eat at the Mexican restaurant but I'll write a separate review for that.\n\nNothing here to want to come back.  Too many options in Vegas to put up with bad service.
