MGM Grand has come a long way since it opened back in 1993 with a 'Wizard of Oz' theme catering to kids. Fast forward to 2018 and MGM is targeting adults and party goers. Ultra hip is what MGM is now. The remodeled rooms were a nice touch with a few hiccups that should be addressed. \n\nMy go to hotel use to be the Mirage but I was tired of the Mirage and needed a change of scenery so MGM Grand caught my eye with better comps since I don't gamble a lot. They are more generous to low and mid rollers. EDC was happening in May so I needed a hotel with good comps with a shuttle stop close by. MGM ticked those boxes so MGM for the win!! The hotel and casino is massive. I'd say the biggest on the strip! \n\nThe front desk clerk quickly checked me in and found me a room on a high floor with a view of the strip. High marks for her for lowering the resort fee and first night rate. I haven't stayed in MGM Grand since 1999 so a lot has changed for the better. The room was nicely remodeled, air conditioning was weak even though I put the temperature on 65. Pool area is massive but my favorite was the lazy river with the waterfalls. Ahh...\n\nCasino had a good variety of slots compared to the Mirage. For dining, I only tried their 24 hour cafe, 'Avenue 24' which was alright. One thing that really stand out is the emerald green lighting on the Grand hotel towers that is reminiscent of the Wizard of Oz theme. It sucks there's no coffee maker, microwave and fridge but oh well. I mostly bought drinks and snacks from the ABC store right near the Coca Cola Store. MGM will be my go to hotel!\n\n\nGo Mlife!!!
