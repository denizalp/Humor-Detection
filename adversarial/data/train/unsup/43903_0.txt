I recently attended a Bellamage eyelash extension course and it was such a great learning experience. We were provided with a lash kit\/supplies, a binder of everything we went through in class and experience working with live models. They taught us how to set up our station, prep our client, how to properly apply the lashes for both classic and volume, and how to market ourselves, just to name a few things. They gave us everything we'd need to start doing lashes on our own. It was worth the money to be able to learn from someone with such experience. Huge thank you to Bonnie, her husband, Pamela and Lindsay for being so helpful and encouraging!
