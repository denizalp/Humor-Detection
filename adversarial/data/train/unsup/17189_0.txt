Okay, so it's a month before my daughter's grade 12 grad and we just started shopping for her dress today. Risky? Maybe. \n\nWalking into A Vintage Affair we saw that there was a wide selection of one-of-a-kind dresses from the 50s that would be perfect for a grad 12 grad dress (And we crossed out fingers that one would fit and suit my daughter)!\n\nMy daughter chose a handful of dresses to try on and it came down to two gorgeous knee-length formal dresses. It was hard to decide, but my daughter chose the more sophisticated one, so that she could wear it to a few other social occasions this summer. \n\nWhile trying on the dresses, one of the owners assisted us. She was so helpful giving advice and ideas on accessorizing. She also pointed out that a vintage dress is not going to go down in price, as long as you take care of it. It's like an investment - a clothes investment! Does it get any better than that??\n\nAfter my daughter decided on her dress, we looked around the rest of the store. There's lots of knick knacks, accessories and things your grandma might have had that is now worth decent money. \n\nI don't know about you, but my grandma would likely faint if she knew how much her hand embroidered doilies are going for these days...
