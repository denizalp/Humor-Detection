Fast food burritos at its best here. Portions are incredible, toppings are always fresh and tasty.\n\nYes, service can be a bit slow as they are a made to order restaurant and then the burritos are grilled for about 5 minutes. I'd rather my burrito freshly made and grilled as opposed to sitting there so no complaints on wait time. Order the naked burrito and they come super speedy.
