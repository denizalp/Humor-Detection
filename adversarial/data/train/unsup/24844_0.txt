There are very few moments in life that are set in stone as \"defining moments\". Your first job, graduations, birth of a child and the very first moment you bite into the Guinea pizza. \n\nThe exact moment that my taste buds experienced the sensation of flavors encompassed by a single bite, I knew I was experiencing something special. Take a slice, frame it and hang it in a museum. This has to be considered art. \n\nThe venue is great and the staff was very welcoming. Our server was on point and I couldn't ask for a better experience. 10\/5 would eat here again.
