Private parking lot.\n\nRestaurant has a really cool comic\/anime theme to it. \nLooooooove all the artwork in this place!\n\nLove the concept of japanese fusion burgers.\n\nGet a combo with burger, fries and drink for about $12.\n\nGet a free jelly tube with tip.\n\nPresentation of food is beautiful.\nI do wish that they ask how you like your burger patties cooked, cause I always get mines medium rare.\n\nThe burger has good flavor, but overall, its too dry. Needs a lot more sauce.\nThe burger was tasty, but not amazing.\n\nFries were okay as well. Slightly thicker cut with some slight seasoning.\nThe mayo like dipping sauce was a nice touch.\n\nP.S. They ask you to give them a funny name for your burger upon purchase.
