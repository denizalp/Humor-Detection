Gyms can range from \"Oh jeez, why does everyone look like they're competing in weightlifting,\" to \"This place doesn't even have weights.\" EOS sits closer to the former, but they offer a lot of cool little options for the non-hardcore as well.\n\nWant to watch a movie on a pretty big screen while working up your sweat? They play mostly hits but there's a good variety. Rather flail around in the pool? Okay, maybe I'm just the one that's bad at swimming. At least it's an option. Want to play on their miniaturized less-than-half-sized basketball court? Eh well you'll probably have to wait but it's there at the very least.\n\nSo EOS offers a lot of different variety and an open area to do some alternative style exercises which is absolutely great. Unfortunately, the bad part is that this place is packed on weekday evenings, the parking lot is often at capacity, and, honestly, they try to sell pretty hard when you first come in.\n\nWe kept reading about 7-day passes and every time we tried, they said \"Uh, we don't do that anymore. Want a membership? No? Okay, we'll get you a 7-day pass because I'm nice.\" Egh.\n\nStill, they don't have cancellation fees or contracts, they're cheap, and the facilities are kept in better condition than the 24-hour I was a part of before. That's enough to make it a pretty damn good gym already. Who wants to pay a cancellation for a gym!? \n\nSo here's to getting fit! Well maybe. Yelp keeps me chubby. :O
