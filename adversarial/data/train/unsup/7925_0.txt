This review is for their Fall 2014 Restaurant Week menu.\n\nFor being a drop out, this place is excelling in the tough world of Vegas dining. \n\nI ordered the House Salad to start off with, a Turkey Pistrami sandwich to assuage my appetite, and a Bourbon Black Bottom Pie as a closure to my meal.\n\nFirst-Course - House Salad: Just like the name states, it's a house salad. Standard greens, nothing creative, this comes with buttermilk ranch. I was praying that this basic salad wasn't foreshadowing what was to come next.\n\nSecond-Course - Turkey Pistrami: This made up for the first-course. Served on a pretzel roll are slices of peppery turkey pistrami and lightly-dressed coleslaw, this sandwich is on the heavy side, but it's delish! \n\nThird-Course - Bourbon Black Bottom Pie: I love this. I can eat this all day long until I barf. This is a rich and chocolaty ganache with salted, crumbled graham crackers that form the bottom of the pie. The light sweetness of the chocolate and the salty crackers pair together perfectly.\n\nService: Good.\n\nOverall: I'm giving Culinary Drop Out an \"A.\" The salad may have been \"blah,\" but everything else was terrific,
