So I called this place hoping to have my dogs boarded in May and one of my dogs had previously been boarded in September of 2015 and the receptionist told me neither one are eligible for the complementary pre-boarding exam and that they each would be charged $50 and that's to be charged  yearly to board the dog that is crazy who makes those decisions So the appointment was canceled and I'm sure I can find other arrangements where I don't  pay $100 plus the boarding fee to have my babies taken care of Beware before make an appointment here not worth the extra charge
