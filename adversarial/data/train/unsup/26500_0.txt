Wes Friedman and Chris Drake were extremely helpful, attentive, and friendly throughout the entire loan process. They always kept me updated through each step of the process, and ensured I understood what was going on at all times. They took the time to answer my questions, no matter the time of day, and were always very quick to respond. Both Wes and Chris have great attention to detail and have shown that they will take the time to ensure everything is that way it's supposed to be. Wes and Chris are extremely trustworthy and always have your best interest at heart. They've made this process extremely smooth and simple, and I highly recommend them.\n\nAlso, my realtor regularly told me that Wes and Chris were great to work with, and that he's happy that he's found a great lender he could work with in the future.
