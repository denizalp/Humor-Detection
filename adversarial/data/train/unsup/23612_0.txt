Stopped in here after a day of sight seeing (Cleveland Museum of Art) and before attending that night's Yankees v Indians game. Arrived just after they opened at 4:00 pm.\n\nWent to wash up in the Men's room. It smelled profusely of day's old urine. \n\nIt's the Hard Rock Cafe by another name. Not a good thing in my book.\n\nThe burger and pulled pork sandwich is what you would expect from a bland, corporate chain. At least the beer was cold.
