One of my bosses from the East Coast loves this restaurant and we'll hit it up every time he's in town.  All of my experiences here have been during lunch time so I really can't tell you much about dinner. I'm sure it's the same, busier, and minus their lunch specials.  You really can't go wrong with anything on their menu.  My favorites include their carne asada plate and steak fajitas.  Their plates are huge and they hook up more than just the rice & beans.  Sometimes I'll dine here in the middle of dieting and have always found something \"clean\" enough to eat.  They'll even substitute some of the rice & beans for more steak.  Besides Vegetarians and Vegans, who doesn't want more steak?\n\nIt's not surprising that a lot of Yelpers rave about the service here.  The hostess and servers are all over customer service.  They treat you good here and most importantly, they'll keep your bowl of chips full.
