$19.99 for All You Can Eat (AYCE) Korean BBQ (KBBQ)? Hell to the yes! \n\nThis place offers quality grilled meats at a huge value! The all you can eat deal is definitely the way to go; the meal is actually a feast and comes with a few complimentary dishes, but I wouldn't sweat trying to force down everything, especially if meat is on your agenda. They also offer a good variety of traditional banchan (side dishes) that all tasted fresh and authentic. Our favorites were the kimchi and the bean sprouts - both extremely flavorful! You can also request some garlic and jalape√±os to grill up! That's our favorite thing to do and pairs deliciously with grilled meat. \n\nOf all meats we tried, I preferred the meats from the non-marinated \"plain\" section, I found them to be fresh and I loved being able to dip them in the table sauces and control my salt intake. The pre-marinated meats were a tad too salty for me. Make sure to try half-portions of the meat so that you have room to try more! Luckily my friend Philip T. gave us this tip, so we didn't have to break our bellies to try everything. \n\nHere's what we tried:\n *Pork shoulder butt - unbelievably buttery! I loved dipping this in the sesame oil salt 5\/5\n * Hwaru pork belly - super thin pork belly that looks like bacon! Flavor was very buttery and slightly sweet. 5\/5\n *Marinated pork rib - great flavor and very juicy meat, but maybe too chewy for me 3\/5\n *Short rib (bone) - great meaty flavor and juicy, but this one was also a tad too chewy for my preference 3\/5 \n *Sweet spicy pork - very tender and nice sweet and spicy flavor, yet it was a little too salty for us 4\/5\n *Spicy baby back ribs - tender and super meaty again, slightly too salty for us 4\/5\n\nComplimentary sides:\n* Doenjang Jjigae (Korean fermented soybean paste stew) - traditional and very comforting! I loved sipping the hot broth 5\/5\n * Gyeran jjim (Korean steamed fluffy egg casserole) - super fluffy! 5\/5\n * Salad - simple but fresh with a tangy light dressing. Great balance to all of the meat! 4\/5\n * Corn cheese - A traditional bar type food, with average flavor 3\/5\n * Pumpkin sikhye - chilled sweet pumpkin dessert drink. It's simple, but a great palate cleanser after all of that meat! 4\/5\n\nWe really adored the waitress who tended our table, cooking our meat for us; she was very friendly, helpful and informative. Plus the overall service was extremely prompt and polite from the entire staff during our dinner. Any sides or sauces we needed were refilled immediately with no down time. We also enjoyed the trendy ambiance and all of the nerdy comics and posters scattered about. We really felt that they appreciated us for dining there and that left a great first impression on us! I've only had a handful of KBBQ dining experiences in Las Vegas, but I honestly think this one has been my favorite so far! I'm already thinking about what I'm going to try the next time I visit.
