Ahhh, the power of the internet. 30 minutes after I posted my first review, customer services reached out to me and guess what, all the pieces of the bedroom set had been located and they would be able to deliver on time after all! I debated on still keeping the ordered canceled, but I honestly do like their furniture. Quality pieces at reasonable prices. I appreciated the store reaching out and fixing the issue, just wish it hadn't come down to a negative review for us to get the customer service we expected. Overall, the furniture was perfect (I actually really love the bedroom set) and delivery was on time.
