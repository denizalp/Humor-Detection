We ate here last night and we ate here 4 months ago. This restaurant is under New Ownership.  The food is better than it was in June. The Crab rangoon's are my favorite. We were pleasantly surprised to find Loquat fruit near the banana pudding food bar. It is our favorite Asian fruit.  The food was hot.  My guy said the Beef that you carve yourself was good.  I really like the Egg Fu Yung sauce and I put in on the Vegetables and rice.  Unfortunately there were not any Wontons in the soup so I put Pot Stickers in the soup and it was almost the same.\n\nWe didn't see the Hostess who dresses strange there and hopefully she doesn't work there anymore.  The Waitstaff doesn't speak much English and hopefully they will hire people who speak some English.
