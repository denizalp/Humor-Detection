Love me some Moe's!!  Meat is always fresh and flavorful.  Their homemade sides, though, are fantastic.  Their collards are the best ever.  But you can't go wrong with any of their standard sides or their rotating daily sides.  While not a regular menu item, if they have the \"egg rolls\", order them!  OMG. One more thing:  the cornbread.  Buttery and yummy.  \n\nWhenever I need take food home to the family, most of the time it is Moe's.
