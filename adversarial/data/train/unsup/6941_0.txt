Zakkushi is surprisingly good. \n\nLove the Sake Combo ($9.99) and Shochu Combo ($9.99) great value since each orders comes with 3 different appetizers. Next time I want to have the Sapporo Combo!\n\nLove the grilled items that we ordered:\nLiver ($1.60) Gizzard ($1.90) Heart ($1.60) Teba ($1.90)\n\nLove the deep fried Nankotsu ($4.60), chicken tender bone perfect to go with drinks and my favourite pub food\n\nI would not order Mentai Potato ($1.80) again.\n\nLove the atmosphere and the vibe at Zakkushi! Good food reasonable price drinks. Though it is a little out of the way, but it is worth to come here for a drink with friends and have some fun!!
