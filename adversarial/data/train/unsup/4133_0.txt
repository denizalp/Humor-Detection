Comet Grill might still have great food, but when I tried to take my daughter & her husband there this noon the server did not like the looks of my son-in-law's NY license, and asked to see his passport! It was clearly discrimination against a person who's of Hispanic descent. Totally inappropriate, and such a disappointment to the good time I was trying to show my kids. I can't in good conscience continue to go there, or to recommend it to others. It hate it, because this used to be my favorite place to go for a cheeseburger, but no more.
