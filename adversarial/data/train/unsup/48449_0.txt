Phenomenal.  Primarily a burger joint, but the flavors are top notch.  It's about $15-20 for meal, but the Chocolate Banana Marshmallow shake more than makes it worthwhile.  My fav burger is the Yo:  provolone, coppa, banana peppers, Tony Packos sweet hot pickles, and the Lola ketchup.  Ohhhh boy...I need to go back .immediately!
