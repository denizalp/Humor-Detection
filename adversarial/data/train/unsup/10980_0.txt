For dinner or lunch, El Rodeo and other Mexican joints like this one are usually not my thing. I like fresh ingredients and typically - or every time I've been to any El Rodeo - they just don't seem to serve fresh anything. \n\nLast night, was a different story.\n\nMy sister and I were out shopping. We were both in fitting rooms complaining about how everything we tried on looked terrible and then whined about how huge our guts are. Then we talked about food and how awesome it is. And then my sister decided she wanted fried ice cream. So, of course, to drown our chubby sorrows we went to El Rodeo.\n\nThe place was dead. We were seated immediately and served the freshest chips and salsa I've ever had at any El Rodeo. They were seriously just fried and the slightest bit of grease was still left on them. SO GOOD!\n\nWe ordered the \"supreme\" fried ice cream. It comes in a fried tortilla covered in cinnamon sugar. This was also VERY fresh - it was just made. I have never experienced two fresh items in a row at El Rodeo so I was more than pleasantly surprised.\n\nWe guessed that since it was almost 9:00 pm they were making things fresh for the next day. So maybe timing is everything? \n\nThank you, El Rodeo, for making my gut even flabbier. Just what I needed.
