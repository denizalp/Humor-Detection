Ehhhh. \n\nMy boyfriend had already been here and although he wasn't that impressed; he wanted to give them another try cuz he's big on sandwiches. \nPlus, I hadn't been here and he wanted me to sample the food. \n\nCame here one Wednesday around dinner time. I was pretty impressed with the space and lighting. Not hard to find at all.\n\nWalked in. No music. No tv. No energy. Just noise of cooking. Mmmkay! Whatever. \n\nDecided to split the pastrami and roast beef. I was excited to try the pastrami as I'm really big on that sammie and I loooove sauerkraut. Roast beef just to try a cold sandwich -- the guy said the meat was going to be rare which I don't mind at all. \nAlso got the side salad for a dollar!!!!!\n\nLarge selection of drinks. Like LARGE -- almost like a gas station lol -- but, I just got the largest bottle of water. \n\nAnyways, we get our food and first bite into the pastrami was pretty darn good. All the melted cheese and grilled bread with just the right about of sauce impressed me a lot. Reminded me of the pastrami sammie that The M Resort had at one of their cafes. \n\nI knew I wasn't going to finish both halves so, I figured on saving the warm pastrami for later. \n\nWent onto the roast beef and first thought(s) were, \" I could've made this myself.\" The bread was bread. Tomato. Lettuce. Some mustard. And very rare roast beef. Absolutely nothing special :( and I paid $9 for it :(:( double sad face***\n\nSalad was overly garlicy. Fresh garlic nonetheless but, SUPER SUPER SUPER garlicy dressing. It was difficult for me to finish my salad & I loooove salads. Especially salads with this kind of dressing. \n\nOverall experience was sad. Nothing unique or something I'd come back for. \nNot what I expected with the high rating on Yelp.
