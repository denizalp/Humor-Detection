I've always been a Target shopper.  With the many locations around the area, it's easy to see them all.  This location sits off of Lake Mead Pkwy with a huge parking area.  Like most of their stores, the setup is familiar.  It's clean, open and organized.  \n\nI've shopped here a few times and also used Target.com online pick up service.  Using that service is really simple and easy.  You'll receive an email once it's ready.  Once in the store you'll go to the customer service desk, show your ID and take your items.  The employees were friendly and quick to retrieve my order.  \n\nI'll just confirm its another good Target location!
