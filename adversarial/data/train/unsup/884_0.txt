I'm kind of curious as to why there aren't more reviews for this company.  I recently used Moving Simplified, after a friend of mine used them for a fairly complicated move.  She had two different crews and heartily recommended Patrick and Preston of Moving Simplified.  She wasn't as pleased with her other crew.\n\nI agree and will use them again.  \n\nSo first the con:\n1.  Website and calling to talk to someone is kind of buggy - it's hit or miss if you will receive a response and not going to lie, I was a touch worried if someone would show up on the day I requested.\n\nNow the pros - and this only applies to the team I had. Patrick and Preston are brothers, it's obvious when you look at them.  I requested them by description as my girlfriend couldn't remember their names.\n\n1.  Fast - these guys hustled up and down three flights of stairs.\n2.  Quality - Nothing was damaged going in or out, even w\/ my er, less then stellar packing skills.  They also moved everything, I mean everything.  They probably think me crazy for having them move an empty shoe box...but dudes, that was the shoe box for the shoes I was currently wearing.  LOL.  I planned on moving those little things myself and left them high up in my closet, but darned if they didn't move EVERYTHING.\n3.  Customer service - they were professional and courteous the whole time.  \n\nAt the end of the day I was looking for straight muscle who would charge a flat rate and that's what I got.  I moved from a rental apartment to my somewhat forever home so not sure when I'm going to need them again, but I will recommend them to all.  I'm a pretty picky customer and was satisfied.
