Was there with a group of 8 for a bachelorette.\nWe had an excellent service from the staff. \n \nThe amuse-bouche was a sweet and salty macaron, interesting and good taste.\nThey gave the wrong salad to a friend of mine and just gave us another salad so I was given a free salad for apetizer lol.\nI shared their specialty meal that night, which was beef ribs that the server explained was for 2-3 people, for 120$. \n\nI would say it is easily for 4-5 girls... or maybe 3 guys.\nWe had a waste some food, sadly, but it was really good.\n\nThe deserts were generous. The sorbet was really tasty and we preferred the basilic flavor. The different creme brulee was flavorful, but a bit too sweet.\n\nIt's easily over 50-100$ per person.
