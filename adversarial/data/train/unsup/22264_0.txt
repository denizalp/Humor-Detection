Bleh. I just came from lunch with coworkers here. Ordered the shrimp and mixed vegetables, was served the shrimp and broccoli. Probably all the same sauce anyway. \n\nShrimp and broccoli both tasted like freezer. Broccoli was.. chewy? Did not realize that the fried rice would come with pieces of pork, but it did, so watch out my non-carnivorous friends. \n\nAlso, apparently, in this part of the country, an egg roll is just a super fried version of a spring roll. Had no idea, I was imagining those spring rolls you get at Viet places, wrapped in rice paper, fresh. \n\nFood took quite a while to come out, and no one brought us fortune cookies. If I'm going to have Americanized Chinese food, I want my fortune cookie. and now I'm craving fortune cookie. Dang it!\n\nI suppose this is a great place for lunch, but only if you aren't familiar with real, good, Chinese food. I'm so sad right now.
