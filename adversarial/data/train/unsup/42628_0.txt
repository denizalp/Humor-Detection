Well. This isn't the first time I've been to any Paramount. And it won't be the last. I'm not sure how to explain it. Its probably the Lebanese in me. They are always average and occasionally above average. But lets be honest. People are complacent. They will go to a place they know is average instead of taking a risk at a place that could be great or awful. \n\n--- Food ---\n\nThe Falafel are amazing. Beyond amazing. I decided to order the most un-middle eastern thing I could to see, and was slightly disappointed. The chicken burger is not something you should be ordering when going to an ethnic place to eat. Stick to the shawarma or any of the foods you cannot pronounce, odds are, you'll enjoy it. \n\n--- Service ---\n\nThe servers were relatively attentive but the fact that my water came 20 minutes into sitting down, after food, was something that sort of stumps me. \n\n--- Overall ---\n\nGood place to grab lunch if you are in the area. Not as high end as I'd have expected for being in the Yorkville area.
