Edit: After seeing so many of these reviews, just want to say that this is NOT a family style place! Don't bring all you kids and expect to be seated comfrotably in a large group greater than 3-4 people! This is a Ramen BAR. it's not a restaurant. You are better off going to Kenzo for a more spacious experience. \nI feel like people are constantly complaining about the space, but aside from the lack of ventilation, it's not meant for you to sit long, and chitchat and have a birthday party. \n\nThe only problem is that the service is lacking when I was there, and they need to keep up with the turnover.\nCome at lunch time, for your best seating.\n----------\nReview:\nIts okay. If it wasnt for the longgg line up due to the hype, it would have been better, but thank godness it was a nice day and it didnt matter too much.  Saturday afternoon it was about a 30min wait.  Make sure you put your name down and hang around the area because they will call you name a few times before you table is given away.\n\nThe long narrow bar like interior goesnt have a lot of seating and makes for a not very ventalited experience. Its hot in there ! \n\nThe menu is tasty but very catered to meat\/pork eaters. If you dont eat pig, there not much choice other than the Vegetarian Ramen (but be warned it made from Pork Bone Soup) and two Dons (rice, both non vegetarian, unless you eat Salmon roe).\n\nOtherwise, go all out on the pork ramen! Choose from different flavours of soup (miso, spicy garlic, soy sauce and plain, $9-10). You can choose from pork shoulder or pork belly. The pork is marinated all special and cooked with a blow torch. \n\nYou can also add another $2 for more pork, or order a big bowl of noodles for $12.8, but I think its cheaper to get regular size and add $2.\n\nAlthough we ordered the big one and we ordered shoulder and belly, they only gave us belly.  It was think, but tasty. Yes the broth makes a difference, and it was really tasty, but not sure if I'll be back.\n\nFor appetizers, we got the chicken karaage (spicy, yum) and kimchi ($3, not worth it, you can get this small portion next door just for sitting down)\n\nNow, sitting 3 engineers at the bar watching the kitchen with slow service we saw so many problems. There's an appetizer guy, noodles guy, pork guy and the assembly\/soup guy. \n  Many times the basket that they cook noodles in were empty many of the time. The main chef seemed to be confused a lot of the time exactly what they were putting together.  The pork guy seemed to need more space and hard time keeping up (work balance req'd!). At times their roles were jumbled and it was confusing.\n\nHopefully they will improve on their service and get more people thru the door! But I wouldn't come here with a party of more than 4.
