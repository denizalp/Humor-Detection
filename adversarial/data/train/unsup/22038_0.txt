It's about time I update this review, especially since I would now give a solid 4.21 stars to Bradbury's. I've grown fond of its 30 sq ft of free space; though there is still many a time where I will be craving a lemon curd crêpe, only to be disappointed by a line stretching out the door while college kids waste valuable space, acting as if they're actually doing their homework. There are a few employees that still make it their personal goal to say as few words as possible, though others are friendly and welcoming, which is something I've noticed change for the better since my last review.\n\nI am still a little disappointed in the amount of coffee you get for the price of a pour over, but a coffee snob gotta snob. If you're driving and looking for value, there are other places close by that give you more for your dollar. But if you're like me and walk most places, this'll do just fine.\n\nI've really gotten into the crêpe crêze, but the savory ones never really appeal to me. Most of that is because they almost always come with an over-easy styled egg, and runny yolks are the antithesis of my being. The sweet crêpes don't seem to rotate as often, but I dig the ones they have, and the relative cheapness of them makes up for my perceived overpricing of their coffee.
