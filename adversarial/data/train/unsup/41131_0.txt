Meh. That's basically my feelings about this place. I've tried the Thai chicken and a pepperoni mushroom pizza and both were just okay. The chicken wasn't the best quality and they're pretty chintzy on the cheese. The pepperoni and mushroom was better but I asked for extra cheese and feel like that was just almost enough cheese for a regular pizza. There was a good portion of mushrooms and enough pepperoni. \n\nThe pizza was kinda soggy in the middle and really nothing special. I'd probably eat here again in a pinch as the price is good but don't expect to be blown away. Its really just basic fast food pizza.
