This place has in equal parts, bad vibe and attitude. I went in asking If they can process a Gun Broker purchase and checking their pistol inventory. Needless to say, after getting an old trucker-looking woman to get off a stool, I found the price was fair, but they had no e-mail, and said the seller needed to fax his form.\n\nWho uses faxes besides maybe healthcare?\n\nThere was also an older skinny trucker-looking guy there who just sat there glaring, very strange.\n\nI found a FFL Provider for 10 less and no attitude.\n\nGun prices are fair, but I won't buy from these weirdos.
