\"You live around the corner and you've never been here?!  Why haven't you come here?  Why do you wait until I come all the way from Austin to Toronto to go to a place like literally next door to your house.  \n\nLOOK HOW CUTE THIS PLACE IS.  \n\nThose waitresses were so nice to me.  You have no idea.  They brought my milk out all cute, they let me order just fruit a la carte then surprised me by asking if I wanted them to throw some granola together to go with it... \n\nGet the salmon quiche!  Get it!  I don't want to order it myself- I'll be fat!  But if you get it, and I just take two little bites; I get to try some and it doesn't count.\"\n\n I still can't believe you never come here.  Christ.\n\n If I lived with you in Toronto, I'd definitely come here.  I'd be here, like, every day.  Why don't they have wi-fi?\"\n\n (my rant to my friend)
