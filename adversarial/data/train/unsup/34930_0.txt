Just came for the sushi. I had 2 rolls, a special one and a regular one. They were both good, slightly above average. Service was friendly and quick. The soy sauce tasted really weird, I am not sure if it was low sodium or not because they put it in their own container. I would like to try something else there other than sushi. The rolls were expensive $17 and $10), which is overpriced for what I got but seemed pretty standard for vegas.
