So, I've been on a bit of a hiatus from yelping for the last two weeks or so, but with good reason... I delivered my incredible baby boy at this hospital and I've since been getting into the routine of being a mommy.\n\nMy experience with labor and delivery at Scottsdale Healthcare Shea was top notch.  Everyone from the administrative people who I checked in with, to all of the doctors and nurses were amazing.  I went through 3 shifts of nurses during my labor\/delivery, and they were fabulous!  My anesthesiologist was incredible too - thank goodness for that epidural!  And best of all, my OB\/GYN was there for my actual delivery.  \n\nOnce Mav made his appearance, we stayed at the hospital another 48 hours or so, and all of the hospital staff we dealt with there were wonderful as well.  \n\nOne thing to note is that this hospital does not have a nursery.  Once your baby arrives, you are in the same room as the baby... nurses are there to help, but you can't just \"send the baby to the nursery,\" as I hear you can do at other hospitals.  I was sleep deprived, but I didn't mind this as I was able to bond with Maverick right away.\n\nOther perks that I was impressed with were the size of the rooms, the fact that everything appeared clean and sanitized, the \"room service\" from the hospital cafeteria, the snacks available to patients, the videos available to help prepare you for being a parent, etc... but again, I cannot stress enough how impressed I was with the nurses.  Special kudos to Pam for getting me started and visiting after the baby came, Maggie for coaching me through the pushing, Cassie for her integral help post delivery, and all of the rest of the staff who I can't mention by name because I was in a drugged \/ hormonal state during my stay at this hospital.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of hospitals in general, but again, I had a fabulous experience here and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hospital to anyone.
