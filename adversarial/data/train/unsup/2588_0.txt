Normally this store is pretty dam good... but tonight... WTF? \n\nNormally the staff fall over eachother to assist and they know what they're talking about.  Good stuff.!!\n\nNormally... but ..tonght while buying caulk.. I asked the wrong person for assistance.  I'm not sure if I caught her off guard with my stupid question \" Could you please help me with some flexible spackle or caulking\" or if it was just a bad night for her... WOW... lady... get out of customer service.. SOON! \n\n I'll still go back here as normally they have most everything here... and its not a big ordeal like the homedepot thing, and 99% of the time the staff is really really great!
