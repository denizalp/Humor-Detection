Costco vs. Sams...   I choose Costco.  I don't know what it is but their store feels cleaner, more organized and priced for better deals.   Costco is about $15 more per year for their membership but I feel I get my money's worth.   The employees here are also more friendly and smiley.   I guess that makes a difference in my book.   \n\nFood samples?  I could walk through and just about have enough for lunch with all of the delicious samples they have out.   This last visit samples included french bread, 6 types of cheeses, angus cheeseburgers, soup, Belvita crackers and a few more things.   Yes, I was full after my shopping! \n\nFood court experience would only include their ice cream sundae with fruit topping.   Ok.  I know I'm cheap sometimes. But where else can you get a humungous sundae for $1.29? I really couldn't finish a whole one by myself.  I'll share! It's really good too! \n\nThe checkouts can sometimes get long especially on the weekends but they really seem to move the lines along quick and efficiently.  Love it!\n\nSo I will probably keep up my membership here unless something drastic would happen here.   Thanks Costco!
