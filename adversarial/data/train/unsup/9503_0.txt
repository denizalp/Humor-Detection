I loved this hotel ! yeah its far down the strip but all you need to is catch the monorail and boom it drops you off at all the major casinos. So let me start with they have a shuttle that picks you up from the airport every hour.Free ride so you really don't need a car in vegas if you plan on staying on the strip.once at the hotel i normally tip my driver as most should :).One good thing i noticed is that it doesn't have the smell of smoke thats awesome. then walk over to the check in desk and the people are very friendly and move quick. The hotel is super modern really great vibe. Across from the check in desk is a lounge bar great for the guest who are waiting . when you get around the corner you will walk into the casino its not really that big but it does the job. Also located in the casino area are the restaurants Bazaar Meat,Katsuya,Ku Noodle,Umami burger and 800 degrees all great places. for the day and nightlife you have Foxtail,lux Sayers club and monkey bar.This Hotel has everything you need including beautiful art work throughout .The rooms are nice we stayed in World tower. It came with double beds big lighted mirrors on both walls. A nice 32 inch tv that welcomes you with your name. The room are clean very modern that includes free wifi. with that being said I think this is a great hotel choice if you are staying in vegas.
