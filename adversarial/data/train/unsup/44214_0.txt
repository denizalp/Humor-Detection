Came for lunch and had an adult beverage with the wings & salad special. As soon as I got to the bar, I could smell the bar. Seriously gross so I moved to the far end of the bar and still smelled. Similar to moldy wet rags\/water. Definitely needs a good cleaning (bleach!)! The wings were fine, the house salad - supposed to be super simple - it was alright, wasn't a fan of the oregano seasoning on it, but ate it because I was hungry. Service was great - she was on top of it. The smell is what had me questioning the cleanliness of my cups & counter.
