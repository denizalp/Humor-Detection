Oscars is a 'Jack Astors' type pub with a patio that gets lots of beautiful sunshine in the afternoon and evening.\n\nThe food is very standard. Chicken, ribs, seafood, pasta, sandwiches, appetizers and salads to choose from and all pretty standard in flavour and quality. \n\nThe service is friendly and attentive though the system on the patio seems to be whoever gets to the table first gets it because we were asked if we'd been helped yet about 4 times by 4 different girls (better over attentive than under attentive though). \n\nIt seems to attract a lot of middle aged people looking for somewhere to drink a beer alone so if that's what you're into, this is a good place for it.\n\nOverall a good option if you're looking for a watering hole before or after working up a sweat at Chingaucousy Park.
