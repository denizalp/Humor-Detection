Dine here on an almost Bi-weekly basis, great for a consistent meal that is not over-priced.  \n\nService is quick and food is great, even when compared to a Moishe's (besides not paying $60 for a steak) or something similar.\n\nGreat spot if you're looking for a regular staple that serves a great steak, seafood, or chicken (not the most vegetarian friendly restaurant) without breaking the budget (or expense account).
