Girls are not the greatest, a few of them barely show what they got even when on the main stage, those corsets be hiding the damaged goods!!! A few of the other reviews say cheap drinks- $7 for a jack n coke is cheap? A few of the girls there tonight had terrible attitudes! This black haired one, who didn't even take her top off while dancing on the stage was the worst!! I forget her name but she's not important and over the hill, time to go to real estate school honey buns. The big guy named Chris was cool. Talked to him for a minute, seems like a solid dude. Won't be back tho, so I wish him well, and only him.
