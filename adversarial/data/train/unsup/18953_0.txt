I wasn't going to write a review for Windsor, since there are already like 80 of them, but I noticed there's been quite a controversy over the mixed grain salad.  Since that salad was pretty much the highlight of my week, I want to add my 2 cents here.  \n\nFirst of all, the components of the salad are listed right on the menu, so if you don't like what's in it, don't order it.  If you like beets, squash, grains, etc., this salad is absolutely the perfect combination of crunchy, hearty, healthy, salty, and a little sweet.  So incredible was this salad that I couldn't even stop eating in time to leave room for ice cream at Churn.  I was very impressed with the vast array of options on the menu here but will probably continue to order the mixed grain salad again and again.\n\nOther stuff about Windsor:\n\nThe patio is delightful.  It's not a particularly large patio but it's got a great setup, with plenty of room between tables.  Thank goodness for misters.  I loved that they gave a little bowl of pistachios as soon as we sat down.  The atmosphere inside the restaurant was nothing special (besides the awesome wall of cassette tapes linking Windsor to Churn).
