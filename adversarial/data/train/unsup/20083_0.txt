Where do I start. Oh yeah, horrible customer service with \"sorry, not sorry\" attitude. It's been over 3 months sine the panels were installed and still not turned on because solar city did not turn in paperwork to NV Energy. Sales rep blamed it on previous rep. Signed a 20 year commitment and all they offered was a restaurant gift card. Oh I forgot to mention, they don't communicate with each other since each person we speak to either lies or says the opposite of the other one.  Oh, and now we have birds nesting under the panels and are waiting for them to come out and fix that problem. And oh yeah, had 3 referrals for solar city but no one from solar city called them. I guess they don't need the business - too busy ripping current customers off.\n\nDo not use this company!!! BBB will be contacted.
