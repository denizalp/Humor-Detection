Sky Harbor Terminal 4 has gone through a major overhaul since my first flights into Phoenix.  The long months of construction was well worth the wait.  I am partial to terminal 4, being that I am fairly loyal to AA and occasionally venturing into Southwest.  I do like this airport primarily because terminal 4 has some great local restaurant flavor.  My favorite places to munch there are Olive and Ivy and Cowboy Caio.   I can get the chopped salad to go.\n\nWhen picking up friends and family from the airport (Terminal 4), I just ask my family to head to the North or South curb and let me know which door number.  Odd numbers are in the south side, even numbers are in the north side.  The cell phone parking lot is convenient and has generally had adequate parking.  That said, I don't like it and generally opt to not use it.  I had a bad experience with a guy banging on my car window when I fell asleep waiting there once.  In hindsight, I can't recall why we were lined up in that lot, but I skip that place at night.
