My girlfriend and I recently went to the antique store in downtown Willoughby store called Eastside relics I was looking for another beer sign to add to  my collection and I was told they have a nice selection of them I went up to the front counter and saw a man around 30 standing at the counter he approached me I noticed he had bloodshot eyes and he reeked of marijuana I politely told him never mind and went and made my purchase somewhere else I refuse to contribute any money towards peoples drug habits stay away from this store you're only supplying them with funds so they can smoke more marijuana
