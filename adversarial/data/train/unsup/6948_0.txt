This pub is filled with regulars who sit at the bar. This lets you know that the beer is always fresh and delicious. It looks like any other English pub dark wood everywhere, and a few flat screen TVs. The patio is pretty impressive, much larger than you would expect from a neighborhood pub. There is a second floor that is used for private parties. The bathrooms are WAAAYYY larger than you would think. Easily a 10 staller plus urinals! These were kept in pristine condition although located in the basement.\n\nThe service is quick and delivered with a smile although if you're not a regular I highly recommend sitting away from the bar at dinner time as you may feel you don't really belong to this boys' club.\n\nThe food surprised me the most. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and a side of sweet potato fries, although they weren't astounding I didn't feel as if I was getting ripped off or that the quality was lacking. The sweet potato fries were not too think nor too thin and had an excellent crisp and served with the standard chipotle mayo, these fries stole the show. The grilled chicken sandwich was on grilled peices of sliced bread but had a large piece of chicken breast. The beer was fresh and the selection was decent.\n\nOverall, a good neighborhood pub with a decent price tag. Probably some of the better pub food in the area especially the sweet potato fries. Great place to meet up for a few after work drinks and food.
