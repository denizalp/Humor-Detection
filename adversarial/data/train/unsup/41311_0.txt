Really disappointed in the quality and variety of choices.  Other than the fresh pasta station, everything else was your typical \"run of the mill\" type food.  Table clearing service was too efficient.  Every time I go up, my plate was taken away before I was finished what was on it.  Save your $$ and find another dinner buffet.
