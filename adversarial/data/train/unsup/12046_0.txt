Quality Food = Quality Life! That's the motto at Flame Broiler, offering up simple, healthy bowls and plates with protein, rice, and veggies. While the fare is light on flavor, it's heavy on the nutrition and the location is smartly placed down the street from LVAC. \n\nChicken-veggie bowl with brown rice (no surcharge!) is an ample portion for a low price ($7), kick it up with Magic Sauce (teriyaki) or Hot Sauce from the self-serve condiment station. The protein portion is larger than expected, making up about half of the bowl itself- they don't overdo the filler here!\n\nService is friendly, location is clean. There is limited parking out front (usually taken by customers for the adjacent Starbucks), but there's an additional lot to the right. Some out door dining tables available.\n\nNOTE: The hours are a bit odd, they close at 7PM on weekdays, which is absurdly early IMO. Check times before you go.
