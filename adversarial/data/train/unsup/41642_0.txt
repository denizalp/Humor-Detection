Had dinner here last Thursday night and really enjoyed the experience.  There were so many things to choose from that sounded good, and based on our experience, we will have to go back to try more, as we were very happy with what we selected.  We also shared our meals so both had the opportunity to try more.  We started with a little tray of grilled asparagus and olives and cheddar cheese that was served with crusty bread and delicious jam.  We shared the scallops, which were very well prepared and flavorful, and the New York strip steak that was served with an amazing horseradish sauce.  The food was amazing and the service was totally up to par.  We opted to sit out on the patio, which was also very enjoyable.  Can't wait to come back, though seeing as I reside in Los Angeles, it will be a while!
