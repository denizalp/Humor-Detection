I use The Parking Spot 2 for business more than pleasure, but they are always friendly, quick, & reliable. Every trip now has been flawless including adding my points. Love the cold bottles of water! I parked just for an hour just to pick up a business associate and then we headed off to a distance work site three hours drive. My associate had never used this service and was very impressed with buses every 5 min or less and loved the cold water. Making an appointment to park is easy and even a one hour rate is cheaper than the airport parking lot! I hope The Parking Spot increases their places as I travel all over this country.
