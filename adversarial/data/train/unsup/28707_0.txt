New to the area , needed a place to get my nails done for my baby shower so thought I'd try bally nails . I got a French manicure and the whole time I had to keep asking the lady doing my nails to fix them. Eventually I just gave up and decided to except the fact that this place is just not worth my time . It's been a week and my nails look like I've had them done for a month or longer ! They look ferocious thanks bally nails ..
