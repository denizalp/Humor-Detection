RUDE STAFF! Take your business elsewhere! I would give this UPS store NO star if it was an option. I used this store (closest mail place to my house) only a handful of times in the past 10 years until another location further away from my house opened up.  The very first time I went in there was to ship a set of wheels I had sold on eBay.  I packed them myself, and very well at that; not my first rodeo shipping items.  I waited patiently and observed how the female clerk seemed to be \"bothered\" by having to be there, or working at all for that matter. This lady (and I use that term loosely) clerk was so rude. I wanted to take my business elsewhere that trip but had already lugged all four heavy boxes inside.  She's a smaller statured, older lady with a grovelly smoker's voice.  I called back later that week to speak to a manager or owner about my experience. He could have cared less about the way she handled the transaction and how I was treated.  The second time I went in (about 8 months later) and she was still employed there, and still rude. Years later, still there--this time gossiping with a younger co-worker about a customer that had just left. \"You can attract a lot more bees with honey than you can with vinegar.\"  This place must manufacture vinegar in the back room.  Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else!
