Bunch of crooks had a vehicle listed for sale for 11,500 so went and got a loan for that amount. Firm the purchase order and there where all types of hidden fees doc add on fees making it over 12,500. It would be nice if the hey would plus really represent the actual price. To top it off the guy was a total Fuck and wouldnt work with my brother at all. I will not be reccomending this company to any friends family or clients
