NYS Elite Basketball is a great league for kids who are looking to take their game to the next level.  However keep in mind this is the ELITE 10-11 league, and for kids to understand the game at their best, the games MUST be officiated equally and accordingly.  Reason I say this is because NYS has two Ref's and ONLY two Ref's that show and give favor to the weaker teams playing the obviously stronger teams.  And they simply will abuse their power when you actually grow balls to question their authority.  Kids deserve a fair chance to earn the game by hard work, communication, and simply having fun, not because the refs know the other team is better, so they give the weaker team every floppy foul there is in order for them to shoot free throws as an opportunity to get some points on the board.  I appreciate NYS Elite Basketball, but for this upcoming winter season, I say this to you.......PLEASE, and I mean PLEASE hire Ref's that actually know how to make the necessary calls when they are suppose to so that both teams simply have a fair shot at becoming better players and earning their victories and respectfully taking their losses.
