Yuck. Ordered the Al Pastore, it was chewy! how can it be Chewey? Ordered the brisket, it tasted like it was doused in barbeque sauce! Ordered the Tinga, it looked so gross we didn't even take a bite. I think the tacos were doused in butter possibly, they were soggy and falling apart. Basically we took a few bites of everything and found it to be disgusting and threw it out.  I don't know what the problem was with the food. We spent $24 on food that should've cost less than $12, and I can't understand the great reviews it got in now magazine, but I'm assuming somebody paid off the reviewer. La cantina down the street is better even if it's a little pricey. Finding authentic Mexican food at a decent price in the city has been an ongoing issue for a few years now. But this was crap.
