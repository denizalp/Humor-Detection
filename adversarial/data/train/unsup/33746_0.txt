Compared to other dim sum places we've tried in vegas, PPP was pretty good. The carts come by often and there was good selection both times we've come. Only thing we tried that I didn't like was this spicy chow fun dish, it was flavorless. Also I wish they offered sate chili oil instead of red chili paste. Knocking off a star because they don't use sprays when wiping down tables, just the same gross rags (luckily I always have baby wipes on hand to wipe our table). Knocking off another star because it's in a casino and I hate having to come through smoking areas just to dine and leave smelling like smoke.
