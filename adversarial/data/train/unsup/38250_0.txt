I recently took a one on one training with Taryn for microblading and she was such an excellent teacher! She has a ton of experience and has worked with so many other skilled artists that she has a wealth of information! I would highly recommend her for her services, and for trainings. She offers pretty much every service and has an excellent way of communicating what to expect, no bs or sugar coating. Really helped add to my education and feel like she gave me the tools I need to move forward. Thank you!
