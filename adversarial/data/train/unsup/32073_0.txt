Color me impressed, at least with the Chinese food.\n\nWe first ate here on impulse, after catching 2 movies in a row at their theaters upstairs. This place opens till 2am, which is really great!\n\nThe best thing here IMO is the double pan-fried noodles. It's not often that the chef successfully creates the crispy outer edges while the rest of the noodles have just the right \"mouth-feel\" to them: a little bite, a little chewiness. The sauce is just about perfect, not too cornstarchy. \n\nA close second is the hot and sour soup. Trust me, it really is above average, almost better than my mom's (heh). \n\nThe kai lan (Chinese broccoli) was also very good, plump and juicy. My less adventurous companion likes their lemon chicken, which is alright, but not great.\n\nThey have some good lunch specials and late night specials (half-price on some items after 11pm, including hot and sour soup, yay!).\n\nIn all, a better Chinese dining experience than some on Spring Mountain, which is a very pleasant surprise!
