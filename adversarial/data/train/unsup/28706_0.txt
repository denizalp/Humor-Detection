Ordered a pizza and salad. Waited an hour and a half. Called to check status & the girl who answered the phone said they couldn't find my order (I received a CONFIRMATION TEXT)....She said they could put the order in again but it would be another hour and a half. WHAT? Waiting 3 hours for a pizza? NO! Get your act together, Angelina's. You're a mess.
