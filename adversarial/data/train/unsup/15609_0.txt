Ladies and Gentleman who serve, have served, or are associated with the military, \"Thank you for your service and sacrifices. \n\nThis hospital has a staff that is absolutely AMAZING!! As a civilian accompanying my best friend (who is military) on a trip to the ER, I walked away completely jealous!!\n\nThe service here is 5 star! No long wait ( maybe 20 mins). Care and compassion was displayed by every staff member. :)\n\n The thoroughness of testing for his abdominal pain was OUTSTANDING! Bloodwork was drawn, urinalysis performed, ultrasound and Catscan  to give a complete comprehensive diagnosis. Total time 2 and a half hours!! Beginning to Discharge. \n\nNow,  had it been myself (civilian) at a regular hospital I would have had maybe one or two of those tests, after a minimum of 5 hrs in the ER,  if lucky, and a , \" Follow up with your primary care physician.\"\n\n That would have meant seperate visits for my doctor at one location, and ultrasound at another location THEN have my Catscan at a later time etc etc.\n I know this because I have experienced it.\n\nTHIS  hospital offers some of the BEST service by the Nicest staff. I would expect nothing less for our service men, women  and their families. They definitely deserve this quality of care. I was extremely thankful to them for taking such good care of my best friend.\n\nIf you ARE MILITARY and you or your loved ones *dependants  needs medical care, don't be afraid to go on base. Not here in Las Vegas NV. This particular  base hospital is great.  I highly recommend this location. Truly an exceptional medical team of doctors and nurses.
