the marquee bouncers must be monitoring yelp reviews because they did not live up to my \"stick up the ass\" expectations :), here are the reasons why:\n\n1. bouncer working the rope was super nice and polite\n2. while i was walking around a bouncer told me i looked really nice and said it's a good look for me (lol)\n3. when my friends meandered our way into a roped off table the bouncer didn't care (lol)\n\ndefinitely more fun in the summer.  for the marquee winter makeover they decided to put up this giant tent and covered the pool with platforms to cram more bottle service tables in so they can cash in more $$$.\n\ni still hate the exit stairs.  i wonder how many girls have ate it up and down the stairs.  so imagine, 3 flights of stairs while under the influence in heels.  not a good combination AT ALL.\n\ni still think the hip hop room can be bigger, the main dance foor is too edm.\n\nstill prefer surrender and xs :)
