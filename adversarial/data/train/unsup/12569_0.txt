This has to be my favorite guilty pleasure on Thursday nights.  For a while there I was addicted - even memorizing some of Dennis Rowland's jazz covers!  \n\nLuckily, I got a life, and hadn't been in a while.  But I found myself here last week showing off this place to an out-of-town visitor, and was sorry I had even left.\n\nKazimierz is a quintessential Phoenix experience, not because it's typical Phoenix -- but because it shows how magical a great space, a great wine list (1800 bottles deep), an entertaining performer, and an interesting mix of guests can do for a bar.\n\nRegarding the rest: \n* Everyone else accurately describes the set-up.  \n* I've never had the food here as I'm always here post-dinner.  \n* The service here is always professional and above par.  \n* And the jazz entertainment on Thursdays ($5 cover) is always a crowd pleaser.  \n\nSpeaking of the crowd it ranges the gamut in age, ethnicity and types -- from guys\/girls night out (on their way to Suede), couples canoodling on a dinner date, to older couples there for the music.\n\nMy only complaint as another reviewer points out is the tacky wine menu - in a three ring binder?!?   It's quite the disconnect.  Why not go one step further and put the wine selection in a.... Trapper Keeper.  Klassy!\n\nIf you get a chance check this bar out in July for the Christmas tree and candy canes.  Ho ho ho, winos!
