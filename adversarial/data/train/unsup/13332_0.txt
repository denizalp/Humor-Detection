Never coming back! First of all, they don't even have the jewelry I want ... For two nostril piercings! Isn't that one of the most popular piercings? And they're out of stock?! Second of all, it's super hot and uncomfortable in there. I probably should have left after that but I didn't so I ended up leaving with a crooked nose piercing. I drive alllllll the way back the next day to get it taken out and get my money back and my piercer, Shane, decides to tell me that he knew the piercing was crooked but left it in anyway! Uhhhh ... Excuse me?? Absolutely no customer service and horrible professional reliability. Just went there today to get my money back because this whole experience has really bothered me ... Shane ended up telling me that it was MY decision to leave that night with a crooked piercing. What. The. Hell. Don't go here if you want your face to stay in tact.
