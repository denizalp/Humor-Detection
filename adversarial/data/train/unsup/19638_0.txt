I like this Nordstrom but often find myself looking instead of buying here.  They occasionally have good sales on men's shirts.  They have an extensive suit collection that will hurt your wallet.  \n\nThey have very nice shoes but I tend to like Neiman Marcus' better, i.e., no Gucci, no Tod's, no Prada (although Gucci & Prada can make some really butt-ugly shoes themselves).  They both carry Ferragamo.  The Santoni's are nice with ultra soft leather if you can find an attractive pair.   The Bruno Magli's are super soft as well, but I just can't get past that OJ thing.  I do not like Allen Edmonds or Johnston & Murphy.  Their leather is hard as a rock.  Needless to say I am a shoe fanatic simply because a lot of men wear a really nice suit with these God-awful ugly shoes that ruins the whole effect.  Go buy some nice shoes.  It doesn't matter what you wear.  If the shoes are bad, you look like crap.\n\nI cannot comment on the women's clothes.  I do not wear them.  :)
