I can see why this place gets 5 stars! I wanted to try everything but settled on Injeolmi and traditional snowflake. Also ordered pong shake. All the desserts were so tasty and yummy to the last bite. It's not too sweet or heavy like boba drinks. It's flaky and perfectly sweetened. I saw many people sharing snowflakes but If you're not overly stuffed, I can see finishing one myself, in fact, I did. \nI want to go back and try everything on the menu. I can't wait! The cafe was very welcoming, clean and friendly.
