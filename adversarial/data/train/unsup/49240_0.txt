I needed two large replacement windows.A Personable and knowledgeable salesman named Shawn came to my house and measured, and then E-mailed a proposal along with standard terms and conditions. \nOne of the conditions read  \" an overhang of at least 12 inches should be provided for each window, 24 inches to 36 inches is preferred. Windows without an overhang or sit within a parapet wall will have no warranty against water penetration\".\n\nI was ready to purchase my windows from this company, but decided to use another vendor due to unacceptable warranty terms and conditions.
