Searched on here for some Asian restaurants with decent reviews and we decided to check out Chou's. Glad we did because the food was EXCELLENT. They have a lot to choose from and the prices are very affordable. The portion sizes are HUGE, so bring your appetite (We had a lot of leftovers and only ordered 3 items). Watching them make their handmade dumplings was fun and they were soft and fluffy when they were delivered. \nService was very attentive (Almost too attentive but didn't bother us) and friendly to boot. \nGreat food and service. We'll be back for sure!
