When I packed up my younger daughter and headed to Vegas for the weekend, my obliging yelper husband texted me several places to eat - either places he likes or yelp-finds. This one was a yelp-find and a real winner. We were having dinner w\/my brother, who lives in Hiroshima, so he's hard to impress when it comes to Americanized Asian food. He liked it too.\n\nTo start w\/the negative, the pad thai was bland. It just didn't knock my socks off and I LOVE pad thai. That was the only negative I could find. That said, we ordered chicken satay and pot stickers. Both were delicious. I had Panang Avocado w\/salmon. Truly yummy! Bo had a green curry eggplant dish which came with shrimp. I hate eggplant so I didn't try it but I tasted a shrimp and green beans which were also really good. I just love a curry that makes your whole body warm. Anyway, each curry dish came with giant mounds of jasmine rice.\n\nThe place is uber-reasonable and has \"early hole in the wall\" decor. You know the kind of place, nothing to look at but your taste buds dance. We had more than enough food and I think the bill was around $30 or $35 - big brother paid.\n\nI'd go back in a heartbeat. Who needs overpriced\/mediocre on the strip. I'll take cheap and tasty any day.
