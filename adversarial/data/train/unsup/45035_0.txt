I ate at Avenue B in Pittsburgh during a visit back in July.  Chef Chris Bonfili really puts forth some creative and tasty cuisine sourcing seasonal ingredients from local farms for his menu which changes daily.  My girlfriends took me here and we ordered & shared many different dishes and they were all delicious.  Kobe Meatloaf, goat cheese & chive whipped Potatoes with Crispy Shallots and tomato jam - Heirloom Tomato & asparagus salad, with a roasted garlic vinaigrette - Black Grouper, black eyed peas & greens, candied bacon, sweet potato hay, berry BBQ - Crispy Eggplant, Tagalini Pomodoro.   Pittsburgh better savor this gem of a restaurant that could easily rival my favorites here in San Francisco.  I look forward to eating here again when I'm back over the holidays!!!  YUM!!!  PS. BYOB
