Dropped by after work to pay this place a visit.  It's just a short walk East from Yonge and Dundas. \n\nIt was their soft opening, not overly busy, we just walked right in and got seated.\n\nThe waitress opened up the menu and said there were only 2 pages available to order at the moment. No problem.\n\nEssentially the first page is the basics, second page more of the basics plus more meat, and some specialty bowls for $15\n\n\nNot to experiment,  I ordered a Shoyu Ramen,  priced around $10.90\n\nMy take,\nBroth soulless. Empty tasting without complexity. Simple and tap water tasting. (or could this a case of too much lye)  \n\nNo egg? Found that rather strange.\n\nBamboo shoots and dried seaweed - nothing out of the ordinary.  \n\nNoodles a bit over cooked.  Tasted very much like soft fresh packaged noodle.\n\nChashu (pork belly) was ok but it was not braised.\n\nMind you better than Kenzo, and broth not salted to heck like Kinton\nBut there's no competition to Sansotei - you can taste the difference.\n\nAnd how come all of them are on Dundas?
