I wandered here with my friend one fateful Friday afternoon and walked out with a gel mani, a pedi, and lash extensions.  While the service here is fast and friendly and the decor is nice and modern, the gel manicure I got was a bit on the thin side.  I'm not usually too hard on my nails but the gel and design was slowly chipping away after a week.  Other than that, my pedicure was great and the lashes looked amazing until I finally got annoyed by the weight and foreign-feeling of the extensions and rubbed them off with some eye make-up remover.  Not a bad little place if you need to glam up for a weekend.  The prices are pretty reasonable!
