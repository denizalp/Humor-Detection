The restaurant has a cute Dia de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) vibe to it. They have tables and a full service bar area. From what it looked like, I think you order at the counter\/bus and then pick a seat? I don't know because I only ordered take out. \n\nWe did 3 combination plates (3 tacos, rice, beans) at $9.50. The tacos are street style so they are smaller but the combination plate is sure to fill you up. All of the tacos were delicious. They even had a special one that was deep fried so it became a hard shell taco. All of us loved the fluffy rice and chunky beans...they even threw in a couple chips to scoop up the beans. The tortillas are soft and taste homemade. I really appreciated how they wrapped up each sauce in its own container and labeled which taco it belonged on to prevent the tacos from getting soggy. If you don't want to gnaw on a corn cob you can get your elotes in a bowl! \n\nGreat little taco spot. We will be back! I hope they get busy...I'm sure they rely solely on word of mouth or whatever marketing they're doing as I don't think they get much walk-in business (since their storefront is hidden)! The service was friendly, but I will admit I was not greeted right away and had one of those awkward \"where do I go to order\" moments. \n\nHOT TIP: Happy hour- $4 dranks & $2 tacos!!!! FYI, apparently \"pinches\" is not a bad word ;X
