My regular stylist left town for the holidays for a month!  Phoned Tracy Riggs Salon and Kim gave me a same day appointment.  Easy uptown location ... retail strip ... aesthetically pleasing brickNmortar salon.  Walked in & was surprised how empty the shop was.  Hmmmm ... on a Saturday???  Kim greeted me & we started with a brief consultation: I was there for a relaxer, deep conditioner, trim & roller set.  CLUE #1: While Kim prepped me ... she took a phone call and I over heard 1 of her clients complaining she was NOT satisfied w\/ her service.  Kim told her she could return offering to re-do the service.   A bit later I got CLUE #2: She neglected to ask me for my roller size & chose too small.  I'm NOT a fan of Shirley Temple curls. She was 3\/4 through in rolling ....Ugg ... just finish it.  Inspite of the mishaps, I had a clean scalp & my hair was shiny & bouncy.  Kim gave me a $20 discount so my final charge was $100.  Expensive SHO NUFF!  I paid & prayed the relaxer would last the expected 6-8 weeks.\n\nMy roller set lasted 10 days ( average).  It was time for a wash so I phoned the TR Salon 2X and did not get an appointment: Snow storm & Kim was out sick.  My 3rd call ( & last ) I spoke directly with Kim & she said she was booked solid.  She didn't bother to offer me an alternative date ... OK.  After 15 days I had to self wash my hair and that's when I got CLUE #3: My hair appeared as if I didn't get a relaxer just 2 weeks ago. The relaxer applied by a licensed stylist failed!  WTH ?!?  Only 3 possibilities here: OPERATOR ERROR, INFERIOR PRODUCTS OR PRODUCT TAMPERING.  Does it even matter at this point which is the culprit?  NO!
