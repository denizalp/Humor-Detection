Updating my review on the hair salon here.\n\nHonestly, I'm not impressed at all. They really do lack communication between their stylists and workers. I called to schedule a simple wash, cut, and style for my hair. The lady I spoke with told me that they did have a deal for $30.\n\nI come in on time for my appointment with Susie. She has me wait another 20 minutes because she's running late with her current client. I finally get into the chair only to have her tell me it was going to be $52 instead.\n\nThat's a huge jump from $30, which I wouldn't be so upset if I wasn't misinformed. \n\nAll in all, I'm taking my hair services else where.
