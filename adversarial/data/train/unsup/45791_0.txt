When first reading the reviews, I was kind of anxious about staying at Serene, but due to great pricing, I went ahead and booked it. Check in was easy, I booked two rooms with them. King suite was clean, everything worked, and I was happy with it. Two queen room, the beds were made, but pushed out from the wall with the pillows in the middle of the bed. Hotel manager waived the nightly resort fee for that room, and I really appreciated that. Ice machine stopped working on our last day, but they were offering ice still at the front desk. Pool was great and clean, well landscapes outside, staff was friendly. Overall, we were barely in the rooms, but loved the showers, beds were super comfortable, and the rooms were spacious. Definitely will stay here again when I come back.
