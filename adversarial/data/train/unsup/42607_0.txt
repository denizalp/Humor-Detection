I had the 5 oz salmon with green beans and mashed potatoes. It was all very delicious! Not giving a full 5 stars solely because of the service. The server was very nice, however my fianc√© ordered a water and our waitress gave him a coke instead. She noticed her mistake and apologized, but he never received his water. We will go here again.
