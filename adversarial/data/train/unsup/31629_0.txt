We brought our Wheaten Scottish Terrier in today for a much needed bath as we are traveling in our RV cross country from NY. We liked that we could use a stand up tub and also dry and comb him out. The Soggy Dog is a very clean facility and I found the employee to be helpful. We brought our own towels, shampoo and conditioner but these are also available here. Wally feels and looks so much better!
