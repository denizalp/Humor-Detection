Fantastic food!  I don't know how \"authentic\" this ramen is, but it's delicious.  I've been twice now and had the Miso (Hungry), which seemed like a more traditional dish.  My second time I had the Chizu, which was more like an Italian dish, but was just a delicious (also very salty, but I enjoy that).  I will be back.  Wonderful.
