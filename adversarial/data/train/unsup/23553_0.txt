Worst place to go.  If you are trying to see woman who are stripping... Do not go there,  they don't even take there shirts off most of the time.  They were strung out and sweaty.   The bouncers there one white dude in particular was completely unprofessional and pushed me when I was trying to go back in to the club from smoking a cigarette.  I will be calling the better business Bureau to inform them of the way people are treated and talked to at this place of sex slave business... Very dissapointed..
