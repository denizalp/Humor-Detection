I love having Eunice do my nails because she's passionate about her work and I see it on my nails even way after the typical 3 week gel manicure duration! My nails still look good around a months time! I was negligent in writing this review because I'll probably be having booking issues for Eunice now but the Pop Lash & Nails salon has always been good to me so they deserve the business! Thanks Eunice ! See you soon!
