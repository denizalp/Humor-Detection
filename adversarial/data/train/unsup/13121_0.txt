We stopped in today to check out the latest addition to the downtown neighborhood. \n\nPro: super friendly server and cook, freshly made tacos (worth a little extra wait for fresh) and great space to enjoy once it gets a little warmer\n\nCon: the tacos were quite messy and somewhat greasy & the agave shrimp smelled fishy...yuck!\n\nWe ordered 5 tacos to do (in order of best to worst): chicken gringo taco, beef gringo taco, carne asada, pork carnitas, & agave shrimp.  I will definitely give this place another chance, but not rushing back quite yet.
