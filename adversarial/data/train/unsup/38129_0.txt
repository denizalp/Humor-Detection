TERRIBLE SERVICE! I went to Dino Palmieri for an eyebrow wax because my favorite lady at Avalon Spa and salon was unavailable. Someone referred me to this place because they always get their brows done here. I went in and told them my name and they told me to sit and wait in the front. They all started to stare at me as if they were debating on who should take me. Finally someone took me back and I was explaining how I just needed a clean up and shape and how I'm really careful with my eyebrows and where I go to get them done. While I was explaining, she just slapped some wax under my eyebrows and ripped them off. She tweezed for maybe 30 seconds and told me I was done. The whole thing took maybe 5 minutes and there was no shape AT ALL. I felt like I was a bother to them by even being there. I paid my $20 and gave her a good tip and vowed never to go back. Terrible service and the women don't give a damn. Thanks for making me feel like a waste of time!
