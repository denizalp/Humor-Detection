Probably one of my favorite hotels on the strip, but is located at the end so there aren't many casinos nearby other than Luxor and Excalibur. They have a team running through all three hotels for easy access as well as a walking path. \n\nDaylight and light nightclub is located at this hotel which brings well known DJs. \n\nMy favorite part of this hotel is just the regular pool area. You have 5 different pools to lounge around.
