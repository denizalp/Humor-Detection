I can't seem to find an entry for the deli side and it needs to be stated that it is fantastic! We ordered the cured meat platter, bruschetta with zucchini and the special lobster ravioli. I have never had bread so delicious or types of cured meats so savory.  The lobster pieces in the ravioli were huge and REAL. The pasta seemed a touch too dente but definitely didn't take away from the dinner. After the great meal, we sidled next door to try the gelato since it seemed to be a popular spot. Wowzers, we now know why, it was so good. This will be our new local spot for real Italian made in house.
