Came out for the grand opening of Gen and I was not disappointed! The wait was about 30 min for a party of 4 but I gave my phone number and waited for a text while I wandered through the mall. When we were seated the service was great and prompt. The ayce dinner was $19.99 the cuts of meat were flavorful and they changed the grill often so the meat did not stick. I will definitely be back.
