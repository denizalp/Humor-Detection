We eat at this hot pot place last night. The price is on the high side once you add the cost of the soup. Theres no free option for a regular soup like other places. Then you have to add cost of drinks as well. If you pay cash, they give you a free oyster for each person. Thats the only good part of the dinner. After that, everything went down hill. The food quality is average or even below average. That's for both meat and veggies. I can buy better food from supermarket. And most of us had a bad stomach the next day,  that's out of eight persons. This place is bad quality and overpriced. Will not come back. Pretty sure this place won't last. Many better hot pot place in the area.
