First, what they do right: their front-counter staff are friendly, fast and informative. The person who did the eye exam was great, too. Where the experience fell apart was during the contacts ordering process. My kid has worn contacts for years. Being told she needed to wear trials, an added expense and delay, didn't make sense. I was then handed off to a succession of people who excelled in saying \"no\" while remaining clueless about customer service.\n\nWhen I asked to pay for the exam and leave with the contacts prescription I was told no. Pressing for a reason I received vague responses that it was not done. In the end I left frustrated. To make amends they didn't charge for the exam. \n\nA little later I went to another optometrist. There I learned there is an Arizona statute requiring optometrists to verify a contacts prescription by first fitting a patient with trials. \n\nI tried America's Best because I'd heard they were fast. Maybe. But they need some help with their policies, procedures.
