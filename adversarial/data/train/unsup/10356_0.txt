We decided to FINALLY check out Red Rock National Conservation Area  recently when they were offering free admission(couple days before the government shutdown)\n\nThis is a must do whether you live here or visiting(There are TONS of things to do here outside of the strip you know!?) Great way to start your day hiking, biking, or just doing the drive and taking in the beautiful scenery...absolutely breathtaking!\n\nAdmission is $7, but you're better off getting the annual $30 pass which is a sweeter deal. Don't forget to stop in at the visitor center to see more exhibits, and purchase items from the gift shop inside. The volunteers inside are also very helpful with any questions you may have.\n\nIf you can manage to pull yourself away from the tables, secondhand smoke, and slot machines, take a drive up to Red Rock Canyon. Your wallet will thank you.....ALOHA!!!
