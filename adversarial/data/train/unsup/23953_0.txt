Yaaayy for the great mom and pop establishment.  The yelpers posted some amazing pics and that brought me in-in addition to the fabulous choice menu items which featured some gourmet specialties like arugula goat cheese and mushroom frittata...mmmm\n\nThe little cafe was busy and we found a small table but menus and coffee were not brought out as quickly as I hoped since only one waitress was buzzing around to try and take care of several tables. A little more ventilation would have been good too but it's a small place and the kitchen ain't very far.\n\nOur waitress was very friendly and the food was very very good. We had some yummy thick sliced flavorful french toast and our kiddos shared some yummy baked fluffily blueberry pancakes. The bacon was crispy and yummy and the coffee was hot and fresh.\n\nSince my sister lives in this historic neighborhood-I'm always supportive of these wonderful little eateries that serve up fabulous one-of a kind dishes and the next time I'm in town I'll stop by for more dishes to try.\n\nWy-Knot eat here? Do it!
