This is a great café. This is even more true given that there is nothing else in the neighborhood that can claim to be a true café. Their espressos and lattes are very good, as it should be.\n\nRegarding the food, you can expect the standard café fare of sandwiches and croissants, which are definitely worthy, but for evenings, they also have a selection of hot meals. While the selection is limited to 4-5 choices, the food is always good and homely, with always a special touch that makes it deserve an extra grade.\n\nThe beer, available on tap, is from local brewery Saint-Ambroise, which is a big plus for me. The atmosphere and service is great and kid-friendly as well.\n\nThey sometimes have the TVs on, when I would prefer some musical background, but they do show the Habs' games on evenings, so I can't complain too much about the presence of the TV's in the first place.
