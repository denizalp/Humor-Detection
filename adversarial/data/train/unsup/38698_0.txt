Haven't been here since they have opened, and when they did open the customer service was fantastic! Friendly, tentative and smiles. \n\nToday... was a different story for this visit. I had ordered pickup from Yelp. When picking up my order, I genuinely not expecting lack luster customer service from this place what so ever. \n\nI walk in and stand near the cash register to pick up my order. Female employee just stares at me, as if I'm cutting the line ? Not asking what I'm there for until, she finally had to walk over to the register to assist a customer pay. Her aura was salty af, like relax! I'm only here to pick up my order, not rob the place!\n\nAfter 5-7 minutes of waiting to finally get my pizzas, and the manager (owner?) calls me over. Goes through the motions to show me my pizzas to make sure they are correct. They were correct except for one pizza was a different customers. No big deal, they had the correct pizza done already just need to switch it out. \n\nWRONG! The manager thought it was a big deal! He begins scolding a male employee in front of me. \"You guys suck, like seriously watch these pizzas better!\" \n\nI'm all for coaching your employees, but.... probably should coach the right employee (that employee didn't prep my order!) and two, probably shouldn't be such a jerk? about it. \n\n3 stars for the food 2 for the whack customer service.\n\nReplace your manager or whatever the heck that man was. I'm positive the customer service is lacking, because of his leadership skills.
