I honestly would give this place 5 stars, but only had a burger, which was silly! They also provided a ghost pepper aioli which was solid and added the right amount of kick. \n\nThese guys know what they are doing and have a great staff on hand. Cool bar to grab a cocktail, with an awesome selection of Bourbon. \n\nWill be heading back for sure!
