Last time I went to this place with my homies. My baby started to cry so bad because he haven't see my sister for a long time. Their female owner started to approach our table and suggest us to take our baby out just chilling for a second. Personally I am not asshole. I recognize the problem and took my baby out; when we come back my baby started to cry again. But I tried to say sorry to my neighbor diners and they understand the situations. So we plan on finish the meal sooner or later. BUT the PROBLEM is their male owner approaches us immediately and say YOU GUYS OUT!!!! I M like WTF!!! FUCK this stupid Korean fucking owner!!! We won't come to this place any more. No offense to Korean guys* worst dinning experience ever in my life. Hope they bankrupt soon!!! And the food taste very normal. Does not worth the prices at all!!!
