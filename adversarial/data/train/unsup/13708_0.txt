After reading Rand's review about a month ago, I just I knew had to check this place out! I stopped by Monday after work with a list of items I'd like to try (I looked at their menu online before coming in). I ordered way too much for my husband & I, but it was my 1st time so I had to try a lil bit of everything. I got the following: shrimp ceviche tostada, carne asada burrito, carne asada tacos w\/a side of rice & beans, cheese quesadilla (flour tortilla), carne asada quesadilla (corn tortilla, handmade!) \"estilo del rey\" style (meaning it's topped with cheese, sour cream & cilantro) & lastly a slice of chocoflan for dessert. \n\nI had the tostada, burrito & carne asada quesadilla (over the course of 3 meals, btw) & all were excellent! Although, instead of shrimp I received chicken. It was still delicious but I was excited to try the shrimp, next time. The burrito had a lil kick to it & the meat was seasoned perfectly. The quesadilla was beyond amazing, I don't think I can ever eat a quesadilla again w\/out getting it \"estilo del rey\" style, freakin yum! My hubby had the tacos, cheese quesadilla & half of my burrito. He thoroughly enjoyed everything & made 2 meals out of it. The chocoflan was chocolate cake topped w\/a thick layer of flan. I didn't really care for the flan topping but the cake was tasty, super moist! \n\nTotal for all that food was about $33, which I find totally reasonable. I can say that this is one of the top places for Mexican in Phoenix. I can't wait to return & try all the other yummy things they have to offer!
