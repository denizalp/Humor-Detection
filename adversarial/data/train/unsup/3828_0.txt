The grand opening of Liberty Wildlife's new location was on November 19th. The facility is absolutely stunning. Everything was built to spec from the ground up and the width and breadth of what they hope to accomplish here is amazing. In addition to providing wildlife rescue and rehabilitation, the new facility will also include an expanded education program with a classroom for kids, an amphitheater for events, and some research studies working with SRP. The new flight cages are gigantic for short and long term residents to be able to fly and stretch their wings, and they are even hoping to increase the population of some endangered native fish species with a breeding program for their pond.\n\nI've volunteered and worked with the dedicated staff here for years and I am truly proud to say that I am a part of this wonderful organization. It's been a long time coming, but they have the facility that they deserve. Here's to many years of wildlife education and rehabilitation in Arizona!
