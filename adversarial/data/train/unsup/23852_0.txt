This place is situated in a strip mall that surrounds Bashas'.  Is this Chandler or what?  I thought it was Queen Creek.\n\nHaving been looking for someplace new to have lunch, I remembered seeing this place in passing and thinking, \"Bistro..?\".\n\nWell, yes, it's not a bistro.  It is, in fact, a standard Chinese restaurant.  But one thing seems to be pretty certain with these types of places,....lunch specials.  It's really hard to go wrong with a lunch special.\n\nConsidering the proximity of Hong Kong Bistro to my place of work (BFE) along with the relative affordability and efficiency I experienced, I'm giving this place a big fat four star rating.  It was mad decent, as the kids say (or said maybe three years ago).  \n\nIt was also mad empty with only two or three other groups of patrons.\n\nI like my Chinese hostesses\/cashiers to be a little more adamant and curt.  I like it when they direct me to where I'm going to sit without any second thought or consideration to where I'd like to be placed.  I expect them to immediately take my order and then sigh or roll their eyes when I ask for a brief moment to look over the menu.  \n\nUnfortunately, this wasn't the case here.  The hostess was extremely pleasant.\n\nShe asked me if I was ready to order and I told her that I was but then said \"Well, I have a couple questions.\"  I didn't really have questions but just wanted to see what she would do.\n\n\"All of our entrees are made with white meat,\" was the answer I received when I asked about a particular chicken dish.\n\nIn the end, I ordered Gang Pang Chicken because it sounded funny almost like Gang Bang Chicken but really, it was surprisingly good.  It's like General Tso Chicken minus the broccoli plus jalapenos.  Pretty freaking rad.\n\nI never order drinks outside of hot tea and water because yes, I'm a cheap bastard.  The waitress kept both filled to the brim.  Awesome.\n\nWhen all was said and done, I paid $6.50 and dropped a two dollar tip because I felt it was worthy. \n\nI'll probably come back sometime.
