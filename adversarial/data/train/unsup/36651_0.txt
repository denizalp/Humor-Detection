My mouth is watering right now just thinking about this amazing culmination of my two favorite foods! Chinese\/Japanese and Mexican. Unbelievable. It is for sure one of those have to try it before you die kind of experiences. \n\nI first heard about Chino Bandito from Diner, Drive-Ins and Dives, Guy kind of good at find those amazing little hold in the wall, mom and pop, ghetto looking food heavens! :-) \n\nWhen you get there is doesn't look like much from the outside, or inside for that matter, just a bit of a step up from a Filly-B's. But the experience and food makes up for it ten fold! One of the best parts is the tasting they walk you through if it is your first time, or if you just need more help figuring out what flavor you are craving that day. They will give you 6 or so tastes from the menu, and explain any of the others that sound good. Then they turn you loose to come up with any concoction you can imagine; Terriaki chicken and fried rice in a burrito, carnitas over white rice, sweet and sour chicken in a quesadilla with a side of re-fried beans, emerald chicken (chicken with this amazing pesto type sauce) and black beans and rice..... I could go on and on. \n\nThey also have the most delicious cookies for dessert. You gotta check this place out. If you are on the other side of town, trust me it is worth the drive!
