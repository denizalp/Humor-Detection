We were really excited to try this new breakfast place, but never got the chance to eat there.  We arrived on a busy Saturday morning, and joined the line to seated.  There were plenty of employees and places to sit,  but no one was acting as host\/hostess.  We really should of cut our losses there, but we waited.  We finally were seated, and  for 10 minutes with no server, or anyone acknowledging us.  It was strange.   As we looked around only 1 table out of 10 or so had food.  We gave up and left.  I am not sure if the staff wasn't trained properly or there was no manager directing people. There was a bunch of staff but they weren't really helping anyone.  We really wanted to try this place out, but the lack of service made it not possible.
