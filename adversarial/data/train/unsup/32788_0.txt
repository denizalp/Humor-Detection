This is my new nail place to go! When I walked in it was quiet busy but the staff were very nice, I went in to get my acrylics  filled in and replaced. The workers were very professional and made my nails look so natural it's great! It's just a fun place to go get your nails done and the price is pretty good too. Lovely experience will definitely come back again :)
