I had the happy hour special, bacon cheese burger. Good stuff!  \nThe bacon was smoked just right. The two onion ring sides were delicious. Ordinarily, I think it's rather pricey, so happy hour Wednesdays are good for the budget.\n\nThe service was mixed - I'll write off our slightly rude waitress until I go there again to see if there is something systemic.
