I visited at 9 am on a Saturday morning for breakfast with my God-daughter (who loves Spam) along with her mom and sis.  I've heard some great things from foodie friends of how some of my favorite foods from Filipino and Korean dishes are fused perfectly with traditional American breakfast and lunch.  That kind of reminds me of Marvel Team Up comic books back in the day.\n\nService: 4.5\/5 Our waitress was very friendly and attentive from beginning to end.  She answered all the questions from two high energy girls with much patience and a smile.  I direct messaged the business on yelp for a reservation request and got an immediate confirmation and response. Sweet..\n\nFood: 5\/5  Interesting and very tasty dishes on the menu.  Great fusion dishes offerings for breakfast and I went with The Seoul Benny: Two scallion pancakes topped with kim chi, pickled radish, Korean short rib, two poached eggs & hollandaise sauce.  The ingredients tasted high quality, fresh and was cooked perfectly.  I was especially happy with how the poached eggs and Korean Short Rib complimented each other.  Great vision.\n\nValue: 5\/5 Tasty dishes prepped with high quality ingredients for under $20 or slightly over is what I look for in value.  When I find it, you know i'll be back.  Definitely be back here for lunch soon, ijs.\n\nAmbiance: 4\/5 A very small restaurant that looks like a long wait is inevitable if the timing is wrong.  The tables are spaced perfectly and I enjoyed the over sized plates our breakfast entrees came out in.  Very foodie friendly, I dig it.\n\nSummary: I often tell my friends that the Vegas Valley has low key transformed itself into a foodie mecca.  The celebrity chefs and restaurants on the strip are great but it's restaurants like Served that is the catalyst for this transition.  When you're getting interesting, high quality dishes around the $20 range, there's definitely competition compression with higher end restaurants.  The Free market keeps everyone honest and on their game, watch out!\nQuote from the 2004 movie -You got served\n\"Y'all just mad. Because today, you suckers got served, Served, SERVED, SERVED!
