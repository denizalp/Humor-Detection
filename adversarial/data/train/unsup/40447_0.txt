I have been to this facility twice and I haven't had a good experience either time... I scheduled a pedicure and they ran 30 minutes late so I decided to leave. It is not a very relaxing environment either. I tried them out again for an eyebrow wax and I told the lady not to trim or do the top of the eyebrow and she did both of these after clearly stating I did not want them done twice... I will not be going back
