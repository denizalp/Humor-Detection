We had reservations for brunch at 10:30 and were seated immediately next to the cutest fireplace facing the mountains. Our server was fantastic and very attentive. He was very knowledgeable about the menu and gave great suggestions. I had the parfait with fruit and bread from the starters menu. The parfait was incredible. It had strawberries, blueberries, bananas, granola and fresh honey. That was my favorite. The fruit was nice with cantaloupe, grapes, pineapple and honeydew. The bread was ok but a bit dry. I preferred the roll basket they gave at the beginning with the sticky rolls, a scone, and a croissant.\n\nThe grounds and atmosphere were beautiful. We explored a bit after and found it was set up for a wedding. I had to share a picture of the cute getaway Jeep!
