Really getting sick of being charged $1 for a towel the size of a wet nap for the occasional time I forget to bring mine. I've bought like 5 or 6 of these things by this point. I understand it's a rule to bring one in and I accept that, but the fact of the matter is that as I look around less than half of the people in here have a towel right now. So why do I get lucky enough to have my card in file charged but none of these people?? Why am I singled out?? I will keep a couple in the car from now on but I certainly don't appreciate an unfair policy and business practice that penalizes some while leaving others alone.\n\n\n2 stars
