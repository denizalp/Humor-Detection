It's been a while since either of us have been to Lawry's, so my fianc√© chose this for an early Valentine's Day dinner. I'm not really a fan of prime rib so I went with the Lawry's Ribeye Steak dinner. It was cooked to a nice medium and more than enough for me; Mel had to finish it for me.  I ordered the 14 oz. boneless meal that comes with the Famous Original Spinning Bowl Salad, scalloped potatoes, and crispy fried onions.  Between the bread and butter, the salad, and my drink (Pimm's Cup), I was too full for dessert.  Our server, Andrea, was very attentive throughout the meal and, overall, it was a very delicious meal to celebrate another year of love together ---ewwww, mushy!  The end.
