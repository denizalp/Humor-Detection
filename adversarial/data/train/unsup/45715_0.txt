Found this hidden gem by accident and so glad we did, I understand why it's so highly rated on Yelp, Facebook, and Google. Friendly staff who make you feel welcome and go out of their way to ensure a good experience. Food is phenomenal. We had a burrito with rice and beans meal and the 3 taco meal -pork and chicken. Good size portions, delicious authentic food, good price and great staff. Definitely will be back!
