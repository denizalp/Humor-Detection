\"Hi, my name is Mike and I'm addicted to ramen\"\n\nSince my last review I'd been back here more than 10 times.  Have I got sick of yet you may ask?  Only one time because it was my third visit three days in the row, but other than that no.  Hell no, I'm not sick of it yet.  My eyes still light up when i tell people about their Tonkotsu Ramen.\n\nI'm still clueless why they use a different noodles for their Tonkotsu, and Miso and Shoyo.  The Miso and Shoyo Ramen has the ramen noodles while the Tonkotsu has this.. noodle.. lol. Just roll with the punches because it can't be explain!  \n\n*side note* sit  at the counter next to the fan by the door.  It gets pretty warm in there.\n\n*side note 2*  They finally stock up on a togo containers.  If you order a ramen to go, they separate all the ingredients for you with saran wrap which is a really time consuming for them but a really nice touch for you.  I love little gestures like that.  All you have to do is cook the noodles for a min in a pot of boiling water, and put it together in a bowl.  Make it look pretty by strategically assigning all the ingredients to their rightful positions, so Monta's effort does not go in vain.  You'll be doing your eyes and stomach a huge favor -;]
