If you're looking to score some great deals, AZ Mills is the place to be! It never fails, I ALWAYS leave this mall with something in hand! It is also a great place to keep kids entertained with various activities throughout the mall, SEA LIFE Aquarium, Rainforest Cafe, and they're building a LEGOLAND that should open this April! They have also revamped their food court with better, local options. I know that I will be back soon!
