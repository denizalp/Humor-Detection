Or, María. I'm betting someone somewhere involved with this Roberto's Taco Shop is named María. Let's just say María. Yep: María.\n\nIn A Sentence™ \nDo not -- under any circumstances -- get the maximum permitted twelve [12] dollar tacos on Taco Wednesday and try to eat them yourself. \n\n-----------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­-------------------\n\nI used to live near this Roberto's. (Don't ask.) How is this germane: I used to come here habitually. Never had a problem; however, I also never tried the chicken tacos at all. Fast forward two leap years: I find myself on this side of the valley one night and I figure why the fuck not. \n\nWell: I'll tell you right here why the fuck not!\n\nYou might end up on your knees begging for, oh forgive me please, when you're a non-theist.  \n\nDon't do it. Don't get the maximum allowed (per customer) dozen dollar tacos and attempt to consume them all. You'll be sorry. You'll also lose more than a dozen U.S. pounds. That's several kilos for those on the world's system.\n\nDon't do it. \n\nGet a burrito or something. \n\nDon't say that no one warned you.\n\n-----------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­-------------------\n\nRating: Two-stars, \"Meh.
