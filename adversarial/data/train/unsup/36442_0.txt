Very decent place for some Vietnamese fare! I've probably been here around 5-6 times now and everytime (regardless of day or time), it's busy.\n\nI always get the Spring rolls, Egg rolls and the Seafood Pho - yes, I know this isn't very adventurous, but I'm happy w\/these items. Alwlays friendly service in a relaxed environment.\n\nWish they would be a little more generous with the condiments - or maybe I'm just a freak who likes a lot of sprouts, cilantro, lime juice\/jalapenos in their Pho? Mmmm...\n\nAll in all - def worth checking out!
