Honestly I'm surprised I haven't written a review for this place already! I'm so glad I found this gem! Especially in a town that lacks authentic Chinese food, and that's saying a lot coming from someone who lives right around the corner of \"Chinatown\"..\n\nBest part? For me anyways, it's that they are open late! (3am) for all the night owls like me, that is perfect! \n\nWhen I'm in the mood for Chinese and not in the mood to look for a \"new\" place (because it can be a hit or miss with some places), I can definitely count on the Joyful house to do the job! Lol\n\nI've had the pleasure of dining in and ordering takeout plenty of times. They do not disappoint! I have never had a bad meal here.. they have a wide selection, huge menu! I've tried quite a few dishes from here and everything has been delicious! From their fried rice to the live seafood, you will definitely enjoy.\n\nPlease do not order your basic Chinese dishes and then complain that it's \"overpriced\", definitely try out their specialty dishes. They always have specials going on. And for the quantity, quality and let's not forget their service the price is more than reasonable.\n\nDo not let the exterior fool you, once you walk inside you'll definitely feel like you're a bit underdressed, which is fine if you don't mind.. it has an upscale vibe, the waiters are in suits\/vests and they are very attentive!\n\nGreat place for the whole family.
