If you're looking for a Dental Office that's far above and beyond your expectations, you are here!  I have a dread fear of Dentistry and have been searching without any luck for four years, since I moved to Charlotte from Long Island, NY.  Finally!!!  I'm in Dental Heaven!  I started last April with Dr. Bunny Yun ( who actually hums a comforting hum while working on my mouth) of My Dentists.  \nFrom the sweetest & most helpful receptionist, to the xray techs, to the cleaning techs, to the adorably, gentle, calming and professional Dr. Yun, even to the compassionate and helpful billing folks (this is a rarity!), I have never been so impressed with a dental practice and feel lucky whenever I go there for Dental Work!  I'm an R.N. and very fussy selecting medical personnel to treat me.\nI have total faith in this practice and am sure that every employee and Dentist here have the same goal in mind:  to treat a patient with respect for her\/his fears in a professional, kind and gentle manner.  I am so thrilled to have found a fantastic group of Dental professionals to provide caringly bordering on lovingly, to my Dental needs!  \nHallelujah!  :0)\nEileen Johnson
