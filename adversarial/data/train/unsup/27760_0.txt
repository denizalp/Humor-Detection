I ordered takeout for this restaurant with the new grabb app. I will mostly be reviewing the restaurant itself, the takeout and service I received. \n\nOn first impression, the restaurant is small and cute. It has limited seating, maybe enough for 16 people.  It's an open kitchen concept with little ventilation. I wouldn't recommend eating in unless you want to smell like oil. Order came out fast, it takes about 5-10 minutes. The cashier or employee who takes the orders looked like she absolutely hated her job. \n\nI ordered a lobster roll ($13.95) and grilled halibut salad ($13.95+$1 for halibut). \n\nFor the price, the lobster roll was good, the bread was very buttery and the portion of lobster was good. I prefer this version of the lobster roll over buster's sea cove. However, the fries were lacking, they were soggy and tasted a little burnt. \n\nThe grilled halibut salad, however was horrible. First of all, I ordered and paid $1 extra to get halibut. However, what came in the box was either cod or mahi mahi as it was extremely dry and fishy. I also requested for the salad to come in a separate box from the fish as I hate when my salad gets wilted and warm. My request was sadly denied. As a result, along my 20 minute drive home, the heat from the grilled fish had made my salad soggy and limp. If you ever come here pass on the salad.
