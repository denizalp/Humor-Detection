Ya know how when one gets a deli sandwich at a deli they pile  the meat two inches high or more n the center and the thickness drops to a millimeter or two around the edge, imparting a sense of over-abundance?\nFridays took a page from that playbook with their new Reuben, but forgot the part where the meat's two inches high in the center. \nIt was two millimeters high under 60% of the bread and trailed off to nothing around the perimeter.\nTo make one think there was actually a meal involved, they made it a triple-decker, and then piled one half-sandwich atop the other for an excellent presentation promising aplenty and if one planned to eat toast, supplying it as well.  If one actually expected a reasonable portion of protein, it was a no-show!  \nOpted for the steakhouse fries over the standard ones for an extra buck, cause it costs more to cut the potato in wedges than to cut it into fries  I guess.\nThe other party's New Orleans shrimp and chicken dish was fine sans the several un-chew-able bits of connective tissue or silver skin that was left in the chicken breast medallions. \nService was quite good, but it seems that leaving one's \"Give Me Stripes\" card out on the table no longer automatically generates the complimentary chips and salsa, nor a query as to whether or not it is desired.  Oh well, no huge loss there.
