I got the Tori Paitan with chicken meat and it was delicious with just a little black pepper added. Large volume of house made noodles and also plenty of chicken meat made this a good deal. Asahi draft beer to wash it down and this is becoming a memorable dining experience. Only drawback is the counter seating on barstools, no table seating. The staff are friendly and helpful with the ordering. I will return here for sure.
