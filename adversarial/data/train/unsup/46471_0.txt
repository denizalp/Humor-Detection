Very disappointing. Hated the remake. Bright cheerful diner now painted mostly black is dark and soulless. \n\nFood. Pretentious and awful. \n\nBurnt toast and only 1 slice. \nBurnt bland potatoes. \nRunny over spiced beans \nEggs drenched in olive oil. \n\nOnly compliments are familiar Bloordale servers and the coffee was good.
