This is possibly the worst pizza I've ever had in my life.  This place just opened up and we got a flyer in the mail and the advertisement looked delicious so we decided to give it a try.  You know when a new joint opens up and they do their best to please and the give extra stuff.  Normally this is how the pizza places are in Vegas.  Super delicious when they open and they gradually get worse and cut back over the years.  \n\nWell Big Daddy Pizza is not going to make it that long I promise you.  I hate to bash a new business but as you can see from the photos I posted of the chicken and pizza.........the quality is horrible.  It reminded me of cafeteria pizza.  There was actually a review of a guy talking  about fresh mushrooms.  \n\nI would like to go Maury Povich on this review and say that was a lie.  I know fresh food when I see it and I'm sure other people do to.  The pizza was super thin as you can see from the picture.  The wings didn't have any meat on them at all.  I went back and looked at the photos posted by the business and the food looked delicious but what arrived at my door step tonight was trying to disguise itself as pizza and wings and didn't pull it off at all.  Well their advertisement worked and I ordered from them but I'm tempted to mail it back and advise them to try again.  The End
