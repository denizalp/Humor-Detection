I ordered a pizza and some wings. They barely put any toppings so it was hard to taste anything but grease. We also ordered wings and when we opened it up, it looked like they had a hard time making the mild sauce stick to it. Just watery boiled wings with a pool of sauce stuck on the bottom of the box it was served in. I don't think we will be coming back.
