I've been wanting to do goat yoga ever since I heard that it had become a thing in Oregon, New Hampshire, and California. I was super happy to see that Goat Yoga Las Vegas existed...but every class was full! Fortunately, they were able to arrange a private event for me and 20 of my friends! Communication through email was excellent and the experience was amazing. My husband came to take photos and videos for us and he said that everyone had a huge smile on their face the whole time. The yoga instructor and the gentleman who transported the goats were super friendly and accommodating. My party loved every bit of this experience! Thank you!
