There are so many detailed reviews here that my 2 cents is probably only worth 1 - if that.\n\nLoved: as I was reading the menu board, grill guy says \"is it gunna be beef?\" so that he could get my burger started, regardless of my toppings.\n\nLoved: service at the cash, super friendly & genuine. They take your name and when they called out mine, it was more of a familiar \"Chris, dinner is ready!\" rather than a monotone \"next...\"\n\nLoved: the \"plate\", a metal rectangular thing, made the burger look that much better.\n\nLoved: the burger. Really, really did. It was messy, about 4 napkins messy. Awesome. I could taste each and every ingredient. So good.\n\nLoved: the little window seat. I would go back for that seat alone. \n\nNext time: I hear the Onion Rings are killer.\n\nWish: WiFi
