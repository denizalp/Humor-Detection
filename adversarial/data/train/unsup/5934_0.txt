I just witnessed the most unbelievable, disrespectful act I've ever seen. People trying to give out free hugs were rudely told to leave by security. This is what you're all about downtown Summerlin? Only for the money and people paying for booths at the farmers market? This is exactly why people are changing more into what the world is today! Because of acts like this. Shame on you downtown Summerlin!
