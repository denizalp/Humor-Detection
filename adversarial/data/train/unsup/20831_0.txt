Yo......\n\nI love In N Out.  I think they are the most consistent place out there, they are inexpensive, fresh and tasty.  That applies for most of them.....this is only the 2nd time out of probably 100s of times that I have been to an In N Out and was not completely impressed.\n\nI placed my usual order of a Double Double with no tomato, both kinds of onions, and an order of fries.  Had a water to drink.  A little over $5.50.  Service was friendly but the food was \"off\".  My burger was not piping hot....the patties were warm but not hot.  The spread was also \"off\".  I could taste a huge hint of mayo in the spread.  I know its made with mayo but they usually blend\/cut that shit so well with the ketchup and relish, you never even get a hint of mayo taste.  I had more than a few bites with straight mayo taste.  It was not good at all.  The produce seemed a little off too.  The onions had a weird \"bite\" to them.  Besides the Goleta In N Out, this was the worst In N Out Burger that I have had.  The fries were pretty good as usual.  Nothing wrong there.\n\nI'm pretty sure I will not come back to this particular one.  The only reason I came here was that it was the closest In N Out to where I was at the time.  Ill drive a few miles up the road and hit up a different one next time.
