I was shocked. I was on my way to the movies and had some time to kill so I said to myself, \"Frank, you look hungry, why not get something to eat,\" to which I responded, \"yes I am and I think I'll have a taco at Rubios.\" What a mistake.\n\nMy journey began with the group of 3, who you could tell were just feasting on chips and salsa. There meal was followed by an employee giving his friends burritos and a session of \"high 5.\" Got to get that reassurance from the friends. Then 1 pulls out a cigarette, placed it on his lips. A gentleman with his son told the gut not to be a jerk, he laughed and pulled out a lighter to light the cigarette. That's the \"oh, he'll no,\" come out of these lips of mine. \n\nWhat more needs to said. Rubios lost a customer. And by the way, I don't understand how the management let a group of kids alone to close. By the way, I didn't see any guacamole on my tacos and the employee said it's there and had to look for it. Wtf? I did find the guacamole, it was covered by a lot of lettuce and the food was subpar. Enough said
