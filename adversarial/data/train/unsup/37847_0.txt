Was looking for a local mani-pedi on my recent stay in Phoenix and found Beautiful Skin and Nails in a small office park just a few miles from the Biltmore. The manicurists were friendly, funny and efficient. I was in and out on time with a great looking set of nails. Easy on-line booking is a bonus.
