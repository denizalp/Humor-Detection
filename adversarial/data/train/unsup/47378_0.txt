Rubbish service!  Went there to get some bubble tea to go. It was quite late that night when I got there and there was only 3 tables occupied. The waitresses completely ignored me when I was at the counter waiting to order my drink (there's no line up and i was the only one) . They were laughing and playing with the bartenders. \n\nFinally I got to place the order and it took them  more than 30 minutes to prepare my two milk tea, and the orders weren't even right.... I asked one of the girls nicely how come my tapioca was missing and she gave me a dirty look and claimed that I had never asked for it.   \n\nI didn't bother argue with her because at that point I just wanted to get my drinks and leave this place.  \n\nI guess people working at Green Grotto are too busy to serve the customers ( but not too busy chatting with each other). I will definitely not go back there.
