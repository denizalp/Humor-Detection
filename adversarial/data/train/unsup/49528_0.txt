I've been here now several times for lunch during the week since it's very close to my work and it is very good! They have such a good deal for lunch that I get, 1\/2 sandwich, salad, bag of chips and a cookie! I love the variety of the menu. For being a smaller space they have quite a few tables inside and several set up outside. Service is always friendly and fast. I highly recommend this little neighborhood gem!
