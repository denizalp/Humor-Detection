Mus√©e d'Art Contemporain (Museum of Contemporary Art) is less about \"art\" and more about political statements by artists. I guess that's what art really is, but is it always so obvious?\n\nOne artist has pictures of transgender people taken on the dance floor or a bull-dozed nightclub in Mexico. I guess that's art, but at a deeper (higher?) level than I'm going to understand. How about a two-foot high wall that's made from the materials of a house that was carefully taken apart over the course of a week?\n\nHere's the caption that accompanies a large bubble machine. \"Installation with machines that produce soap bubbles made with a mixture of (uncontaminated) water and other substances that touched the bodies of victims of violent deaths. Pieces of cloths were moistened with the water used to wash corpses after their autopsies, then were placed at the sides in the desert of Juarez where the remains of murdered women had been discovered.\"\n\nThe one piece I really liked, a series of vertical parallel lines in various colors, \"These bands can be seen as recurring planes that create a vibratory space energized by the multiple potentialities of the placement (and permutation) of the colours.\"\n\nAbove my paygrade, but neat to look at.
