Great sushi place. I came here for lunch and ordered the sashimi bento box. The meal came with lots of sides, included a soup and salad, and was very reasonably priced. The presentation of the food and the quality of the fish was among the best I've seen in a Toronto Japanese restaurant. Not too mention it was delicious. This is nothing like the \"fast food\" sushi places all over town. I felt like I was eating gourmet at a price I could afford. I will be going back.
