More like 3.5 stars for me. We came opening night, which was a Wednesday so it wasn't so crowded. Lots of choices with all the food trucks. It's expensive for the portion of food you get. So I say, don't come here starving unless you're willing to drop a good amount of money. We probably spent $60 at least and we weren't even full. And definitely don't come if you're on a diet. Lots of fried, covered in cheese, dessert type food. Its a good thing to share your food with your group so that you can try more items. The definite favorite was the sisig burrito from White Rabbit and the Dole Pineapple float. \n\nP.S. Print tickets to avoid long lines and don't forget to bring lots of cash.
