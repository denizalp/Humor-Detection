This place would be a perfect if it weren't for the fact that you get treated like a criminal by the security guards. This is my second time to this office and the second time the same guards have treated us like trash. \n\nI'm just here to celebrate my marriage by changing my name, I could care less how long the wait or how crowded the building. This could have been a pleasant experience except for the fact that the staff here act like they are employed at Alcatraz. \n\n#whatsupwiththispicture \n#socialsecurityadministrationsucks\n#getaclue\n#takeachill\n#hellogoverment?
