How many promoters does Wet Republic have? How many of them say its the best party in Vegas? How many of them are correct? Umm, ALL OF THEM! \n\nI had SUCH a great time when I went to Wet Republic. I was celebrating my birthday with Tiesto and didn't have alcohol the rest of the weekend after having my big sister drive me home. That must mean it was a really great time. \n\nWith the exception of Tiesto taking my hat and giving it to some dude, I really enjoyed this venue. The water gets murky really fast but the people (guests and staff) are all super friendly. Shout out to the bartender that gave me the extra shot for my birthday! I also love love LOVE the two water fountains on the side, LOL. I respect a venue that wants to keep their patrons hydrated :)
