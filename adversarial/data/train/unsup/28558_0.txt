I think my bartender was having a bad day.\n\nI have been to Nakama a few times.   I usually meet to discuss business.   This was my least favorite experience at Nakama.    The food was pretty good.   \n\nI just cannot get over the service.  The bartender was short and gave the impression we were putting her out when she took our order.   I agree with some other reviews where the place is not the same when I originally moved here.  \n\nI will get my hibachi \/ sushi fix elsewhere.   There are plenty of options on Carson.  What a shame :-(
