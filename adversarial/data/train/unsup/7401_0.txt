I used to go to Woodbine a lot, after they replaced the old slots with the new ones, everything stopped hitting. Woodbine has become a complete scam. a friend of mine banned himself from woodbine a couple of years ago, but gets in without questioning.  The slots are all rigged and nothing hits. the Keno and video poker slots are the biggest scam. I prefer Fallsview Casino, it never dissappoints.\nI hope a casino will open in Toronto and that shit-hole woodbine will shutdown for good.
