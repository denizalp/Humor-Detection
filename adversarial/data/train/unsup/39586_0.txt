Ok breakfast food. Sadly not many vegan or gluten free options, Vegas restaurants are very much behind that trend. Ordered a breakfast that came with bacon and we asked for a veggie substitute. The chef refused to sub avocado without a 3 dollar charge. Chipotle charges 2 dollars for avocado and we are paying for meat we are not eating. So lame! Customer service fail.
