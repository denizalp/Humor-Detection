Came into the ER with horrible pains, looking for answers. What I got was the worst experience of my life at an ER. I could not walk due to the level of pain I was having, and the only person who offered me a wheel chair was a janitor! I am floored at how awful this staff's bed side manner was. \nI was here for 5.5 hours BEFORE they gave me any results to my tests. If they were so concerned with whether or not I needed emergency surgery, you'd think they'd let me know within AT LEAST 3 hours. My BF got up to ask what the deal was and the results were magically ready right then (YEAH RIGHT). \nMy BF and I heard a conversation between nurses saying \"your mad I don't give you rooms, and now that I do your mad at me still.\" So which is it? Are you guys packed to the brim and that's why you kept me here so long or are you NOT??\nWhen I called today to clarify why I was told I had an issue by the doctor verbally (I have a witness), but that result on paper said \"normal,\" The head of the Nursing staff literally asked me why I didn't ask when I was here. Hmm, maybe its because I was administered heavy painkillers? (I also don't appreciate the attitude I was given during this phone call). \nI was also charged for an EKG test that when it was being done, the person doing it was saying \"oh this isn't working.\" Why was I charged if you couldn't do it right?\n\n!!Don't come here if you can avoid it!!! I experienced some of the most jaded, uncaring, and unhelpful group of people I have ever met.
