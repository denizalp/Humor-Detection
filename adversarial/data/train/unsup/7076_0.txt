My perspective is that of a business traveler, attending a conference, and a non-gambler. I stayed at THEhotel. So that said...\n\nPros:\n\n- Not trying to be Venice (like the Venetian) or Rome (like Caeser's Palace). You're a freaking hotel in the middle of the desert. Don't pretend to be something else that you'll never be.\n\n- Rocking good Tuna Nicoise salad from room service.\n\n- Nice gym.\n\n- Nice suites.\n\n- Nice chair, desk for banging out email.\n\n- Ethernet cable for reliable connection.\n\n- Well-stocked bathroom and closet. (Soaps, shampoo, sewing kit, iron...)\n\n- Fairly quiet.\n\n\nCons:\n\n- (Branding geek alert) Capitalizing THE everywhere -- THE hotel, THE wedding chapel -- falls flat and seems contrived. Almost as if their marketing department said, \"hey, we want to be cool like the W Hotel, who incorporate the letter \"w\" into signs and services in clever ways. The W pulls it off since it was pretty clever when it came out. Slapping THE isn't clever, and comes off as lame. \n\n- Minibar has Bud Light. Seriously folks, if you're gonna charge me an arm and a leg for an adult beverage, make it something that deserves to be called \"beer\".\n\n- Room service timing is random. When I ordered the aforementioned Tuna Nicoise after a workout, they said, \"it'll be 60-75 minutes sir\". I reluctantly agreed. Then the guy came 20 minutes later. Thankfully I was out of the shower by then. \n\n- The next day, I ordered breakfast, and got the same 60-75 minute estimate. Having a meeting 60 minutes later, I skipped this. Protip: when running a hotel, assume that a certain percentage of your guests actually eat breakfast and order room service, and staff up accordingly.\n\n- I got breakfast at THEcafe (those names...) and paid $15 for a \"build it yourself\" bagel, which I had the pleasure of eating at a dirty table. Oh, and the receipt prompted me to tip them for the privilege. THEannoyance...
