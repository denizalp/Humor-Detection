This was one of the worst experiences I've ever had a Beauty school before. I was here about 3 months ago and gave then 5 stars but I will NEVER go back to this place. The most unprofessional atmosphere. I went for a haircut that ended up taking 2.5 hours for a HAIRCUT! Absolutely ridiculous. I get it'll take a little longer because it's a school but 2.5 he's is absurd. Especially b\/c the girl cutting my hair was literally gossiping the entire time. She was so busy talking with her friends she cut a giant chunk of hair off up by my ear!!! My hair goes to the middle of my back. I literally had to tell her to \"stop!\" Not only were the students a joke but the instructors were even worse. One of them grabbed my face and pushed my head to side then made a joke out of it. Just because I'm in a school doesn't mean you can man handle my face without asking. I want to cry when I think about my haircut, it's terrible I will never go back to this place. Aveda Institute is 100 times better and cheaper. My hair is ruined, the students are a complete joke. And the instructors are even worse. This place should be closed down. Its sad that people consider that a school.
