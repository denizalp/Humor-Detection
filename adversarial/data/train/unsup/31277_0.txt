This place is on point. I'll be back again and again. It's finally open after many weeks of renovations (used to be Therapy Cafe). Usually a new restaurant has many kinks to work out but I must say they seem to have their act together. Staff is super friendly and knowledgeable. Met the owner - nice guy! I've had the Meatball Sub and the Rachael (like a Ruben but with turkey instead of corned beef). Both were EXCELLENT. All sandwiches come with a side and a fountain drink for under $10.
