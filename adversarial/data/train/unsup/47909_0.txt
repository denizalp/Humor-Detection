Sushi samba nailed it!! From the hostess podium, to the bar, to our server, to the food, this place was trendy, fun, classy and the food was epic. \n\nWe arrived at the Palazzo on a busy Thursday night (Super Bowl weekend in Vegas) and were able to wait for 30 mins at the bar waiting for our table. Cool decor and fun atmosphere. Bartender named Rico was friendly and helpful and came up with a special concoction for us to drink. Hostess staff was warm, not snobby. Once seated,\nour waitress was also amazing and recommended some really incredible dishes to us, even explaining what took longer\ntimesq to cook, what would come out faster, etc. The food itself is simply incredible. My taste buds were exploding. Some of my favorites were the sea bass skewers, the filet mingnon robata w asparagus and the amazing SÃ£o Paulo sushi roll! Paired with some Nigori sake, it was one of the best meals I've ever had.\n\nLooking around, the place was filled with fun groups and beautiful people. It had a fun vibe and was a great place to people watch, have a date, or have a group gathering. It didn't have that snobby elitist feeling some nice and trendy places do. Btw - don't come here in your t shirt and ratty sweats. Grab a dress or throw on nice nice slacks :)\n\nWell done Sushi Samba. We will be back again.
