Prior to writing my review for Primanti Bros., I put on my helmet, tooth guard, started my car and prepared to run away once the angry hordes of Pittsburghers read my review...Why you ask?   Get ready for it....deep breath...\n\nI...don't...like...Primantis...\n\nGasp!  Choke!  Faint!\n\nYes, yes, I know.  As a born and bred Pittsburgher, I am committing blasphemy by admitting I don't like Primantis.  I don't like their sandwiches, I don't like their nachos, I don't like their soups, salads, wings or fries.  I find the whole idea of a sandwich containing 3,000 calories worth of Italian bread, cole slaw, meat, and fries just too over the top.  The fries are a soggy mess, the slaw has too much vinegar, the meats are cheap, and the bread is...well the bread is actually ok.\n\nI know it's a Pittsburgh institution and it even served a very pragmatic purpose back in the day, but now it's just kitsch that gets the city featured on Food Network on occasion.  I've eaten there numerous times and have done my Pittsburgh duty of taking all out of towners to the (in)famous Primanti's, but always with the caveat that, \"It's not that good.\" and usually an apology afterward.\n\nSo there you have it.  I do feel like a giant weight has been lifted off of my shoulders.  I no longer have to carry around my terrible, terrible secret.
