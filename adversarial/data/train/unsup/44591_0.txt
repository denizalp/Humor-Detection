This was my first Las Vegas buffet, and I was expecting to be wowed. However, I was not. I think I was expecting more artful presentation and exotic flavors; I got some good flavors and generic presentation. The food was good, not great, and their vegetarian options are dull.\nPerhaps my opinions will change after I've experienced a few more buffets.
