Downgrading my review from a year ago. The food is okay but not as good as it used to be for the money spent. The presentation was also not as nice as I remember. The staff seems ungracious and uncaring for diners and each other.   The menu seemed changed from a year ago when they featured many Italian seafood options.\n\nWe did use Yelp reservations for our dinner for the first time and and the reservation reminders proved very helpful to our busy lives.
