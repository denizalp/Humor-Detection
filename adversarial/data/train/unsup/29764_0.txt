DYI FROYO is experiencing the biggest boom the restaurant industry has seen since the Sushi craze of the early 2000s. \n\nThere are dozens of players entering the FROYO game right now, but ultimately only a few will manage to differentiate themselves and survive the icy onslaught of competition and consolidation.  Mark my word that  Yogurty's FROYO will be among the survivors. It's Canadian ownership heritage may even help it topple arch American FROYO rival Menchie's for the title of Canada's favourite FROYO, \n\nTheir FROYO bases (Oreo Cookie, Birthday Cake, Salted Caramel) are among the best tasting and most inventive I've seen, plus their topping selection (everything from cheesecake and cookie dough to glazed pecans and mango balls) is second to none.\n\nYogurty's is easily Canada's cream of the FROYO crop.  Fill up your cup. Grab a spoon.  Dig on in. \n\n-SZ
