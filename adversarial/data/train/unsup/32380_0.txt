Four people within 2 weeks mentioned this place and one of them had seen it on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives..so Ive been dying to check it out. Today was the day. We arrive and it's in a little strip mall in an area that I have never had to drive through to go anywhere.Meaning  had it not been for word of mouth I would have never known this place existed! They ask if it's your first time and when you say yes they proceed to give you samples of their top dishes. I ordered a combo: Black beans, jerk fried rice, pollo diablo and emerald chicken. I can't even explain the flavor explosion that erupted. Emerald Chicken cannot be beat, it was dare I say orgasmic. In addition to the flavor fiesta you get a free freakin big ass doughy cookie!! A Snickerdoodle was this weeks cookie...not many even know what a Snickerdoodle is let alone make the best Snickerdoodle ever to be devoured. This place is beyond words! Just go..GO NOW!
