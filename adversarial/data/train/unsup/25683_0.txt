You need to chill and have drinks but you're hungry..., this is your spot. The wings are freakn bomb, the drinks Freakn Delicious, and the atmosphere Supa chill. Big group or just with yr 'date' it will start or end the night right. Love the pit style seats in the bar, nice comfy sofas and the hostesses are very nice always checking in with their guests. They have TV screens in all areas.
