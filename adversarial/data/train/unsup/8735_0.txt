I was browsing different sports shop to find a headgear but nothing seems to be what I wanted.  Luckily, my good buddy referred me to OTM fight shop.  I am so glad he did.  Here are the highlights.\n\n1.) Staff was great.  She is friendly and knowledgeable.  She helped me find the right headgear that is light and comfy for me.  Not only that, she noticed that I was rockin' in my Yelp Elite watch.  I love her already!  Then we went on to talk about yelp and how to become an elite...the best conversation of the day.  She rocks big time in my book.\n\n2.) Check in to yelp, you get 15% off or a handwrap.  How awesome is that!  Because my headgear cost 80 bucks, I chose the 15%.  Yep, that's the Asian in me calculating for the better deal.  \n\n3.) Variety of boxing\/mma gear, as compared to any other fight shop that I've seen.\n\nI will definitely come back to OTM for my fighting gear.  Highly recommend!
