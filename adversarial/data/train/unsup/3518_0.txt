Seven women without a plan walking down the strip meet two well-dressed club pushers. Jet? What the heck...we'll give it a shot. Where is it? Oh, you're going to escort us? Thank GOD...because trying to get 6 women to follow me, their elected \"leader\", anywhere is like trying to herd cats...but, throw a man in front of them and they'll walk for miles! Thank God again because we never would have found it on our own...after a 5 minute walk winding and turning around corners, we arrived. \n\nMore benefits of being female in Vegas...short wait, no cover, free drinks. The only nasty dancing going on in our immediate vicinity was by the girls up on the poles. One drink later, I was shaking it up there with the young 'uns...my ego was fully gratified by the \"encouragement\" I received back on the dance floor. For about 3 minutes, this 40+ year old whooped some 20 yr old booty! \n\nOther than the liberating moment on the pole, the club was pretty typical...the crowd was a mix of young and slightly older, I can't remember much about the music, but I do remember some 80's tunes with a beat pumped in, and I wasn't mauled much during our time here. \n\nI'd definitely go back...if only for the pole.
