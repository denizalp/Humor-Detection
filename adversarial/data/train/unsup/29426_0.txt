While there are a decent amount of classes and the location is great if you work downtown, there are three huge drawbacks to this Gold's Gym location.\n\n1.)  Cleanliness is a real problem in the locker rooms.  Skip the shower sandals and wear full-on hip waders, because the showers are always disgusting.\n\n2.)  Billing is randomly shady.  If you sign up under a special, read the fine or invisible print because I've never had Gold's honor any deal they may advertise.  In fact, they may just bill you a little extra some month.  If you cancel, make sure to have your cancellation letter notarized and sent under certified mail, because there is a good chance that they will start billing you again well after you've quit.\n\n3.)  Don't bother with the free personal training session.  It'll just be some real swole bro that'll talk you through some sit-ups, and then you find yourself cornered by the trainer desk being grilled, police-style, as to why you won't pay for more personal training.  They will question your personal choices, call you fat to your face, and then shove a contract under your nose while the trainer and his swole boss stand over you until you sign.  \n\nJoin the Y downtown instead.  They have better hours, a cleaner facility, nice trainers, and a pool.
