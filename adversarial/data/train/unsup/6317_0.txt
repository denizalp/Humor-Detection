Well let's see it is 4:25 am so it was yesterday I went to Mazie's for lunch with a couple of friends. \n\nHad not been before, but will go back. \n\nI like the brightness of the place and easy seating. It is not cute or pretty but rather haphazard in style. \n\nI had the bluburger and a cup of split pea soup, oh and french fries. \n\nThe soup, if it had been placed in front of me and I did not know what It was, split pea would not have come to mind. Oh do not get me wrong, it was very tasty and I enjoyed all the same. It was sweet and that in it self is odd for split pea. It has a variety of ingredients one usually does not find. Although I would order it again because as I said, it was good. \n\nThe burger was cooked as I ask and was just fine. The Blue cheese was a bit weak in flavour. I did not have to spit it out so I was just spiffy doodle. \n\nI was told the fries were good. Were they, or were they just salty. I am not sure, but then again I am not a french fry person for the most part. \n\nThe water was fab. \n\nThe service was slow, for us anyway. Three sets of folks came well after us and were half through their meals when we got ours. My eating mates noticed this more than I and were rather put off about it. I on the other hand just did not care. \n\nI suspect I will be back at some point in time. Assuming both Mazie's and I survive the future. \n\nBelow it is asking if this place is good for kids. I say a resounding NO, keep your stinky noisy kids away from me. \n\nIt is also asking about take out, yes take the kids out. \n\nAnd as for attire, please be kind and dress. Few of us could show up naked and still be able to hold the food down. \n\nI think I am done.
