Think Hooters meets Chilis, and you will get a sense of Pink Taco. \n\nThis is a formula restaurant that try's to appeal to young men who drink a lot and like Mexican food, and the young woman who are GFs, wives, or looking to be either that follow the men here. Just like hooters is an Owl, Pink Taco is an actual taco dish and not a sexual innuendo. (Yeah, right!) \n\nThis is the first location, inside the Hard Rock Casino and Hotel, established in 1999, followed by Scottsdale, AZ and this year in Los Angeles, CA. They are planning to open in San Diego and Huntington Beach in the near future, but had problems with the name  in trying to open up a second Scottsdale location. (They should have tried Tempe!) \n\nThe food isn't bad, actually, and the all female hostess\/wait staff doesn't wear pink shorts and t-shirts like you would find in Hooters. \nThe food is better than Hooters, which isn't saying a lot. I tried the chicken and cheese enchiladas, which came with finely shredded chicken stuffed into 3 enchiladas, and covered with half green and half red sauce (my choice) and covered with baked cheese. Rice and beans came on a side plate, all for $12.50 during lunch. Chicken Tostada was $10.75, and the Steak Burrito was $12.25. Soft drinks were $3.00 \n\nThis could be a fun place to go with your friends when a little drinking and humor are perhaps more important than the food you eat. My buddies come here to sit on the patio and see the hottie and groupie wannabees in their bikinis sun bathing by the pool, while thinking of eating a Pink Taco.
