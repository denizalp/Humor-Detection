Five stars for the food, and service! Kamasutra just doesn't offer a full 5 star experience, but I can't say there is anything specific that makes it drop a star.  Kamasutra is a Bayview and Eg shining star. Although there are several reasons to head up there, the fact that more than a few blocks away you won't find any more independent restaurants is key.  \nIn my attempt at low-carb, low fat (yeah right at an Indian resto), I got the tandoori salmon.  My table mates got the tandoori chicken and a vegetable curry- spicy! The tandoori dinners are massive, fist-sized, lumps of protein coated in a light spiced yogurt marinade. The fish was unbelievably delicious and the chicken, I am told was equally good. The waiter was a joy and didn't interrupt our conversation and brought out a free garlic naan to share as we waited for our tandoori specialties.  \nDrinks were decent, and they have a full bar, including decent wine selection.  The seats were super comfortable along the banquet with Indian silk-covered pillows. I loved this place and would happily return to see the waiters and eat the food next time I'm in the 'hood.
