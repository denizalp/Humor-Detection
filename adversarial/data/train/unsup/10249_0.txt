Chop chop chop chop!\n\nMy friends and I arrived here around ~12:30 and were seated right away, with the choice of the patio or inside. We chose the latter under the shade of an umbrella. We ordered the fried vermicelli, deep fried tofu (which came with a chili sauce), sweet and sour pork, pork and chive dumplings, and green onion pancake. The dumplings were super crispy on the outside and just perfect inside, super flavourful and was even more delicious with soy sauce! The fried vermicelli EXCEEDED my expectations as I thought it was going to be the typical bland noodles but wow I really enjoyed it. The deep fried tofu smelled a little funny but we realized it was the garbage truck beside us - THEY DON'T SERVE STINKY TOFU AS MUCH AS I'D LIKE TO TRY IT! Everything was all in all delicious and I would totally return to try their other types of dumplings. I highly recommend that if you come with a group of friends, you order many dishes so everyone can have a little bit of everything.\n\nThe drink menu is pretty sweet too, I got soy milk which I rarely get the opportunity to have in other restaurants. Service was excellent as well with a super attentive server. I would recommend Chop Chop for quality Taiwanese food!
