Enjoyed an amazing dinner last night before the Rod Stewart concert! We were greeted by Pete Gomez, asst. GM, like we were friends. He Patrice, the GM and the entire staff were amazingly friendly, attentive and accommodating! The food was delicious, martinis were perfectly chilled and service was top notch without any pretentiousness. Exactly the experience you should receive when dining at such a high end establishment, thank you for the memorable experience!
