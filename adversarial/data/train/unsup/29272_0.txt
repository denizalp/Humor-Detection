I love this place! I don't really write reviews but I had to for Lucki Thai. They're really clean and know how to take care of you! I've never had a poor experience, everyone that works here is so friendly!! The Panang Curry and Phad Thai are my favorite. Oh and did I mention super fast! Also I love how they're conscious about keeping your water glass full. They're seriously the best!!!
