As much as I try to avoid fast food, sometimes I get in the mood for McDonalds.  Their fries just go really well with ketchup and most of their burgers don't have mayo on them so I don't have to ask them to hold it.  The burgers come with a great mixture of mustard and ketchup and the cheese is gooey to blend with everything else in the burger.  \n\nThis McDonald's is consistently good.  The food is always hot.  The service is exceptional for a fast food joint and the order takers at the drive through are friendly and my order has always been correct here.   Rarely do I give a fast food joint 4 stars but this one is deserving of it.  \n\nThis restaurant is convenient to I-77 and South Blvd and sits adjacent to a Kangaroo Express.  It's easy in and out since there's a traffic light right there.  \n\nDefinitely one of the better McD's in the area.
