A couple weeks ago we came here blind, chosen randomly from Open Table.  The staff were friendly and professional, the decor is simple but elegant. I had the rotini, and my wife had the linguini, and I had  one of the Dieu Du Ciel beers, Grande Noriceur, which was served in a smallish glass.  My rotini was nicely done, with a good blend of flavours in the sauce and a nice contrast of textures.  The linguini was quite nice, too.  Overall impression was \"pretty good\"... Until we ordered dessert!  We got the Peanut Butter Pie and the Pineapple Walnut Carrot Cake, and it was like discovering buried treasure!  Both of them were beautifully plated, and very good! SO good that I just drove downtown from the NE to get them again as a takeout order!
