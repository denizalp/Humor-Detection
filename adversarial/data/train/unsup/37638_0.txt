Ace car rental is not inside the airport. Their is a second shuttle which takes you to the car rental site. The shuttle driver said it is a free shuttle yet my on my receipt i noticed that they charged me a shuttle fee. The customer service agent I dealt with told me I had to get the Ace additional insurance cause I didn't have a copy of my full coverage insurance policy. I had rented cars with other companies and never needed a copy of my insurance. She proceeded to inform me that if I didn't opt for Ace's insurance that I would have to continue to pay for the car daily until my insurance company and Ace hashed out any damages. I booked my car through Expedia and Ace's prices were cheaper, but when you factor in the second shuttle and the additional insurance they basically forced me to get, I wish I would have used a more reputable company.
