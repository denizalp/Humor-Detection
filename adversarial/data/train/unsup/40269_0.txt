I was trying to recreate a pizza experience I had at a different place. Saying to myself if I copy the ingredients and toppings surely the flavor will be similar right? Wrong. If I were starving and there was nothing else available to eat this pizza would be a godsend. Fortunately for me I am not starving unfortunately for me I ordered this pizza blah blah blah
