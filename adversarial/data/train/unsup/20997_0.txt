I love this location as its very close to my house. Never had a problem here. Staff always seem helpful when I had a question. Can almost always find the items I need when I need them. \n\nMy only complaint here is the bathrooms. 99% of the time, the bathroom smells as though someone pooped all over the floor. Several times I've had to go and all toilets were full and gross. Need to make sure the bathrooms are fully stocked with toilet paper as well.
