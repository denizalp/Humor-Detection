Three stars.  It's Denny's.  But wait, it gets better.  We came in on a Saturday morning following a heavy evening of indulgent hedonism.  The first thing I notice is the guy wearing a plastic nose, but he's not dining alone.  His large stuffed dog has accompanied him on this meal and seems to be quite happy sitting on top of the table.  The gentlemen appeared to be having the time of his life and even got up to play the air piano at one point.  These are moments that only occur in Vegas.\n\nI forget our server's name but this guy was totally on top of his game.  Our order took a while to come out but the soda refills were flowing like Niagara.  The food?  Well it's Denny's, it tastes like food.\n\nI come here about once a year and that will probably continue until I move.  Thanks for the memories Denny's.
