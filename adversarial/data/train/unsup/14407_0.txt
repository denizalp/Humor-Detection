#10 of 100 Review Challenge of 2016\n\nWe needed a snack before we started to drink at our table at XS and this was the closest spot to the entrance. Courtney and I already had sushi that day at Samba Sushi and we could always use more. We ordered the crunch roll and another roll that I can't remember the name of but after a bit, we split up the rolls where the crunch roll was mine. We also ordered fruit which came with papaya, lychee and pineapple I believe. We also ordered a Stars sparkling wine. It was delicious. \n\nYou can't miss the sparkly dragon on wall. The service also was not a miss. Friendly, attentive and professional.
