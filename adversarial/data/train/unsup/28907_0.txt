We chose Yardbird as the site for my 50th birthday brunch because a Yelp search showed that they had the best fried chicken on the strip.  I love fried chicken!!  We had 12 people for brunch.  We had an assortment of fried chicken, biscuits and gravy, chicken and waffles, ham biscuits, brisket biscuits, deviled eggs and a salad.  One of the guys said that the ham biscuit was hands down the best ham item he's ever had!  The special biscuits and gravy with a fried boneless chicken thigh was amazing!  Deviled eggs were delish.  They have an amazing selection of bourbon.  Service was excellent and we will definitely return!  We live in Florida, and may check out their location in Miami.  It's probably worth the 2-hour drive!
