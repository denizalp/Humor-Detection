REVIEWER # 225\n\nI have to admit with other Yelpers...This Enterprise Rent-A-Car location provided me with the BEST customer service and stress free experience I have EVER had! \n\n\"Wait, Did I just say that?\" *Scratches head* Yes! This place was amazing! From the time I picked up my car to the time I dropped it off!\n\nI arrived in Phoenix AZ Airport after a quick flight from SF Airport and had already reserved my car through Rentalcar.com I usually never have a problem with reserving through the website.\n\nI arrived at the office which was easy to find and waited in line while taking in all the heat the AZ has to offer. The office provides complementary water while you wait (location is in the outside refrigerator).  Within a couple minutes I was next in line. Told the young lady my name and she pulled out her Ipad and began her search. She walked me over to my new car for the week which was a jazzy ol' Toyota Camry and had me sign my contract on the IPad after we finished our walk around. I then was off to go!\n\nA week later....\n\nI drive up to the enterprise office to get ready to drop off my car. I notice there is a huge line! I think to myself, \"Great, another hour wait to turn in this car\". However, I was totally wrong. So you drive up to the office and you get out the car. There is a employee that comes with an IPad and scanner and scans the barcode on the car. Does a walk thru of the car and ask if you have all your belongings. He tells me my grand total and what I was going to be charged and then I am off to my airline. Easy peezy and the whole process took less than 5 minutes!\n\nMY RATING:\n5 STARS!! I have never been in and out faster than this experience before! I love that they use IPad which make it easy to get clients in and out. I would definitely consider using enterprise in the future and if I am ever back in AZ I would definitely come back and use them!\nThank you Enterprise for the fast and efficient customer service!\n\nREVIEW 153\/196
