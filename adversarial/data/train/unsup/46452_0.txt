First lets just point out we are eating in a food court mall. I was not expecting a five star meal. I needed to grab something fast to eat for dinner in my way to my hotel. I wanted something Asian inspired but not super greasy and deep fried. The cashier recommended the chilli chicken. I made it a combo with the apple slaw and vanilla soda. I liked the apple slaw it was light and refreshing and not too acidic. It had a great balance and not too much apple. My chilli chicken was good and very filling, I couldn't finish it. I added some Siracha and hoisin sauce for a little kick. I'd eat there again next time I'm at eaton centre.
