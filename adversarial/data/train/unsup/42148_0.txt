We were turned onto this place by my sista on a previous trip to Montreal.  We originally wanted to check out a more \"authentic\" Chinese resto but didn't feel like trekking from our hotel over to Chinatown so instead we hopped on Le Metro over to the Eaton Centre and strolled the underground over to Place Ville Marie.  \nMr. Ma is in bldg 1 and can't be missed from the inside our out.  The restaurant is expansive but it is always quiet when we visit.  I would like to take away 1 star because they only have one highchair which was already in use, but the food is just too good.\nI stuck with what I know, General Tao and DW had the Spicy Orange Chicken.  Both meals were some of the best tasting, juiciest chicken we have ever had.  Mr. Ma is a little stingy on the sauce but super tasty none the less.  One meal could easily feed two people, in fact we had quite a bit of food left over which we enjoyed back at the hotel the next day.\nMost people complain that it is a little pricey.  This is some of the best Chinese food that I have had in North America so I'm certainly not going to complain about paying a few extra Canadian $$.  What else are you going to do with that pocket full of toonies? Stop being cheap and take your significant other out for some unforgettable Chinese food!
