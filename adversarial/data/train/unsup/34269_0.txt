I took my 10 year old grandson to the Waffle House thinking it was the same as the Waffle Shop in California. Dont make the same mistake I did, they are not even close to the same! I ordered eggs and porkchops and my grandson ordered a chicken biscuit. The eggs were runny the porkchops were raw in the middle and it took half an hour to get the raw porkchops! I was really disappointed when my grandson got his meal ( Chicken biscuit ) and he looked at me and said \" This tastes like a TROUT BISCUIT.\"Not sure what exactly it was but my grandson wouldnt eat it and neither would I. They offered to recook my porkchops but when I smelled the grease and saw the old waflle batter hanging off the counter, I wasnt gonna take any chances. After that, WE LEFT.
