Stopped in for the first time today.  Great counter presentation just what you should expect.  :)   Got half a dozen donuts, a mix of glazed, cake and long johns loved them all.b I had a cafe mocha, it  was perfect, my husband had a strawberry smoothie which was also great.  Tab was about $12 so it was a great value we will definitely go back  soon and look forward to trying some of their breakfast and lunch menu.       Give them a try!!!
