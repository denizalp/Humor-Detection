Went again last night.  Other reviews of this place dealing with table service are spot on.  If you it at the bar ya get great service.  Any place else, and you get ignored.  This time, got sat on the patio.  Ignored for 20 minutes.  Went and got our round from the bar.  Only thing the server girl actually did was take our food order.  Even had to go to the bar to get my daughters desert .  Ate my whole meal with empty water and beer glasses.  And the beer lines need cleaned in the worst way.  Google dirty beer lines....
