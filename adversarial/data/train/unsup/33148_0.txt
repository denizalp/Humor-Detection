Gosh.  Where do I begin?  Cupcakes?  Out of this World!!  Pies?  Out of this world!!! Sandwiches?  Out of the World!!!  This place is great.  The staff is very kind, especially Brian and Gregg in the mornings.  Two stars because the decor is a bit drab, and the music is too loud.  Stick to what you know... Cupcakes, Pies, Sandwiches, Oh My!!!
