I heard about the restaurant from a friend in Colorado who discovered it on a recent trip and she just raved about the lunch she had.  We went there for a friend's birthday dinner before heading down to the Strip for a show.  Our food selections were hit and miss for our enjoyment.  The scallops were delicious.  My chicken was done to perfection with al dente broccolini, but I couldn't tell if I liked the mac 'n cheese with kale at the bottom of the dish because the lovely chicken drippings were mixed in with whatever sauce was on the macaroni.   I would ask for the mac 'n cheese on the side to give it a fair chance.  The fresh tomato soup of the day was tasty, but had an unexpected spiciness to it.  The waiter didn't prepare my hubby for that.  If you like traditional calamari with marinara sauce, don't order it here.  It came with chopped green olives and an odd red pepper sauce for dipping.  The lavosh was tasty and different.  See what I mean about hit and miss?\n\nI had made a reservation and asked if they would pay a little attention to our birthday girl.  They had no reservation for us when we showed up and no fanfare was made.  They weren't crowded, so no biggie on the reservation front.  We took a picture of our friend with the small chocolate cupcake they brought as we were leaving, but left it there.  Forgettable. \n\nOur waitress was very affable but not overly attentive.  We sat to the side in hopes of having less noise so we could talk, so maybe we were off her beaten path.  The place boasts interesting wall decorations and an inviting atmosphere.  We plan to go back and see how lunch goes before deciding if this is permanently on or off our restaurant options list.
