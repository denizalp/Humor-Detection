Awesome atmosphere!! This is a very hipster, yet not out-of-touch restaurant! It caters to all! Service can be slow at time, but order the Frites to pass the time! They have a great assortment of dipping sauces. My personal favorites are the Sriracha Ranch and the Basil Aeoli. I had the Brisket Poutine, and it was definitely a highlight! The briskets were well-cooked and really tender!! Pro-Tip: DO NOT LET THE WAIT TIME PERSUADE YOU AWAY.
