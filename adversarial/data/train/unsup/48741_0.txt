This is a very decent coffee shop. Certainly not the best cup of joe in town, but one of the better places around the capitol square.\n\nThey switched from Alterra to roasting their own beans in house a year or so ago and are starting to hit their stride. It was very disappointing for the first few months but has gradually improved. There has also been a complete turnover of staff; this seems to have resulted in better brewed coffee -- now it always tastes fresh and like it has enough grounds -- but somewhat less impressive espresso drinks.\n\nThey finally put in more power strips, so there are enough places to plug in laptops. It's an excellent place to chill out and work when it isn't packed with other people doing exactly that.\n\nThey continue to have a good wine selection at some of the best prices in town. They have a handful of tap beers, also at very good prices.\n\nThe food isn't great, but it's ok in a pinch or if you're sick of the other quick lunch spots around the square. Food preparation seems to have sped up considerably of late, which is a welcome change.
