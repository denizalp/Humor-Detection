As I mentioned in previous review, never fails they have EXPIRED or near expiration dated goods on the shelves. This time around though it was was pretty bad. Out of the 6 grocery items Mr B. just brought home, 3 items need to be returned.  The hot dogs had expiration date of July 10th, the buns had specks of mold and the cream cheese had expiration of March \/17! That's dairy products THREE months past and it's still on shelves? That's pretty bad guys.
