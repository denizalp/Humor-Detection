If you are involved in any kind of sports in Gilbert, chances are you've been to these fields - they have softball, baseball, soccer and football fields. This field is called the New McQueen Park and there is one directly behind it called McQueen Park which also has fields for softball and baseball.  I often make a mistake and drive to the wrong field so you should know exactly where you're going beforehand.  These grounds are beautifully kept, very nice and clean, the grass is green and the sidewalks are swept.  I love coming here and spending time outside while cheering on my favorite players.
