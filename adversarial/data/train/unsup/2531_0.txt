I came here after reading all the great reviews and left extremely disappointed. The salon is very busy and they treat it like an assembly line, hence it feels like they are rushing with the cut. The hairstylist cut my hair too short when I told her to just trim and clean it up a little. She also used a razor the entire time. \n\nMaybe the problem here is communication or lack thereof. I really wanted to walk away and not pay for my cut because it was that bad.
