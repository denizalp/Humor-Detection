I LOVE THIS PLACE!  We like to go around 8pm or later on a Tuesday night because it is less noisy and a lot more relaxing when there are fewer people in the place.  Normally I would take advantage of an outdoor patio when the weather is nice however, the ambiance is amazing so we like to sit inside and enjoy our meal. \n\nWe ordered cheese with fresh Roma tomatoes,  kalamata olives, and fresh basil with the red sauce.  YUM!!  We love the thin crust and the sauce is amazing.\n\nThe service was outstanding and always is.  A must try for those of you that haven't tried it yet.
