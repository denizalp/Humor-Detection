I ended up TWICE here in one night and didn't particularly like either experience, BUT was forced to come here because of one thing:  Every other restaurant in NY NY stops serving food late and I needed a snack (then my friends met me and needed some sustenance too) so my option was America orrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr America.  So America it was.  The service late at night is awful, the bar drinks take FOR EV ER (and cost too much), the prices are crazy high for the quality of the food, and the overall vibe is kind of sucky too.  Everywhere else in NY NY has such a nice vibe (or at least A vibe), but America has a Denny's with a gargantuan map one.  It's a shame I spent so much money here.  In retrospect, I would've told my friends to suck it up and walk across the street to MGM to get something instead.  Now I know.
