Like a worm in a bottle of mescal Tequila Bookworm is just there. Idly floating at the corner of Queen West and Portland. You're not really sure what to think when you walk into this place. It's a coffeeshop but they're licensed, so it's a bit of a bar too. They also do brunch. What is this place?\n\nWhatever it is, it's a pretty chill spot to curl up with a laptop and a coffee. They have lots of two tops and a wall full of paperbacks, though it's mostly shitty unreadable stuff like John Saul or The English Patient or Dragon's Egg. And with a garage door that opens wide, I imagine it's a fun place come summer and ogle the passersby on Queen West.\n\nI haven't tried enough of the options on their menu to give it a really solid assessment, but I know that I will come here again.\n\nObligatory Title Pun: Forget early birds: this WORM is for night owls.\n\nMenu Readability: I don't think I've ever looked at a menu here.\n\nNeed to mention: This cafe is open LATE! Huzzah.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: I love any place open past 10pm.
