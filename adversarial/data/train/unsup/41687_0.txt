I came here for a Company meeting and the conference room was clean and nice. The breakfast and lunch they served were delicious! The whole layout of this hotel was beautiful. As I walked in they had a lobby area with computers and then I seen something that caught my eye. It was a big mirror and I immediately took a selfie with it  That is probably my most favorite thing in this hotel. After lunch I was still hungry and so a teammate and I tried looking for the kitchen workers to see if they still had leftovers from our lunch. Juliana who was at the front desk was kind enough to check in the kitchen but unfortunately there was no more food left. Atleast she tried that's all that counts. Oh yeah I love how they have a bar and a little mini convenience store for all your snacking and necessity needs instead of having to go to a store. The chair booths are comfy it looks like a little couch with pillows with a slight privacy.
