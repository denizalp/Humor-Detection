We had an amazing time at the science center. 4 floors of discovery, learning and fun. We spent hours exploring all the exhibits. They even have free teacher admission. The highlight of our trip was the planetarium show we saw Arizona Skies , Chris and James went above and beyond and presented and amazing show on the constellations. I will definitely return!
