K bought a couple of winter coats at Savers. (Don't judge) She asked me to take them to the cleaners. I have been using the cleaners near Sprouts on Dobson & Ray. I took the coats there and much to my amazement, the estimate was $70. OK, I don't know much about Dry Cleaning but what I do know is that I'm not going to pay more for Dry Cleaning than the coats cost. I said thanks but no thanks.\nThe next day K checked around and found a coupon for \"First 5 Items Free\" from Del Rey. I laughed and said I doubted that meant anything but what the heck, let's drive the coats over and see. We were out running errands anyways so we stopped by. The young girl at the register took the coats and off we went. The coats were ready a few days later and there was no charge. WOW. \nNow, we recently took our comforter in and I think the cost was probably what any cleaners would charge so I really didn't flinch. The comforter came back clean, on a hanger and wrapped in plastic. Seems very professional. \nWe are on the email list and get coupons all the time. I think if you plan accordingly you can get a lot of dry cleaning done for very reasonable prices. We'll keep coming back and hopefully will continue to have good experiences.\nFair Prices. Pleasant Staff. Convenient hours, Drop Off availability and same day service. 5 Stars.
