Visited this place per Aron's suggestion and it did not dissapoint. \n\nMy boyfriend and I had just finished a long day of walking and traveling and it everything was closed since it was 11pm. \n\nThank god this place was open. It was quiet and cozy, very inviting. We were welcomed warmly by a man who seated us with menus. \n\nI ordered a sub and my boyfriend ordered a pizza. The food was really good. Warm, homemade style, tasty. It wasn't the best sub in the world but it was definitely worth a stop.\n\nService is good, music is good, prices are good. No complaints here.\n\nVisited on June 30th 2017
