When I started researching places to get my wedding dress dry cleaned, prices were ALL over the place.  I was pleasantly surprised when I called OrganiCare and they told me it would only be $100, especially without using toxic chemicals!  It took about a week and came out perfect.  I've used them again since, with just a formal dress; the cost was $13 and I was able to pick up the next day.  I definitely recommend this place, the girls up front are always pleasant and they have candy by the register!
