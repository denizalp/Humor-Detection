Okay, if you like dive bars (I do) and you like a heavy handed bar tender that serves cheap drinks, you will love Kelley's.\n\nThis is a dive bar to be sure, and there are always drunk locals sitting around in their usual spots at the bar and getting loud.  But, if you want to run in for a few drinks, you will leave with money left in your pocket and a smile on your face!\n\nIf you are in the area and in the mood for some cheap, stiff drinks, check Kelly's out.
