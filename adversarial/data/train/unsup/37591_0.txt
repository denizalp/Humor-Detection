I came here on a Wednesday afternoon and there were a few tables occupied already at around 12:45. And by 1 ish, I didn't expect it but it was almost already a full house. The space is quite small though. The decoration is quite unique and classy. Seatings were comfortable and staff was friendly. \n\nThis place mainly eats hotpot fish. But for my actual fish eaters that like the entire fish this place isnt for you because they only serve fillets. But for people that dont like bones then this place is great. The lunch combos are pretty worth it. I got the 16.99$ lunch combo and it included 4 large pieces of fillet with cabbage and onion inside the soup. Cabbage kimchi, two bowls of rice, and 2 pops. We ordered an extra side of lotus root and bean curd for 1.99$ each. There were 8 different soups to choose from. All soups are free meaning you didnt have to add extra money for any soups which is a bonus. There was 4 spicy and 4 non spicy soups. We got the chili one which consisted alot of red chili, green onion, and tomato. The more you eat it the more flavourful and spicy. Omg so so so spicy. The table beside me ordered the most spicies one and he asked for extra spice. Like how??? I was literally dying from the heat. Since the combo came with two pops it saved my tongue and esopagus. The hot pot had fire underneath so it kept the fish hot. The fish was pan fried before they put it in the soup so it was super tasty. The lotus root and bean curd went so we with the soup. The bean curd was was a little chewy even after leaving in the soup for so long, but it soaked up all the soup so it was still so good. \n\nAll in all the combo was such a good deal. I would definitely recommend trying the combo first because it included everything you will order for the soup (pop and rice) to survive the heat.
