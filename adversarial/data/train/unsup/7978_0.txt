This place is pretty spacious and walking distance from other cool restaurants and lounges; great location guess what I'm saying.\n\nFor drinks, I went for their flights since finding a right brew can dangerous since I want to keep drinking till I find the right one!  Needless to say, the place has a large round bar in the middle while the atmosphere is very sports bar-like.  \n\nWe started with appetizers; the King George Amber Beer Wings.  I found it very plain and basic.  For our entree my partner ordered the Alaskan Cod and Chips while I went for their Calabrese Pizza; house sauce, salami, cheese blend, chili flakes, and arugula.  Overall, the fish were extra crispy atop some waffle fries; great texture and complimentary to our beers.  The pizza was loaded with toppings and served in a square cookie pan, which is unique!  However it worked since the crust had a subtle crunch while keeping the topping moist and sauce juicy. \n\nIn the end, Phoenix Ale Brewery seems pretty chill place and the food seems to be a hit or miss and\/or nothing to rave about. - Enjoy!
