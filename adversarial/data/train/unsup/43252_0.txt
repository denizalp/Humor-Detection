Ordered chicken Alfredo , with a side salad gyro and a Capri salad. 2 cheesecake slices for dessert. Total for our food was 44.00. Had the food delivered. Paid by credit card which cost another dollar. Didn't get a receipt, going off the menu prices looks like I paid an extra 7.00. The food was marginal at best. The cheesecake tasted like it had been thawed out and put in the fridge for a few days. I had high hopes and unfortunately won't be ordering again after poor food quality and being over charged.
