Nuvo Hotel isn't all bad. They offer free Wi-Fi and free calls anywhere in North American. And the size of the room is really big, kind of like a studio apartment.\n\nUnfortunately, it feels like you're walking into an apartment building, a sketchy apartment building, when you get there. The office is only open from 9 - 9 which is inconvenient to say the least. There are constant shouting matches happening in the alley way out back. My bed was a Murphy bed that was quite squeaky. And I'm fairly certain there was an attempted break-in into another room during my stay.\n\nSo, while the price and the people where nice I don't think I'd ever stay here again, nor would I recommend it to others.
