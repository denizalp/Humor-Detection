perhaps as a result of the season - it was with the Chef standing tableside that a five-piece pasta course was presented, smoothness exemplified by Burrata Agnolotti offering perfect little pockets mixed with big chunks of Lobster  while last year's Chicken Foie-Fredo saw a big textural upgrade by way of crispy Chicken Chicharones tossed with Hand-cut Fettucine and strips of tender white Meat glistening in unctuous Alfredo.\n \nTransitioning the wide-ribboned Ripatelli to winter by way of Wild Boar Bolognese while making a hearty pass at the Midwestern slow-cooker classic inside of tiny Ravioli, a tongue-in-cheek swipe at the \"Official flavor of Fall\" came across in LaPlaca's ever-light Dumplings, a Ragu of braised Reindeer offering a slight bit of grassy funk that found its foil in thin slices of Beets along with charred Brussels Sprout Leaves and housemade Gingerbread Crumble.\n\nAlways happy to see Portofino's Veal Osso Bucco, perhaps not Sin City's most famous but arguably the best, new secondi offered Day Boat Scallops amidst Cauliflower Florets and smoked Pork with spicy Popcorn on a bed of smooth Polenta, the Rack of Lamb perfectly roasted medium with a round of smooth Stuffing plus Figs added for sweetness, the Strauss Brands Veal served slightly different from last visit's \"Veal Pacino\" with a lower price, similar size and better flavor than the one jokingly referenced in the unofficial off-menu-only title.\n\nDisappointed to see that desserts have regressed, the pastry department once again undergoing change as a result of the shared nature with other restaurants within the Casino, both the Tiramisu and Crème Brûlée remain competent closers, though the loss of Cassata Cake and the Cookie-based Souffle trio are issues that management should look into remedying as soon as possible.\n\n***** As innovative as ever, the Pastas and Entrees continuing to shine on a nation-wide level despite the constraints of playing to The Mirage clientele, it seems shortsighted that management would invest time in changing the name when a fresh coat of paint and good pastry Chef could offer exponential improvement at nominal cost, though as long as Chef LaPlaca and Chris Zadie are involved there is no doubt the restaurant will continue to impress.
