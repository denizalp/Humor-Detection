I'm pretty sure that Chino Bandido, an establishment that has been around since 1990, was light years ahead of the rest of the food culture when it came to fusion concepts. For this alone, you have to give Chino credit for being an innovator of sorts. And given that they are one of the most frequently reviewed restaurants on Yelp within the Phoenix area, it's obvious that they've amassed quite a following over the years.\n\nI've only dined here three times. Originally, I went with some work colleagues after their publicity from Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. Additionally, my girlfriend and have dined here twice.\n\nAs many people point out, Chino is located in a bit of a sketchy area that seems to get increasingly more uncomfortable deeper into the night. Nevertheless, it seems to receive a lot of business from people who appear to be regulars. Their menu cards are a bit odd, but they're willing to help you if you're confused on how to order. I like that they offer samples of their meats in order to reduce the risk of making mistakes.\n\nI've had their Jade Red Chicken a few times and have always found it to have fairly decent quality for the price. Their Chile Relleno, something I decided to take a risk on (since sampling it is forbidden), ended up being a surprise hit. Traditional rice and jerk fried rice are both decent as well. Throwing in a free snicker doodle cookie with each meal is a nice touch.\n\nI suggest that you be realistic. Don't go in here expecting to eat high-end cuisine that's on par with what you'd receive at a five star restaurant. It's the equivalent of \"fast casual\" - without the sleek IKEA-ish decor, of course.\n\nI don't feel it's the best Mexican or Chinese food I've ever eaten, nor is it something that I find myself craving in the same manner that other people seem to on a regular basis. But for what it's worth, by the standards of \"dive\" food, it's good enough.
