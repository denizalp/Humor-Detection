Buyer be warned! Do not shop here unless you know what your looking at. Went in to see a Mitsubishi and thank god I had my brother who noticed extensive damage that was poorly fixed. \n\nThey said it was never involved in an accident however due to the extensive damage underneath and poor paint job I avoided this buy. \n\nIf your going to sell a limon at least let your costumers know up front before they drive across town to see your product. \n\nYou might ask, did they know of the damages? The answer is yes! If your in the car business weather your selling or fixing a car you can notice the passenger frame is not connected to the rear bumper.
