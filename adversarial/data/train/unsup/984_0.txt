Do you know who Peter Lik is?  Well if you saw the movie \"life of walter mitty\" starring Ben Stiller, he seems alot like the photographer Sean Penn played in the movie.\n\nPeter Lik takes astonishing 3d like photos of nature scapes in all of its profound glory.  One of his photo's sold for $1 million dollars!  Peter normally releases a proof set of 45 and then a limited set of 950 of each photo he releases. Every time 100 of the 950 prints sell the price goes up on the remaining prints.  At the end of the print run the price has basically doubled from around $4500 to $9000.\n\nThis is Peter's largest gallery although he has several in Vegas.  He also currently lives in Vegas and was described as being ADD even though he must be extremely patient when taking his breath taking photos.\n\nIt is impossible to describe the depth of colors and beauty Peter captures in his photos.  There is one photo of a zebra which I would swear its eye lashes were props applied to the photo, that's how crazy astounding these photos are. The prints are also made on special paper which contains silver which reacts according to the amount of lighting on the print ie the print changes its look according to how much light is on it.  Pricing also includes custom framing, matting, uv protected glass, tax and shipping.\n\nWhile the big prices will keep some people from making a purchase here, I highly recommend visiting to admire this breathtaking work.
