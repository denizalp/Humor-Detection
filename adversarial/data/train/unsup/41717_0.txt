We have dined in and taken out of Stoke's Grill on several occasions.  Their pizza is really really good, and is a good item for take out.  Their soups, in particular, their butternut squash soup, is also very good.  The spices in the squash soup - the warm nutmeg - and the creaminess of it, make it so good.  Perfect in the wintertime!  When we dined in, we got the white fries with the white garlic aioli - very very good.  I really liked the aioli.  While neither my husband or I drink beer, they look like they have a good selection of bottled and draft beers.  I'm particularly impressed with the place despite it being in a strip mall.
