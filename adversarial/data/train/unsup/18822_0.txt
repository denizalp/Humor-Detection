If you need a server.... you can find just about all of them sitting at the bar playing around on their phones. \n\nWe had the pleasure of having Sierra as our server- whose attitude was just about as piss poor as her service. I ordered a tostada\/taco lunch special, so you can imagine my surprise  when a taco and some other slop was placed in front of me. Sierra advised me the mystery item was in fact an enchilada. Ah... it's Mexican food right? Just the same shit put together  slightly different. I told her not to worry, I'd eat it anyway.  I wouldn't have mind as much... but then she proceeded to argue with me that I was wrong because when she took my order she asked me for red or green sauce.\n\"Enchiladas are the only item that come with sauce\".  \n\nNot enough energy to argue with her, she immediately made her way back to the barstool where her phone was again glued to her hand. After about 15 minutes  of having dirty plates just sitting in front  of us, I thought I would do her a favor, head up to the bar with my card and pay. No use in staying  there any longer nor ever coming back. For better food and service I'll visit the Filibertos drive thru across the street.
