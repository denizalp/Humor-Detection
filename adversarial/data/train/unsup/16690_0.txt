I had no idea Acacia cafe would be so delicious. I have been here for breakfast quite a few times now, and each time I am pleasantly surprised. The food is high quality for low cost (almost diner) prices.  \n\nA few of my favorites: \nAwesome waffles cooked to perfection and covered in fresh ripe fruit.\nThe veggie omelet (try the roasted vegetable mix), the hash browns its served with are always crisp and not greasy.\nThe vegetable sandwich with cheddar cheese \nIn addition to the food, the beverages are also great. They have three types of fresh brewed tea (the passion fruit is my favorite) and their cappuccinos and coffees are excellent also.\nThe staff is friendly and quick to help you make up your mind, and it has always been very clean and well organized. This is a must try for a quick breakfast, I can't wait to go back for lunch and try the chicken salad everyone is raving about.
