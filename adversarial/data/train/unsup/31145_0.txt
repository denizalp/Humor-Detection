Very surprised by how much I enjoyed my meal there.  Not that I heard poor things about Apteka-- in fact, the opposite as my son has been saying great things about the food-- but, rather, I've never eaten at a vegan restaurant before.\n\nA couple of us had the kluski, my wife had the pierogies, someone had a sandwich.  The menu is pretty limited but changes all the time-- yet we all left there very pleased with what we ate!  Plus I had an interesting tequila-based cocktail that was great.  Very surprised how tasty and satisfying vegan food could be (no offense meant to any vegans or vegetarians reading this).\n\nThe restaurant is Eastern European, so it was nice to hear the gentleman behind the bar pronounce my Polish last name correctly-- then let me know that they do serve stinging nettle (what my name means) tea!\n\nWe sat in the rear half of the restaurant which had a  patio feel.  A nice space to eat and talk.\n\nHad a lovely meal and look forward to my next visit there.
