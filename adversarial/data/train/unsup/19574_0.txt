I had not been here for several years.  I came in for a quick lunch, and a chance to update my viewpoint.\n\nThe restaurant was half full just after the lunch rush had ended.  I noticed a new menu focussing on the noodle dishes.  I defaulted to my classic choice-Shrimp Wonton Noodle Soup.\n\nMy lunch arrived within 3 MINUTES, steaming, and delicious.  4 golf ball sized wontons crammed with fresh, crisp shrimp sat on a bed of fresh noodles and broth.  The dish is so fresh, no matter how slow I ate, the noodles would never have turned soggy.\n\nI hate winter, but this soup makes winter bearable.  I can't wait for winter, I'll be spending a lot of lunches here!
