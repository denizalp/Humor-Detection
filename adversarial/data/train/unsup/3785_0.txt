I enjoyed myself the few times I've been here at the Rula. It's a great change of pace from the Landon & Candace frat\/sorority show up and down the rest of the strip. I didn't have any service issues sitting at the bar, nothing out of the ordinary on a crowded weekend night. \n\nIt IS a place where friends just hang out with beers in their hand, sometimes trying to jig to the catchy Celtic bands playing the middle. On Halloween, my friends and I were out in the back patio and a girl in the tower of the adjoining hotel gave everyone down below a nice stripshow. Bonus star.\n\nI guess the downside of the bar is with the high ceilings and bright lights it doesn't have that authentic Irish pub feel, but who am I kidding. \n\nWe're in Tempe. \n\nWhich also means smoke-free Irish bar, and until May rolls around, Rula definitely has the leg up on the two McCaffrey's...\n\n4 Stars.
