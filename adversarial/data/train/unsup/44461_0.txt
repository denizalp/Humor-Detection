The day after a holiday weekend (Memorial Day), I have a slow leak and a busy day.  I go in to them in the morning and they are of course booked all day.  But they squeeze me in, put on my spare, mark the hole in the tire, and don't charge me a dime.  All in a short period of time.  Super nice of them.
