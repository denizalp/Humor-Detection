I had high expectation of this place from reading the other reviews. I don't know if it was just an off night or of all these people are wrong. \n\nService was soooo slow and our server was never anywhere to be seen. Took her ages to take our order. Food took ages to come, and it was cold. Plus when we asked for the  bill it took her 5 mins to bring the credit card machine over. \n\nMaybe they were busy, but for the size of the place and the amount of people in there I really don't think this was the case. \n\nAfter all that, the pulled pork was pretty good. The cornbread was a little to crispy and crumbly but otherwise good. \nCould have all been much hotter though.
