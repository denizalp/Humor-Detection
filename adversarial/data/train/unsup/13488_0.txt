4.5 stars, rounding up for uniqueness and fabulous service.\n\nHeard about this place from a friend, who highly recommended the uni pasta dish. Came in with the BF and was a bit surprised by the prices on the menu and the variety of dishes- took us a long while to decide on our orders. Judging by the Top 10 List, it's a pretty common issue here.\n\nServer was super sweet and polite and made several suggestions.\nAfter browsing so many Yelp reviews that insisted on the uni tomato cream pasta, we finally caved and decided to split that as our entr√©e and add on a bunch of appetizers to share.\n\nTotal came to just under $50 before tip.\nShared the half order of FRIED OYSTERS (just okay), the ITALIAN SPRING ROLLS (didn't care for them at all- poorly executed and overpriced, take it off the menu), and the BRUSCHETTA- three different types served on three small circles of bread, a bit small to share but very tasty: one was seafood, another was avocado and wasabi, and the third was a mozzarella that was to die for. Wish it was served with two pieces of each type rather than just one though, just a hint of each flavor wasn't enough.\n\nAnd then there was the UNI TOMATO CREAM PASTA, the dish sonnets are written for. I'm not  fan of uni at sushi restaurants but somehow this dish works really, really well- it almost comes off as a rosa sauce with clams, but roughly six billion times better. The uni is sneaky and it's flavor is in every bite but there isn't a large quantity of it in the dish itself. Somehow the extra shakers of red pepper and parmesan don't feel sacrilegious when you shake them on your serving.
