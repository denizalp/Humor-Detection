On the positive side, the food was imaginative, well executed and presented. However on the other side of the coin, the waitstaff is poorly trained and aggressive in telling you what you want, even after you order it your way. For example, my medium rare tuna arrived medium well because I wouldn't order it rare. There appeared to be little service training: when ordering wines by the glass, the waiter said that is what we call it even if it is wrong, when he missed one of the ladies in our party during the drink order, there was no apology just a flip comment from the waiter that clearly offended her. The staff clearly has the priority and walked thru parties while they were being seated rather than taking the 2 extra steps to walk around. It is a shame, since this a nice place with good food at a reasonable price and everyone in our party enjoyed their food but the waiter ruined it for some of us and there are so many good alternatives close by.
