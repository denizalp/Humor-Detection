Yeah... I'm an O'Reily guy. But, I only had  20 minutes to fix my car before work so I went to the automotive store which was closest to my house. And it happened to be an AutoZone. The repair I needed was very small, the oil filler cap on my car broke off in my engine so I just needed a replacement. The chick working here was really friendly and she knew her stuff. I was in and out in less than 5 minutes and was able to solve my car troubles with less than 10 seconds of work.  But, recently I've been having a bad reaction to my pain killers(I suffered a bad injury to my spine a few years ago) and they have made me kinda incoherent... so about 10 minutes later I crashed my car into the side of my house. I then had to come back to this Autozone location for more parts.  So in less than 20 minutes I was here twice. True story.
