Yup  I did it , I took the family to the Boofay and it didn't make us sick ! \nI am not usually a huge buffet kinda gal  but I was interested in trying this place and with the Recommendations of the S.C.A.B. Y . \n( Superior Crew of Boofays of Yelp)  also known as Ryan , Daren, Rand, Norm and Iain. I was sure I couldn't go wrong . Taking in consideration of the genre of this establishment this was a pretty good operation. While a pungent sour smell hit you upon walking in  you quickly dismissed it upon the viewing of food.  The food was strongly  decent . My favorite was a chicken they named BBQ chicken , ironic because it was a light teriayki , but whatever, it's their restaurant and they can name it whatever they like. But it wasn't BBQ.\nThey also had  ---wait for it ---Crab legs.. cool !!  The other items were good and looked good: Veggies on the line still looked fresh and not overcooked. They had some interesting fish concoctions with shrimp and octopus  that caught my interest. The sushi line looked once again, decent but of course tasted only okay.  Orange Chicken and Beef Rib  tasted good .There was also big assortment of shrimp dishes , for a minute I went all Bubba Gump ..\n Fried Shrimp , Salt and Pepper Shrimp, Shrimp Tempura, Cold Shrimp, Coconut Shrimp then I remembered its 2010  and I snapped out of it.  They also had a few desserts which we didn't try and Ice Cream which the kids fully appreciated. \nFor the price of 10.00 a person it was reasonable if you take into consideration its a  Chinese Buffet. We decided this a good place to go if you are craving Panda express or Teriakyi  Chicken .  \nService was good and we got in and out of there relatively easily.
