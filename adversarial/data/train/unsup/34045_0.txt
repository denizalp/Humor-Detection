I've done a lot of escape rooms and this one was pretty challenging and fun. Definitely in my top ten. My group did the fortune teller room. The people are very friendly and helpful. Only bummer was we showed up 15 minutes early, like they told us too, and we didn't start until 30 minutes later because we had to wait for the other group who were doing the other fortune teller room. I guess the guy wanted to explain everything at the same time. But, that's ok. I will be back!
