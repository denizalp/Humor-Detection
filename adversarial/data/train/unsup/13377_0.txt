The Bay is the modern day evolution of the old Hudson Bay Company, which was founded in 1670. It was said that its initials (HBC) actually meant \"Here Before Christ\" and in a sense that's true as they did precede missionaries into much of the north woods. \n\nThe old HBC was once the de facto government in parts of North America before European-based colonies and nation states existed. From its longtime headquarters at York Factory on Hudson Bay, it controlled the fur trade throughout much of British-controlled North America for several centuries, undertaking early exploration. Its traders and trappers forged early relationships with many groups of First Nations its network of trading posts formed the nucleus for later official authority in many areas of Western Canada and the United States. \n\nSo there's a lot of history to consider when you walk into this modern and inviting department store. My little piece of that history is my high-quality and 100% wool Hudson Bay Point Blanket. However, the next time I come in, I'll need to keep Gayle in mind as I consider the wise advice of Kat F.
