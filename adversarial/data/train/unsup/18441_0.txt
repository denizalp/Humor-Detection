This goes to the fact that over the course of a year this place has been going down hill.  In the past,  there has been items missing from orders and yet they never do anything about it.  \n\nOrdering online is a complete joke with Burger Rush. Food that is over 30 minutes late is still not here and on top of that,  will most likely be cold and soggy like usual. This will be the last time I order from them. Way to many issues.
