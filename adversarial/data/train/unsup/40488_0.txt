Wow!! I can thank this doctor and his staff enough. I was having chronic pain under the arch of my foot for over a year. At the point I saw him, I had been to 2 other podiatrists in the area... both of which were unable to fix my plantar fasciitis after multiple therapeutic attempts. When I saw Dr. De La Cruz I was at the point of giving up, and thought I was going to have to live with this pain for the rest of my life.  His professionalism, diagnostic ability, and treatment was the best I have seen. I am now pain free and would suggest this doctor for any foot and ankle pain!!
