Thank you, about.com, for letting me on this little secret called Enchanted Island.  My sister and her two kids (ages 8 and 6) finally made their first trip to Arizona this past August, and prior to their trip, I did some research on about.com for kid-friendly spots and EI was one of its \"must-visits.\"  \n\nThe kids loved all of the rides they were able to try.  There was the bumper boat that my niece couldn't go on bec. she was too tall, and this was the only downside to whole experience- it was clear that my nephew enjoyed it.  However, there were other rides for the older girl to try, that it didn't take long to quell the tears.  Even though most of the rides were geared toward toddlers, my niece and nephew really enjoyed themselves and kept talking about how much fun they had for a few days after!  My sister and I loved seeing their enjoyment.  We also liked the fact that the amusement park is IN an actual park, and a quite charming one, at that.  I was a little wary after reading a couple of online reviews stating how rundown it was, but the park wasn't as shabby as I was led to believe.  \n\nI again thank about.com for revealing this little gem, for who would have known it to exist?  My coworkers and other acquaintances surely didn't.  I hope that some of you are able to enjoy it with your families, too.
