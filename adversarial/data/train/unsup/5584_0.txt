This QT is always slow, it's always super busy because they always have out of order pumps.  The loo always have no soap in the dispenser and the paper towels is always jammed or it's nonexistent.  \n\nOn a good note the staff is nice, the the location is somewhat neat.  They always have beer in there like all other QTs.  If this QT wasn't so close to me....I go else where.  Overall okay place!
