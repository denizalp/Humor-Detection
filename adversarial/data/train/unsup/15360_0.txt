One of my favorite bars in LV. With hundreds of beers and a whole room upstairs dedicated to Whiskey its a fun place to experiment with new beers and whiskeys. Delirium Tremens on tap... one of the few places in vegas that has this beer! Also Nougat beer by the bottle. it tastes just like a snickers bar. Jack the bartender is awesome as well. and oh! free wi fi :)
