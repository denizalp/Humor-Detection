Possibly the best meal I had this Veteran's Weekend.\n\nCame for lunch, with a craving for a juicy burger. I mentioned prior to seating that it was my girlfriends' birthday and the hostess nodded, seated us and off we were to an amazing lunch. \n\n*CALAMARI $16 - The fried calamari was good, it was in a huge tin perfect for sharing between 2-3 people. It was on the salty side which stops you from having too much of it but nicely season with the herbs. Smoked marinara and lemon garlic aioli for dipping. It's one of those can order or not sort of dish. \n\n*BACON BURGER $19 - This was amazing! the beef patty cooked to a medium well doneness but still juicy, how?! Nice ratio of melted cheeses (gouda and american) that did not overwhelm, perfectly cooked crispy bacon strips. The burger came cut in half, i don't know if that's their standard or because they assume we were sharing. We did, it was a lot! Comes with fries, potato + potAto:\n\n*BAKED SWEET POTATO $11 - This was excellent, perfectly baked large sweet potato that's sure to be too much for one person. The maple-chipotle cream cheese is genius, but can be too creamy and heavy, you better scrape some of that aside to reach the potato. Sweet on sweet can be a bit too...well, sweet, make sure you share this. Dusted with Pecan Streusel Sea Salt, makes this side dish a freaking winner. Loved it! \n\n*CHOCOLATE STICKY TOFFEE CAKE $6 (FREE, which came as a surprise after I mentioned the bday) So delicious and smart. Listen to this, Bourbon chocolate cake (sick), spiked caramel (what?!), chocolate mousse (keep going), chocolate streusel (Lord Jesus) and caramel freaking corn (can I get a pop-cooorn)! The BOMB (bear in mind i never say a food is bomb, but in this case, it's the only word that can describe this masterpiece) \n\nService was excellent, loved the decor, the beer tables. It was all an unforgettable experience. This totally made our day!
