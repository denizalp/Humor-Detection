My husband and I are in the process of moving. My husband took care of getting quotes from moving companies. This company is like your crazy ex-boyfriend or ex-girlfriend who won't get the hint. They left a voicemail. I didn't call back. They called again. I didn't pick up. They called again and I spoke to a rep. I told him we already found another company.\n\nThe nosy guy asked which company so I told him. He said he has never heard of them and asked more questions about the company. Look pal. I don't know the history of the moving company or where their headquarters are. Then he asked if they charge by weight. Then proceeded to tell me how they will probably overcharge me and the cons of going with a company that charges by the weight. I said OK, that's nice. I'm already stressed as it is about moving. No need to make me worry more.\n\nNo respect for companies that bash other companies to win my business. I had received other calls from other moving companies and after I had told them I found a company already, they said thank you politely and bye. That's the way you should act. Professional. I would hate to think what would happen if we had decided to go with them. After perusing the reviews, I'm glad we didn't.
