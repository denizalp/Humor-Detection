Grimaldi's is decent pizza. I was there with my family dining out al fresco one evening and they forgot to make our pizza because they were too busy concentrating on the catered event in the banquet dining area. When our pizza did arrive, it was the wrong pizza. So they finally did get it right and have gotten it right with each subsequent visit.\n\nI like their thin crust pizza and it's definitely worth ordering. I have to laugh sometimes when I run into the New Yorkers that have a major chubby about this place.  It's rather entertaining but I would still recommend this place when you're in old town Scottsdale and are jonesing for a pizza.
