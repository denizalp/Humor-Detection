I ordered the Chirashi , something I don't usually get because I don't like eating so much rice,  but this rice was delicious! Perfect balance of the wet\/sticky Japanese rice with bits of seaweed, egg and ginger. Topped off with a variety of fresh sashimi including salmon, Hamachi, mackerel, sweet shrimp, octopus, surf clam. The salmon was a bit soft\/mushy for my personal taste but otherwise everything was good. \n\nAlso ordered a side of soft shell crab - crispy and freshly deep fried; not all pieces were very meaty but liked the batter. \n\nFresh oysters - malpeque. Didn't like the green onion on top though.
