It's true that I'm not a vegan. Can't even call myself a vegetarian. But I love food. And because of that, I can appreciate the new kid on the block (girl you know it's true...oh wait, that's Milli Vanilli) which is why I was excited Vegan House is finally opened. \n\nIt's not often that I take lunch outside the office. So, today was a treat. And that treat started with a lovely cup of soup. It should be said, I'm not really a soup lover. The idea of occupying so much stomach space to what's nothing more than flavored water seems like a dining mistake. But this soup was good! The veggie roll appetizers were terrific. Crispy and flavorful, they really were a great pre-entr√©e option. My Jungle Noodles were a great blend of fresh veggies and dense tofu. It was all the right stuff, baby. On that note, I asked if the tofu had been smoked because the texture was more meaty, with a firm exterior with just the right amount of bite. Turns out, they quickly fry it; amazing! I'd ordered mild and it was far too mild for my tastes. Next time, I'll be certain to get it hotter. Or maybe next time I'll try something else from the menu.
