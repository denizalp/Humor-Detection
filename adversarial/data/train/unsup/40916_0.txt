Me and wifey took my dad and a friend out for drinks and some Mexican food. Me and wifey love this place and my dad and friend did also. I can't say enough about the salsa, it is some of the best I've had. The service is top notch as always and the food is the same. Will continue to come back. Reservations are highly recommended.
