I first visited Las Vegas in 1972 and I came back for vacation almost every year until I moved here in 2001.  I love this crazy, wonderful, bright light city and its history.\n\nThere are so many things to do within a short drive of Las Vegas.  We have several National Recreation areas, two National Conservation areas, theatre, entertainment venues at Strip hotels, and all the other activities that go with a city of nearly 2,000,000 people.  How many places can you snow ski in the morning and water ski that same day?\n\nMany thanks to the deceased first lady of Las Vegas, Helen Stewart.  If she hadn't kept her family together and stayed here after her husband's murder at the Kiel Ranch, the railroad probably would have passed us by and the city wouldn't exist as it does today.  Instead, she sold the Las Vegas Ranch to the railroad and that started us out.  From there, laws--mainly gambling-- and then the building of Hoover Dam helped bring this city toward the future it has.\n\nAnd it's still growing.  Bright light city--you have set my soul on fire!
