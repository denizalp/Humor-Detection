short version review:  NOPE NOPE NOPE\nPOOR QUALITY WORK\nPOOR CUSTOMER SERVICE\nPOOR MANAGEMENT\n\nActual review:\nI would give zero stars if able. Paid for the 34.99 complete car wash - specifically requested all interior to be wiped - seats, door panels etc. This complete wash would have included armor all to wheel wells. \n\nAs I drive away I see an area on the seat that had not been wiped and figured not a big deal I'll do it when I get home. Once home I go to wipe the one are when I notice the passenger side doors had not been touched - dust was very apparent. Then I also noticed the wheel wells had not been touched. Essentially nothing extra on the complete wash had been performed. \n\nSo I have to fit a return visit to the car wash to rectify the situation to have the manager belittle my request. \n\nNot impressed with any of the Jackson facilities. But this has been the worst. \n\nA wet cat could've done a better job.
