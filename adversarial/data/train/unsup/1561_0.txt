A great car wash. I'll slide through here while people wait in line for 30 minutes at Giant Eagle or the other place on W 117th. The place around the corner on 117 is called Laser Wash. I don't want any damned lasers blasting my car. Last time I checked lasers are hot things that melt and burn. I rather have a traditional car wash that uses water. Consumers are fascinated by technology however and if there is the mention of a laser people believe it is a superior product.
