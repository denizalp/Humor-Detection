OMG THIS PLACE IS SO AWESOME. I got the 12 course omakase meal for 39.99$. Literally the best Japanese food and sushi I have ever had. The food they give you is well over 40$ worth and you can pack it up to go! Everything tasted so amazing I cannot even put it into words so I have attached a plethora of pictures!
