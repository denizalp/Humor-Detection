Very cool and modern building, awesome location and I like the fact that its a pet-friendly environment. It's supposed to be 25th floors but it skips levels between floors (I would assume it's about 20 stories).  \n\nGym is kind of small, pool is closed very frequently.\n\nI would've given better stars but there's down sides like they only give you a parking space even if you are leasing a 2 bedroom condo. Some of their staff it's not very considerate. In fact, you get better assistance and service if you work  or have something to do with Zappos.
