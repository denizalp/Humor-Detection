Sorry I've been slacking. I should've written  an update a long time ago. Anyways. Sundance Grill is a casino cafe located in the Silverton. Being that they're probably the closest casino to my house I've been here many times.\n\nUp in the front they have a gelato bar. They have some tasty flavors like salted caramel and chocolate mint. The gelato ain't that bad, I've had a few times. Why not end the meal with some gelato!?\n\nI've tried a lot of their different items and for most parts I've enjoyed most of them.  The food is better than a lot of other casino cafes with similar prices and items. They have a 14 oz king's cut prime rib, Rueben sandwich, deep fried ribs, chicken fettuccine Alfredo, smoked BBQ salmon salad, banana foster's French toast, and much more.\n\nThey also have a late night menu that runs from midnight - 5 AM. It includes $2.95 biscuit and gravy, $4 eggs and sausage\/bacon, $4.99 steak and eggs, $5 ham and eggs, and $6 cheese burger. You'll probably see me here during this time if your lucky.\n\nThe cafe seat lots of people. I've been here when it's packed, empty, short handed, and when there's more employees than needed.    The interiors is nice and theres a few tv's inside incase your trying to catch a game.\n\nI'll be back.
