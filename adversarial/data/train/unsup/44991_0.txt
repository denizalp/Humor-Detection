I ordered the breakfast burger and when I first saw it I was speechless. I didnt even know if I could eat it properly but I did. It was so good! Perfect combination with patty, Turkey bacon, egg, hollandaise sauce and all the fixing.  It was probably the best burger I had during my stay in Vegas and I had burgers everyday
