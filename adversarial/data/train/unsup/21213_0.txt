Cough! Cough! Excuse me I just walked out of the casino!  I forgot how it felt to be suffocated indoors with a bunch of smokers.  Sorry smokers no pun intended :)  This casino is a huge circle period....with a crappy bar in the middle.  Food court was decent because they have some popular brand name restaurants.  I went to the club when they first opened....yah! Are those booths to sit or for me to fall asleep?  Let's just say it wasn't much to experience - thank god I got in free!  If your hands are itchy and need to throw some money at the casino quick...this place does alright, but if you need to be entertained...go to Casino AZ
