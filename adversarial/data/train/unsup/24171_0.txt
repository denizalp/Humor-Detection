Local business caters to corporate cafeterias; unfortunately training is lacking and food prep is eek! Food has improper storage and easy attraction for varmints. Repetitive menus focus on carbs and starch, not flavor.  A soggy precooked breakfast burrito is hard to swallow in our awesome foodie city. \n\nDisappointing Turnover with grill chefs. There does not appear to be loyal followers here...
