Picking a yoga studio is a tricky.  What makes or breaks a studio for people has as much to do with the quality of the showers and change rooms as the quality and style of teachers.  If you are looking for a relaxing, spa experience, this is not the studio for you.\n\nDownward Dog is a busy studio.  Busy, popular classes can have as many as 40-60 students.  In the summer this can mean hot, steamy and crowded classes.   Classes in the small room (usually reserved for intro classes) might have 6-15  people.  \n\nBusy classes may have an additional 1-2 instructors to provide adjustments with alignment.  If you want more or don't want adjusting, let the teachers know ahead of time to get the most from your experience.\n\nCLASSES OFFERED\nThere are occasional meditation and yoga nidra classes offered, but the studio predominantly offers very physical, Ashtanga influenced, vinyasa flow classes.\n\nFOR NEWBIES\nDD offers some of the most physically challenging classes in the City.  That being said, if you are new to yoga, want a little more hands on instruction, or simply want to brush up on the basics, you should consider taking their Intro to Yoga and\/or Level Prep classes.  These focus on more instruction and providing breakdown of postures and preparatory options to harder postures, and less emphasis on maintaining or exploring flow and linkages in a practice.\n\nPrep and Intro classes are some of the best you'll find and will provide a foundation to really let you see the potential benefit of a regular practice.  If you want to learn yoga, this is a good place to start.\n\nFOR EXPERIENCED PRACTITIONERS\nIn general, a Level 1 class at Downward Dog is likely going to feel like a Level 1-2 \/ 2 class at most other studios.  The classes will provide less instruction than a Prep or Intro class, and assume a grounding or awareness of the basic standing postures.  Classes will be quite challenging and the level of hands on adjustment really depends on the instructor, the overall apparent needs of the group, and whether or not you've told the instructor in advance that you are new and would like a little help and guidance.\n\nFOR ADVANCED PRACTITIONERS\nDownward Dog's more advanced classes (Level 1-2, Yoga Jam, Ujjayi Pulse, and Primary Series) offer a level of challenge, excitement and exploration that you will be hard pressed to find offered at any other studio in the City.  \n\nThis is the strength of the studio and NOT for new students.  \n\nThey are physically and mentally challenging, fast paced and assume a solid awareness (not necessarily refinement) of the fundamental and standing Ashtanga postures.  That being said, I've seen newcomers get completely whipped but hooked because of the challenge, and also experienced people leave completely intimidated and turned off at the difficulty.  YMMV\n\nSome classes (Yoga Jam, Primary Series) are filled with VERY experienced practitioners, and MANY instructors.  There are few studios in the city that can offer instruction to advanced level INSTRUCTORS and DD is one of them.\n\nMYSORE STYLE SELF PRACTICE\nIf you want to further or improve an existing practice, Downward Dog's Mysore classes are a unique offering in the City.\n\nThey offer instructors qualified to safely and effectively teach Primary, Intermediate, and Advanced postures.\n\nUnlike a traditional Mysore class, you are not restricted to following the prescribed Ashtanga Primary Series, and can incorporate any sequence that you feel works for you, from any variety of yoga styles. \n\nIf you can \"entertain\" yourself for at least an hour (or are able to follow along to a Primary Series \"cheat sheet\"), Mysore classes at Downward Dog really offer the best environment for 1:1 teaching and learning, and one of the only environments outside of a special workshop, to explore postures that you may have seen on Youtube.\n\nIf you have an existing self-practice, and want an inspiring environment to practice in, Mysore classes are definitely the ticket.  Morning classes with David are significantly less crowded and offer the opportunity for extended 1:1 instruction and support, while late afternoon weekday classes with Ron can be quite crowded offering less opportunity for adjustments.\n\nDownward Dog is an inspiring studio, offering a level of instruction and physical challenge very hard to find at any other studio.  Assess your personal yoga needs and ability, choose your class wisely, and you may find this to be the studio for you. \n\n If you have a macho friend who thinks Yoga is for wusses, take them here and get them schooled.
