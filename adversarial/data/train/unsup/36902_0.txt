My mom and I tried this place out before hitting the mall during her most recent visit to town. Our first impression was the space and decor. It's very large and open, contemporary and easy to people watch... one of our favorite sports. We came after lunch and just before dinner on a Sunday. There was a significant crowd giving the time of day and day of the week. They were only serving flatbread and dinner salads at the time and we settled on sharing two flatbreads. I ordered the Pesto and she the Fig & Prosciutto along with a  pitcher of the white sangria. \n\nWe sat in the bar area in some leather couches and sofas that line the bar. Very comfortable but we could have done with a larger table being that there were only two of us and we had a hard time managing in a space that was meant for 4.\n\nThe Pesto flatbread was my favorite of the two. Roasted garlic cloves, lots of cheese, fresh tomato... what more could one want? The pesto was very good and gave the perfect amount of flavor. It was my ideal flatbread. The fig & prosciutto was good as well. It was a very unexpected pairing with fig, prosciutto, goat cheese and spinach. Being that goat cheese is one of my favorites, I felt like it was lacking. I probably wouldn't order this again but it wasn't tragic either by any means, just not exactly my taste. The white sangria was great. Very refreshing and an interesting combination of juices and flavors. I just wish that the pitcher wasn't more ice than sangria. \n\nOur service wasn't fantastic nor was it awful as others have described. \n\nAlthough I didn't order off of it the wine list was very extensive but it was also on the pricey side.
