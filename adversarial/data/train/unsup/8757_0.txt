This is for real my new favorite place to eat for casual dining in Charlotte. I've always loved Peruvian style chicken but for the price and the quality, this place can't be beat! Not to mention the staff is top notch and super attentive and helpful.\n\nI can't wait to eat there again. I dream about it sometimes.
