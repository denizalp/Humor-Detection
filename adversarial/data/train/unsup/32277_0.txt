Came in for pho around midnight. Service was excellent! Hands down the best service we've received at a local restaurant. The server was kind, joyous, and attentive. Brought us hot tea and waters upon arrival. We started off with potstickers and egg rolls. Both came accompanied with nicely made sauces. Needless to say, both of our apps were perfectly delicious! Main course was pho. We ordered p12 (rare steak and tripe) which was large enough for two. Ohhhh myyyy goood!!!! BEST pho in town!! It has such delicious, fresh flavors! We fell in love and totally pigged out! Lolol \n\nIn all, I certainly recommend this gem!!! We look forward to our next visit which has to be very soon! \n\nXoxo
