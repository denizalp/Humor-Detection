I went to Sommet on Wednesday after seeing the 7p reformer class featured on Groupon Now. The studio is in an easy location with plenty of parking.\n\nIt's a great space with a few reformers, weights, treadmills & TRX bands. I was lucky enough to have a private class with Teresa for the hour. She started with an assessment of my posture and overall body composition. We did a few exercises on the floor & then began work on the reformer. Teresa was very patient & did a great job of explaining everything to me. We finished & she gave me a lot of helpful suggestions on stuff I can do on my own in order to improve my posture. So nice!\n\nThey offer both private & small group sessions which are pretty pricey (in my opinion), but it may just be worth it - comparing my posture from 7p to 8p was amazing! Good for mind & body.
