I was CRAVING banana creme pie after dinner the other night so of course, what did I do? Search it on Yelp! The Pie Hole was one of the first and closest options that came up so we decided to give it a shot. The best part, they have 5\" mini pies that are perfect for 1 --- errr, 2. I ended up saving half for later! We arrived around 9 PM so they were only open for another hour and were out of a lot of their pies (If you're looking for something special, call first!) but thank goodness they had what I came for!  It was SUPER delicious and whether you're craving pie or looking for a fancy treat to give a friend, their 5\" minis are fab! The place itself is also adorable and makes a great trendy {locally owned} hangout spot! Their story is fantastic and I enjoyed reading it while sitting at their bar and eating my mini pie! I can't wait to try more of their flavors!
