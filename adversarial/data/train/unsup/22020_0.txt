The club is PACKED, the music is HOT, and the line to the ladies room is RIDICULOUS x100. It's Vegas AND Tao is one of the top clubs on the strip- what else would you expect?\n\nThe music is mostly hip hop with a splash of top 40 and rock classics (Queen, Joan Jett, etc). The last time I went, it was good. This time, we were unlucky to hear the playlist twice! Ew, clubs should never EVER replay songs over and over in the same night.\n\nAs for the drinks, stick to shots. Regular mixed drinks are pretty disappointing. My ketel one-tonic was like 95% tonic. If you're in for the long haul, go for table service so you'll have strong drinks + somewhere to sit and rest the tired feet.\n\nIt can be pain to walk up\/down 2 flights of stairs, especially if you're stuck behind slow drunk people or people who stop to take pictures on the stairs every 5 steps.\n\nHighlight of the night: Seth Macfarlane doing a musical number (celebrating his Birthday).
