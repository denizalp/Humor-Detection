Just ate my first \"all-dressed\" pizza from Woodland. As I was eating the third slice, I was wondering whether a pepperoni pizza had been delivered by mistake. I was quite disappointed as there were hardly any vegetables. I had to look for the few thinly sliced mushrooms and the barely there small pepper pieces. Also, the crust was quite soggy. As a pepperoni pizza, it was o.k. but nothing to write home about! I was expecting better with all the favourable reviews. Will have to go back to ordering from Mory's pizza.
