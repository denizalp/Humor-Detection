I haven't been to an Outback in a long time as the one where we live is always so busy. So since we were traveling and there was a wait at the Logan Steakhouse (near our hotel), we opted for Outback. The first thing I didn't like was that they sat us in a booth by the bar and the entrance to the kitchen. I didn't say anything because we were way past our dinner hour, so we sat and quickly ordered. The waitress dragged her serving cart as opposed to picking up the tray and carrying the bottom part. This was unpleasant to hear and to sit by. I've been a waitress and part of the job is carrying the meals to the table. If you can't do that, maybe you are in the wrong profession. The second thing that was unpleasant was that we ordered the sirloin steak and it came perfectly cooked but slathered in pepper. It was really hard to eat. The potato was delicious, as was the salad, but the steak, the main attraction, was almost a perfect miss. Not sure what is going on with this restaurant, but it needs to have management take a good look at the wait staff and the chef. Can't say I'll be returning to any Outback in the future.
