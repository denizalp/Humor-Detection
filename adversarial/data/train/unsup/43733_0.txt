I've driven by Fuku Burger dozens of times, and finally stopped in today.  I ordered the Chicken Katsu burger as a combo.  They say that the combo saves $2.00, and when a small drink costs $2.55, that's not the bargain it might seem.  My chicken seemed to be slightly overcooked, and the advertised katsu sauce was not the type to which I am accustomed.  That being said. It was still tasty.  The fries were excellent, well cooked and seasoned.\n\nSo, why 4* when my sandwich was just good, not great?  Well, several things.  The staff was very nice and helpful.  The decor was very cool.  Heck, having Ultraman on the ceiling is virtually worth 1* by itself.  They have WiFi.  And, I'll definitely go back again.  We'll see if the rating changes at that point.
