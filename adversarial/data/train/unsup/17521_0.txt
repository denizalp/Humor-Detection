I have visited this restaurants a few times, and this is my conclusion.  This restaurant is inconsistent, especially in service.  \n\nOnce, a server slam down the noodle at our table when I was conversing in English with a Japanese friend.  Then, both of us converse in Japanese with the waitress, the waitress said, \"Oh! I didn't know you speak Japanese.\" Her attitude had a 180Â° changed. It's one of those people who think their country is better kind of Asian discrimination.  Since then, I haven't  seen the women works there anymore.  Apparently, she resigned.  \n\nThen, around 3pm on Saturday 9\/26\/2015 was my last visit.  There were two waitress that we encountered.  One who has a long hair was very nice and professional.  I don't think she was suppose to be our server.  \n\nA short hair server was rude. She was the first to approach to take order and ask, \"Are you ready to order?\"  My husband decided to order some skewer not knowing that you have to fill in those order on a price of paper; this waitress rolled her eyes and stop taking orders and in a commanding tone she said, \" Write it down.  You have to write it down.\" when she has pen and paper in her hands.  That order paper was just within her reach as well. Instead of filled it out as her job requires, she turned away quickly and said, \"I will be back.\" without given us time to response, she left to hide behind the register.  (Assuming to poke her own nose...) \n\nThen, I signal her to come back, first thing she said ask was, \"Did you write it down?\"  My husband burst into laughter at her demeanor.  I calmly told her, \"it's rude to talk to customer this way.\"  Then she swiftly apology saying English is not her first language. (I didn't have a chance to say, it s not your language ability; it's your demeanor poses as rudeness throughout.)  \n\nThis is not the first time that this server being rude to customer.   I have wittiness her rudeness to other customers in the past.  She can be extremely professional when her manager is around and extremely rude when there no manager.  It's like getting a bipolar server.  Funny, really!  \n\nAfter I directly confronted her shortcoming, we have a different server at our table. The short hair server went hiding completely. Can't see her on the floor at all. Sympathy to her colleague who works the entire restaurant by herself the entire meal.  There were about four additional tables right after we sat down with one server working. \n\nIn terms of food, I used to enjoy many dishes of their food until my visit on Saturday. The popular dish of Minced Cheese katsu used to be wonderful but the taste has changed completely on Saturday as if it was done by a different chef.  The awful pungent smell of mince meat and cheese!  Everything tasted different too greasy during this last visit. \n\nI suspect a change of management or main chef; this inconsistency in taste has never happened in the past for three years.  \n\nComing to this restaurant is like playing lottery; you can get a wonderful experience or the opposite.
