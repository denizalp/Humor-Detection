This review is strictly on the PORK BELLY BAO.\n\nIt is absolutely amazing. The PORK BELLY BAO is 5 stars hands down...if anything, it should be 6 stars because its that bloody hell guud.\n\nThe texture, the way the fat touches and melts in your mouth, the aromatic smell, the plating, every single thing about the PORK BELLY BAO was delicious.\n\nSo luxurious, so scrumptious, so heavenly. the most amazing PORK BELLY BAO that I have ever tasted.\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n\nUNTIL THEN!! ^-^
