La meilleure creme glac√©e a Montreal! My absolute favorite. The owner is a dedicated, talented man who has a passion for all things delicious. Handmade, artisan ice cream at it's best. My favorite is the kulfi ice cream, an Indian spice ice cream that is as tasty as it is original. Other wonderful flavors are salty chocolate, strawberry basil sorbet and maple. The flavors change around a lot, they did offer a vegan ice cream (cherry tofu!) although I'm not sure if it's still around. The staff is efficient, kind and attentive, the shop is clean and there's nothing to complain about, at least for me.\n\nSeriously, if you're eating ice cream anywhere else in Montreal, you're missing out. Big time.
