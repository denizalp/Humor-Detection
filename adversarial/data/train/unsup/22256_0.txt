Dinner was great.  Same menu as lunch.  Mike was our server...super server and service.\n\nBusy place.  Not like lunch.  Quite a hustle, watch out for the bussers who will snatch your plate away as they are under great pressure from the blond hostess to \"clear that table.\"  Lots of in-motion wait staff.\n\nFood was great.  Even had dessert (not usual for us) and wife remarked over the coconut topped yellow cake that \"it was not dry, like so many other places.\"\n\nPrices were a bit high.  We each had a glass of wine.  Nice that they have wines grouped by red and white and then two sized glasses and finally selections by price.  Good idea and good selections to choose from.\n\nWife had side salad and ravioli, I had blackened grouper.  Not very blackened to me, so could have used more spice.  Bill was over $80 and they had taken wife's salad off the bill because they forgot to get it to her until she asked once she received our dinners. Would have been just under $90 without tip. Ummmm...\n\nMust have been the crowd, as our meals were lukewarm at best.  Too much customer, not enough pick-up.  Could have been a case where they were turning the tables rapidly, but once seated, the kitchen and wait staff could not keep the cycle going at a even pace.\n\nServers and customers took it in-stride.  Will not stop us from coming back.  Good selections and quality of food and preparations.
