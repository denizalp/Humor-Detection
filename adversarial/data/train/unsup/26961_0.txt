It's a decent gym but the parking situation is horrible, and has been for months. It will take on average 20 minutes to find parking in the 5:30-7 pm timeframe. The gym suggested you avoid peak hours (before work and after work) but that is difficult because, like most people, I work during business hours. Unless you qualify for a reduced rate based on your income, it is hardly inexpensive. I'm glad they're doing something to fix the parking now, but the reality is it should have been fixed years ago.
