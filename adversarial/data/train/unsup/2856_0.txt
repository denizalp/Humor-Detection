I went to Flat Iron because I liked the look of their menu online and I had a daily deal for $50.  I brought along 2 of my girls for a Friday night dinner of appetizers.  \n\nWhen you walk into Flat Iron, you kind of feel like you're walking into a nuclear reactor in meltdown mode.  This is because everything glows with a lovely red hue.  The place wasn't busy at all and despite certain death we were shown to a beat up table next to the bathroom.  Lovely.  I don't know about you, but if it was my last meal on earth, I'd  like to sit as far away from the bathroom as possible.\n\nWe moved to a non-bathroom table and were greeted promptly by a friendly server who quickly brought us a round of waters as we wanted to experience the apocalypse without mind altering beverages.\n\nWe shared three appies - deep fried pickles, calamari, and lettuce wraps.  The pickles are exactly the same as those at the Ship and arrive with a fantastic dip.  The calamari was ok, could have been seasoned a bit better, and the tzatziki was a miss, more pickle dip would do well here.  The lettuce wraps were uber salty.  If the nuclear meltdown doesn't kill you, the sodium in these bad boys will.  These were accompanied by a sneaky upsell by our server \"Would you like chicken or shrimp?\" (We didn't know that a few pieces of chicken were an extra $4.50, but who trifles with such matters when the world is ending?)\n\nFinally, we shared the molten chocolate dessert.  A great way to finish an ok meal, but to be fair, it's really just a warm brownie with ice cream.  If it says molten, I want to tempt fate by burning my mouth on some melty chocolate dammit.\n\nOverall, we got out of there alive, though it was close at times.  Ultimately, we agreed that the dim lighting makes the furnishings look better than they are.  Unfortunately, since we weren't drinking, we didn't feel the same about the food or the ambiance.
