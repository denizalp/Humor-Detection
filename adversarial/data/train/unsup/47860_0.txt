Outstanding. Maybe the best meal I've ever had in Pittsburgh. We got (in very, very rough order of how much we liked them):\n\nSobrasada\nOxtail\nSerrano ham\nSalt cod croquettes\nOctopus\nBeef tartare\nBeets\nOlives\nPatatas bravas\nChurros\nQueso\n\nThis was a ton of food for two people -- we were both incredibly stuffed after, and yet there were still more things on the menu we would have liked to have tried (eg brussel sprouts, ribs, and especially more charcuterie). That said, we really liked all of the above, and I'd be fine getting any of those dishes (besides for maybe the queso) again.\n\nHighly recommend this place.
