I'm glad that we finally have a pho place on this side of town... The menu looks great and has many different options..\n\nI had been to the other Viet Bistro location before so I came in expecting really good fragrant broth. I don't know if it's because I got shrimp pho but I was not a fan of this location's broth at all. I did enjoy the shrimp and pork salad which was basically like a naked spring roll!\n\nThe service was ok but there was a major language barrier as the server barely spoke any English..
