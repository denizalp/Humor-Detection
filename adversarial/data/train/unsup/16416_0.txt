We took bagels and cheesecake to go--which reminds me, I still have the cheesecake in the fridge. BRB FOOLS. \n\nYum! Now that I have been reminded what a delicious cheesecake this is, I feel I have the strength to write the rest of this review. My friend and I got the strawberry cheesecake for our late-night Netflix girltime dessert fancies, and bagels and cream cheese for the next morning's airport run shenanigans. \n\nI tend to like a more dense, fatty, hilariously-bad-for-you cheesecake, but this one is light and airy and is a-okay for me. The fruit on top is good, but I don't like the red-40 laced syrup they drizzle on top of it. Next time I'll just get the plain because it's a good cheesecake overall.\n\nHowever, the real winners here are the namesake of the Cafe--the bagelssssss. I got spinach and feta, my friend got the egg bagel with everything on it. Both were good, though after spending the night in the fridge, were nearly impossible to cut. I eventually got them both in the toaster and gobbled all those carbs at 7am (which led me to sleepy time for most of the rest of the day). \n\nAll in all a decent place. I want to try it as a restaurant instead of a deli, too. Good thing it's right down the street from my best friends' house so I have an excuse to visit!
