I recently went with my mom to get her arm worked on and ED was her tattoo artist. He did a small one on my back that ended up getting extremely faded and scarred because my shirt got stuck to it while it was healing. Now, because of the way mine turned out, I had such a sore spot for the shop. I always told people never to go there. But we'll get back to that later!\n\nSo we went in and he seemed like any normal tattoo artist. Just looking to get work in. So after him sketching out the tattoo, he called us back and he started with my moms piece. As soon as he began, he opened up. We talked about all kinds of things and he was SO friendly. All of the guys who were in the shop that day were.\n\nHe had taken a short break and when he came back, he noticed the tattoo on my back and made a face. My mom saw it and she asked him what the face was for. He didn't answer and went back to tattooing. My sister and I left to grab some food and while we were gone, my mom explained to him what happened to my tattoo. He asked who did it and then answered himself. As soon as we got back, he said he would fix it for free, as he didn't want his work looking like that. \n\nAll in all, he was great. My mom's tattoo turned out AMAZING and I'm scheduling my touch up for next week.\n\nEd really is great and the prices are, as well. It's a great place for people wether it's their first or fiftieth tattoo. Today's visit DEFINITELY changed my mind about the shop. They are awesome!
