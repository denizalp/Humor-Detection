Got one of their lunch special beef dish and it tasted dry and bland. I think they may have just reheated the beef. Rice and veggies were okay. Lemongrass soup that came with the dish tasted meh. \n\nPad thai looked good, get pad thai.  \n\nThis place is located on the upper floor of a building, so it feels somewhat nicer and there is some Thai music playing in the background.
