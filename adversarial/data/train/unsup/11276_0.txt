After waiting 40 mins in -13 degree weather we finally grabbed a table for four right beside the bar. \n\nI was cursing the entire time while waiting in line, wanting to go down the street and just have something else, but the long line of people battling the cold temps reassured me that the food and atmosphere would be one not comparable to many others. \n\nAs soon as we walked in, we were warped back in time to the 90's with their lime green fluorescent booths and playlist of wicked 90s hits playing (Backstreet Boys, Vanilla Ice, MC Hammer etc.)  \n\nThe order: hungry gal with bacon with an extra egg ($2) and side of Peamel bacon ($3). Total cost : $15. Came with Apple slaw salad, potato hash brown & toast. \n\nIn response to some of the other reviews saying the serving size was small.. I feel that maybe you just didn't order enough food lol. For $15 I was full till dinner. \n\nThe service was good, they forgot my peamel bacon at first, but it eventually came out after I told them. Coffee was bottomless, they only asked me to refill it once though. \n\nOverall it was great. All the other food we ordered was good, the cappuccinos were also delicious too. \n\nI do recommend coming here if you've never been, I personally wouldn't wait longer than an hour, especially in the cold.. the food was better than good, but for the hype this place has it's not worth TOO LONG of a wait, if you get what I mean.
