Not at all what I expected. But in a good way. I expected an hour long foot massage. Nope. Not even close. It's mostly a body massage with very little time spent on your feet. Weird, why call it a food massage then?\nI was certainly useasy at first. It's an \"open\" area, and you have to be VERY quiet (I'm NOT known for being quiet). You stay in your clothes, which I liked too.\nIt's pretty much a full body massage, not the same as Massage Envy, but similar.\n\nFor $20 bucks, and a $10 tip, well worth the money.\nCheck it out and see for yourself!
