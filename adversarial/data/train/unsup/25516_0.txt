I've been a frequent at this place for years, enough that the managers pretty much recognize my whole family. And I have to say, this is probably my favorite Chinese place for lunch.\n\nFirst of all, the place is HUGE. My relatives have booked this place as a venue for weddings, events, gatherings, and we usually get a good experience. On some days when you come at a busy time, it's not that bad of a wait because of how many tables there are! I remember waiting in a line past the door a few times to be seated, but maybe this has changed?\n\nFOOD! I honestly think it's great here, though it is a bit expensive for what it offers. I prefer the lunch dim sum, letting them wheel carts as you take your pick. It's nice because I'm definitely not a decisive person, so I usually just get the tastiest looking stuff on the carts. A favorite is the crap shrimp ball things (? lol), the siu mai, dumplings, they're all very good. I also love the green vegetable plates or the scallops here, they're cooked well and I've never had any rubbery or overcooked meat.\n\nSERVICE is all pretty good too imo, a lot of the cart ladies speak broken English and a bit of a Vietnamese so it's not too hard for us. They're usually fast too, bringing drinks\/sauces\/plates when we ask right away. \n\n\n\nI would definitely recommend this place to people! The reason it's a 4 is because I find the dinner experience to be a bit disappointing; often our dishes are just warm or sometimes cool when we order them. However, I love coming back at lunch, I think the dim sum is a fun and tasty experience. Actually I go almost every week and I've not noticed any drop in quality, so this place will probably remain my goto Chinese lunch for now!
