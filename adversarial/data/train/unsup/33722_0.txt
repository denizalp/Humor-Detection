The concierge at our hotel recommended this place for us when we asked about renting kayaks for Salt River. I called up to ask for rates and specifics. The owner goes by Captain Ted and he was more than patient in explaining the rates. Despite the short notice, we made an appointment to drop by the next morning to pick up two kayaks. He strapped the boats onto the top of our rental car, went over all the equipment we needed, and took the time to explain which parts of the river we should explore. \n\nCaptain Ted works out of his private residence is located 20 minutes from Salt River. His rates are fair and he was a joy to do business with.
