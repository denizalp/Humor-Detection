Rotating my way through the Vietnamese restaurants on South Tryon, tonight's takeout was from Doan's. I did not order ahead, so I was expecting a bit of a wait when I placed my order at the counter. No such thing. My two huge tubs of Pho with side items in separate styrofoam containers was ready in less than five minutes. Nicely plated so that it was all fresh when it arrived home, I had the chicken and the beef eye separate, with bean sprouts, lime, jalapeno, noodles, chopped green onions and sliced onions as well as two small pots of hoisin and Sirracha. Very impressive.\n\nI also got an order of summer rolls which were quite fresh and tasty after a ten minute car ride.\n\nTwo huge pho and the summer rolls, less than $24. Good deal!
