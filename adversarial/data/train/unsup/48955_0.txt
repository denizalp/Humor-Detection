I made an appointment and they said that they would be at my residence by 6:00 p.m. on Friday evening. I paid some big muscle to move my furniture and other belongings outside of the house so I could have everything clear and ready for the guy to come clean the carpets. I even had the house cleaners vacuum the carpet and extra time to make sure everything was perfect. The guy never showed up and never called. And lost money on this deal because I had to pay to put my household items in furniture back in the house and will have to repay to have it moved out once I find a reliable carpet cleaner that is willing to show up when they say they will.
