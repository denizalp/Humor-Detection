If I were to rate Joe's Midnight Run solely on food, I would give it 3 stars. However, this place overall is definitely a 4. I love that they are open until 2 am - it's the best place for late night munchies. The vibe is great, the servers are cool and the drinks are top notch. This place is perfect for either drinks with your friends or date night. They play cool music and the ambiance is spectacular. As far as food, I would get the frittes. The french fries with the garlic aoli is delicious. I've also had the arroz negro which I thought was just okay. For the \"Biggies\", I had the Pork Chop which was recommended to me by our server. It was good but take note, they cook it medium. I looked it up and I guess since it is a good cut of pork chop, it is safe to eat it medium. But still - I was uncomfortable eating the pink part of the pork. The server did warn me that that's how they cook it. I ate part of it, took it home and cooked the rest of it. It was delicious but not worth the $24. \n\nNeedless to say, we will be frequenting Joe's Midnight Run. I wouldn't go anywhere else for late night munchies.
