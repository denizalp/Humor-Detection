DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!!!!!!!   I just went there for lunch and there is only one word that describes it accurately DISGUSTING.   Not only did we spend $45 for lunch but the food was not even good.   I ordered a Pizza and it was RAW DOUGH and all the toppings were sliding off and in general you could tell the pizza was undercooked.  When I approached someone who worked there their response was \"that is how it is supposed to be - mushy\" \"that is how we cook our pizza here\"  Although I was clearly unsatisfied, no one came to follow up for me and there didn't seem to be a manager in site.     I work just around the corner from there and needless to say I will never be back.  My advise, save your money and go to the superstore across the street who makes better fresh pizza then the \"Italian\" place.
