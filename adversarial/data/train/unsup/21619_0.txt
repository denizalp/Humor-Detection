Eek! This is a mall? According to what standard? Looks more like a plaza with a hidden back alley that got turned into shops to resemble a mall. \n\nSeriously? I think you're more apt to get mugged here while \"window shopping\" than you would by walking through a bad area of the city. Reason being, you'd never see it coming.\n\nThe plaza and the mall appear to be in severe ill repair, and judging by the choice of font used for the outdoor signage, I'd say this building was big in 1973. Dynomite!! \n\nIf it wasn't for the Passport office located upstairs, and the couple of restaurants in the plaza, I fear this mall would see zero traffic. \n\nCome for the passports and get cozy.... You're gonna be here for awhile.
