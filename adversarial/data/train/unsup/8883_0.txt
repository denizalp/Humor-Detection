I like this place because it is my new go to boba spot on Spring Mountain, since I don't care much for the other choices nearby.  A good sign is that their boba (tapioca balls, pearls) is made well here. I like the way their menu is organized and it tells you which drinks are caffeine free or dairy free. The best drink I've had here is the Okinawa coffee, which had a strong coffee flavor with a brown sugar base. The winter melon smoothie is great for those who want the winter melon flavor without the caffeine. Personal preference, I like winter melon tea or milk teas, so I'll have to try those next time! The longan fresh milk had real bits of longan and it was not that sweet of a drink.  The Hokkaido smoothie tasted good, but it had a Hokkaido taste I was not familiar with. I was getting coconut undertones with this drink.  The interior is cute and comfortable with cat decor everywhere! ***3.75 overall :)\n\n*****Yelp 2016 100 challenge*****\n29\/100
