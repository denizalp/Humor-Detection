I really like this place because 1) it's in midtown 2) they make good food 3) our server Maggie was awesome - patient and on top of her shizzzzz.\n\nOne of my friends got his meal way later than ours and then his bill was messed up but she took care of it like a pro and made everyone happy. That's proper service, thanks Maggie!\n\nThey play mainstream EDM and I caught myself fist pumping at times but it was on a loop.  They need to extend their playlist but all in all a wicked spot to check out.
