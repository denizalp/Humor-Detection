Over the past couple of years our family has worked with Lynn Bunch and the consultants at ID.  I can honestly say that our family has been through a lot in the past 3 years.  We have had serious illness, a couple deaths in the family, a grandchild born and an enormous amount of personal growth.  The support we received from ID has been amazing.  Our lives would have been filled with so much pain, struggle and fear if it weren't for you ALL.  \n\nRecently I just completed my last of 9 classes.  The class can be attended live or for those on the go on DVD.  If you go the DVD route BUY the support package.  It is the best way to absorb the information, confirm you are going the right direction and brings even more clarity to the work. The other great thing about this work is that not only can my wife and I take classes but so have our children and soon our grandchild.\n\nOne of the other things I love about the teaching is there is practical application everyday and now that I have completed all the course work I am sooooo looking forward to taking the information deeper by joining the group the focuses on Mastering Intuitive Living.\n\nThank you ID for all that you have done for me and my family!
