Happy Valentine's Day!\n\nI write this review on Valentine's Day because I'm just a romantic guy and nothing says \"Happy Valentine's\" better than a great pair of running and lifting shoes.  I admit, I am one lucky dude. I have the perfect girlfriend and for special occasions we get each other things that we're going to use like gym clothes, lifting gloves, protein bars, steaks, desserts, and shoes. We were both in need for some shoes.  She needed a good pair of running shoes.  I needed a good gym shoe with a flat sole for squatting\/deadlifting.  We arrived at New Balance and were both serviced like we are the King and Queen of Summerlin.  \n\nMy girlfriend is no amateur to long distance running and only gets shoes that are properly fitted to her feet and style of running.  She found the exact shoe that she wanted, tried them on, and walked around the store with them.  While she was test driving her shoe, I found a pair of NB trainers that I have been eyeing for a long time and it was discounted significantly since the newer models are out.  NB had my size and I immediately done some body weight squats, weightless deadlifts, and burpees.  No, I'm joking.  I didn't do the burpees.  I paid for my girlfriend's shoes, she paid for mine. Happy Valentine's to us!!   I'm sure that we will be back for our next pair of running shoes.  The overall service is great.  Larry and the team at New Balance took really good care of us.
