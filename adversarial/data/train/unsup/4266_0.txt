Smack yo mamma in the mouth good!!!!! I'm so glad and fatter now that there is a Rail in Strongsville! On a Friday night, just before 6pm we waited only 15-20 minutes! The service and food was wonderful.(as always) I'm glad the rail delivered because my family and I were entertaining a colleague of mine from Portsmouth, Ohio and boy was he impressed!  \n  If you need to know more about the best burger joint in town, dare I say the state? Then just check my reviews of one of their older locations. They've got a great brand and they're keeping it great! We may need to think about a sixth star!
