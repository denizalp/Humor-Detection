Decided to grab a bite here before our High Roller experience.  I ordered the drunken fish tacos....one word: delicious! I tried  a piece of my sisters burger and it was just as delicious as the tacos.  I loved how there side order of fries came with a variety of fries (straws, waffle and steak fries).  I underestimated this restaurant and I would highly recommend trying this restaurant out when in Vegas!
