I'm in Vegas this week and Tea Station was recommended to me by a friend who swears this is the best place around to get boba milk tea. Boy was she wrong because I ended up walking out of the store! \n\nThe reviews on here about the ass backward customer service are absolutely correct. I walk up to the To Go counter and a douche kabob of an employee walks over and just stares at me with a pad. I'm just like \"ok hi I'll take a medium boba milk tea with grass jelly please.\" And then he says \"you got cash??\" \n\nUh..is it me or does it now feel like I am in the middle of some drug deal? And why does it matter if I have cash? \n\nMe, \"errrrrr...I just have a credit card and three bucks.\" \n\nDouche Kabob, \"yeaaaaaa it's a $10 minimum (points to sign)\" \n\nMe, \"dude, I'm not going to order ten dollars worth of your stuff so that I can just use a credit card. I just want a drink.\" \n\nDouche Kabob, \"sorry I can't do anything then.\" \n\nMe, \"well I'll go somewhere else then (walks out)\" \n\nSome advice to the Douche Kabobs of Tea Station: if you are going to run a business based on drinks which run about 4 dollars on average...maybe you should consider joining the rest of America and allow paying customers to use their credit cards with no minimum. Because you look like jackasses otherwise and now, instead of a glowingly positive review, there's another negative one about your store on the internet for public consumption.
