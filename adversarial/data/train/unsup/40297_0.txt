One of the best buffets I have ever been to! Delicious mounds of crab legs! (Although the ones that are pre cut, making it easier to get to the meat, are tougher and don't taste as good.) \n\nI went during the week, and they had Kobe beef, and other meats that you would think would only be out on their weekend buffet. \n\nNice selection of food: Italian, Chinese, Japanese, salad bar, bread bar, appetizer bar, and large assortment of decorative desserts.
