Expected better from all the raving reviews. Two of us got the Paella, we both agreed it tasted liked boxed Spanish rice, chicken on the skewer was dry and tough and the frys with it were just Ore Ida frozen ones. Tried the chicken liver appetizer, this was tasty, but I'm not sure why everyone on this site is raving about the toast, it's actually just white Wonder bread. Took 3 hours for us to get our food, owner did say it would take a while, (claiming it's all fresh made), it's more like they only have to burners on the stove and 1 sauce pan, literally brought out 1 dish then would have to wait 10-15 minutes for someone else's dish (not busy either, only 5 other people there).  Over-rated and more expensive.
