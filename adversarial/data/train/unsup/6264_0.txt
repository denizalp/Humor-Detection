I had driven by Cafe Posada a million times and finally decided to stop in after we tried to hit Joe's Farm Grill for the Friday Fish Fry (they had run out).  The sign outside said \"Under Old Management\" which indicated to me that this was a good time to try it. It must be good!\n\nAlas.\n\nThis is Mexican food like your white momma used to make. Think black olives from a can served on top of sour cream, shredded cheese, and some sort of variation of meat\/beans. \n\nAnd we actually had to ask if they served alcohol because there wasn't an alcohol menu and the waitress didn't offer.
