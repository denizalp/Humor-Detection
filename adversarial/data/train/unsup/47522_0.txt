I needed a latticed patio cover and cement patio extension. I contacted four contractors for their assessments and estimates. While all three contractors bid within a $100 of each other,I selected Celebrity Patio due to the professionalism of the project scoping and estimate of Ken Jones, as well as references 'on line', and from within our Community here in Summerlin. The work was accomplished as described and estimated. The workmanship and follow through of Ben Jones and his team was very professional. We recommend them.
