I do believe that I have consumed thousands of tacos in my lifetime. From Taco Bell to \"high end\" taco places. From West coast to East coast. From Alaska to Florida. In that time as being a certified taco connoisseur, I have yet to eat at the place that has been recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records as having the smallest taco in the world....until I found Comida.  Comida has created the micropenis of tacos. \n\nPending award:  highest cost by square inch. Good luck Comida!  \n\nAtmosphere:  A\nService:  B\nFood Quality:  B\nPortion size: Z
