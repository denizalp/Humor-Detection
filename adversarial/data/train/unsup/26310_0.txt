I took a private lesson in BJJ from Vinny Magalhaes here.\n\nIt is an amazing gym, very spacious and clean, and state of the art. The staff there were very friendly and welcoming. Very easy to get to. \n\nThis place is a must visit for any martial arts enthusiast wanting to get some training in while in Vegas
