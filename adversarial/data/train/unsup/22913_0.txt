David Williams constant twitter hype, long days at the 2011 WSOP, people willing to pickup your food for you.  Nuff said.\n\nThe burgers are creative with strong Asian flavors that really satisfy after a long day of grinding.  Props to the mushroom burger (shitake and wasabi mayo) and the spicy burger (chili infused mayo and kabayaki sauce).   The meat itself is what you would expect.  Its good and cooked well but hey, this is not the Burger Bar and you are not paying $15 for it.\n\nThese burgers are not for everyone.  They are juicy, greasy, basically messy to eat.  Wait too long and the bun is mush. But if you're one of us with the winning \"it's all good\" attitude, Fukuburger delivers.
