I'm not rating the product, only the customer service level of the older gentleman (owner\/worker) not sure of their status. I took my daughter since she wanted to see what they carried, since I boosted about this market. We were both very impressed and decided that this is where we will start purchasing most of our meats. However, the only thing that they do not carry, that my daughter loves are turkey chops. That will not be a problem. We didn't really make a purchase other than some cheese, that looked wonderful and I just had to try it. A little over $3 and I used my debit card. This gentleman with no personality, took my card that I handed to him. (Key words: \" I handed ). Rang my total and place my card on the counter. (Dear Lord, that makes my blood boil, hair stand on the back of my neck, eyes bleed). You know what I'm talking about. Placed my receipt on the counter for my signature. Took the receipt, no eye contact, placed in the drawer and never said \"thank you\" \"come again\" \"hit the road\"...nothing! I am going to try them again. I can assure you when it comes to customer service, \"3 strikes, you're out\", does not apply here. They will get one more chance. What's more annoying is that I have told several people about this market and each person has gone, made a purchase and loves the product. Maybe they should keep personality-less in the back and not have customer contact.
