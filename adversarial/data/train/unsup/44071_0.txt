It seems like everyone and then some was here to eat! This place is super busy but it is amazing how clean they keep it they have plenty of people on staff to get through the line quickly. It took a little bit to get our food but that is to be expected. The restaurant is beautiful and the staff really tries hard to do keep it clean. We even had someone attempting to smoke in the outside seating and the security from In-N-Out came out and told them to please put that out. Great job Mr security! We really appreciate that you guys really made this restaurant feel like they think the customers are really important. Try the 3 by 3 animal style with animal fries...You will love it!
