We ended up having a light dinner & cocktails here last minute before seeing KA. Glad we did because it was delicious! We ordered some appetizers and shared them. This was enough for the 5 of us (also ended up with 2 enormous baskets of assorted bread because we had about 4 different people waiting on us for some reason) - \n\n-Heirloom Tomato Caprese, Fresh Mozzarella, Basil Aioli, Aged Balsamic\n-Crispy Fried Calamari, Cucumber Slaw, Lemon, Gremolata Aioli\n-Saut√©ed Maine Crab Cakes, Tomato Relish, Basil Aioli\n-Mesquite Grilled Steak Skewers, Creamy Celery Salad, House Steak Sauce\n-Truffled Potato Chips, Maytag Blue Cheese Sauce\n\ncocktails- Prosecco, cucumber martini (favorite drink of the trip), orange blossom, pineapple mojito\n\nThe truffled potato chips were outstanding!!! I seriously could've eaten the whole plate myself. Very rich flavor and the bleu cheese was the best I've ever had. Steak skewers were my second favorite, really tender & the sauce was terrific. Calamari was good but didn't stand a chance against Federal Hill's.  Heirloom caprese salad was refreshing and the crab cakes were good but tiny. They did offer to give us an extra because only 4 came in an order.  Wish we had time for dessert because the chocolate beignets looked out of this world. Next time I'm in Vegas I'll def come back.
