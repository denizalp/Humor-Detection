My wife and I love donuts and are pretty picky about them. It is so great having an amazing donut place like Glaze in the southwest. It is by far the best in the area. They have some novelty donuts, but they don't get too crazy or try to do too much. \n\nWe were lucky enough to get their Samoan donuts (exactly like the Girl Scout cookie) and it is easily one of the best donuts I've ever had. \n\nI highly recommend Glaze!!!
