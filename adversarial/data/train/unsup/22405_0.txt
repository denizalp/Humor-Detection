I don't get it.  The number one flavor in America is vanilla.  I tasted the no sugar added vanilla and it was terrible.  They could take a lesson from Kroger's No Sugar added Vanilla ice cream.  Now that's a delicious ice cream.  \nSo then I bought the regular vanilla ice cream (medium) without asking for a taste.  Vanilla is vanilla right?  WRONG.  This was the most terrible tasting vanilla ice-cream ever.  I bought an ice cream for my son who ordered the mint chocolate and he loved it.  So the one star is for that.  It is a shame that you don't have a good regular vanilla ice cream.  \nThat is all I have to say.  Oh, BTW.  The two cost me $11.22.  You can take that sticker price if you eat it,  but my vanilla was not worth the calories so I dumped it.
