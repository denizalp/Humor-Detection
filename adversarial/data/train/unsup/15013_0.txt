After walking around Toronto today, I was hankering for a cultural activity in the evening. One Canadian tradition was a home game between the Maple Leafs and the Bruins. And there were certainly a lot of blue and white jerseys around just before this installment of Hockey Night in Canada.  However, I was more in the mood for theatre and for a \"feel good\" production.  And after considering Jersey Boys and the Sound of Music, I settled on another \"classic\" - the stage version of Dirty Dancing.\n\nThe Globe and Mail review of Dirty Dancing includes comments about fabulous choreography, enticing music, and exquisite visuals.  Spot on.  In particular, the actors who played the 3 main characters (Penny, Johnny, and Baby) were just plain fun to watch.  That included a favourite dancing scene featuring music by Eric Carmen (Hungry Eyes).\n\nAs for the Royal Alexandra Theatre, $40 got me a 2nd balcony seat with an acceptable obstructed view, an elegant venue, and a very pleasant and relaxed evening.  This theatre has a lot of history and class and I enjoyed the opportunity to be here.  And although Todd V. and I don't share the same opinion about musicals, I too would love to see a well-staged dramatic piece here.
