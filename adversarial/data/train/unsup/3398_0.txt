I went to Celsius when they first opened and I was impressed.  Unfortunately, I think they've gone down hill a bit since then.  It's probably been around 3 years since my initial visit, and I've been a handful of times since then - both to eat in and to take out.  \n\nI have to say, my most recent experience was very average.  The service was ridiculously slow, and the quality of the rolls we ordered was just mediocre. I was with 2 friends and all of our food came out at different times.  We had 2 servers taking care of us, but even between the two of them, they could not manage to keep our waters filled.  We ordered a variety of sushi including an order of salmon sashimi, a spicy tuna handroll, a tuna maki roll, futomaki, and another of their specialty rolls.  We also had a couple of miso soups and a salad.  \n\nI love sushi, and it's rare for me to allow extra sushi to go to waste, but last night, none of us wanted to finish the 6 or 8 extra pieces that lay on the table in front of us.  I think that is a sign that it was not so amazing...\n\nAnyways, the place was packed, and it's nice that they have a patio, but Celsius could probably stand to brush up on their service.  I can't complain too much though; it was $56 total for 3 of us; not bad for sushi!  However, I probably will not rush back to Celsius... I would probably choose to go to Malee's, Pure, or Sushi Brokers before returning. It's not bad, but just average, blah, mediocre, so-so.  I think you get the point!
