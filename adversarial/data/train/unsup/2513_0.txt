Safe and Loving Environment\n\nMy house was being painted and I needed to find a facility to take care of my three dogs while the paint job was being completed. That's when I came across \" Love Your Pets Too\" and I am so glad I did\n\nPaula and Richard have a passion for animals and it shows. It was great being able to leave my dogs at loving home rather than a dog facility. We even had a Meet and Greet prior to boarding and Paula immediately made me feel at ease that my pets  would be well cared for. \n\nPaula and Richard kept us updated daily by text messages, pictures, and daily videos. It was great being able to see just how well taken care of my dogs we're. I can't say enough positive things about our experience with Paula and Richard. We are so happy that we have found such a wonderful family to watch our pets.\n\n I will definitely use Paula and Richard again! I forgot to mention, Paula and Richard even picked up\/dropped off my pets!
