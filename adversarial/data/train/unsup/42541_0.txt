Mei Chuen has been an institution for fast cheap HK style Chinese restaurant in the Scarborough area.\n\nIt is open early 8 AM and close at 9 PM. So you can go there for breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea and dinner.\n\nThey have special set menu whole day long.. All of them comes with a choice of hot drinks (famous HK style milk tea is a must try, they are still served HK style in a extra thick teacup)\n\nAll the food here are ok, portions are big, the price is good and you never go home hungry!\n\nThere are daily special written on the board in the front, all written in Chinese, so you have to ask the servers about them.\n\nYou have to write your order on the order sheets that are on the table and the wait staffs will check your order and leave you a little receipt on the table. When you are done, just take the receipt to the cashier and paid there...\n\nNot the cleanliess.. so don't be surprise! You know what I mean when you go to the washrooms and see the signs they posted there.. :)\n\nCASH only!
