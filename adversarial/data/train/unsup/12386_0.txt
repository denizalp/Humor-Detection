Many, many kudos for all of your always delicious pizzas and bubbly brews, Brixx. We had a bitchy waitress who was trying to go home the entire time she was serving us, but the food was so good- I didn't even care.  \n\nWent on Friday for the late night buy one get one free deal (after 10pm).  Hummus plate, spinach artichoke dip, pear gorgonzola pizza, and spicy shrimp pizza.  Several rounds of ice cold Sam Adams for $2.50.  Sigh.  My quest for comparable pizza in Seattle continues as I have been spoiled by you bastards. \n\nYou delicious bastards.
