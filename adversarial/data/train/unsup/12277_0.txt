I will come back here, but I have to be careful. I came to buy one thing and bought a lot more...\n\n1.  Service - Very knowledgeable. You will meet a sales person and they will help you. Embrace it. They are hear to help you as there is no way you know all the details of appliances and kitchen \/ bath goods. They can help you.  First time, I took a lot of time to go over information. They were very helpful and not pushy.\n\n2.  Pricing - Not bad, and they can help a little if you ask, but you have to ask, know a bit of pricing or beg.  They have a very small amount of wiggle room I find.\n\n3.  Delivery - They outsource and the team they outsourced it to were fine.  Not sure if they are licensed, bonded or insured, but very professional.\n\n4.  Installation - They have the Delivery people do this. I had issues with the install and the amount of time it took, and the salesman actually credited me for some of the extra costs. I consider this proper ownership of the problem and huge customer service on the store's part.\n\n5.  Selection - Very, very huge\n\n6.  RC Willey - I used to shop there at RC almost exclusively as they give you reward dollars based on what you spend. However, t he sales people there seem a bit desperate and also a bit aloof. I musta spent over 15k -20k at RC and they treat you like a very unimportant client.  I am going back to Pacific sales. \n\nWhen I need more items for the bath next, this is the place I am coming to. Sorry RC Willey.
