While I wasn't able to enjoy the full course sets due to my daughter getting tired, we really enjoyed the veal meatballs, fingerling potatoes and mozzarella da buffala for the appetizers. My picky eater of a son enjoyed an entire helping of Gigli as well as my mother while my wife and I enjoyed the Ricotta Cavatelli as well as some Gigli. Both amazingly delicious along with the appetizers. Then we had to skip to dessert which was 3 Tiramisu and one pistachio gelato that my son was over the moon for and wanted to know why this was so much better than regular ice cream. If you have the time for an amazing course dinner and seeking Italian. This is the place.
