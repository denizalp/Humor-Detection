If you go to Cafe Carumba try the charuscurra (sp) sticks.  And the rocky point pizza.  And the spicy jalepeno sausage slider things.  And the mini chimis.  And the...well try whatever you can but unless you are with a big group for an event you may not that far through the offerings.\n\nI attended an event at Cafe Carumba and I was impressed with the food and the service.  I would keep them in mind for corporate gatherings or even a small meeting (they have a private room for such things).\n\n\n\nThe staff at the bar was great as were the servers.
