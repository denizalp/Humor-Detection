Great customer service! Been here twice now to get supplies for my kid, in 2015 and 2018. We know nothing about golf so both times the staff has been gracious and helpful and made us feel welcome in the shop. Both times, we went straight to the counter and asked for help and both times, staff went out of their way to work with us.\n\nHighly recommend this shop! Cheaper than amazon for kids' gloves and clubs, supports a local business, and you get expert help!
