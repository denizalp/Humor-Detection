There are  two  large doggy play yards - one  for dogs under 20 pounds and one for dogs over 20 pounds. Sometimes, people don't know what a little tiny purse size dog weighs, and  they bring them in  the wrong yard. It is always fun to watch a lab try to wrestle with a chihuahua. \n\nSome people also feel it is necessary to keep their dog on a leash even though there are large gates protecting the dogs from escaping. My friends, if your dog does not behave off the leash, it does not belong in a dog park with other dogs. :)\n\nThese two issues - dog size and leash\/no-leash - exist at dog parks near and far - I just like  to help gently guide those new to the scene.\n\nAlso, never wear clothes you love to a dog park.  You may be confused for a lamp post or fire hydrant, and become a conduit for pee-mail.  Watching spaced out dog owners get sniffed and peed on is funny no matter how many times you see it happen.\n\nBring water for yourself - there is one covered picnic table in each fenced off area. And bring a leash - you have to have your dog on t he leash until you get inside the gated area.  Great park. Big enough for the big dogs to run a lot and get tired.  Because of the separate  yards, little dogs can have fun too.
