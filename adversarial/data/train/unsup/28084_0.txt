Delicious BÃ¼gels but terribly overpriced for the sandwiches. I would recommend buying half a dozen or a dozen bringing it home and buying your own cream cheese. Aside from that, best bagels outside of Montreal and NY... maybe even better in my opinion. \n\nTexture: dense, chewy, while toasted exterior stays crisp and pleasant\n\nTaste: dough is yeasty, fragrant, sweet with subtle notes of whatever ever flavor you pick.\n\nAppearance: Uneven and not nearly close to being round, definitely looks rustic and homemade.
