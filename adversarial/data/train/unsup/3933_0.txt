This place has everything! Books, comics, vinyl, VHS, greeting cards, star wars collectibles, etc. This is the jack of all trades of collectibles. The staff was friendly and welcoming. There are a ton of books in this store! The philosophy section was a bit lacking but just about every used bookstore is short in that department. The Sci-fi selection was pretty extensive and we found a few interesting books on Middle Eastern and Egyptian history. A great book store with the possibility of finding what you need.
