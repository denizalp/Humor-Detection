Who consults Yelp to look for a place to have a cosmetic procedure performed?  Me, and apparently you since you're reading this!\n\nI was looking to have a 5mm round, slightly elevated mole on my chin removed. After Googling for MDs on the Internet and consulting Yelp, I ultimately went to LV Dermatology in part because it kept popping up on my web search, and the location was only a few miles from my house. \n\nThe appointment itself was about half an hour, most of time was spent waiting. I was only with Dr. Greenberg for around 10 minutes. He had a student intern with him. I did my research about the types of mole removal beforehand so I was familiar with my options before the Doctor discussed them with me. I elected to go for the shave excision since due to work constraints I wouldn't have time to return for follow up. If I had more time I probably would have gone for the punch biopsy and had him stitch it up. The procedure itself was very quick. He injected the area with anesthetic and sliced the mole off and applied antibiotic afterwards. I do have a flesh colored scar from where the mole was removed. Since it was located on my chin, I can't really see the scar so having a scar doesn't bother me. If the mole were in a more visible spot, I would have elected to do the punch biopsy, which I believe would have resulted in less of a scar or no scar. Either way, I am satisfied with the result. It has been 3 years since the procedure. \n\nA dermatologist out east quoted me a few hundred dollars to have it removed so I was very pleasantly surprised that I only had to pay around $70 plus lab biopsy fees, after insurance. Maybe I had really good insurance at the time.
