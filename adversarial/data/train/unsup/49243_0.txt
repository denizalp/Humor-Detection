Excellent lunch spot - all the sandwiches are delicious, though my favorite is the tuna with goat cheese.  Everything's made fresh, and there's always a huge assortment of home made sides to choose from, from orzo salad to grilled zucchini to ratatouille.  Owner has always been there when I've gone and definetely adds some flavor to the joint.  Great ambiance, almost feels like you've left and gone to the meditteranean.  Patio is nice, though it's unfortunate it's right up against 7th street traffic.
