Those 2 stars are a gift!\n\nWe stopped in here after a trip to the Westside Market for lunch. We got there shortly after they opened and were the first ones there. The bartender\/waiter didn't seem at all happy that we were there. While we were sitting there another family came in and stood by the door waiting for the guy to seat them. After about 5 minutes of them standing there and with him nowhere to be found they walked out.\n\nWe both ordered the corned beef and all I can say is I've had better. I love corned beef and I could tell this stuff was at least a day or two old and just warmed up and done so the wrong way. The fries were good but I'm not going back for fries. \n\nIt's a shame that a place in that location was so bad when everything else around there is pretty good. I give it 2 stars cause the place has potential to be really cool. Maybe it is. Maybe I was there the wrong day. Better employees and better food is all this place is missing which unfortunately are pretty important in the restaurant business....
