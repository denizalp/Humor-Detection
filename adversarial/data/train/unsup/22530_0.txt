I absolutely agree with previous reviews. I was about to make a pizza myself but hunger was telling me that it'll take a lot longer than take out :)\n\nOrdered Pesto Extravaganza and Maui Maui... both were great. I usually don't eat the crust but this one was pretty palatable so I cleaned up. It is not Pizza Hut-cheap but it is absolutely worth it.
