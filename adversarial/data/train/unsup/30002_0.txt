Although hidden in a dumpy little strip center on Scottsdale and Thomas, this place has GREAT food. Chicken and vegetables were very fresh (and I am REALLY picky about meat in these types of restaurants). Thai iced tea is delicious. They only serve beer and wine (I think they have wine, they def have beer). Very casual and good service.
