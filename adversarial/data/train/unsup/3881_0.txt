This place sucks. We got in for a good price or otherwise i would be even more disappointed.\nThe rooms are ok. AC is very loud and sounds like it will take off at any moment. It is either freezer or warm in the room.\nShower has dispensers but you have to do a work out to get stuff out.\nSmokey casino.\nThere is no great drop off from car\/taxi.\nYour cell reception (AT&T) sucks.\nWifi is ok, you get free wifi for two units per 24 hours.\nThe pool is nice but when I was there it smelled like truck exhaust for about one hour. And the pool is ice cold.\n\nThe line at check in every day is super long.\n\nWon't stay here again.
