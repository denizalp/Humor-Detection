Yummy!!!!! I love a good BBQ. I went here with my friends because I heard the rave reviews. She got a two meat plate and I got a 2 meat plate. We shared and picked off of each others plates. I literally rolled out of there and could not eat another bite all day. The style is Texas BBQ. Ms. NY ( no, \"Get A Rope\" comments please)  and Az gal here was not sure I knew what that meant 100% but I found out it meant \"YUMMY!\" (with a capitol Y) and a slice of white bread on the side.  I was not sure I got the whole white bread thing but my friend said they do that in Texas. I was like, \"seriously, white bread huh, no wheat? Brawha! \n\nAnyway, the food is very good. The sausages are DA BOMB!!!!!! The brisket, was delicious as well. I know this is going to sound weird but they have the best Grits. They stuff them with cheese and Jalapenos. I could have just eaten a plate of those all day. YUMMERS! The sides were all standard yummy sides like Potato Salad, Beans, and Cole Slaw.  Of course don't forget about those grits too. I dream of those grits. (who knew this NY'er had some southern gal in her) The chili chocolate pudding was so delish too. I am getting into this new craze of chili's in chocolate. Well, maybe not so new since the tradition has been around for thousands of years. However, the way foodies are experimenting with the idea is so much fun! We literally cleaned the bowls out. And when I say, \"clean,\" we meant it. No need to wash those bowls. They are Throw Aways so no fear. We have no shame.  \n\nAll in all, if you love good BBQ stop by. Come early though since they sell out.\n\nOh yeah, the owners and the staff are the nicest people EVA. They love what they do and it shows. Another benefit, \"BUY LOCAL!\"
