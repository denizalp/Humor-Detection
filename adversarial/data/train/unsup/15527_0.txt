My husband and I have visited this establishment quite a few times since we live in the area, however, the last 2 times were very disappointing. Our most recent visit we ordered a bottle of the Malbac on the menu ($40) and immediately told that wine had been replaced by another Malbac so we decided to try it. Ordered the baked brie appetizer and a Taste of Chicago pizza to split. The appetizer was pathetic and insulting to the idea of baked brie, the cheese was luke warm and didn't taste right, there was a large handful of walnuts, approx. 10 dried apricots, 4 pieces of thinly shaved apple and 4 stale crackers. A young lady came by the table and asked if we were finished, we told her it was not good and she said \"Thanks\"  and walked away only to be back momentarily with our pizza.  After taking the first bite we discovered the pizza was also luke warm.  We sent it back and asked for our check at which time we discovered the substitution bottle for the $40 wine was $56 - icing on the cake you might say.  Needless to say we will not revisit even though the server tried to get us to stay for a replacement pizza - no thanks.  No wonder the place was almost empty.
