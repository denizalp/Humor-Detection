I'm quite eco-conscious and therefore a big fan of reusing (especially barely or never worn) clothing items.  In other towns, I've nearly filled my wardrobe from these types of consignment shops.  Note: I have never tried to sell clothes here, only browsed.  \n\nI find the prices a bit steep for what it is, although I'm definitely willing to pay $30, even used, for perfectly fitting jeans.  However, I found the tastes of the buyers to be so hipster that it's often hard to translate the styles of much of what they sell to a style where I want the shirts to stay on my shoulders, I find American Apparel a little too extreme (really, those neon paintbrush stroke spandex tights I wore in the 80's are cool?), and I don't want to have to enlist the jaws-of-life to remove my skinny jeans.  But, if you're a fan of the \"in\" style, I'd say you're likely pretty happy with the selection.  I guess I'm just old and crochety.  The sales staff are as you'd expect from a college joint selling \"cool\" clothes, a little cool themselves.\n\nI like the place, at least in theory, and will continue to browse here when convenient.
