This place kinda makes me feel like i do not belong. If your not driving a Beamer or a Audi of Lexus your dirt. At least that's what the people that shop at fashion square think like. I'm happy I dont live here because all the people are fake as can be! Look at my car my daddy bought for me! Ughh sorry sweetheart your 18 and I'm pretty sure you don't even know how to parallel park. \n\nok sorry off to the review... :)\n\nThis place is the mother of all malls as far as shopping goes. There is bound to be some place you will like. Between all the delicious restaurants and all the retail shops, you could make coming here a entire day event.  There is a huge food court and a movie theatre. 3 stories of shopping and who knows what else I havnt seen yet. \n\nAlways come here to eat at The Yard House. Best restaurant in Phoenix.
