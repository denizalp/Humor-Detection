This is a great place for having a burger or just a few pints on the patio.\n\nThe hummus plate appetizer is a must have, one of the owners was there when we arrived and he prepared it using one of his mother's recipes from back in Israel (thank you Alon!) and we thoroughly enjoyed our beautifully crafted burgers in absolute silence (there's not time nor need to talk when you're enjoying food that much).  There were some chewing\/slurping\/swallowing\/miscellaneous other noises but NO TALKING!!\n\nThe staff were very nice as well, Max was a true gent and so were the girls who's names I didn't get.\n\nThere's free pool too so rack em up!
