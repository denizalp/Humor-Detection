If we want to change the way tourists see our city, souvenir shops seems like a pretty obvious place to start. I don't know about you, but I don't tend to frequent the touristy shops all that much. I mean, how many of us actually have totem poles in our living rooms and soap stone bears on our night tables? Or cupboards stocked with maple syrup and candies that we consume on a regular basis. And don't forget your trusty cowboy hat!\n\nKanata Trading Post embraces all that we've marketed ourselves as being Canadian. Postcards, dolls, t-shirts, keychains, hats... it's all there and well-stocked. The trading post is a fun idea. Dating back to our days of having real trading posts stocking wares and good for trade out here in the Wild West. \n\nThe gentleman behind the counter was perfectly nice. He said hello to me, asked me if I needed any help, it was by all definitions a pleasant experience. I walked through the store checking out the various \"Canadian\" pieces. There most certainly is a lot of selection for passers-by to take home with them.\n\nBut where are the \"trading posts\" that are actually representative of our Calgarian culture? Where's a store that stocks albums from local indie artists, clothes from upcoming designers and little trinkets made by people at the local farmers market instead of the ones that get shipped in from some country that surely isn't one we call home?\n\nTime for an update guys. This isn't what it's like to be us anymore.
