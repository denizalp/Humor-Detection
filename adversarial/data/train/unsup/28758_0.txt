I have not been as much as I would like to in this place but I can see me going there more often.  After remodeling the place it was a nice open feel that really welcomes you to the place.  Their selection of coffees, beverages and \"food\" is comparable to any other coffee shop in the area.  In addition, they serve ice-cream, which is a big plus! The atmosphere is nice and quiet, appropriate for studying or even just reading your book.  They also have a mute TV that you can watch for example the world cup every 4 years :) or whatever else is on.  I am quiet sure I will be visiting this place more often in the times to come.
