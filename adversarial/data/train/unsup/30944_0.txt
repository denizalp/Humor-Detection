Kristina took care of us on our maiden voyage to Yardbird. The food was great, the menu options plenty. I seriously enjoyed my experience. They were out of most IPA's when we went. Which was not great, but Kristina's incredible service and great alternate options more than made up for the outages. Great place. Great food. WONDERFUL service! A+
