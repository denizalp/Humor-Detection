Its probably my second time coming here and i can say that ive never had PAD THAI taste this good in a viet restaurant as I do here. The portions are big and the quality is excellent. they also renovated the look of this place and it feels more relaxed and clean. my family also loved their food and were definitely choosing this location than any other in brampton. good quality, good portions!
