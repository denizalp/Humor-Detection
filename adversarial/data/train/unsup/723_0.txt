Nelson Q was right on the spot for this place because they makes a damn good burger, and it was beyond inexpensive.  \n\nI have to admit, I'm super late on this review, because the cat gave birth on my original notes, and then my dog ate my redux of them.   I'm having such bad luck in finishing up this review, that it's comparable to Tony Romo finishing up week 17 of the NFL regular season.    \n\nWalking into Dispensary Lounge is like walking into a time warp, and the 1970's decor was pretty neat.  It kind of makes you wonder if the old school mob types use to hangout at this place?   Well looking at the clientele on my visit, it seems there was more college students going there for burgers.\n\nDuring my visit, the cost of my made to order half pound burger with fries was only 3.95, plus .50 for any other extras such as cheese, mushrooms, and whatever type of extra your heart can handle.   I ordered my burger cooked medium, with cheese, mushrooms, grilled onions, and bacon, which bought my burger cost up to 5.95.\n\nThe burger took about ten minute to make, but when I seen the final product, the wait was well worth it.    My burger was cooked perfectly, and all of the condiments were fresh.   I was quite taken back on the value of this meal, and it tasted as good as it looked.   I had to ask where there getting the buns at because I seen this these guys before across the street,, and yes, Dispensary lounge are using Great buns bakery as their supplier.\n\nI haven't been back to Dispensary for awhile, and I heard they raised their prices, but if it's the same product, and it's only a couple of dollars more.   This is still one of the best deals in Las Vegas.
