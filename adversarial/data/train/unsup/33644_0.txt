Great place! I have been coming here regularly for about a year now! Bella is one of the best, but all the girls are super great! They are quick and good at what they do. Really great prices, past places I've been to used to charge $75 and up for a manicure. Mine is now $35 plus tip. It's great! The only downside is they do not always honour appointment times. A friend and I always try to go together but we always end up across the room from each other and start\/end at different times. Otherwise, it's great!
