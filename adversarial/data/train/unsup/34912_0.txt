Tremont Scoops is really just OK. I feel like every time I go in the servers don't really want to be there, and they always seem like it's a huge inconvenience to get me a taste of something. The ice cream, to me, is no better then a pint of something you could buy in the store. With a great local (and fresh) ice cream scene, Tremont Scoops needs to step something up in order to compete.
