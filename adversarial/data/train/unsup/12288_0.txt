Portland Variety is a cute, sleek, modern restaurant that I stumbled upon while staying in the area. Hungry, but also in a bit of a rush, I decided to pop in and expand on my curiosity. The service was awesome. Quick, friendly, and attentive. I ordered a burger minus the bun and side salad. Portions were on the small side and prices are a bit steep, but everything was delicious. My burger was cooked & seasoned perfectly. For a standard menu of classic favorites in a lovely setting, this was a solid, convenient pick in the area.
