So here is one of the only places to eat west of 215 in Summerlin. There are only a few locations in 89135 and 89138. This one is great. The Philly cheesesteak fries are a meal on their own. A great invention and excellent cheese sauce. Good ambiance but not necessarily an environment that says kids, although they will love the food. They do some late night music and events sometimes. Cool interior ceiling beams that are hand scraped
