Comments in the older review still apply, except for now they have a happy hour, but you may get somewhat shafted like I did.\n\nI simply asked if such and such beer was \"on the happy hour\" and the reply was \"yes\".  So I ordered this beer a few times, plus an appetizer, and then my cheque arrives - FULL PRICE.  Guess what... if you just order the beer by name, you don't get the happy hour price & size (16 oz).  Instead they serve you the 20 oz. at full price, without bothering to tell you that you're paying full price, EVEN WHEN YOU JUST ASKED ABOUT A BEER ON HAPPY HOUR.\n\nThanks for making this review an easy one, and I'll be sure to note this experience to my friends who like to go for pints of Guinness on occasion.
