Felt sick from the grease in the dumplings.  The restaurant is quite dirty and you are not guaranteed to get what you ordered.  I asked the woman why there was chive in my seafood dumplings and she said that was their recipe.  Meanwhile there was no seafood flavour and mostly chive flavour in my dumpling.  \n\nSo my conclusion is, come here if you want to eat DUMP-lings.\n\nI shall never return!
