The posters lining the walls talking about how good this place is are mostly from the last decade, because all the cool new burger place are better without question. So what if the fries come in portions you struggle to finish on your own? They're not that good. There aren't many cool toppings to choose from. Ooh, American cheese...I'm enthralled...not. \n\nThe burger is just ok. Not seasoned, buns aren't really toasted...just really low-effort. I would compare the quality to that of a place with a drive-thru, but a meal costs nearly what you'd pay at a sit-down restaurant. This chain is overrated.
