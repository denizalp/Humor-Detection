Chinese Traditional Bun, a dirty little secret tucked away in a basement spot on Dundas across from Pho Pasteur.\n\nThis place is surprisingly under-yelped but it kept coming up on Chowhound and Urbanspoon as a good place for dumplings and I thought it deserved investigation.\n\nWhen I say dirty, it really is. The floors were littered with food and was in desperate need of a sweeping up. The food was honestly so good that I'm still giving 4 stars regardless of it's dinginess.\n\nThere are a few nice ladies running this place. One speaks English and is happy to make menu recommendations. There is another older lady who is making fresh dumplings and noodles when you enter. \n\nChinese Traditional Buns has a very unique menu with lots of Northern Chinese dishes that I haven't seen on any other menus.\n\nFirst up was the Xian cured pork sandwich ($2.29, bargain). Looks like a CHINESE HAMBURGER!! The pork was served on a small thin bun which looked something like an english muffin, and was flavoured and garnished with green onion. This was really tasty.\n\nNext came the dumplings - egg & zucchini steamed ones. (12 for $4.99). This was my favourite dish, REALLY tasty and fresh. I want more!\n\nNext were some steamed buns \"Gou-Bu-Li buns of Tianjin\". Whatever that means. 6 meat filled buns for $3.99! These were good too but not as delicious as the dumplings.\n\nWe also ate a delicious eggplant dish that was properly spicy in a sweet glaze sauce. ($7.99 for a giant plate)\n\nTons of unique menu items here, I will be back to investigate further.
