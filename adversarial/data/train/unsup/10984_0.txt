Just meh. No gaming, so not off to a good start. There were drink menus available at tables, with prices, which is nice. Among the $17 cocktails are the Buzzworthy and Slightly Off Course. For $18, some choices are the Old Fashion Old Fashioned and Hit The Road Jack.  I can't say I'm a fan of the centerpiece shark, I think it's a bit much for the Palms. They should have given more thought into who their actual customers are versus remodeling to try to attract new ones. \n\nSo, another example of demolishing what was a fine center bar, with a fun tropical theme, and (trying to) make it millennial friendly. This will not attract the customers\/locals who frequent the Palms. \nBring back the gaming, this is a casino, thank you...
