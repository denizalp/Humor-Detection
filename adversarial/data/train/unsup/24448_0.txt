I went to the new LoLo's location with other fellow yelpers to check this place out.  I had been to the location downtown and wasnt all that impressed with what I had seen, so I thought I would give it another chance.  This one was a much better time.\n\nUpon entering, said parties were already seated.  I was happy to say that my experience here was much better then before.  This place is actually clean!  and has decent parking!  and, as a bonus, the service was substaintially better then the one downtown.  Same menu, same tasting food, but a better experience.\n\nWhen coming here, expect to wait.  This place is super popular, and tasty.  Be prepared to eat!!
