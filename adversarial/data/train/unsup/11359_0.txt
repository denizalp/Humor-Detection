Seven of us gathered here on a Saturday morning (late) for trying different things on the menu and the ramen.  Items ordered that I tried:\n\nSeaweed salad\nTakoyaki\nTako wasabi\nKaraage\nSliced dried beef\nGyoza dumplings\nTonkotsu ramen with extra egg\n\nTwo things from the appetizer list that stood out for me were the seaweed salad and the tako wasabi.  Although seaweed is pretty much the same from one Japanese restaurant to another, this presentation and dressing were first rate.  Teh tako wasabi was also very good.  I enjoyed the takoyaki but I only have one other place to compare this with and it stood the comparison well.\n\nThe ramen was a normal sized portion.  The noodles for the tonkotsu are thin and are house made.  The broth was rich and the ramen is good.\n\nService was excellent with items brought out in separate stops rather than many things at once.  \n\nIt's good to have a ramen house of this quality without going to somewhere on Spring Mountain Road.  It's a quick trip on the freeway for me to get here.
