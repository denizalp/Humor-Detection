I've been going to Gravity ever since they opened... it's been a great journey and they continue to improve the experience on a regular basis.\n\nA true test of a brand is its consistency in delivery and that's exactly what you will get there... consistency in product, taste, service and culture.\n\nGravity is always looking to improve and make great tasting food and coffee... mint tea will always be mint tea, you can't improve perfection.\n\nThey offer free WiFi - and for the most part, other than me, I don't see anyone abuse the privilege... in other words, that person who buys a single coffee, then stays all day to do their work... I don't see them, except for me - I've been that guy... and I make sure I bloody well buy my lunch from Gravity - not jip out and secretly eat my own protein bar when no one is looking (seen it happen at a few places). Gravity is my home away from home... \n\nExpensive? Compared to what... please don't say Tim Hortons, Second Cup or Starbucks because it just isn't true. The \"experience\" at Gravity is 10x that of those places. In other words, you get what you pay for.\n\nStaff... second to none... because Andy (the owner) hires people who give a shit. That's why. Sure, sometimes they're shy, but they smile and they do their very best! Period.\n\nCustomers... driven, enthusiastic, artsy, sporty, entrepreneurial, humans... all great people. Some of the best conversations that I've had at Gravity have been with people I had never met before.\n\nI could go to any coffee shop in Calgary... but I don't. I drive 26k one way (form home to Gravity) just to do my work, meet a client and just have a coffee and celebrate a challenging week... (FYI - there is a Starbucks, Second Cup and Tims all within 3k of my home - but I CHOOSE Gravity)\n\nGravity is a fantastic place because it was designed and built with a  purpose ... to SERVE a community of people who believe in serving others.\n\nVince\n\nPS: I don't charge extra for spelling mistakes, they're just my gift to you ;-)
