Whoever said Vegas never closes, sleeps, etc; it does. We had a delayed flight and ended up here at about 11:30pm on a Monday night and nothing food wise was open, absolutely nothing....not to mention we must have walked close to 1\/2 a mile to make the connecting flight. You don't always get to pick your connecting flights when purchasing airline tix so, for getting us home in one piece it was just fine. \nWe did get to fly home with the Pacific Tigers Women's field hockey team; that was the hi light of the airport experience for me ; )
