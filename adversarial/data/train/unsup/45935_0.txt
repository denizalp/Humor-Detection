Service left allot to be desired, as I am in the business.  My training always included that first come, first serve.  But obviously that is bypassed when friends show up?\n\nAnd this Administrative Fee that is automatically added to the bill is illegal unless it is posted. \n\nSorry Route 28, you won't get my money, nor my co-workers.\n\nHappy New Year!
