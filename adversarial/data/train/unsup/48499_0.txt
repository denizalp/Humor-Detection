My absolute favorite fine dining experience. Every trip to Phoenix we try to make dinner at this wonderful place. The Salt Cellar is a underground seafood restaurant that has a feel and smell of being on a ship on the sea. My favorite is the crab legs. Our waiter Markus was fantastic.  I highly recommend The Salt Cellar restaurant for a dining experience you'll always remember.
