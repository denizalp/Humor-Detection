Went to go see Inside Out because we had made a promise to our daughter to go see it today. After purchasing the tickets, my husband and I started to notice that the temperature of the theatre and especially the room was uncomfortable. I went to express my concern and the staff mentioned the AC wasn't working properly.  After waiting another 10 minutes, the temperature was getting even more uncomfortable. My husband complained about it and all they provided was a voucher for a free SMALL popcorn- nothing else. They knew we were driving to another AMC location out in Stapley to catch the matinee showing, the least they could have done was provided our tickets for free due to having to go to another location as an inconvenience. Harkins would have provided better service in my opinion or at least notify us before purchasing the tickets that they were having an AC issue.
