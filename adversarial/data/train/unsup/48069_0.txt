FOOD: (5 STARS) Everything was delicious! Wifey had blueberry crush, treviso caesars and petite prime steak. I had stella, treviso caesars and full lamb bolognese. The best calamari I've tried so far, must have been the curry aioli.\n AMBIENCE: (5 STARS) Classy. \n SERVICE: (5 STARS) Waiter was very attentive and genuinely pleasant. I just don't remember his name (am really bad with names).\n LOCATION: (5 STARS) When you're actually inside, you forget that it's in a business complex, just a mile drive from my place.\n\n Why 4.5 STARS and not 5?\n\n Saw one male worker behind the kitchen counter, nibbling something he snatched from someone's plate!\n\n Hostess kind of made me uncomfortable from whispering several times to the guy that would sit us. Did she not have planned a table for a party of 2 early on?\n The guy that would sit us kept a nice smile (helped us feel comfortable) while the hostess still whispered to him as we started to walk to our table. \n\n White table napkin was \"linty.\" Wife asked for a black napkin after we saw one lady in black outfit at the next table had a black napkin in her lap.\n\n Nevertheless, wife and I enjoyed the place, the service, specially the food. We will come back with family and friends next time.
