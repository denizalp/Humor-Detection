One of my favorite strip casinos. A lot of great foodie restaurants and my wife likes a clothing shop there so we come quite often. \nMy issue here is the parking. \nThe parking here really sucks. One lane in and one lane out. On top of it they make you pay for the experience. \n\nGoing In you have to stop at a super steep incline to get your ticket. The attendants stand there not assisting. They point to where I should stick my mlife card to get my ticket. I'm trying to lean over and not take my foot off the brake I'm fear of rolling back. I get my ticket then peel rubber going up and try not to crash in the cars exiting who have stopped in my lane. \n\nA scooter in front of me didn't have enough power to make it up the hill with two riders. Yes it's that bad. \n\nMy wife won't park in that lot.  If she is driving we end up at a different casino.
