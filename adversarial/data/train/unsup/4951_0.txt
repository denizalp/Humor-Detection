We have been here MANY times over the years. This past time I would have to say it was a bit disappointing.\n\nI can understand it is a dining experience and different than a lot of restaurants but for the prices paid there should be more food than what is put on a plate and brought out to be shared. Never enough veggies to put in the soup mixture and the meat portions have gone way down.\n\nMy son and husband are big eaters and they were both still hungry when we were done and we ordered a lot,\n\nWe always love the cheese fondue as well as the chocolate and we always have to ask for more to dunk in the chocolate as well.\n\nThe Dinner pictures are from this past time and the Chocolate fondue pictures were from our Easter Visit Both times there was 4 of us. \n\nWe also ordered 2 bottles of wine.. So our bill was not cheap, Its a shame places have to change over the years. \nYou can tell when a place cuts back,  Why raise prices then?\n\nThis would have been a 5 star for sure if everyone was full , We love coming here but we are kinda hesitant to go anymore.. \n \nService was not too bad.. We only had to wait a couple of times for  the server to come back so we could ask for a few more veggies, Other wise he was pretty good.\n\nAtmosphere is nice, I love the booths they are kinda private and yet a little romantic feel if you were to come here on a date,\n\nWould we recommend? \nIf you want to have some good food, cook for yourself is kinda fun ~ Kinda expensive for what you get, \nWould we go back?\nI think maybe for some cheese fondue sometime, I love when they make that in front of you!
