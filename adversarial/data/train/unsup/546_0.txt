I love The Palazzo!! ALL the rooms are suites! How awesome is that?!\n\nI stayed here for a couple nights with a big group of friends. We had two connecting suites which made it super convenient. The rooms were huge! I loved the sunken living room with its comfy couches. And there's TVs in every room!\n\nThe bathroom was pretty spacious with a tub, glass shower, two sinks, and a little vanity area perfect for getting ready! There was even a flat screen TV in there! I also liked how the toilet was in a separate small room on its own so even if you're using it, other people can still use the rest of the bathroom to get ready. Very convenient. \n\nThe 2nd floor has all the shopping and restaurants. It's also connected to the Venetian which is nice and convenient.\n\nThey have one of the best spas and fitness centers in Vegas with even a rock climbing gym. It's pretty expensive though and I would say it's not worth it unless you're a work-out machine who HAS to work out even on vacay. \n\nAll in all, the Palazzo is amazing! Modern, clean, spacious, luxurious. I would definitely stay here again! It's especially perfect for groups! It's also an ideal location since it's located near the middle of the strip. :)
