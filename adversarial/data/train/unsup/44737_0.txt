This place is great!\n\nI'll admit, most of mani\/pedi experiences happen in North Phoenix because I usually would go with my mil.  But my aunt was visiting from out of town and we were both due for a little nail TLC.  \n\nI didn't know where to go so I starting scanning yelp and the interwebs looking for help.  I wanted something that didn't require us to travel too far (she was staying near tempe diablo stadium) and we were planning on going shopping at Fashion Square later in the day (post nail mission).\n\nI was trying to avoid the craziness of downtown Scottsdale but also didn't want to go someplace fancy due due to cost efficiency and appointments typically being necessary.  It can be hard to find a regular nail salon!\n\nBut alas!  Nancy's to the rescue.  We arrived before it opened, which was perfect because we were the first ones in the door and taken care of.  We weren't focused on getting in and fast, we just wanted to enjoy ourselves.  They did a great job on the nails and have very reasonable prices.  Their mani\/pedi combo is also terrific.\n\nSo I strongly suggest that if you need a place to get your nails done, Nancy's will do a great job and your feet and hands will feel extra pretty and loved.
