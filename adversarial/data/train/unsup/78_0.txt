SOYO = #1 Vegas Korean hot spot!!!\n\nMy boys... supercr3w\/ jabbawockeez  love coming here. I came here last month with the boys... and I was super excited since I've been wanting to try Soyo after reading their rave on yelp.\n\nI had the Kalbi and bulgogi! 2 solid choices!\n\nI can't wait to come back for more kalbi & bulgogi!!\nI don't do spicy\/hot  nor do I drink alcohol so my korean choices are limited but the kalbi and bulgogi is more then enough to make me come back to Soyo!\n\nLove the indoor seating. cool drinking cups.\n\nCasual dining. stress free parking. no wait (when I went that night).\n\nIf you're visiting Vegas or a local and looking to get your korean on... make it SOYO!\n\nI'll be back SOYO!\n-Miss Yelp 2011 :D
