i have been putting off buying a car for literally YEARS longer than i probably should have and after starting my day at a different spot who tried to give me the run around i was expecting, i just left. on my way to a different dealer i stopped in here just to see (since i was walking by) and i am so glad i did. this was the easiest car experience i've EVER had. i got pretty much exactly what i wanted for under KBB estimate and was in and out in about 2 hours, which is basically light-speed compared to other times. give them a shot! if you come in knowing what you are looking for and with a decent understanding of the process, this is a place with a streamlined set up that basically made my month.
