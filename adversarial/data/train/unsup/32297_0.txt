Came in on Thursday February 16th. I wasn't feeling so good but I was hungry. My server was Denis. He was awesome. I asked him what he recommended and he let me know the Stuffed avocado was his favorite so I ordered it! Seriously it was out of this world. I ordered the Shrimp Avocado and it melted in my mouth. To be honest I don't even know if I ate anything else because it was so good I had to concentrate on it! They have a great happy hour!!! Go see Denis he will definitely take care of you!
