Booked appointment with Deb for this afternoon. I have roommates and we work a lot. Apt overdue for a spring cleaning..... Just walked in and my place smells so good. It looks incredible. I'm a shorty, its awesome she dusted even high places and hard to reach places.\n\nI love she used eco friendly products. Did I mention my place looks INCREDIBLE. To bad I cant keep her....definitely gonna book her for bi weekly cleanings. Extremely competitive prices. I strongly recommend!!!!\n\nThanks again Deb
