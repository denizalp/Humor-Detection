Either I was just really hungry or this has got to be one of my all-time fav burgers, hands-down! \n\nI built my own -- pretzel bun, dry-aged wagyu beef, angel dust rub (garlic powder, salt, peppter), Truffled Shallot Aioli sauce, English cucumber, tomato, Aged Gruyere.  Chose pink (vs. no pink or red for cooked options).  This baby was messy but no worries because lots of napkins were provided.  The taste was melt-in-your-mouth juicy salty goodness, every last bite as I was licking my fingers.  Sometimes I've found that fancy-schmanzy burgers leave something to be desired because there is just too much going on, but this one?  Ohhh, man.  It hit every last spot on the inside from the roof of my mouth all the way down to my toes, I think.\n\nFor a side, I selected the Napa slaw. I want this recipe.  It's just the right tangy mess to go with my burger.  \n\nAlas, no room left for a milkshake.  Next time!
