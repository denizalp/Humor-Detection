we walked through, just to check out what happened to our old stomping ground. first thing that came to mind: dry. \n\nit was just a weird feeling seeing Michael Jackson and Dolly Parton dealing blackjack, but, it wasn't the IP anymore. the walls were all barren and desolate. i don't think they were done rebuilding the place. we got a round of drinks at the bar, looked around and got out. too eerie.\n\nthe jury is still going to be out until i come back and stay here.
