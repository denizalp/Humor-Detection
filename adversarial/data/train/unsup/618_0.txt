I'll admit, I wasn't expecting much. Though I love a good gin & tonic, I wasn't planning on that for brunch, so when the Sunday Brunch Club headed to Needle & Pin I was hoping (at best) for decent food. Wow. First, the owner gave us a thorough explanation of each menu item. Though the brunch menu is limited, there's definitely something for everyone in your party. The crew split a Bread Board and I'm so glad we did. Have you ever enjoyed a freshly made bagel? I remember visiting Bageland in Squirrel Hill as a kid, and that's the closest I can get to that flavor. Between our group we ordered the Bangers and Mash (looked awesome though on the small side), a Popover (much heartier than expected), Oat Cakes and Overnight Oats (one of the most delicious breakfast items I've tried in my life). When my trio of Oat Cakes arrived it looked good, but I assumed I would demolish it in under 5 minutes. I left with two-thirds of it for what became an oat cake dinner! The bottom line, this version of brunch tapas is heartier than it looks and I left craving nothing but a return trip for dinner. Congratulations Needle & Pin, and welcome to the neighborhood!
