My boyfriend bought me a maple bar and green tea donut from here today, and they were the best donuts I've *ever* tried. My favorite type of donut is the maple bar from Winchell's, but these seriously beat that out of the park. He bought them for me at 11, and I didn't get to eat them until 7, but they were still so soft, moist and fluffy. They seriously melt in your mouth. \n\nThe green tea one is really flavorful and the matcha they use is top quality. I love the addition of pistachios on top as well, they're soft and give the right amount of crunch. \n\nThe maple bar was surprising to bite into. Even after hours, the glaze on top was still really creamy and not hardened at all. The dough was so so soft still. It was a dream. \n\nI'll definitely be coming back here soon to try other flavors!
