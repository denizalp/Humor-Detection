As both a fan of classic toys & of the circuit of history channel TV shows , I knew I had to pay a visit to The TOY SHACK! \n\nWhat an amazing experience!! Not only to visit this place which is mentioned & seen on some TV shows , but to experience the Toys this place supplies. From the amount of toys ( literally from floor to ceiling - it's packed!) to the different types of cars, dolls, models , etc. really old to new. You can get lost in there , no not because it's huge, but just so much to look at. \n\nThe icing on the cake was meeting Johnny. The owner. Unlike the other TV shows where the crew isn't around these establishments during touring hours - HE IS! Very down to earth guy, he gives everyone the same amount of attention , almost making you wanna buy more. \n\nI was Very, Very, Very Happy to pick up a Dukes of Hazzard Lunch box. \n\nI WILL BE BACK!
