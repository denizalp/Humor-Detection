In the Junction and Bloor West hood, for buying and fixing bikes, this place rocks. \n\nIt is a diamond in the rough though. The sign and shopfront are old-school. But it's the service and quality of the work make it stand apart. Getting down to brass tacks, Louis is an old road bike racer. He's straight up. And he does wheel rebuilds and tune-ups for a great price, with a fast turnaround time. What's more are the bikes he's selling. Not your average  shiny rides. Instead you can see this place builds 'em solid. Also, as noted before, he keeps Peanut the pug around. \n\nIt's this kind of eclectic community oriented businesses that give the Junction hood it's unique feel.
