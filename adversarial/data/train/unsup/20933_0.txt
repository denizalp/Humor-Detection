Many a Yelp Toronto CM has sat in this very cafe before me and written a review. Previous CM's have made mention of disgruntled staff, poor-ish service or a total lack of free WiFi... did WiFi not exist back in 2011??? \n\nI'm happy to report that my recent Sunday afernoon visit to Balzac's Coffee was pleasant on all fronts. The WiFi was strong, I found outlets to plug into right away, the staff was friendly (and border line flirty.. yes I'm onto your flirtatious ways you golden haired minx), and for a Sunday, I never thought I would find such a relaxing chilled out place in all of the city, let alone the busy Liberty Village.\n\nMaybe it's their nondescript front entrance which he\/she without a trusty Yelp app armed with the ever useful Monocle, might walk past, but this place was cozy and quiet. Set in the side of one of the re-purposed factories (now lofts) of Liberty Village the stone exterior and loft style interior are tres chic in my book and make me long for a transplant north of Steeles.\n\nWhile working at this late time in the day, I opted to avoid further caffeination and settled on a Hot Chocolate. Maybe it was because I got a small, but even though it was made with an unmarked chocolate syrup, the milk was frothed, thick and there was no heavy syrup at the bottom like so many disappointing Tim Hortons Hot Chocolates\n\nSide note: Timmies HC is like drinking chocolate flavoured water until the bottom where the syrup is so thick it's almost unbearable.\n\nI digress... looking for a place to do some work or reading in Liberty Village, I'd recommend paying this place a visit.\n\nPro-tip: Ask for the WiFi password from the cashier when you pay.
