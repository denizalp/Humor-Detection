My first poutine in Quebec came from Frite Alors. While walking to my work activities, I kept noticing their cute sign since it seemed like the fries were screaming \"frite alors!\" at me. When the server came by, I asked her what her favorite poutine was and she quickly and confidently responded with the taco poutine (ground beef, spices, grilled onions, avocados, tomatoes, sour cream, Mexican spicy sauce and nachos). My colleague ordered the la cochonne (fatty bacon and onion, fun fact: I found out cochonne means whore). \n\nMy favorite loaded fries type-a dish is carne asada fries from San Diego, which consist of crispy fries (thinner than what you'd find in poutine) topped with guacamole, sour cream, carne asada (steak), pico de gallo, salsa, and shredded cheese. The fries are served hot, so if you keep the to-go box closed for a minute, the cheese will melt deliciously on top.\n\nOverall, the fries were a great consistency but I'm not sure if the blend of flavors with the taco poutine work for me. It reminds me of a Canadian version of carne asada fries, which just meant a thicker fry and gravy and cheese curds added to the above toppings. I wasn't crazy about the gravy flavors combined with the Mexican \"spicy\" sauce (salsa) and the texture of the curds was a little out of place. I put the spicy in quotations because for my spice lovers, it wasn't very spicy at all. I loved the cochonne though! The bacon and the onions were delicious with the fries and the curds.\n\n\nRESULTS:\n- For me, this place is a 3.5 rounded up to 4. I would take my review with a grain of salt though because I have not eaten poutine many times in my life.\n\n- Good place for poutine (though, not the best) and the cocktails are reasonably priced.\n\n- Quick and kind service!
