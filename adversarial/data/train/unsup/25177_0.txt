I Have been to this office 2 times so far, after changing my insurance. I felt the need to write a review, because I have to give credit where credit is do. I absolutely love the staff, but have to admit, I don't know All of their names yet. Starting with Marissa.. she is so polite in person and on the phone. Whoever it is that checks me out after my Appts. has also done a very nice job and they are very thorough and know their jobs. Now  as for KELLY, the Nurse, she is so sweet and understanding. Never had a Nurse so nice and listens to you. LACY you are also a dear, for helping me with my Prescriptions and explaining them to me. You are very thorough and kind when you call. Now for the big one CYNTHIA OZAWA, she is FANTASTIC!!!!! She listens and she never makes me feel as though I'm a number, as my past Dr did. I can't say enough good things about her, except, she is the best. I found her through a personal friend who also sees her. I am so BLESSED to have found her and this whole practice. I hope to meet each and every one you. It's always nice to put face to a name. I also wanted to thank each and every one of you for making my day at the DR's office such a wonderful day. Can't say I've ever been able to say that, EVER! Keep up the great work, and remember a smile and kindness go a long way.\nKim H.\nHenderson\/Green Valley
