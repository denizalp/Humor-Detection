My mother has been sick for a while and I suggested her going here. For nearly $1000.00 she had to continually call for test results which was promised in 2 weeks. Randomly stopped by and asked if results were in and they were but no one called. They wanted even more money for the test results. This is a place I hoped my mom would find answers but she's left still being sick and down almost $1000.00 Sorry I even suggested this place. Very unprofessional and very non compassionate. Truly a sad and disappointing experience.
