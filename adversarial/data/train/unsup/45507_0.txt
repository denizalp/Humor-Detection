25 people of varying ages and tastes. Had entire section 4 us. Great service, took care of all requests. Great value for party unlimited wine included. All 25 served at same time. Only added 18 pct tip in my world unheard of low. Best value for fun large group in Vegas. Last of old time Vegas on strip.
