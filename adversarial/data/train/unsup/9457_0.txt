This place is dirtier than a prostitute's vagina and I'm being nice. The very last time I went there, I stepped in dog crap twice because people fail to pick up their dog's poop. So, watch where you are stepping because it's a land mine out there. Secondly, I saw gross bloody poop and I was so focused on that, I stepped in dog crap the second time. My last straw was when this lady came in with her dog and she was yelling out her dog's name (trust me, it's a name you can't forget). I look up and it was the same lady with the same dog at the vet with parvo virus. I picked up both my dogs and ran like the scene from forest Gump. RUN FOREST, RUN!!!
