I had an appointment schedule for 10 am today with Josue Torres that I confirmed on 04\/17\/2017. I made the appointment two weeks ago after I completed my first appointment. When I walked in he had another customer in the chair. The shop doesn't open till 10 am and I walked in at approximately 10. He told me I would be next. I sat down and talked on my phone for about 5 minutes. I then exited the shop and I will never return. I just feel its a bad way to do business and I wasted part of my morning waiting for the shop to open.
