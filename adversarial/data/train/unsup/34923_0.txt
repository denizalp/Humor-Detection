I guess I forgot to review this place... so here goes.\n\nWhole household came here for dinner on a Friday night.  Had to wait to be seated even though I saw a few tables open...  but I guess the wait wasn't too bad.\n\nOrdered wings, they were okay.  Overcooked though.  I guess everyone else liked them fine cuz they scarfed em down!\n\nPizza was okay... but I wouldn't come back for it.\n\nService was decent.\n\nI would go somewhere else for pizzeria food... (my fav place that I keep mentioning), but if everywhere else was closed I would come here.  LOL...
