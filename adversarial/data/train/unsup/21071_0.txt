I took my brother here on Friday after he helped me move in to my new apartment. He had to go up three flights of stairs and carry heavy things. He is not really known for his strength. I was really happy that he stepped up and helped out his little bro. I asked him where he would like to grab lunch and he said this place. It is the old chef from Phnom Penh. The food was outstanding. The service was outstanding. They were very attentive and friendly and provided many recommendations. I am going to start coming here all the time.
