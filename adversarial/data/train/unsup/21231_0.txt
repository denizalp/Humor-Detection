There's a new ramen restaurant in town and this is not just another ordinary ramen place capitalizing on the new ramen craze in Vegas like many other ramen places popping up around town. This ramen can actually compete with the big names like the Montas or the Soras. So be afraid...Monta, be very afraid...Sora, you finally got some real competition.\n The menu is very extensive, you can actually have a complete meal here without having ramen, but since ramen was the reason I was here, that's exactly what I ordered. I went with their most popular which is the tonkotsu black, a very rich in flavor broth with pork chashu and the perfect toppings, fresh onions, fried onions, garlic, nori and a boiled egg and served with perfectly cooked thin noodles.\n I had to try the pork broth this time for comparison purposes but on my next visit I'll provably be nicer to my heart and order the chicken broth instead or even the vegetable soup ramen and I hope they're as good as the pork so I can stop here more often without the guilty feeling. \nService was great, I had no problems with my drink being refilled as needed and my waitress was very helpful explaining the menu and making recommendations. \nThe dining room is very spacious with many booths and tables, a bar facing the open kitchen and a majestic communal table in the middle inviting strangers to become friends by the power of ramen if only for just one meal.\n I can see Jinya Ramen becoming one of my favorite restaurants come winter, for I could definitely have ramen here every day, if only my arteries were twice as wide.\n\n#happy hour 3 - 5  = useful.
