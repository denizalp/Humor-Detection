I'm generally not a fan of most chain sandwich stores because I feel like I can make it a thousand times better and healthier at home; but sometimes convenience takes priority and then you will see me at Jersey Mike's.  \n\nJM make juicy, flavorful sandwiches and they are close to where I live, which adds another convenience point to the list.  They also have wraps, plus you can order the sandwich as a salad. Staff is friendly and fast.  The place is small but always clean.
