If I'm driving through DeForest you can be sure to find me at Ehlenbach's! Sure it is a touristy cheese castle and you can probably get great cheese curds at a local grocery store in Anytown, Wisconsin, but I'm not from these parts and I love the cheese! I love their garlic and herb, cheddar, and marbled curds. Whenever I'm running low on cheese merchandise like hats made of cheese, cheese magnets, cheese souvenirs I know where I can stock up! They ship to anywhere in the country. They have a very photogenic store front too! After a long day of waterslides at Wisconsin Dells, make the drive back to Milwaukee a little better by stopping at Ehlenbach's Cheese Chalet!
