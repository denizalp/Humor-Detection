My mistake was not checking out the owner, Phil Waters or his retail operation. Called about a tire for my Vespa and was told in stock $55. Drove 60 miles round trip to find out they just sold out and all they had left was one $85 tire. Found out I was charged $30 over. tried to return the obviously unused\/unmounted tire and was refused even though he has a written refund policy. Took it to BBB and even told him I would drop the complaint just donate the $30 to the American Cancer Society. Waters refused. Found out later that he has 6 consumer fraud complaints with the Ohio Attorney Generals Office and a criminal record with the Cuyahoga County Clerk of Courts Criminal Docket case # 491225, 486126 civil docket 563736. The criminal cases involve forgery and altering  of official documents . This from a guy who states he was a former LEO with a Cleveland suburb. Buyer beware,
