This place is decent.. Became a staple in when I go out, Old old review (lol) it was real at the time:\n\n i have no idea why this place is getting such great reviews in new-times.\n\nthis place blows. we went there expecting to see some of the amazingness that everyone keeps talking about (and for my birthday, too. so that was retarded), but all it was was a bunch of brokers and douches and realtors and businesswomen looking hook up and thinking they were awesome and better than everyone else. i don't think i've ever seen so many pretentious pricks in one place (except maybe at merc bar or any club in scottsdale).\n\nthe food wasn't great, but not horrible. the drinks were actually reasonably priced, but the douche-factor made it seem like we were paying top dollar. i guess the place is supposed to be somewhat historic (which is their one selling point, even though pretty much the only original historic piece is the sign painted on the building featured in all their promotional material), but it just seems like they gutted the inside completely and threw the history away -- building a \"new\" dwelling place for fakey scottsdale cougars with spray-on tans looking to score with random 36-year-old investor douchebags bragging about making their first \"mil\". \n\nthe overpriced, snotty furniture was in my face like a big disgrace and when I came home, my mom got scared, and said you're moving with your auntie and your uncle in bel-air. I whistled for a cab and when it came near, the license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror. If anything I could say that this cab was rare but I thought, \"nah, forget it. yo homes.. to bel-air!\" I...pulled...up to the house at about 7 or 8 and I yelled to the cabby \"yo homes, smell ya later!\" I looked at my kingdom, I was finally there -- to settle my throne as the prince of bel-air.
