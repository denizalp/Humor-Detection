One of my favorites in all of Phoenix. Not only is it local, but it's in such a convenient location, has reasonable prices, delicious drink items, and awesome staff. Plus, they've got a punch card system going on! Who doesn't love a free drink after a certain amount of time? AND to top things off, they have a drive thru and they're always so quick to serve, and this never dilutes their quality of service. I love Smooth Brew!\n\nI've tried a couple of their coffees, but I'm a huge and adoring fan of their smoothies. Green machine and hyper monkey (especially on a Monday) are my favorites!\n\n10\/10 would recommend!
