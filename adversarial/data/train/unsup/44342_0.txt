The Arrogant Butcher treated me right. I was pleasantly surprised yesterday when my girlfriend took me here to surprise me for my 31st Birthday and that she did. \n\nWe had a table of 10 good friends enjoying different brews before deciding on our meal strategy. Before we could dabble into the Raw Bar we were greeted with two pretzel and cheese dishes. Apparently the secret was out that this was a birthday. So we carried on enjoying the pretzel and cheese and ordering oysters, shrimp and mussels. All which were tasty. The shrimp are enormous, the oysters about average and their Jalape√±o Mignonette sauce was something that stood out for me. I could almost drink it, but I've got a thing for spice. \n\nI decided to stick with the seafood theme and I ordered the New Zealand Sea Bass for dinner and it was tasty. Living in Florida the past 3 years has spoiled me with seafood compared to Arizona. With that said the price of the seafood was a little steep but the quality was there.\n\nEveryone ordered something different and I tried a bite of each one... All were good. We also tried one of every dessert.... All were good!\n\nI believe this is one of those places that you can't go wrong with. I will come back and thanks Arrogant Butcher for showing my group a good time.
