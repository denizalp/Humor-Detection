Went there tonight for takeout 4-16-15 at 6 PM.\n  **CHECK YOUR ORDER BEFORE YOU LEAVE***\nYoung female with orange hair, freckles, and heavy makeup made my food. \nI had:  \n-A small bobbie ($6.60)- You can't go wrong.  I gave an extra star just for this sandwich. White roll, stuffing, cranberry, turkey, and mayo.  \n-Cap's creation salad ($5.99 +$1.00 extra for meat)\nTHEY FORGOT MY TUNA...didn't notice until I got home. I'm so irritated. \nI asked the gal if they have banana peppers and she said no, but they have sweet peppers.  They were disgusting...imagine green bell peppers made into a sweet pickle.  Bleck! I picked them all off.  \nDressing is T. Marzetti's from an individual pack.
