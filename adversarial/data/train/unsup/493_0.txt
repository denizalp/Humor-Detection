DISLIKE! The concept was cool and drew my attention to give it a try, but in the end, this place is a tourist trap. $17 gets you entry with some warm clothes. We were told that drinks cost $12-$16 inside so we were advised to get the package that includes two drinks and then a regular $17 package. While getting ready to go in, we were told to leave our cameras and phones in a locker. whoa! How can I document my experience. They advised us that someone will take our pic and we would need to purchase it ($20) or else share it on social media, \"Like\" it on FB, and then we can download it. Ok, we'll share it, we thought.\n\nThe inside was cool-looking but we were the only ones there. Got our specialty drinks and then a photographer took our pics. It did get really cold close to an hour in. I ordered a beer and it only cost ($6-$7). The person outside left that info out, saying drinks cost you $12-$16! They were probably doing that to sell you the package. Not cool! Whole experience cost us over $65!\n\nWent back and followed the instructions to share our pic...only to see that there is a big \"do not copy\" imprint on our pics! Again, they failed to tell us that, only saying we can download our pics once we share the photos. I wouldn't have minded paying the amount we paid if we at least got our pics without that imprint once we shared, but instead I got a bitter cold feeling after having come here.
