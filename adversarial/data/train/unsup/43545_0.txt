Come for the cheesecake and stay for...well, the cheesecake.\n\nWe ate at The Cheesecake Factory one busy Saturday evening.  The wait was an hour, which was really no biggie because, hey, you've got a huge mall behind TCF to browse through!  I was thinking to myself, \"This place is so crowded it HAS to be good, right?\"  WRONG!  From the perpetually pissy server to the horrible main dishes, this was one of the worst experiences we ever had at a restaurant, bar none.  The only thing that WAS good was the thing they are famous for, the cheesecake.  Of course none of us found that out until hours later; the food had made us all so sick we had to take our cheesecakes to go!  Next time I waste my time coming to this place I'll know to grab my cheesecake and RUN!  Run far, run fast!  Mickey D's has the food at this place beat.  The ONLY thing that got stars was the deliciousness of dessert.  The service and food both get a big, fat ZERO!
