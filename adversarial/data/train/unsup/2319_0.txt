So what's better than dessert, you ask?  \nA dessert to eat after dessert.  Sho 'nuf!\n\nPost dinner at Biltmore Fashion Centre we instinctively walked towards Frost.  The smell of free samples was in the air.\n\nTheir website lists a long menu of gelatos and sorbets, but the store displayed 38.  My guess is that flavors get rotated every once in a while.  There's a good mix of fruity flavors, caramel flavors, nut flavors, cheesecake, and chocolates of which you get unlimited sampling.  Unlimited?  That's what our server said.  I think there were some \"diabetic\" options too.\n\nAlready running on a full tank at the time, I failed to take advantage of the sampling.  Damn stomach, grow bigger!  3 particular flavors that pack a punch:  salted caramel, peanut butter crunch, and pistachio.  Amazingly tasty but light on the tongue.  \n\nSadly, the taste doesn't come through in all of the gelatos and in my opinion the frost bite was pointless.  \n\nAnd cost?  Ain't cheap.  Your pick from three cup sizes or a waffle cone which costs 6 bits extra.  But for a nice treat, I will definitely go back again and lick more flavors.
