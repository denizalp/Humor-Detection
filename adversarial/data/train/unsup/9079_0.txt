I've been a patient of Dr. Joe's for nearly two years now; and as Lan T. states, they do conduct quite a few tests when you first sign up.  They do these tests to get the FULL picture of your oral care; and with these results they can determine the health of not only your teeth and gum but of other factors attributed to certain heart diseases and cancers.\n\nMy insurance covered about 80% of the costs of these tests; so I guess it's to each their own insurer.  \n\nAs quite a few people do, I have a well founded fear of dentistry.  Growing up I had to go, because my mom made me do it; but when that dentist had passed on (really nice guy, just didn't like the sharp pointy objects he poked me with), I didn't go searching for another doctor for nearly five years.\n\nIn comes that fact that although I fear dentists, the idea of losing my teeth scares me quite a bit more!  My mother would gladly tell me at every moment she got that I had her \"new car\" in my mouth.  I got braces when I was in junior school, and the end result was about thirteen grand; so I cheerfully developed a fear of destroying this \"brand new car\".\n\nI live close to Bloor West, so my husband and I decided to try out Dr. Joe (the hubby had never went to a dentist before, but had decided it was time to start!)\n\nAnyway, believe it or not, I don't fear dentists anymore thanks to Dr. Joe specifically.  He has a way with keeping his clients calm without the use of drugs (until needed); he has talked me through numerous checkups\/consults and even a root canal.  Mind you the sharp pointy objects are still poking, but the surprise factor is gone; you're not left guessing and stressing about whether his next move is going to hurt.\n\nAnd surprisingly enough, just knowing \"You're about to feel a pinch, is that okay?\" removes so much pain from lack of anxiety.\n\nThese days, when they say, \"Let me know if you feel any pain\" I usually think, \"Pfft! Bring it on!\"  And I've been going to his office now every three months for checkups.\n\nThey also have a great method of distraction too; every checkup\/cleaning room is installed with a flat panel monitor in the ceiling, so you can catch up with the news or HGTV while they're cleaning your teeth.\n\nX-Raying your teeth doesn't cost as much as at some other locations either, because they use digital photography to get an inside look at your teeth and gum.  The price for costly film is now redundant, since the pictures are computer generated.\n\nJust The Other Day...\nMy last visit was a few days ago and I almost nearly didn't make it!  We have construction going on our house, and my timing just got all bungled up.\n\nI doubt this could have happened every time, but they were willing to push back my appointment *twice* that day until our \"house guests\" finally left.\n\nI even got a little goody bag too, which kinda made me laugh and feel all of eight years old again.  It came with a toothbrush, dental floss, toothpaste and *lip balm*. I usually come home with the toothbrush and floss, but the added paste and balm was a nice treat!\n\nLet's Talk Money\nDr. Joe's office is a little more pricey than what our insurance wants to pay; by the time we get a check back, we're about $15 out of pocket on average for these check-ups.\n\nWhich on a side note, their receptionist does all the insurance work for you, so you don't have to worry about filling out the forms properly.  We normally get our money back within five days of the check-up.
