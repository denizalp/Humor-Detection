I've seen this place for a long time when coming passing through the parking lot to walmart and finally tried it. It wasn't planned, but panned out nicely. The inside is clean and the service is excellent. On the walls they have signed pictures from various people. I believe the Holly Madison and David Cassidy ones are real because they haven nothing better to do but all the others look like something they ordered from a fan club through the mail. I started out with garlic knots that were very good but I could only handle like 3 of the 6 because there was so much garlic under the bread. If the side of red sauce that came with it had flavor then I think they would have went down better but just by themselves it is a lot to take. My wife liked them but felt the same way about the sauce. I ordered an Italian sandwich for dinner and it was decent. I wanted extra cheese that ended up costing $.60 more but that was cool by me. My wife enjoyed her soup but thought her pasta dish lacked flavor. Sauce is everything and if the sauce isn't good it limits what you can order at a place like this. I assume that a majority of people come here for pizza and pasta so I don't know maybe it's just me but the sauce needs some vavoom. My wife did sample some pizza and really enjoyed it. I will come back for sandwiches here anytime and want to try their wings. They also have lunch specials and offer a $5 for $10 yelp deal that I will use in my next visit.
