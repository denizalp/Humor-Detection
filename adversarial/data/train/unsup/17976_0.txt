I've been here several times and it gets less and less fun every time.  Primarily due to the deteriorating clientele and over priced drinks.  $27 for 2 margarita plus the cover charge?  Mmmm...the drinks aren't THAT good!\n\nPlus, it's actually a swingers' bar and because of that there's always about 4 sleazy men for every woman.  \n\nThe outdoor patio is full of smoke so forget about enjoying any fresh air.\n\nThe music is pretty decent...soooo 2 stars.
