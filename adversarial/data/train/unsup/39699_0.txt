Tom was our server & he was super nice and knowledgable about the menu. My husband and I had brunch, & everything we ordered was delicious. We started with the chorizo Mac and cheese, YUM! He had orange juice & I had bottomless mimosa for 10$ so that was a plus. I ordered the breakfast burrito and my husband got the Benedict pizza. Everything was super yummy and plated nicely. We usually come for recess so this was a nice change, very chill, cool music and school themed decor. This is one of our favorite places in Vegas.
