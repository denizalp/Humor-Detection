My tickets were free and I felt like I wasted my time.  \n\nThis is probably my 6th or 7th Cirque du Soleil show and I've never left one disappointed until now.  \n\nI was expecting raunchy acts and such, but this just seemed like an excuse to show nipples.  Not funny, just making money off of bad jokes and boobs.\n\nThe audience reaction was disgusting.  They all hooted and hollered when the two chicks were skimming all over each other in the fish bowl.  But when two guys kiss?  It's met with \"eww!!\" and the like.  Nice way to show your ignorance people.\n\nTake my advice.  If you want a vulgar show that's *actually* funny - go see Absinthe!  That's a class act.  Sexy and hilarious.  Skip this POS.  There's a reason they're giving away tickets...
