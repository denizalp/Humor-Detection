Without a doubt the best firearms store in las vegas. I am new to shooting so i was a bit nervous going in a gun shop. when I walked in I was greeted by Vince and it made me feel a little welcome at that point the owner Nathan was also really cool and willing to spent time and talk about the choices I had for my first firearm.  I just have to say that their customer service is over the top. They had a refrigerator full of beverages even juice boxes for kids and they are free.. Cant say it enough I was really taken back by the way they treat people. Good job Spartanarms.
