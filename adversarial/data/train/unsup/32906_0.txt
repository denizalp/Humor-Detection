I have been to Papa Changs in Markham before but not the express location at Pacific Mall. It's located in the 2nd floor where there are many stalls so there is no place to sit down and eat. I ordered the standard minced pork with rice and pickled veggies, which is a standard Taiwanese staple dish. The minced beef was very tasty and the pickled veggies was good, but I could tell that it was probably microwaved frozen food and it was in a take out container when I asked for eating in. When I tried to pay with credit card, I was told that there was a 0.50 cent charge which surprised me. As well, the egg was an extra 0.50 cents when i thought it usually came with that dish. The pricing was very cheap and affordable for $5.99 But the extra costs were very surprising. If I were to go back, it wouldn't be to this express location though.
