Silly fun is the best and there isn't much sillier or more fun than an evening at King Putt. \n\nBlack lights run rampant here and there are plenty of trick shots to be had. Even better, they allow you to purchase drinks and carry them along the course. Each hole has a cup holder, for convenience as well.
