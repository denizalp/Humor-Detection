We are in town for CES and were looking for some great seafood. We took a party of 8 out to dinner and ordered two large combo platters for the group. Our platters had shrimp, crab, lobster, mussels, clams, crawfish, corn, and potatoes with a medium spicy seasoning. The food was awesome, the waitress (Kim) was helpful and funny. We all really enjoyed the food and atmosphere (causual but not dingy). I know I will definitely come back again next time I'm in town.
