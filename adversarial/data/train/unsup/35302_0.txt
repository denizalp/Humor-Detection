Brasserie Kensington has a very good balance of upscale chic and laid back pub. \nThe later it gets, the darker and more romantic it gets. In the early evening it's bustling and lively. They have a very good selection of beer that the men seemed to be very happy with, and a long healthy list of wine that us women really enjoyed.\nThe menu is a bit confusing. I assumed Brasserie would serve specifically French food, but there's a mix of burgers and fries, some French and then....Schnitzel. \nThe duck poutine was awesome, my fish was ok. Service was also very ok at the most, but the best part was sitting near the window watching the slow relaxed Kensington life. \nI definately love the later evenings of the Brasserie, when candles are lit and the whole restaurant gets moody and everyone is having wine and cheese platters. Two different atmospheres, and I definitely love just one.
