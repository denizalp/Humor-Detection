If you follow my food reviews you know I'm critical of the ENTIRE experience. Zero Degrees puts out an okay product. Their Jasmine Boba Milk is good though I know it's pre-made. But when I'm looking to sit down and I see four open tables totally dirty trashed, and I see (kid) employees behind the counter doing SQUAT, I take issue to this. \n\n... something about Vegas, man. These franchises survive on food reputation and not the culmination of the entirety of service. \n\nNot again. I'll stick to Kung Fu Tea.
