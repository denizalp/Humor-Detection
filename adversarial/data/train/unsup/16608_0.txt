After the first course, I threw up.  \n\nAs a huge Top Chef fan, we went to Bartolotta for the Top Chef tasting menu.  First course consisted of five tapas-sized dishes.  The first was an assortment of \"fried\" fish which included soft shell crab, calamari and 90% white fish which we didn't care for.  The ocyopus salad was tasty as were the grilled scallops with mushrooms and parmesan.  Canellini beans with bortaga was tasty.  The clams in  wine sauce were metallic tatsting.  I tried two or three and sent them back suggesting the chef check the dish.\n\nThe waiter brought the next couse which consisted of sheeps milk cheese ravioli, squid ink risotto, and two types of pasta.  I had a bite of each and mentioned that the pasta was very undercooked.  The response?  \"That's the way we cook it here.\"  My bite of rissoto was good, but all of the sudden I became nauseaus and had to run to the ladies room.\n\nAfter about 10 minutes, my husband was presented with a bill.\n\nThere was no concern, no apology.\n\nAfter cleaning  up, I spoke with the manager and questioned how he could charge $200.00 for a meal that literally made someone sick. \"You think it was the food?\" the manager asked.  He ultimately comped the \"meal\" but charged for wine (even though that was left on the table).\n\nI was sick in my room the next day with symptoms of food poisoning.\n\nCannot recommend.  Nothing was above average even before I got sick.
