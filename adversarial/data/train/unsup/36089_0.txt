Restaurant: Ciao Wine Bar\nCuisine: Italian\nLocation: Yorkville\nAddress: 133 Yorkville\nPrice Range: $15~\n\n1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent\n\nFood: 2 \nService: 3 \nAmbiance: 4\nOverall: 3\n\nExtra information:\n\n* Happy hour\n* Takes reservations\n* Open for lunch and dinner\n\nEver heard of girls night out? I am sure you've had one or had girls around you that screams 'girls night out!!' in a high pitched voice and hop around in circle.\nWell, that was what I was suppose to have with few of my girlfriends at Ciao Wine Bar. Every thursday, there is a happy hour from 4pm to 7pm and their martinis are around $5 each. Which I must say, is a very good deal cause everyone needs a drink on a Thursday.\n\nAnyways, I've passed by Ciao Wine Bar many times but never realized the restaurant was so big until I walked in. \nHonestly, I don't mean it was all spacious and luxurious when I say the restaurant was really big. I found it to be a little cluttered with so many different sections to the restaurant and the tables were placed very much near each other it wasn't very ideal.\n\nWe started with some bread which I actually really enjoyed with little bit of salt on top and the black\/green olives on the side.\n\nOrdered: Ciao Apple Martini 5\/5\n\n* At $4.50, this tasted like green apple martini and it did what it was suppose to for me on a Thursday night\n\nOrdered: Fried Calamari 3\/5\n\n* Plate of fried calamari with garlic aioli and tomato sauce for $15.99\n* Deep fried anything is always good but I found it to be just ok\n* Calamari itself lacked flavor which meant I had to smother it in the sauce\n\nOrdered: Capricciosa Pizza 3\/5\n\n* Pizza with italian ham and artichoke for $16\n* I found it to be decent also, but nothing amazing\n\nOrdered: Arugula Prosciutto Salad 2\/5\n\n* Arugula topped with prosciutto and parmesan for $15\n* It's hard to mess up a salad.. it was alright but again, nothing special for what it's worth\n* I feel like they were a little too skimpy on the cheese\n\nOrdered: Seafood Linguini 2\/5\n\n* Linguini with squid, shrimp, mussels and clams in white wine sauce for $21\n* This was probably one of the worst seafood linguinis I've tried in a long time\n* For a dish called 'seafood' linguini, it lacked seafood and that is just unacceptable\n* And even with the seafood that was there, it was frozen seafood which is just sad\n\nOrdered: Red Sangria Pitcher 3\/5\n\n* I found their sangria to be quite expensive for $30 when the pitcher was so tiny\n* The pitcher poured out abour 3.5 glasses and that was it\n\nHonestly I am finding restaurants in Yorkville to be over priced and over hyped for what it is. Don't get me wrong, they are all pretty decent to some point but I feel like none of them really lives up to my expectation in terms of food. But then again, I haven't been to all of the restaurants in Yorkville so I am still searching.\n\nConclusion: Happy hour is great at Ciao Wine Bar on Thursdays but if you are all about the food, I could skip out on Ciao and head somewhere else.
