I always walk into a business with an open mind and hope for 5 stars. I let the business dictate what their star rating is, as it should be! So I rate this place 2 stars. 1 star for the cool atmosphere idea of an artistic loung with small library ambiance. 1 star for the delicious pastries. \n\nHere is why they lost stars during my experience:\n1. Seating- this cafe is WAY too over crowed where it becomes awkward and uncomfortable. I'm pretty sure this must violate a safety code but I digress. \n\n2. Service- the cashier taking my order was extremely robotic asking for each item ordered \"For here or to go?\". Now thats not a problem on the first item but if you are using common sense with your customer, odds are if they are dining in for the first thing ordered... you dont need to ask that for every item. Just sounded like a bad script reading.\n\n3. Accuracy and quality - asked for an ICED soy nutella latte. I got a HOT latte that tasted like watery warm milk. My companion ordered a hot latte and had the same feedback of watery warm milk. If you go to a coffee shop, you want coffee in your cup lol right? \n\nCool concept idea, bad service and quality execution.
