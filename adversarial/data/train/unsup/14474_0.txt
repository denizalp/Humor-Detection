If you are headed to the Scottsdale or Carefree area you MUST walk into this small shop and check out the wares.\n\nIt's eeeettthnniiccc. Filled with funky hand-made wares that celebrate the crazy Latin culture... we spent a good 10 min in this little store, ooh'ing and laughing, and calling each other over to look at this...and this...and this.\n\nLOVE the crazy art that takes classic old-school paintings and makes them fun. LOVE the unique metal jewelry peppering the walls. LOVE all the crazy esqueleto kind of Nacho Libre vibe, little hanging dolls, painted prints, photo frames, painted handbags...who DOESN'T need a thick knitted scarf with a little crazy Mexi gremlin face on it? Come on people, think outside of the box. \n\nCame home with a few small gifts for the family. Almost everything in this place is made by local artists, so you are supporting AZ talent when you shop here.
