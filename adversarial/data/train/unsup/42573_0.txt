We stopped by before dinner for drinks and snacks.  It was what you have in mind if you were to say \"diner in old Vegas\".  The service was good.  The food was so-so.  We got mozzarella sticks, which were run of the mill frozen with a pasta dipping sauce. The sliders were big on bread, small on beef.  The beer was cold.  The mojitos were spotty.  The first one was good, but second was *really* sweet. That being said, the mojito was probably the best thing we had while at the Peppermill.\n\nThe place was cute for its old school charm, but the food was something that we could have done without.
