Best $100 manicure of my life. Worth. Every. Buck. So I don't really know what to do with myself when I'm here. I forget my name and I forget how to walk and how to pick my jaw up from the floor. If you're a spa addict, then you've reached nirvana. The decor is what a spagasmic dream would conjure up and the amenities would excite hedonistic Cleopatra. The steam room, sauna, jacuzzi, tranquility room, bathrooms, showers and locker rooms are just to die for. Forget the Encore hotel room, I could move into a locker and be happy. The customer service is fantastic and the quality of services is outstanding. Returning in March for a couple's massage and birthday extravaganza. Oh Wynn, your Encore just leaves me wanting more...
