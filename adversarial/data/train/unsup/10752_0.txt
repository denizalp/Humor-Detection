These poor guys. \nThey've mixed up more sample paint than I care to admit! \n(Did you know that there is an incredibly wide range of gray when it comes to paint? Gray with blue. Gray with purple. Gray with green. There are so many options, then add sunlight into the mix and which way your wall faces... I know more about gray paint than I care to admit.)\nYou know what rocks though about the 3 trips to Ace this past weekend... every time I'm there I'm met with a smile. Someone asks me what I'm looking for and each cashier thanks me genuinely for my purchase. I wish it didn't take 3 trips to get exactly what I'm looking for, but I secretly enjoy going. This isn't the closest location to me that sells Benjamin Moore (best paint ever), but I'll drive out of the way for the stellar service.
