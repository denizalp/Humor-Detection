Full disclosure: I didn't buy a car from here. I have no idea how the buying experience was. \n\nI came here to test drive an MDX and the sales staff wasn't great. We had to go to the back lot to find the car I was interested in. It was pretty clear after about 10 minutes that I knew more about the car than the sales guy. It took him forever to bring the car out of the lot (20 minutes) for a test drive. \n\nWhile I was sitting there I got to witness a negotiation, and they were trying to talk someone into nearly criminal interest rates. This place is high pressure, sketchy, and I didn't see too many happy people there; sales or customers. \n\nOne of the managers asked how I was doing, and when I said I had been waiting I was told my sales guy was washing the car to cool it off. Pretty weird. Unsurprisingly when I went outside there was a dirty car. It was a little white lie clearly intended to keep me around, but stuff like that matters to me. \n\nThis place was a scene straight out of Glengarry Glen Ross.
