I have wanted very much to come here, as they were touted on their bagels and Jewish deli-ness. I was pleased that it was more spacious than I expected, with tables and a counter for seating. The bagel selection was good and the pastries looked wonderful. But I was here for a favorite--bagel, schmear, and lox. The first annoyance was the lack of a \"please seat yourself sign\", but that was minor. The next annoyance was that there was no bagel-shmear-lox item on the menu. I had to order a bagel and a small Nova platter. The waitress was good in asking if I wanted capers, as of course I did. The bagel did come with an adequate amount of schmear; I often have to ask for more but here I didn't. The small Nova platter was a major disappointment. There were a lot of greens (more than I needed of lettuce, tomato slices, cucumber slices, and a half a pickle) but an insignificant amount of lox. The good delis I know in Cleveland and New York would have been ashamed. I am sure that much else is good, but this is not.
