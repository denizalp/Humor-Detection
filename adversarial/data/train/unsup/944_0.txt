It is two o'clock on a cloudy Monday afternoon. The sharp pangs of bewildering hunger overwhelm all rational thought.  From casual happy Benny I morph into Beeyotchscwatch.  I must feed. Enter P & G.  Order:  Half and Half Platter (chicken, lamb, salad and rice) and one Chicken Shawarma. Minor wait of no more than five minutes and \"The Feeding\" begins. Wait a stinking second. I gotta take pics. Begin the feeding!  Chomp chomp, nom nom, burp burp, lift left butt cheek, ahhhhh. The feeding was finished. Time:  Two fourteen.  \nVerdict. \nHalf and half platter.  The salad was weak spinoff of Fatoush.  I requested a healthy drizzle of tahini over the meat  and rice which they gladly accommodated. I topped it all off with a Benny sized squeeze of hot sauce.  Chicken was moist and flavourful.  Lamb was good too. Not salty or over spiced,  just good ole mankie lamb.  Lol. Yellow rice done right.  Garlic sauce was good. I smeared it on the extra pita and made a garlic shawarma.  Any one got gum?  \nChicken Shawarma. Um um yum yum good.  Had length, weight and girth.  Don't go there ok?  Don't. Chicken so moist and flavourful. Oh I am coming back for this. \nMy only real upsets were the portion size of the platter meats, no hummus or tabouli on platter and the house hot sauce was very weak.   Oh yeah, a lentil rice with fried onions would have been a nice option.  Peace out my Fellow Yelpers!
