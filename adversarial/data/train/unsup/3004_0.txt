We celebrated Christmas eve this year at Habitat. I had been wanting to dine here since they opened and this was our first opportunity. Just as we suspected, the restaurant was not at all busy. We both liked the ultra modern interior design, the dark woods and the bright punches of color. We were led to a table by one of the windows with a view of PNC Park in the distance and cold and lonely streets in the foreground. I luckily brought along my coat so I would not freeze!! From our table, we also had a view of the open kitchen. \n\nWe were greeted by Raja, our warm and friendly server. BJ ordered his typical beer and my got my usual adult beverage. It was a drink with something extra, a huge lipstick imprint on the rim. So, we were not off to such a good start. \n\nThe menu is limited, we shared a salad and the roasted butternut squash soup with Autumn spiced creme fraiche. It was brought out and served with a flourish. The bowl was placed in front of me and then the soup was poured from a small tureen. The only bad thing was, there was barely enough soup to cover the bottom of my bowl.  But it was good.\n\nBJ ordered the locally raised grass-fed beef. I had warned him that other Yelpers advised that the beef was tough. They were right. Good thing BJ is strong enough to wield his not so sharp enough knife to actually be able to cut thru said beef. He also got a baked potato and a side of white cheddar crab mac. We both felt that the mac needed a bit more flavor. I ordered the shrimp pad thai. It was served in an interesting bowl and was an average size portion. I did enjoy the dish, however, I had a serious case of hives shortly after dining here. I feel it was connected to the pad thai. \n\nWe also shared one of the desserts. It was interesting, but not enough that I remember much about it. Much like my experience at Habitat. It's nothing that is worth repeating.
