Little hidden Gem in Saint-Laurent.\n\nHad the Omuraisu and the Fried Fish (split with a friend) and both were absolutely great!\nBoth were only $10.\n\nThe quality was clearly there.\nThis is a small family run place and one of the owner who served us was extremely friendly.\n\nA friend lives nearby and I will definitely return.
