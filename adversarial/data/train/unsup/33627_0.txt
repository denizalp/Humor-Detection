For the last 4+ years I've lived in Madison, I've always driven by Bonfyre on the Beltline thinking this was just some other American Bar\/Grill restaurant. But boy was I wrong! I came here last Wednesday night with some family friends and my boyfriend, and I was surprised to find that the reservations we had made were much needed! The restaurant was very full at around 6pm (so make your reservations, people!). \n\nWe were seated in a large, cosy booth. The ambiance was nice, although a bit too dark for us. That was only an issue when ordering off the menu, but that's just personal preference in my opinion. We ordered the fried calamari and the mussels in a light curry broth to start with.The calamari is FANTASTIC! Not the tiny rings that you typically get at a normal restaurant, these are large, generous pieces that are lightly battered and fried till golden brown. Mussels were also really fresh and delicious, the broth goes very nicely with bread as we waited for our entrees to come out. \n\nAs per the reviews, I really wanted to try the rotisserie chicken, but the Seafood Trio was calling my name. Seafood portions were generous, although the collard greens were a bit too tangy for me. I'll let this fly, since I'm not a fan of vinegary dressings. \n\nService was also good, they were very attentive although they seemed very busy. Nice atmosphere for a casual dinner, and the food is amazing. I'll be back to try the rotisserie chicken (and most likely everything else on the menu)!
