I went in for a wax at the benefit bar and came out with a second degree burn on both sides of my face (1 month before my wedding).  The burns were so bad that it looks like I was in a car accident.  The girl who waxed me was Tasha.  She noticed my face turning red and still kept waxing, she started making excuses about why my skin was so red, she even brought the esthetician, Chelsea, over and she made it worse by putting other face products on the burn!  The next day I ended up having to go to urgent care and get 3 prescriptions for my face.  I went to talk to the store manager, Brian, and he did not apologize nor did he acknowledge what happened to my face.  He was extremely rude.  Never stepping foot in there again.
