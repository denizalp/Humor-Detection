Wow Bowlero, we came here on our kids spring break we had the early afternoon planned out. We came on a Thursday two games for a family of four came out to $70+ bucks way over priced if you ask me, but ok we went to our lane the other half of our lane was never cleaned off. The last players cups stayed there our full two hours we were there. We ordered appetizers drinks and desserts. We played our 1st game no drinks nothing has came by now. We had asked about this and were told oh ya let me get it.. 15mins we had the buzz in to ask again a guy came by and said there was a mix up and he will need to redo the drink order. My kids kept looking up everytime a waitress  would come by and thought they were bringing our food. Food never came. We did however get our drinks for free because they forgot but that's it. Still food never did come. While all this my daughter found a open pocket knife on the floor. I didn't want any one to get hurt, so I asked a bus boy passing through if he could pick it up. He didn't seem to care or apologized for it. Bowler wasn't a pleasant  experience especially for already paying so much.
