Magic Mike Live is the perfect Girls Night Out!\n\nWhen you get together with some great friends, this is the show to see.  It's located in the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino.  Entering from the doors that faces Harmon Ave, just make a left until you see the signage above the show entrance.  They do check ID before scanning your ticket to make sure you are of age.  \n\nBefore you know it you are heading down the stairs to the showroom. There is a bar to get your fill of refreshments before heading down one more set of stairs to the main seating area.  If the lines are too long, don't worry!  There are some attractive male waiters coming around for drink orders quite frequently.  The tables are adorned with Magic Mike dollars to make it rain on the lovely gentlemen performers.  Some other male review shows dealing out your own singles but there is no need to make change before attending.  \n\nWe sat in Section 108 and 109.  Each section was only 2 seats at a table.  Along the stage there are sofas that line the outside with the tables immediately backing up to them.  I found that this section gave a center stage view of show happening all around us.  The performance not only happens on stage but also happens at your seat.  Not complaining at all!  It's a high energy show with great music to keep you entertained the whole way through.  The only way it could've been better if Channing Tatum himself showed up.  This girl can keep hoping right? Enjoy the show!
