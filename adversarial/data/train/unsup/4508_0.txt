There are no stars for this company!! They are thieves and liars!!! I checked out Monday and when I got home I realized I left multiple expensive clothing behind!!! I \ncalled right away and they told me they could not check and housekeeping is contracted out!! There was another guest in the room and could not call room to check!! I could not believe it!! I know exactly where it was and told them but they were rude and not helpful!! I. Know if I would of booked directly with signature I would have my stuff!! Instead either the maid service is sporting my clothing or the girls in the office!!! What kind of people are working for this company?!?!
