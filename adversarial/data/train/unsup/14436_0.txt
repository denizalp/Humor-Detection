I can't say enough to dissuade people from going with Rogers for their telecomm needs. I've seen it time and again with my previous contracts and friends' services. \n\nAstronomical bills. Who-Gives-A-Shit service. Contractual nightmares and irregularities.\n\nIf you want that You're-Just-Another-Number feeling, in addition to that What's-This-Other-Charge question with each bill, go with Rogers.
