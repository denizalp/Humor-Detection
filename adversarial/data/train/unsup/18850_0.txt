Wow.   I felt as bored as Britney.  This show was a complete waste of time and money.   The only upside was Will I am and Iggy Azalea videos tied to her bad dancing.  Britney use to have something.  At this point, it is time to retire or Work B***h.\n\nSave your money and see anything else.   Muppets would have been better
