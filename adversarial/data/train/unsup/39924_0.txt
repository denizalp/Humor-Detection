Tried their build your own plate. Choose waffle with Earl grey and oolong ice creams with green tea cream sauce while having cookie chunks and cinnamon as toppings. Very satisfied! The Earl grey and oolong ice cream taste very favourable and would want to have that again. This will possibly goes good with a cup of green tea.\n\nAlso tried the coconut tart. Not too sweet but not very strong in coconut flavour as well.\n\nAtmosphere is simple and not very loud. Nice place to have a chat with friends
