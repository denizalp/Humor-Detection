We ate here twice for breakfast. The service was good and there was a good variety of food but the quality of the food was only okay. The corned beef hash was the worst I've ever had -- it was so full of fat & gristle that two of us had to discreetly dispose of it in our napkins. We paid $68.10 for breakfast for 3 which we thought was high. We ate at a Denny's within walking distance on the third day for half the price although it couldn't compare to the quantity or variety of food at Flavors. If you're staying at Harrah's, it's convenient but I wouldn't make a point of going there if you're staying elsewhere.
