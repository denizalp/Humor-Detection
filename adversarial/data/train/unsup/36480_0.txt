The food is bland and service is suspect (slow)... clientele is senior citizens which I personally don't mind... food is a little expensive given the mediocrity of taste. I have been there twice now, and was underwhelmed both times. Probably wont go back, but if your 55+ you should check it out as you might see some of your buddies....
