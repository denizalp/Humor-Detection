40 bucks for what?!?! \n\nI never have been a fan of buffet....why....cause im small and cant eat for my money worth, im a picky eater (hence the name) and three....my parents called it boofet and thats what i have been saying for years....*traumatized moments*\n\nit was quite a long line for dinner so go if your almost straving so you can eat more! \n\nIf you are a lover of seafood, their crab legs are pretty decent..voiced by my peer * i had a nibble* but nothing else spoke to me....their pea risotto was pretty good and tomato bisque but everything else was just kinda plain and bland....so its worth it if you go for seafood but nothing else....\n\nwhen i went, they had american, mexican, asian and italian theme food...their desserts were aite but den again, nothing fancy\n\nTip: sit by the toilet...free some space =)
