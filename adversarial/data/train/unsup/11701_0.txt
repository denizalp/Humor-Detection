I guess they have a following, but it's not that good. I had lunch here years ago and now gave it another try...\nThe rolls were just average to below average and overall nothing special at all.\nThe royal spicy tuna roll had such little tuna in it that it seemed nearly missing of any tuna at all.\nFish on the nigiri is not that fresh and unagi was mushy and boring, we've had better.\nScreaming O, was off flavor, mushy tuna that should be seared should it not?\nEven the wasabi was dull and dry.\n\nYeah, sushi imagine, not reality.
