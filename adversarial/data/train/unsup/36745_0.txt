So my friends live in the area around here (Wychwood Heights its called? I unno. St Clair West seems better..)and this is their go - to spot for brunch. I suggested we go to Brunhworks, but they told me this place was a lot cheaper, so $$$ yes.\n\nWe waited about 45 minutes for a table in that super cramped little area. That was a mission and a half on its own..plus the cost of being hungover and it was snowing outside (As usual) so I wasn't the happiest per say.\n\n\nAnyways, we sat down to a cute booth (super props to them fro having a booth that I actually fit into..super props for that)\n\nWe had :\n\n1. The Westtern Sandwich - This was.. okay. The eggs were overcooked for my taste, and there wasn't a top of toppings. The bread could've used some butter, but yea. The boom frites were amazing though. Super super super good.\n\n2. The Chick-a-dilla - This was a a breakfast quesidilla I guess. It was quite tiny I guess, bbut the guac was AWESOME.\n\n3. The Power Breakfast - Standard fare\n\n4. My friend's Omelette.- didn't get to try this.\n\nThe place is cute, but the breakfast was under-whelming. The servers were super super cute though.\n\nDon't come here during the rush rush hours like we did, but it's a decent place I guess. We'll be back here soon
