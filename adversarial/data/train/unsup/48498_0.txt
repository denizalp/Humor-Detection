Great vibe for brunch\/lunch. Small, packed, but lots of seating. Lots of menu choices and many bagel types and types of spread. We ordered sandwiches. Meats were well cooked, had great flavor, and were in decent portions. Soup of the day was a creme of carrot which I was skeptical of, but became more and more of a fan with every bite. Eggs served on the side were fluffy but unspiced or salted. Tea was served in a french press. Juices were fresh and hand squeezed. Overall upbeat trendy place to eat at, but expect a wait and slower service during peak times. \nWould return and definitely recommend if not just for a bagel to go
