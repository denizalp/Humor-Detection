The double cap is always worth it. Eggs Benedict every time for me- I am a fan. The waitress started up selling before I could ask for my cappuccino- had to calm her down with a few emphasized eye blinks.\n\nThey did not bring us any bread to start....hmmm, had that every time before. I casually mentioned it and the waitress was hugely apologetic and offered to bring whatever we wanted- because they addressed it and the breakfast is spectacular- 5stars is my rating :).
