This is the least busy Apple store compared to the Fashion Mall and Caesar's Forum shops.  The customer  attention and service are good.  The merchandising is consistent with other Apple stores. \n\nIn the hot summer months it's not the ideal location to wait in line for a new product release because you will be sweating outdoors.  Pre-order online or wait at a store in a cooler climate.
