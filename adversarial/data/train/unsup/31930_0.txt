Service here is quite good.  Zero complaints for service or atmosphere.  Everything seems to be in order for that.  Food quality though leaves a lot to be desired food was somewhat cold and not very well prepared.  Seems more like food you find in a diner in the middle of nowhere i.e. \"The Greasy Spoon\".  Certainly not on par with other Pizzeria UNOs I have been to like in Orlando. Giving it 2 stars as nothing is actually wrong with the restaurant just the food is really horrible.
