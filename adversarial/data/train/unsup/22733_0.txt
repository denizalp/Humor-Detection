My wife and I stopped here around 11:30 so we could have had lunch or breakfast. We choose breakfast. The place was very busy but we didn't have to wait very long.\n\nOur waitress Jackie immediately came to our table and took our drink order. Then gave us plenty of time to decide on our entr√©e. \n\nI ordered the \"Build your own omelet\" With a side of cottage cheese and diced potatoes. I know it's hard to ruin breakfast but . . . this place does breakfast right. My omelet was perfect in every way. \n\nMy wife ordered 2 eggs (medium) w \/ waffles they were perfect as well. On a side note; \n\nBy the way we saw a couple of guys who ordered the biscuits & gavel. .. Holy cow they were  HUGE. \n\nFOOD: Diner style comfort food. HUGE portions.  SERVICE: Our waitress Jackie was very friendly, and attentive. PRICE: Was NOT expensive at all for the quantity of food you get. CONCLUSION: The food was served hot , and quickly (even though they are very busy) and the way we wanted. I see why they are sooooooooooo busy.
