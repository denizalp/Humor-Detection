I was asked to Lulu's 13 by my brother's trivia team.  There was a championship going on and they needed an extra team mate.  It so happened to be Cinco de Mayo. that day.  I got a margarita that was on special.  I got the blended which was nice.\n\nI ordered the quesadilla off the regular menu because I was not overly hungry.  The chicken was good.  It was well put together.  Only complaint was the guacamole.  It had very hard pieces of avocado in it.  It was a small part of the plate so I didn't complain about it.  I will hope it was just because they were busy that they didn't take better care of the guacamole.\n\nOur server was good considering he must of had a lot of tables.  I would be willing to give Lulu's another try next time I'm over by East Towne Mall.
