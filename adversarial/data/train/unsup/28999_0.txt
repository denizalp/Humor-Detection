Went on a friday night around 8 pm. The line actually moves pretty fast. \nWaited only about 30 min.  Usually I have waited up to 1 hour or more.  Now for the food.  There is a large selection of items.  My favorites are the prime rib and shrimp cocktail.  They also had kobe sirloin steak.  The quality of the prime rib is better than some restaurants.  Some of the other items such as pizzas and asian foods are above average for a buffet.  I will highly recommend if you have not been here before.  The wynn buffet might have a slight edge on this one.
