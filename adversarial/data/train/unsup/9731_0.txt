Fraying around the edges (e.g., wallpaper, air condition system), but overall a decent place to hang your hat for a night or two.\n\nRooms rather large with all the standard amenities. Lobby bar area nicely appointed with free Wi-Fi to sync up my iPhone (as data roaming charges too expense to use while out and about). Starbucks also in the lobby for grabbing breakfast on the go.\n\nStaff was extremely helpful and accommodating of my food snobbery in search of one decent meal while visiting the area on quick business trip.\n\nFitness center is barely the size of a broom closet. Access to the nearby Parkway Athletic Club helps a bit but it's no great shakes either. The weights and cardo area is cramped. The whole place could use a fresh coat of paint for starters.
