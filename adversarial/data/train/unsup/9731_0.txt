Years ago, when I went here for the first time, it was awesome. The selections were varied and tasted oh so good. Last night, despite that it was New Year's Eve, even after the lobster and champagne, Wicked Spoon disappointed us. The selections were so few and the desserts that they brag about was mediocre at best. It was an absolute disappointment. Well, now we know not to be back here.
