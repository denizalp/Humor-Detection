Right. Before the review begins, this is the only restaurant I have been to that does not seem to care about constructive criticism. Heres why: While having a great time due to the darkness and novelty experience, guests including us have more or less been complaining about the mediocre food since 2008, so I will start with that point as well. \n\nFood\nWe were a foursome and all tried different dishes. Steak, Chicken, Shrimp and Pasta. While the steak was cooked fine (get it rare), the vegetables were bland and drenched in fat, shrimp overcooked, the risotto was a joke - you could have stood on it. The deserts were clearly bought in. Your standard high-trans fat for-shelf-life glucose bombs. Thanks for heating the bread to pretend you are a fine-dining place, that ultimately lifted expectations to get disappointed even more. It is difficult to understand, how a restaurant with such short menu fails to deliver any sort of quality on each dish. \n\nValue \nAnd while the servers may be legally blind, the operations management surely is not, but they compensate well with ignorance. Also, they need vision to count the cash before laughing themselves to sleep every night. Really and truly: I dont understand why they seem to have no ambitions to improve.\n\nAmbience\nAmbi...what? Its pitch dark. Before you go in there is an old-school, dusty foyer with pricey drinks being served. Nuff said. \n\nRating (2 Stars total)\nFive stars for novelty effect, friends telling great jokes and the good cause\nOne star for a missed opportunity to wow guests using their only sense left\nZero stars for lowest quality-to-price ratio ever experienced in a restaurant \n\nAlternatives\nOrder good take-out food, turn off the lights and donate $5 to your favorite charity\n\nReviewed March 2012
