Ok gatta say, \"Hell Yeah\"!! Finally found some good A** Pizza!! My bro at work told me bout this place. Had to check it out! Even thou its in Old Town Glendale an i live in Suprise! But worth the trip. All the ingredients was fresh, with the right amount of cheese an sauce! Got the wings an they was banging too!! The whole experience was good! The staff seemed really nice!! An the price wasnt bad at all! Plus it was cleaner than most stores you just walk in. So YES I will be back!! Over an Over again!! LoL. Its worth the stop!!! An parking isn't hard to find. But you might have to walk a little distance! Still worth the stop!!
