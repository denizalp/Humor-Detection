I discovered this place years ago when I was skateboarding with my buddy. We had maybe $20 between us but soon discovered that we had more then enough. We knew little about feta cheese or olives at the time but knew we loved it. Simply asking the man what he thought was the best we both left with enough feta and olives to kill a small village. We were in heaven! \n\nThat was 14 years ago and to this day I still find myself going there with a few bills in hand asking him what he would recommend. I have learned a lot about feta, olives, and all the other goodies they serve here but the one lesson I learned that has really stuck with me is this: When you are in need of a tasty goat milk feta and some garlic stuffed olives, there is no better place to go then Kalamata Grocery.
