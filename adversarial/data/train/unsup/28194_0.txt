First, elote in a cup. Second, for $4.50 I was expecting to get a delicious prepared elote in a cup. It was definitely not that. It's cheese, mayo, and what I assume are frozen corn kernels because you can't be bothered to use whole corns or you would offer that option, right? Third, the raspados we're digusting, sugary, and somehow still watery. Don't offer the option to add lechera if you're not adding any to the raspado. Fourth, it's over priced, there's like 10 people working and it still took you 20 minutes to prepare my order, and why do you call out a number if you don't tell your customer what number they will be? I could have easily grabbed the wrong order. Final thoughts, this place is disappointing and over hyped. The people who go here don't know what good Mexican munchies are if they rate this place so highly.
