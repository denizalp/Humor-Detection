Want to give it more stars but I can't. One star was for the taste of everything which was very good. Second star was for the creativity in the menu. They definitely lost a star in the preparation of things. I understand that the place is new and running but it definitely shouldn't take more than 30 min after I get my drink to get my food. Second of all the place is very chaotic. For what ever reason things don't look organized in the kitchen or the juice floor. And lastly we had went the week it opened and seen so many mistakes on people's orders. I know this is only because they are getting blitzed by everyone but I have been to other grand openings and haven't seen anything like this.
