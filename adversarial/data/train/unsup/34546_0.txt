I tend to go during non conventional hours because it can be packed around the typical lunch and dinner time. I love the monthly sandwich that changes and at first I thought that their prices were high, but the amount of food you receive is huge. I always have leftovers for the next day's lunch or dinner. The food I've received has always been fresh and my guests have also enjoyed their meals.
