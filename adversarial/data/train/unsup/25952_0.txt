I've been working in the food service industry for quite some time and am fairly easy going and understanding when I go out to eat. So the fact that I'm complaining to begin with is a big deal. First , there were three people working and one person in line ahead of me. No one acknowledged my presence or even made eye contact with me for the whole time they made his sandwich....When the boy behind the counter finally said something to me...it was \"Sorry. What do you want?\"\nI asked for itailian bread, he got white, I asked if it was the Italian and he said it was....spoiler alert, when I got home with it, it wasn't itailian, it was white. Oh well. Bread is bread. Back to the rude people making my sandwich. I asked for a specific sub, he said I had to pick all the ingredients myself. So I asked for everything that came in that sub and he asked me to tell him what come sin it. Then he made a big deal about having to turn around and look at the picture of the sub. The other lady sort of rolled her eyes at me. I was still trying to be pleasant at this point even though I was getting pretty frustrated that no one was helpful and made me feel like I was inconveniencing then for even coming in. Like they had better things to be doing. When I finally paid for the sub, the lady asked again what sub I had....like she didn't just help make it. \nNine of these things by themselves would have been upsetting, except for the lack of humanity in these employees. But all of those little, snide, rude mannerisms just made it such an unpleasant event to get lunch! And, like I said, when I opened up my sandwich, it was wrong. \nI won't be back, and I'll certainly tell my friends to avoid it. \n\nThere's a great Whataburger in that same parking lot. Phenomenal. \n\nThis Subway location is not terrible, but the staff is just rude and barely alive.
