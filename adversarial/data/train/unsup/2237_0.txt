Sadly I will never come here again. The food is just as great but the service has become unbearable. If you've read my last review, you'll see that I mentioned the lady who serves and how she lacks  in the good sense department and customer service. I chalk this up to culture differences. So I usually just laugh it off in my head.\n\nToday I brought my mom and sister here and the lady throws our straws. When she gathered our dirty plates she slammed them atop one another. I found it useless to tell her thank you as she continually scowls and can never bring herself to say \"you're welcome\" I hate to bring up the fact that she was very welcoming to the Caucasian patrons. Hell she's even nice to my boyfriend, apparently he has the right shade of brown. Lol I can imagine if she knew he was Latin. No more extra Naam babe, you've been outed. \n\nSo it is what it looks like. I'm nice and respectful so I have no choice but to go to the obvious. She's another foreigner that has these twisted preconceived  notions in regards to minority's. Yeah, you may think I'm nuttier than squirrel sh^t but I'm not someone who thinks every inconvenience has anything to do with color. This lady though is mad! So while the food is good, I will not spend my time or money eating at my second favorite Indian restaurant. In the wise words of my sister, it should be mandatory for citizens and foreigners to take some type of cultural sensitivity training before opening any business. I did think of a joke though, she must be the bizarre in New India Bazaar. Hey I didn't say my joke would be funny.
