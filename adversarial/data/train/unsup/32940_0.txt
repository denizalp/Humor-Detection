I was really excited to come here based on the reviews, but I was sadly disappointed. The restaurant design and atmosphere was amazing. The menu was also creative and definitely something different from your average Mexican restaurant. \nThe let-down was after the food came. I ordered a a steak taco and a chicken adobo taco with an horchata. My husband ordered coconut ceviche and more tacos. Our tacos were served cold and lacked flavor. The salsa was okay. No limes were served with our tacos. To top it off, service was horrible. We waited so long for our food to come out and our waiter was practically non-existent. \nDon't think we will ever be coming back. Maybe for happy hour? But not for food.
