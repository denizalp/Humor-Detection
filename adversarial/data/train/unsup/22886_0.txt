Oh ribeye cap...\n\nWhere have you been all my life?! I know, I know. You've been there for me the whole time. But like a jerk, I never knew you existed on your own, separate from my now-former favorite cut of meat: the ribeye. You've always been my favorite part of the cow, but I never knew it was possible to have you and only you...Gordon Ramsay Steak made a dream (I never knew I had) come true. The fact that they offer this piece of meat is worth the 5 stars alone. Google it. You know you want to...\n\nAnother 5 star item? The sticky toffee pudding with brown butter ice cream. Not only is the presentation clever (the brown butter ice cream was served as a \"stick of butter\"), but the flavor lives beyond the looks and the hype. My friends and I agreed: we're willing to brave the Strip traffic and casino smoke to sit at the bar here, have some Rince Cochon on tap and some sticky toffee pudding.\n\nOther notables:\n-the variety of the menu- it is a steakhouse, but if you feel the need to veer from their specialty, they have several seafood and other meat options. My friend got the Fisherman's Grill, a sampling of seafood that includes shrimp, salmon, mussels, lobster and perfectly cooked scallops.\n-beef wellington - how can you visit a steakhouse envisioned by a British chef and not experience tender bites of beef wrapped within puff pastry that's not even soggy on the bottom!
