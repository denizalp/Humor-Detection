Food tasted fine, employees friendly, eating area clean. Met my expectations.  If you do not expect huge portions of Mexican food, you will enjoy.  I did like the fact you can get your receipt emailed to you instead of getting a slip of paper.  I think all places should do that and avoid cutting extra trees.
