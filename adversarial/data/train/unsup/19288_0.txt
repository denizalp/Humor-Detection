Love this stadium as they open the roof and windows and you can enjoy the beautiful view of the city while watching our Arizona Diamondbacks.\nPicked up our tickets at will call and proceeded to the gates. It was HOT out!\n\nRequested that my daughter not go thru metal detector due to her medical device and they didn't bat an eye and provided a female to do a pat down. It was fast and efficient.\n\nAll the Chase staff was so friendly and nice.\n\nNow, the reason I didn't give 5 stars is the price and quality of food! Holy schmoly its expensive.  I paid $11.25 for a draft beer that was chilled a bit, not even cold and refreshing. Brats were $7.25, giant cookie $5, and a snow cone $4.  Spent a good chunk of change and will definitely come more prepared next time as so many people carried in their own food.
