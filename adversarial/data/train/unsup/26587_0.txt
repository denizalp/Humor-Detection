This a great space to bring your dog.  There are two spaces in this park.  One for little dogs and one for big dogs, though I've used both spaces for either size dogs.  I've often seen people who have unsocialized dogs first used the smaller space to begin socializing their dogs until they are able to handle the big space with the other dogs.  In the past two years that I have brought my dogs to this park, I've never seen an incident go down.  All the owners are extremely attentive to the environment and are always ready to respond to any situation.  People are friendly and really great dog owners.  There are tons of tennis balls.  Tons of fountains for dogs to drink out of, a hose to clean your dog off after playing in the mud, doggie poop bags (by the way, I haven't stepped in dog shit yet) and toys galore.  \n\nThis is just a great space.
