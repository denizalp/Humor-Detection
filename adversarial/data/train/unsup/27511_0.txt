I hired the string quartet, LFQ, for my wedding ceremony and cocktail hour. My guests all thought they were great. I felt that I didn't get what I paid for.\n\nMy husband and I spent hours going through their repertoire, listening to quartet versions of the songs on YouTube and carefully selecting what we wanted to hear. We provided the list to the contact person, but our selections were completely ignored. In fact, they didn't even play the song (Air on the G String, pretty standard fare) I had chosen for my bridal party to walk down the aisle to. I don't even know the song they actually played. Every time I hear A on the G String, I'm brought back to that moment and I am annoyed. They played the theme to Super Mario Brothers during my cocktail hour. Cute? Kind of. Not on my list though, and not what I wanted to hear. The played a lot of classical musical. (Also not on my list.) I wanted to hear Stairway to Heaven and Dave Matthews Band, which is why I spent so much money on a string quartet instead of hiring a group of college students.\n\nAdditionally, after the ceremony they were to go to the reception location and being playing there. When I walked into my cocktail hour, their instruments were sitting by their chairs, but they were not to be seen. I said something to my dad and he mentioned he saw one down at the hotel internet cafe on the computer. What?! Seriously?! My father went down and got him. His response? \"Oh, we didn't know we were supposed to play as people were entering.\"\n\nLike I said, my guests loved the quartet, but they didn't pay for something they didn't get. If I could go back, I would save $900 and hire the college students.
