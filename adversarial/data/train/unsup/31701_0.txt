Trader Joe's has a new loyal customer! \n\nEverything about this visit was outstanding. Customer service here was wonderful I was greeted when I walked in, given tons of great tips and options by the staff and thanked for my business! Now, that kind of treatment will keep me coming back! \n\nThere were tons of delicious options to chose but I was especially pleased with all the healthy snack options which come in handy when most of the day you are chained to a desk. \n\nAnd the wine selection was ahhhmazing!! I totally think wine should be it's own food group! I mean I left with four bottles that I'm looking forward to trying! What can I say...I'm a sucker for wine. \n\nYes, I concur, parking is a pain and hard to find and the parking lot is tight...but I'm going to just keep circling and hoping for a VIP spot in the front!
