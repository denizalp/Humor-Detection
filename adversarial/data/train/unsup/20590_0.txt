I eat here every week. This isn't the best sandwich shop in town but the location is convenient and they take the coupons I get in the mail. Not every location takes them and I refuse to pay regular price for a sandwich at port of subs. The $5 large coupons are the best but the BOGO coupons are great too. I had a old school stamp card from 2005 that I found in my desk and this location still took it even though they haven't used that rewards program in a while. I had my whole card stamped in so I just needed my free sub! I didn't expect him to take it but thought it was worth a try so it ended up working out and I gave him a tip.  \n\nThe sandwich I ordered and always order is the #1 and that has ham, salami, capicolla, pepperoni & provolone cheese on my choice of white bread. of course I have to add my toppings like mustard, mayo, onion yadda yadda. I like how they slice the meat fresh in front of you. They just don't put enough meat on it. The sandwiches here are good or I wouldn't eat them but like I mentioned before, to pay full price with out a coupon when you could get more bang for your buck at Jersey Mike's is crazy. keep your eye out for coupons or have family save them for you like I do!
