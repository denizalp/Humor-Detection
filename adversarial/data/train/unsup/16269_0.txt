This place is amazing.  It is a smaller massage therapy clinic so it has a nice friendly homey feel to it.  I am able to get an appointment on fairly short notice.  All of the staff are amazing and friendly.  My favourite RMT there is Alycia.  She listens to what you say and her music selection is awesome (think Indie Chill stuff - not nature sounds).\nThe bill Green Shield directly which is fabulous.\nIt can be a bit tricky finding parking though.
