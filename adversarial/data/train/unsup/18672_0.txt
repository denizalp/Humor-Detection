Solid 4 stars.\n\nI usually judge Thai places on their noodle dishes and this place is GREAT.  Their spicy noodles were better than most and very spicy when I ordered it \"2 spicy\" out of 3.  Ingredients were fresh, service was good, decor was simple but nice, and the price was fair.  Note:  You will like this place even more if you like Thai Milfs.\n\nThe only thing that would make this place better would be if they carried soy milk to make Thai Tea.
