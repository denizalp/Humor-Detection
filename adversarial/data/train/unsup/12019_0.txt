This place is awesome!  Friendly staff, great beers and some pretty darn good music.  It seems like they've changed a couple of staff here recently and I'm loving all the new faces so far.\n\nThe first time I came here, I ate in the side with all the rockstar memorabilia.  It's cool over there, def give it a look see.  Lately though, I prefer the bar.  Always somebody friendly to chat with.  Some great recommendations on beers as well as quick friendly food service.  The fried brussel sprouts are a must.  The rest is up to you.\n\nWill I be back....  YES!  This may be my new local watering hole.
