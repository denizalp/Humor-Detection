Ugh.  It was time for the annual invasion known as going to see the GYN peeps.  I've been a patient at WSC for at least seven years and usually see Dr. Volker, but he didn't have any appointments available until July.  I was okay with being seen by a nurse practitioner, so I accepted an appointment with Sheila Tack at this location.  WSC has a few offices around the valley, but it was my first time at the Spring Valley office.  I walked into a packed waiting room,  which is typical for an OB\/GYN office; I was prepared to be there for at least an hour and a half.  I signed in for my appointment 20 minutes early and sat in one of the comfy chairs and settled in.  I was given some paperwork to fill out a few minutes later and having completed that, I sat down and was engrossed in reading my friends' Yelp check-ins when I heard my name called.  What?  I even looked around before I got up to make sure there wasn't another Theresa there (yes, that's my name)--I was called in at 10:20am, my actual appointment time.  I got weighed, had blood pressure taken, and then donned the fashionable exam gown with the opening in the front, of course.  And then...I waited for about twenty minutes in the exam room.  At least in there you can lie down on the exam table and chill out.  Sheila came in to do the exam and she had company:  a male medical student.  Oh joy.  Whatever--these students have to learn somehow.  I just tried to ignore him.  Ms. Tack was very professional and personable.  She didn't rush through the exam and answered the questions that I had thoroughly.  Of course, the whole thing probably took less than ten minutes.  I'm happy to say that this session with the lady doctor, er, nurse practitioner was done in an hour from the time I checked in and I don't have to do it again until 2014.  The End.
