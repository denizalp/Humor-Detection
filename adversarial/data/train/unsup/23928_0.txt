Ugh I don't get this place. This is a club for media type people. But the type of people who become members here don't have anything interesting to talk about. Guys only seem interested in picking up girls, thinking being members at this club is an enough of a bragging right to impress the girls. It makes me wonder if these people are even serious about arts and media. Frankly I had more engaging conversations with staff here.  \n\nThis club holds fun arts events and parties, which I think are worth the price of membership. I've come here for exhibitions for a number of times, which were really fun. There is screenings of rare old movies too here. Patio is fabulous and foods are pretty good, and staff is polite. There are lots of couches everywhere to sit down and hang around for conversations.
