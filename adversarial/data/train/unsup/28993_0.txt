This was a date night location since we had a gift card to Food Fight restaurant group and had not been here yet. I started off with a recommend cocktail from the waiter. It had matcha tea in it and was incredibly light and refreshing! Then we had the brussel sprouts as an appetizer. They were flavored well and had nice crispy edges. Definitely recommend. For the main part of the meal, I had the steak and my partner had the fettuccine. Her plate was practically licked clean, so you know that was good! I had requested my steak medium-rare and definitely had some pieces that were more rare. Unfortunately, did not eat those as they were too rare for my taste. However, the medium-rare pieces were great and melted like butter in my mouth. \nWe finished the evening with a London Fog and the granola dessert. The granola dessert was good, but I think I was expecting a slightly sweeter dessert. \nOverall, a great meal and I'd be happy to eat at Everly again!
