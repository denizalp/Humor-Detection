Over priced and poor service\nAgree with Lexi  N\nWe had 2 slices of duck as the Duck Entree\nAnd our waiter would bring us drinks and walk away for 20 minutes. It was almost an hour before the men had 2 drinks and we were able to order entree.\nThe sever brought my appetizer first before two other guests with me. The beef tartar was not good because it was covered by hollandaise sauce and a hard boiled quail egg. I pushed it away, but the two men ate the rest because they were starved.  I complained to server and to tell the Chef that it was not good; but no one offered to remove it from bill or give us complementary dessert.  \nI ordered Pheasant expect the whole bird, as a friend of my parents have hunted for us 10 years ago.  But instead, I received half of a bird.\nI had two men with me, and they needed more.\nThe server continued to be in other areas and give poor. \nMy husband and I were the guests of the other  man, otherwise I would have disputed the bill.  He should be reimbursed
