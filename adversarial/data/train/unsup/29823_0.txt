Better seen as a fast food joint than a real restaurant. We were in\/out in 45 minutes. Waiter was rushing us almost as soon as we sat down, and rotisserie chicken came with 10 minutes. The white breast meat was dried out. Obviously not prepared to order. Awful french fries and inedibly over-spiced rapini. Really indifferent service.
