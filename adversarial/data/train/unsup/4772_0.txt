This place is nice. Expect to pay a pretty penny for your food. Is it worth it? For some things, yes. Other dishes, no.\n\nWe had a group of 6. And it took us 2 1\/2 hours to dine. We were not sat for awhile due to missing one person. Once we got to our table, the waitress seemed overwhelmed. We kept having to get her attention just to order everything. Some drinks weren't getting to the table or some of the appetizers. They ended up giving us 2 drinks for free. She seemed much more calm after a minute. But there was about 4 different people serving us throughout the meal. It just didn't seem very organized. But the staff was very kind.\n\nMost of the prices are pretty decent. We ended up paying about 92$ pp since we split the bill. This was for appetizers, dinner, dessert and drinks. \nThe dishes that were worth the price:\n\nThe polenta side. I know it's just a side, but it's topped with truffle and mushroom. It was the best polenta I've ever had. Insanely creamy and downright delightful.\n\nThe bacon on the blue cheese salad. So thick and flavorful. \n\nMy aged rib eye was very good. It was cooked perfectly and it was very flavorful. My husband's ribeye cap was overcooked and not so great. If it would have been cooked as asked (medium rare), it would have been much better.\n\nOverall, this is a beautiful restaurant. I'm sure we'll go back. But with the craziness of the service and prices, it may be a minute.
