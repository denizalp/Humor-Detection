This is one of my favorite spots go dine after a loong wait of sitting around in the Indian Hospital's many waiting rooms. \n\nI've never been there during lunch hours, usually right before the evening rush and I've never experienced a long wait. I've noticed that it's pretty quiet, I'm usually sitting at the loudest table in the place! The service is decent. I've had better and I've also have had FAR worse! \n\nThe food is good. Their combinations are GIANT! And so is their soda! They come in these HUGE cups, and it's hard for me to finish a second! lol, but someone at my table is always willing to help me! Their tortas are to DIE for!! I always order either the Al Pastor or Carne Asada Torta! Their salsa is very good but it can be a struggle to get the waitress to get a second bowl. \n\nThe staff behind the counter always seems busy preparing food and getting to-go orders ready. It's sometimes cool to watch them go at it all warp speed! One thing about this place is that you have to go up to the counter to get your ticket when you're ready to pay instead of having the waitress bring you the check. This is a cultural thing, a lot of hardcore authentic mexican places are like this, so just go with it. \n\nParking in their lot can be a lil tricky, I've hit a few cars trying to park my car here, but I think it's because I'm a bad driver. But still make sure your rear view and side view mirrors are facing the right direction! :P and expect a great meal with no frills or BS pretention, this is the real deal... sure, there's better places to get great Mexican food in the town, but after spending half a day to have an IHS dr. tell me that all I need is tylnol, all I want is a flippin' taco!
