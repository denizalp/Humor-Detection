My favorite new restaurant anywhere in the United States. Each experience has been blessedly pleasant at Apteka.  the food is absolutely brilliant. The staff is great. The first time I went, It took me 5 seconds to readjust my expectations to what dining out could be. I literally don't want to eat out anywhere else now. It's a tiny miracle that the place exists and it's gratifying to see they have been successful so far. It feels Like they won't sit still and it's exciting to imagine where they might take their cuisine from here. Bravi to everyone involved.
