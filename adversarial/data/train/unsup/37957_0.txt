This place was a complete surprise. I was not expecting a collision facility so nice and well kept. When I arrived they were cleaning the main area as part of their daily routine I suppose. The waiting area is outstanding with great air conditioning to escape the Vegas heat. They had snacks, WiFi and cable tv. I only needed to come in for a side mirror install which I bought an aftermarket part online. Jack B, the owner, just messaged me on yelp and quoted me a fair price to install the mirror. I came in, and 20-30minutes later, I was out. They did a stellar job. I had to do the painting somewhere else because they quoted me 1-week for some reason. However, I now know where to go when I get into an accident. This is where I'll\nBe taking my insurance check to. \n\nThanks for the experience.
