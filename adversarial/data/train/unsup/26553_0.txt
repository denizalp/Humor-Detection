Such a great experience with Vincent. Called prior and arrived right on schedule. Very professional and completed tha assembly of our bookcase in less time than I planned. Wish we had used Space City when we bought our ikea furniture. That was a very bad experience and this was a very pleasant experience. Thanks to Vincent and will definitely use them again.
