Planned on lunch there after reading the great reviews.  We started with the black bean dip.  When I noticed it was microwaved, we quickly paid our tab and went elsewhere to eat.  This is a neat little place with a cool Jamaican atmosphere, but the really have to lose the microwave.  I can make microwave dinners at home.
