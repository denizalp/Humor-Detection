Glad to see a restaurant succeeding in this space. I hope they stick around.  I brought some out-of-towners here and we ordered a little bit of everything to try. Not one thing disappointed us - My favorite was the quesadilla, which was prepared differently than usual.  It was crispy, flaky and fried. Service was great - waiter was knowledgeable and friendly. Prices were very reasonable and I appreciated that the portions were not huge.  I'll definitely go back.
