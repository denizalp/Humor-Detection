This place was so simple, yet so fun!  \n\nI felt like a kid walking in and I was astounded by the cotton candy flavors offered!  You can even spin your own very large wand of original cotton candy!\n\nThey have a massive gum ball machine in the front window of the shop that lines the quaint Main Street of downtown Belmont.  I was expecting to see the stereotypical self serve scooping style bins of candy with clear bags nearby waiting to be filled.  That wasn't really the case.  This place focuses more on novelty candies and individually wrapped goodies.  Some nostalgic and some trendy offerings are available.\n\nThe staff was friendly and knowledgeable about the product.  It's a quick in and out experience, but I highly recommend it.  Especially for cotton candy lovers!  I will definitely be back!  I want to try every flavor!
