a lot of tricks being played in the hidden fees. this place does not give a rats ass about customer service. i am doing all of their customers a favor by forwarding all of the \"fine print\" to the attorney generals office for review. i believe their practices to be very deceitful! how the hell do you tell someone if they cancel before the 12 month agreement it is a $60 but if you cancel 1 day after they will hit your account for another annual service fee $43 (?) and since you're in the next billing cycle they hit your account for another $10.... what a crock!!
