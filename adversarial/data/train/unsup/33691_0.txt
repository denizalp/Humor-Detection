A group of six of us went last night, had reservations for two weeks and they couldn't find the reservation even though I confirmed the day before. We understand that it's tapas style and everything comes out when it's ready; however, one person wasn't served for 20 mins after we had all eaten AND that's only 20 mins because one of us had to go inquire for the fourth time where her tacos were. No one offered to comp her meal so we were stuck paying for it. We had also ordered a salad to go and the salad was MUCH smaller than the one that we had ordered earlier in the evening and it was missing ingredients. For what you pay and the false hype around this spot, none of us will be going back.
