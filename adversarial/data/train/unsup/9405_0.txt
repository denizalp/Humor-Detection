The cocktails here are terrible, hey just kidding! I have been donating blood since high school, this was one of the best experiences I have ever had. The staff was attentive and made sure I understood everything. My only complaint was that I wanted a seat near the orchestra, again just kidding! Look at it this way, the world has been good to you, so give back a little bit, it's not like they are asking for a pint of blood, oh wait. For the third time, just kidding. I will be back to donate whole blood in December, the floor show starts at 1 PM, see you there. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!
