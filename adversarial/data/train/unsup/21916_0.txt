Wunderbar!   Ausgezeichnet!  \n\nHaving grown up in Munich, Germany I know me some good schnitzel and spaetzli.  Café Berlin has both and more!\n\nIt's tucked away in a small strip mall, and they do close kind of early (8pm except Saturday at 9pm).  Inside, however, you will find some very cool modern\/industrial décor with lots of excellent photos of the Berlin skyline.\n\nStaff seemed very friendly, and our server spoke German (and was from Berlin herself).\n\nThe menu is replete with German classics - schnitzel, rouladen, bratwurst, etc.  They have so many different kind of schnitzels alone!  Plain, with mushroom sauce, with cream sauce, chicken, pork, etc. \n\nWe started with a sampler platter with a wonderful German pretzel (I felt like I was back at Oktoberfest), potato pancakes, and interesting fried onion\/cheese rolls which I had never tried before.  Excellent!  I then tried the schnitzel \"Weiner Art\" which is your basic schnitzel without adornments or sauce.  Schnitzel is a thin piece of chicken or pork (your choice) which is breaded and fried.  They have a regular (one piece) or large (two pieces) portion available.  The regular was plenty for me.  I swapped out the potato salad for their awesome pan fried potatoes.  The schnitzel was perfectly tender and crispy - just like back in Munich.  The potatoes were wonderfully crispy and flavorful.  Awesome all around!  They have a great variety of classic German sides including French fries (pommes frites), German potato salad, fried potatoes, and spaetzli.  \n\nLeave room for dessert... We tried their German Chocolate Cake as well as both Apple (\"Apfel\") and Blueberry strudels.  Amazing!  Incredibly moist cake, and the strudels had perfect thin dough surrounding plump fruit deliciousness.\n\nGerman food is not for everyone; it is classically a meat and potatoes affair without too much seasoning and fanfare.  Café Berlin does it amazingly well!
