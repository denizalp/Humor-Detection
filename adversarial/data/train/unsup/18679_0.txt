Hidden Gem For Great Greek Food\n\nToday, I had a 'hankerin' for some  Greek\/Mediterranean food but had no clue where I should go.  So I turned to my fellow \"yelpers\" for help and after reading reviews I decided to head to George's Famous Gyros and Pasta. \n\nWho would have guessed that this little hidden gem had great tasting Greek food.  George's is unassuming from the outside and even more so inside.  George's is small, the tables are plastic and there isn't much in the way of ambiance.  However, George is wonderful and so is  his food, which is always prepared fresh and is absolutely delicious.  \n\nGeorge understands Greek food. I assume  growing up in Chicago, laid out a great foundation for this eatery. The Greek salad with gyro meat, burgers, and fries are excellent.  However, make sure to bring an appetite because the portions are large, easily enough for two.\n\nAfter finishing a large lunch, and thinking to myself, I cant eat another bite.  Out of the coner of my eye I caught a glimpse of the baklava and it was impossible to pass up.   I had dessert on the brain.  I am so glad I decided to endulge.  The baklava was oozing with honey and had just the right amount of sweetness. A perfect ending to a great lunch.\n\nOh, did I mention the low prices and great service? George's is an incredible value for the high quality of food.  If you enjoy Greek\/Mediterranean food and you're in the area, you should definitely stop by George's, you won't be disappointed.
