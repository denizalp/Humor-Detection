I found myself feeling a little sick last weekend and just wanted to get checked out for the sake of my sanity. I ended up coming to this Convenient Care location as soon as they opened. Once I walked in, I was greeted by a kind woman at the desk and she checked me in right away.\n\nAs I waited to be called back, I enjoyed a complimentary cup of coffee from the Keurig machine. After about five minutes or so, I was taken back by the medical assistant named Darian. During my interview, he made sure that I was well aware of what everything meant in terms of numbers, vital signs, etc. He was so friendly and made me feel comfortable during my visit! Once Darian was done interviewing me, I didn't have to wait long for the doctor. He came in and explained what needed to be explained and I was out of there in no time!\n\nThank you to the awesome staff for making my visit a great one! I would definitely recommend this location!
