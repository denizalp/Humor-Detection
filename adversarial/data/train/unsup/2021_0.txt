you might think a place where the waitresses are in lingerie would be sketchy yet it's anything but. the place is immaculate and the girls make it warm and comfortable. i noticed quite a few customers are women so even they're comfortable with the environment.\n\nCourtney and Deanna are way awesome. their positive attitude is catchy. dig the food, the games, the drinks [kick ass boba. yummy!], and especially the music. \n\na fun place to escape and just chill.
