I took my car here because it was overheating.  I paid $45 for a coolant pressure test to see where the problem was and left my car overnight so they could have time to work on it the following day.  They called the following morning to let me know that the top radiator hose had ruptured, and the bottom needed to be replaced, along with the thermostat (from the car overheating.)  They quoted me $595!!!!!!!! Both radiator hoses for my vehicle run LESS THAN $20 each and the thermostat is around $30.  I called about 5 other auto mechanics, one of which is a specialist in my car, and was told that their quote was absolutely absurd.  I was told by EVERY other mechanic that I called that the labor to replace both hoses and the thermostat is less than 2 hours.  Every other mechanic I talked to also quoted me at less than $300 (less than $250 at some) to do the exact same work.  I have no idea what they are thinking here but I would not take my car here.  The only nice thing I can say is that they were very nice upon my initial arrival and also gave me a ride home so i wouldn't have to sit and wait on my husband to get off work.  I don't know if they quoted me this price because I am a young blonde female or because they just over quote everybody by double what the cost should actually be.  On a side note, I am changing the radiator hose myself today for $15.00 (the cost of the hose) and all I need is a screwdriver.  I might look like a dumb blonde but I know how to replace a rubber hose for less than $600.
