Thanks to Yelp we ventured into this neighbourhood for a Mexican meal. \n\nFirst a note on the neighbourhood. It is beside the tracks and away from the sanitized neighbourhoods of Sun City. Some individuals may not be comfortable and should consider a noon meal. For those more comfortable with world travel, this should be in the top of their list. \n\nWalking in immediately brought me back to a Mexicaleri in Merida, Mexico. The bright colours, painted walls and multiple rooms are typical Mexican. \n\nThe staff match the decor and know their stuff in regards to making suggestions and attentively keep diners happy. \n\nThe food was amazing. All of the usual dishes are in the menu. The flavours are fabulous. The balance of chilli, cilantro and cumin was perfect.\n\nThis would be a regular for me if I lived in the area.
