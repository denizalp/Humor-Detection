Lived here for a year. Never needed to call the maintenance men. Everything worked fine. They kinda tricked us with the demo unit our one bedroom had ugly salmon colored walls made it look older but overall it was clean no bug problems appliances worked perfectly fine. Area is kinda ghetto even though its close to the lakes. Pretty sure my downstairs neighbor sold pot lol and his nasty girlfriend would be moaning ridiculously loud at 7am. Not cool waking up to that ewww. Oh and the water doesn't get very hot that was my biggest issue winter sucked. Not the greatest apartment not the worst but they raised rent to over 800 dollars for one bedroom which i believe you can find much better deals out there.
