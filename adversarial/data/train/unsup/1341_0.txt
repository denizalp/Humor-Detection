I wish I could give this place 2.5 stars. It's nice, BUT... I went in during a summer evening. Reasonably quiet. Ordered a small decaff. It was....adequate, if a  smidge on the pricy side.\n\nPersonally I am not concerned if the staff are like zombies, as long as they don't toss ones credit card back to you, If they look you in the eye, say please and thankyou, then all is well.\n\nAn upside is that one tends to find lots of eye candy opposite sex wise. So, if you want to talk to a Ryan Reynold's lookalike or a Doll faced girl, there's your place!\n\nThe downside, and the thing that knocks it's half star off (if I could give 2.5 stars) is the lack of air conditioning. And effective window shades to keep the sun from knocking your head off or blinding you as it sets in the summer. I am not sure if they have AC or not. If they have, then the bizarre 'lets keep the front door open and let all the heat in\/cold out' in a vain attempt to cool the place is just silly. \n\nClose the door, turn on the AC, voila, a comfy 19c in the heights of summer. Noone likes sticky thighs syndrome on vinyl seats. I also agree with turning off the wifi during peak periods, this is a coffee shop people, not a library.
