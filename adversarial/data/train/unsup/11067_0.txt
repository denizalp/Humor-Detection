I had hopes that this place might be a cheaper version of the nearby La Canasta, but my hopes have been dashed. The food here (I've eaten here 3 times) is decent, but not as good or flavorful or as fresh as La Canasta. Plus the location is amidst what I like to call \"bum central.\" Entering from Van Buren you might feel like you've been dropped into a scene from Resident Evil (my gamer friends will get that one, the rest of you wont). \n\nEven though La Canasta is across the street in the same neighborhood, they have a large parking lot, so you can feel somewhat away from \"bum central\" and the street peoples. \n\nAnd price-wise this place is really only about .50 cent cheaper per most menu items. So If you are ordering for yourself or a couple of people, not really saving any money and you are getting lesser quality food. 2 out of the 3 times I ate here, the tortilla was old and hard as a rock. \n\nPlus there is nothing aesthetically-pleasing about Aya & Peilas. La Canasta is beautiful inside, but this place looks like a converted pawn shop, which I'm pretty sure it used to be! I even like Filberto's better than this place.
