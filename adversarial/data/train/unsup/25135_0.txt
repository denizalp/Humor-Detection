Great environment for a tasty meal.\n\nWe arrived for a lunch on a Monday and was seated outside with a nice view of the river. We split the guanciale and English pea flatbread, along with the beef tartare, as starters, both of which were well prepared and had good flavor. We had the rainbow trout and the burger as entrees, the latter of which was a touch overcooked but seasoned well, while the trout was fresh and tasty. The service was fairly attentive and the outdoor seating pleasant--it's a nice place to enjoy a tasty meal when the weather is nice.
