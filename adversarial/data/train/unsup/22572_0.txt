Still my favorite bar on the main drag of Saint-Laurent in Montreal.\n\nfantastic bartenders, great dancing, lots of free drinks and direct-from-the-bottle pouring (but for some reason, while it's kinda slutty at Senior Frogs, in french, it just comes off as classy, seriously)\n\ngreat staff and promoters too, they'll hook you up if you are having a good time.\n\nHonestly, I've been coming here since it opened and never come to Montreal without one night at Rouge.\n\nps: careful on the stairs when exiting, I've seen some friends go down (but to be fair, one was trying to slide down the banister)
