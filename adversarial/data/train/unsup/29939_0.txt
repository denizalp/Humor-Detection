So I wanna start off by saying that the girls that work at direct have awesome customer service skills and are very helpful and they do have really great deals on nail supplies. I try to come in as often as I can to check out what they have. \n\nOn Friday December 23, 2016 I came in @4pm?? \nAs usual the girl at the counter greeted me and I started looking at their polishes and deals they had for the day. I couldn't help but notice from the corner of my eye an older man behind the counter flirting with one of the customers telling her how good of a deal he was gonna give her so on... \nIt's a small store I was looking at IBD and that's when it got awkward, the \"owner\" I'm assuming (middle eastern\/Indian) tall maybe 40'S male was asking one of the employees (young girl) if she wanted ice cream while he was right behind her with his body pressed behind her, she looked like she wanted to throw up. I felt so uncomfortable that I hurried up and wanted to check out (I should have walked out or said something but I didn't think it was my place)... \nwhen she was writing my sales slip he came behind her and rested his head on her shoulder again super close to her, checking if she was doing it right I'm assuming and she just seemed so uncomfortable. I feel horrible for these girls.... so unprofessional and disgusting! No teen girl wants her boss to be a pervert on them like that... I will no longer be supporting a business like this.
