Had the chicken satay appetizer and Panang curry and sweet and sour with chicken. Both entrees were very very good and the service was very friendly and efficient. Prices are very reasonable considering the amount of food served. Our bill came to $ 32.61 before gratuity. In addition, they offered us complimentary green tea ice cream which was a nice ending to our meal. Thank you Chanpen Thai for a wonderful evening!
