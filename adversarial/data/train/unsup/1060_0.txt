My mother, sister and I had mani\/pedis.  One of the cutest nail botiques I have seen but would have liked a larger polish choice. They also would not open bottles of standard OPI \/ Essie colors that they were out of.  Service was very good and friendly and I received a very detailed mani\/pedi. 5 stars for service,  2 for polish, 4 for ambiance (would have liked jets in the basins).  So I am rounding out to 4 and hope next time they do better on the polish front.
