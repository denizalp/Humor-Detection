When I drop in to bring order to my stored history, there's always a warm welcome. \nThe folks there listen to your need and help you get to a solution. I have gone from a mid-sized (5x10) unit to the small(est?) 5x5 unit. They congratulated me! Truly interested in seeing people succeed with a controlled purge of a hording past. Hours also extended since I started renting.
