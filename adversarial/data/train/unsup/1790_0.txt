Packing up and moving your life across the country can be pretty hectic. This task lands on the bottom tiers of \"things I enjoy.\" However, when it came time to select a moving company to transport the family goods from Charlotte to Chicago, Easy Movers was a fine choice overall.\n\nSince hubs did the front end work of setting up and negotiating with the administrative folks, the only piece I can really comment on is that they stay true to their word. Promises were kept and our household items arrived in Chicago on time and in great shape. The actual guys who moved our boxes and furniture were polite, funny and efficient. The items from our two bedroom townhome were unloaded into our new home in a half day's time. \n\nIf you're moving in or out of the Charlotte area, Easy Movers is a solid choice!
