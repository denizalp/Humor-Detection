I checked out the Korean Family Sauna website first so I could learn what to expect. After reviewing it, I knew that I wanted to go. So I did.\n\nWhen you pay ($20), you receive a locker key, a pair of cotton shorts and a cotton tshirt, and 2 very small towels. (um, I should be specific - the towels were the size of handtowels)\n\nThe change room is huge, and clean. Infact the whole place is absolutely spotless with gleaming hardwood floors.\n\nThe games room is also huge. I mean HUGE. There's a pool table, numerous leather couches, several flat screen tv's, and a cafeteria that is licensed. That's right - licensed.\n\nThe main room is also huge and you can call this the \"warm up room\". There are bamboo mats to lie on (with wooden blocks to rest your head)  and people just relax here.\n\nYou simply just relax in this room, which is surrounded by 8 saunas\nI brought a magazine, my Iphone and a pair of ear phones. The other people in this room with me, included a Korean family of 4. i.e mom, dad and their two kids (10 and 12?).\nThere's 8 different doors that lead you into the saunas. Some are warmer than others but whats important is the rocks on the wall. Each room have different rocks that have different health benefits. I went to each and every sauna.\n\nOne sauna had these lovely colored rocks on the wall.\nWhat I found interesting in these saunas was the fact that there were no benches in them. You simply lay on your bamboo mat.\n\nIn between visiting each sauna room, I hung out in the cold room.\n\nI also enjoyed the opportunity to go back into the games room to enjoy a Sapporo ($9) and a maki roll. ($4.50)\nMy visit to the Korean Family spa cost me $20 (food and alcohol separate) and I swear I was there for close to three hours. Pretty good value, in my humble opinion.\nDefinitely worth visiting if you like saunas!! I know I will be returning. I have no doubt in my mind.\nThings I learned:\n-bring a 1.5 litre of water with you. I promise you, you will drink the whole thing (you can refill it there).\n-bring shower shoes for the shower\n-bring a book, magazine, earphones, music and earphones\n-bring a towel incase you want something larger than the towel they give you, which is the size of a kitchen towel. It makes GoodLife's towels look like bathsheets.\nKorean Family Spa - 382 Magenetic Drive (416) 514-1965 Open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week!
