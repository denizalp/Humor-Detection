I live within walking distance of Main Street Cupcakes and have been there about a half a dozen times since it opened up.\n\nOver the years I've found the best approach with Main Street Cupcakes is to lower one's expectations before entering the blue building. \n \nWant a larger than normal sized cupcake found in cupcake shops in NYC; nope not here.  Want elaborate top\/frosting adornment worthy of a bakery whose sole mission is cupcakes; nope not here.  Want a cupcake produced with perfectly moist cake; nope not there.  Want anything remotely close to the cupcake shows that can be viewed on the Food Network; nope not here.  \n\nThat pretty much sums up MSC.  If you change your expectations to want none of the items above, you may actually have a decent experience going to Main Street Cupcakes.\n\nI even gave MSC another shot for Valentine's Day 2012 and purchased their special four pack.  My wife and I sampled each of the cakes and came the same conclusion again; small, dry, and unexciting frosting\/adornment.  The red velvet was especially poor, with terrible taste, super dry, and nearly unedible.\n\nSo why have I continued to return to MSC?  Well it's close (we are in walking distance), there is a lack of competition, and it is a nice stopping point when on a walk to the Hudson farmer's market and around First & Main.  Returning each time to MSC, I think my wife and I secretly hope that the cupcakes will become dramatically better, but over the years they never have.  \n\nHow does this place survive, I don't know; novelty I guess.\n\nIn summary, two stars.  When I'm with the family walking around Hudson, I don't mind stopping in and picking up a couple of cakes for the fun of it, but I also have lowered my expectations to tolerate MSC.  However, there is no way I would ever use Main Street Cupcakes for any sort of event as I would never place guest experiences on the line with cupcakes that are only tolerable.
