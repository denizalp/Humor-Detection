This is, by far, the best Italian restaurant in Henderson.  The food is superb, cozy atmosphere, and very friendly staff!  Chef Rudy is so nice and came out to greet us!  Try the mushrooms and dates in adobo sauce appetizer...fabulous!  This is a restaurant you should definitely put on your list to try out soon...you will not be disappointed.
