The service at the bar was very good. Reasonably priced draft beer and good selection. I had the spare ribs with Cole slaw and home fries. The Cole slaw was store bought. Nothing special. The homefries were good but undercooked. The ribs were cooked perfectly. Browned and tender. The ribs were well sauced but the sauce was bland to me. I would give 4 stars if I had liked the sauce more
