This place is open later than a lot of the other theatres, came here after a night of clubs once.  Convenient location on the south strip. Walking distance from Tropicana, MGM, NYNY, Gamework, Monte Carlo, etc.  Always have the newest movies and some of the new but older movies. Nice displays that show offs their movies. Amazing view of the strip from the parking garage. I read a review about lack of seats, so far all the movies I've watched here are were it large rooms with a lot of seats, you might have been watching an older movie so got the smaller rooms.  Prices for snacks are reasonable for being a theatre on the strip. Good place to wait out the Vegas sun without gambling. I've seen celebrities here twice.  I like there's usually multiple showing of movies and don't have to wait long for the next one if I miss it. There's a game that is addicting that you can win tickets in the lobby area.  Lobby area is pleasant. One of the largest snack areas I've seen.
