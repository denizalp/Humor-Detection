This place is horrible. Wish I had read the reviews before going there. I called my order in and was quoted 20minutes. I ran some errands and had some ice in my car which I thought would be fine given the time frame. I got there to pick up my order 30 minutes after I called it in. I was never greeted by anyone, so I stood at the counter. After standing there a few minutes a man from the back with a thick accent yelled for me to \"have a seat\", so I did and about 10 minutes later he came and told me my order was done. I asked for peppers for the pizza and he seemed annoyed, didn't say a word grabbed some and threw them on top. I tried paying using my debit card, and he told me \" I wish you had cash\", at this point I was done I got my card and walked out. I can't speak for the food here but the service is AWFUL. I will never go back. I'll take my business to Tail gaters.
