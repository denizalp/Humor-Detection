I went to Fugo on a cold windy winter day so other than me and my fianc√© there were no other customers there. The staff are really talkative and nice. I wanted to try their soft serve but they said they won't run the machine in winter; they usually serve it starting April. But they had the same flavours as regular scooped ice cream. We got the earl grey and thai iced tea. I LOVED the thai tea flavour. It was so refreshing and not too sweet yet creamy and rich. The earl grey was also really great, less sweet than the thai tea one, but not as much creamy.\nWill definitely be back in summer to get the same flavours as soft serve!\n\n\nUPDATE: Got their soft serve this past Summer. It was not the regular Thai Tea or Earl Grey flavour. They had one with fruit and one vanilla. Do NOT recommend the soft serve. Over-priced and quality is not good. The mango one is clearly made with artificial flavours. I do still recommend the regular scooped ones (in the tea flavours mentioned above), hence keeping my 4\/5 star rating.
