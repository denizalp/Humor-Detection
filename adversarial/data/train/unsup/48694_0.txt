This was my first time getting a Jersey Mike's sandwich. I'm normally more a Capriotti's girl, or Subway on my way home. I decided to try Jersey Mike's a few nights ago since I was already in the area.\n\nThe main draw of Jersey Mike's is in their fresh sliced meats. As in, they don't slice it until you order it. The meats were flavorful, and had none of that slimy quality that Subway can get. They have fewer topping options, mainly lettuce, onion, & tomato, which is why I only gave them 4 stars. If you want cheese, you need to ask for it.\n\nI went with the 13, with 6 types of meat, and put both the red wine vinegar and the oil on top. The sandwich was good, at about the same price of Capriottis. I will definitely come back, and work my way through the menu.
