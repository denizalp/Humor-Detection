Hot dogs, French fries, and tater tots. This is the menu at Happy Dog.  With each of these items, you can pick from a large list of toppings and sauces, ranging from mustard and sauerkraut to habanero sauce and chorizo chili.  There's no limit to how many toppings you can put onto your $5 hot dog, although some of the tastier add-ons for the fries and tater tots will cost you an extra dollar.\n\nFor people going to Happy Dog for the first time, I would recommend sticking to the kitchen recommended combinations. Not all of the toppings go together well, and you may not like your hot dog if you mix the wrong things together.  The toppings can make the bun extremely soggy, which makes it difficult to eat your hot dog without a fork.  Also, I'm not a huge fan of the sauces available for the fries and the tater tots.  In my opinion, the house ketchup is too bitter.  I feel that a lot of the other sauces are good hot dog toppings, but not great tater tot dipping sauces. \n\nThe atmosphere and unique mix of music, however, makes Happy Dog a good place to go for a beer and snack after work. Guests should be aware that this establishment has a $10 credit card minimum.
