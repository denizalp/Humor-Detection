You know what? I'm sort of sick of giving Grumpy's chances to \"get better.\" It's just not that good. Again, the pancakes were great. Despite my vow to myself to never have eggs there again, I tried the vegetarian Benedict -- poached eggs on an English muffin served with avocado and tomato. Should have been delicious, but had no taste! We ordered the hollandaise on the side, which really brought attention to the fact that the egg \"pile\" itself had zero seasoning. It was gross and I only took one bite. \n\nWe also ordered the apple-oatmeal pancakes, but were brought the buttermilk ones. The waitress was extremely apologetic about it, especially when we decided to just keep the buttermilk so we wouldn't have to wait any longer. She also deducted from the bill because the apple oatmeal are more expensive. \n\nIt also bugs me that I get charged for having fruit instead of home fries (which, as I've already mentioned, are not very good in my opinion). \n\nService is fine. Coffee is really good too. But I don't think I want to eat here again for awhile. They just don't seem to know how to season their savory food.
