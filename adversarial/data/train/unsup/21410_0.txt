So, full disclaimer: before eating here, I went on a ten day silent meditation retreat. They only fed me vegetarian food. About half way through, I developed a hankering for fried chicken... and when I finished the retreat, Yelp led me here, to Olive Chicken.\n\nAnd I'm so glad it did.\n\nThe Korean people are known for the quality of their fried chicken, and despite its modest appearance and very reasonable prices, Olive Chicken absolutely lives up to its country's reputation. Their chicken is AMAZING. I had the half and half -- regular crispy and hot&sweet. Both were so good that after five pieces, and despite being entirely full, I went back for two more. It is that good.\n\nThe only thing I'm sad about? It's that this place isn't closer to where I live. Because even with all the willpower built up from that silent meditation, I couldn't stop myself from coming back here on a regular basis.
