What happenned to the $3.99 Vegas breakfast?  I don't know, but definitely not to be found at the Victorian Room at Bill's.  We had been in Vegas for 3 days and hadn't had a casino breakfast yet, so on our last full day we thought Bill's on the Strip would be a good choice.  The food is good, but why was our bill $45 for 3 of us?  The selection was a little small, so among 3 of us we had to split, share, and build from the menu to get the breakfast that we wanted.  Anyways, that was probably the most expensive breakfast I've ever had at Vegas.  We should have gone to the buffet at Caesar's for the same price, but at least we would have had a lot more to choose from.
