I love this hotel. After spending years of LV stays at the Venetian, we decided to step out of the box and check out other hotels. This was my second stay at a new hotel and I was pleasantly surprised. The suite size was just right and the bath tub was the best I've had. Seriously. It was a struggle to get me out of that bath. Customer service was great, which isn't saying a whole lot since we didn't have any problems or issues during our stay. The only time we talked to anyone was during checkin\/checkout, so I'll have to test the service further before I give a definitive answer. I also love the quiet entry. No crazy lines to get to your room. We brought our young daughter along this time and it made us really appreciate the lobby...no heavy smoke or noisy machines to walk through just to get to your room. And the decor is spot on. Love love love. \n\nA couple of things... the only flatscreen tv was in the bathroom. I pretty much expect every tv to be a flatscreen in LV. And it really doesn't make any sense seeing as the rooms are beautifully decorated and very modern. So that one kind of left me scratching my head. Also, I've heard\/read a lot of comments about the reservation system. Apparently it's first come\/first serve, so you're not guaranteed a room, even if you've paid for it and have received a confirmation. Another thing that doesn't make any sense to me. These were the only qualms I had; I will definitely be staying here again.
