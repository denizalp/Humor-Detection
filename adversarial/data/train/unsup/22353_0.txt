I never have long waits like at other doctors, my last appt. was at 9:30, I checked in ar 8:50 and was being seen before 9.  Dr Sharma is very polite and he listens and takes your situation and opinion into consideration. He really is the best GP I've been to in Vegas and I highly recommend him. They also have pricing if you don't have insurance and that was cheaper than the additional fees my insurance wanted to charge because I hadn't met my deductible yet.
