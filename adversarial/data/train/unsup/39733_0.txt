Really, no reviews yet???\n\nThis DQ is a staple of Lakewood's heritage. It's always staffed by high school aged girls, and has the tiniest width drive thru in the world.\n\nBut it's standards are up to par as a chain. The staff is friendly and fast, the product consistent and good. If you're just not in the mood to spend $20 on ice cream at Malley's, then this is a great stop on a summer day.
