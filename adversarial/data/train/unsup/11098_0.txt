It was a-ok, even with the Groupon.  It's a sex museum close to the strip.\n\nNo one was parked in the parking lot that we thought it was closed.\n\nThey are open everyday so don't be worried.\n\nSo they have about 24000sqft with a lot of art work, videos, displays, facts, that has to do with sex.\n\nPoliticians that got in trouble because of sex, facts about penis sizes, porn videos playing here and there, peepshows, vintage porn, A LOT of art work, sex art work from different countries, a lot of toys.\n\nThe service was friendly and I have nothing bad to say, but I wouldn't recommend or visit again.
