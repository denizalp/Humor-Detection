My friend and I were obsessed with this show so obviously when I was just in Las Vegas, we had to make a trip out there. On a Sunday afternoon, the line was super short and we go to go in! \n\nremember that the cast are only in the store M-F, 9-3...something I didn't know. Oh well!\n\nThe location is a little off the strip by the Stratosphere, so it's not the glitziest part of the strip.\n\nI had an issue with the fact that I couldn't really buy anything in there. Not because I do not collect antique guns and coca cola dispensers, but because I drove from LA and wanted to pick something up portable.\n\nYou mean a Winnie the Pooh statue costs me $150? No thanks. Not much variety for the average customer but that doesn't detract from the fact that I love the show and enjoyed visiting.
