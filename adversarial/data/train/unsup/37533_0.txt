This was my favorite meal in Vegas!\n\nThe deviled eggs were high on my list, and they didn't disappoint.  I really like deviled eggs, and these were some of the best I've had.  The filling was yummy, and they were pretty to look at, too!\n\nWe're both vegetarian, so we shared the deviled eggs, and each had the mac and cheese as our entree.  The mac and cheese was also very good.  I'd rate the deviled eggs above it though.  If I ever go back, I think I'd try the biscuits and something else as my entree, but I'd definitely get those deviled eggs again.\n\nThe drink I had was just ok, the Southern Peach.  It was very small, and it was $15.  I'd skip a cocktail next time, and stop somewhere else for a $15 drink I'd enjoy more.\n\nHowever, I'd go back here without any hesitation at all!!!  And finding it was very easy.  We got a Lyft and entered at the main entrance to the Venetian, and I followed overhead signs that said Restaurant Row.  We basically walked right into it.  And we went at lunch time and were seated right away.
