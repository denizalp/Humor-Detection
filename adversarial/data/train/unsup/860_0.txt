Root canals are supposed to be painful and scary, right? Not at Charlotte Root Canal Center with Dr. Sunar and his caring staff. First, they fit me in the same day I saw my regular dentist, even thought they were busy. The lovely front office worker, Esperanza, went to the trouble of actually calling my insurance to verify the price of my treatment before I had anything done, because I had expressed that I was nervous about the price. She broke everything down to me as well as showing me the total. She also made sure that my insurance policy was followed so I would have coverage (for some reason my insurance requires that the exam not be the same day as the procedure).\n\nPreoperative x-rays and exam were easy and painless thanks to Dr. Sunar and his very capable assistant, Lydia. Then they booked me the next day so I wouldn't have to wait for treatment. When I arrived, they got me right back into a room, and then Dr. Sunar came to apply topical anaesthetic followed by injected local anaesthesia. He was very pleasant and we chatted while we waited for the anaesthesia to work. The root canal itself was totally painless; both Dr. Sunar and Lydia were efficient, professional, and meticulous. \n\nEven now, over twelve hours after the procedure, I have only slight discomfort in the jaw muscle due to the injected anaesthesia (this is common for me after dental work).\n\nI recommend Dr. Sunar and his entire staff at the Charlotte Root Canal Center. What a relief!
