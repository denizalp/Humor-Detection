One of the newer theatres so everything is pretty clean. However something just feels lacking and everything from the food to service is average at best. I came with my bf to watch a movie in the VIP and I find the seats were not as comfy as the ones downtown. The food was also a 2 Star - we got the dinner and movie for $69 deal but it was really meh, don't recommend. My pizza tasted like frozen microwaved pizza and everything was just lacklustre.
