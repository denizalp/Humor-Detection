A good solid three. \n\nI have done other painting and drinking socials recently and this one in comparison for me was good. It was solid. I am not sure what words to use because of the hosts might tell me my words are not acceptable for compliments.\n\nWhat I enjoyed was the area that was well lit & set up funky! It had some pizazz to it. The music was great. It was a nice selection of everything in lots of different genres to appeal to the masses. Watching people dance was awesome. \n\nHowever, they could have been better a little better in their instruction. There was a dab & pull method they were telling us to use, but didn't explain what this was until 15 or 20 minutes later or so. And there were other times where they could have told us how to blend better. I mean I did want to leave with a good painting.\n\nI hate to leave a 3 star review especially because I had so much fun at the UYE I attended, but there are other venues in town that I would prefer to go to first. As much as I want to forget some of the things one of the host said, I can't. I was slightly offended and confused and it left a bad taste in my mouth. \n\nThe bartender that they loved so much, also lacked a little in the customer service department. I felt like we were a bother to him sometimes. And that should never be the case.
