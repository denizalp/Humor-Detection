So disappointed!!! Very bad costumer service. Came in with my family to try this place because I heard it was good so I figured let's give this a try. Walked in had two people waiting in front of us no biggie just waited and waited about 20 minutes later I got fed up and went up to the to go counter and asked is anyone going to seat us we all have been waiting for 20 minutes and no one even came up to us just ignored us. So then the gentleman said he would get someone right away but right away ended up being 15 minutes later the family in front of us walked out very upset and I felt horrible for them cause as soon as they left then someone came to seat us. Now I'm irritated and unhappy for the wait they then sat us next to this huge table with 10 loud costumers so rude! and the music they had was so loud I couldn't even enjoy my food.  The only thing I enjoyed was my coffee which by the way had been sitting on the counter for 20 minutes while we received our food before our coffee yikes!
