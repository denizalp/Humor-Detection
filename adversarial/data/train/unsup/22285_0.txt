Whahht. No review from me yet? Sorry GFG I failed you. \n\nKnee Nose and his family are the best. I am glad they decided to park at 19th ave and Greenway. \n\nThe kids are amazing lil business partners too. \n\nGet the lentel soup, 2 meat combo, w\/ 1\/2 salad 1\/2 rice. that is 2 meals for the price of one! \n\nGo once a week for at least 10 weeks and try everything. it is all sooo good!\n\nPS.
