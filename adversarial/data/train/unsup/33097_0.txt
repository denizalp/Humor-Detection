I'd base it 5 stars based on the food but the service was out of control terrible. We travel from the east valley to come here so Im not sure if this is normal for them. I hope they were training new people or something and this is not normal. The entire restaurant had empty tables with no one eating while the line wrapped back by the bathrooms. The line was barely moving and I saw several people leaving. I was shocked at how ineffecient the workers were at taking our order and making the food once we finally got to the counter. The one black girl in the back was basically doing everything and working her tail off while the two young girls in the line just looked around confused. You just can't have a line wrapping around the restaurant like that and no one who has food. See pics.
