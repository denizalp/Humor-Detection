Nice restaurant\/bar. They are right next door to a hotel as well. I went for brunch but they also had their full menu available. Nicely set up with booths, tables, and seats at the bar. I wouldn't say it was formal but it had an upscale feel abs vibe to it but casual at the sametime. \nI think there was a mm outdoor seating area as well. There was some booths on a little bit of a rider which was cool.\nThe food and service were good. \nI had the breakfast and it was filling and good. Cage free eggs which is good.
