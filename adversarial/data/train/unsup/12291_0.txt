King Streetcar, what a f-ing joke. Seriously.\n\nThis one ranks right up there with the Bathurst streetcar. As in shitty and inconsistant. \n\nI've only been using this line for a week and I'm already DONE with it and figuring out an alternate route. \n\nIt's just not right when no streetcar comes for 15+ minutes but then 3 in a row come. And I just love waiting in -25 freezing-my-ass-off weather on a damn street corner hoping this thing will show up, meanwhile I could have walked most of the way home in the time spent waiting.\n\nOh, and those streetcars that go by saying \"NOT IN SERVICE\"? That's just cruel. WTF are you driving around for if you are not in service? Such a tease.
