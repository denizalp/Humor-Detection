I thought I'd check out the new Evoque. I'm 6'5\" and not a lot of cars are comfortable. I like it's looks and figured I'd see if it was comfortable.  My partner and I went into the show room. No one acknowledged us.  I saw one unlocked, adjusted the seat and got in. It seemed ok. I was curious how it was with the sun roof closed. So far, no one had said hello or anything to us. I was curious how the seats folded down and how much rear room it had. I fumbled with the seat a bit. Still no one acknowledged us. I walked around the car a few times, read the sticker, looked at the video display. I walked around a few more times, looked around the room. We decided to just forget it. Business must be good. I've never stepped into a dealer and not had at least one person offer to help me. I'll take my tax return $ and my 805 credit score somewhere else, maybe the Mercedes dealer.
