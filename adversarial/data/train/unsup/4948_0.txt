I hate hate hate hate hate this airport, because I hate US Air.  The airport's atrium nearly saves it, but then it all falls apart on the way in and out.\n\nPros:\n+  This place is big, plenty of services from a modern wine bar to coffeeshops and retail locations.  Even a sushi bar and piano player.\n+  The layout is pretty simple, and they try to keep it pleasant, they even have rocking chairs.\n+ Clean and spacious\n+ Free WiFi that's actually pretty decent.\n\nCons:\n- US Air hub... I get delayed every single time... occasionally I get cancelled.\n- All of the nice things I just mentioned in the Pros go away the moment you walk into the wings.  Gotta love a dilapidated Sbarros or chicken chain. \n- This all goes to the h - e - double hockey sticks when you try to leave.  The bus and taxi area is a completely insane clusterexplative.  I can't even understand what is happening with this, or why I'm standing in the wrong spot every time I try to reach the parking lot or the hotel.  Signage would help.\n\nThe atrium makes me want to like CLT, but the everything outside of the main area only serves to remind me I'm working around US Air.  This airport could be better, but even the free wifi can't help.  Maybe if they can refurbish the wings, it can get to 3 stars.
