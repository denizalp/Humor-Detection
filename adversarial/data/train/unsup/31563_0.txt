I have been too many Dickys around the country they have a pretty decent barbecue for a chain restaurant, except this one. They over cook things all the time, so they are dry and tasteless and try to cover it up with BBQ sauce, well guys that does not work on anyone with taste buds. This is one of the worst run restaurants I have ever come across. The owner is obnoxious, rude and makes you feel like you are doing him a favor by coming in and spending money at his restaurant. You would think the Owner after reading all of these HORRIBLE reviews would try to do something about it but obviously he is a LAZY business owner and will put himself out of business soon enough. Yes you owner you have a 2 STAR rating out of 5, that is 40% that is an F in any book. This location is dirty and always has lots flies in it. Even worse four of us went there for dinner we all got sick. The following day I called and spoke to the owner or manager and basically they said too bad so I called their corporate office and they said someone from that store or area supervisor would be contacting me and making things right. I have called back 3 times since my initial call, well that was 2\/15\/13 and now it is 5\/11\/13 and still no contact back. If the Corporate office at Dickeys cant see this store is killing their \"Brand\" they deserve to go out of business. Wish I could give -1 stars.
