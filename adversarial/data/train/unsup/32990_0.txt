See my first review for more details, but I finally tried the brew I brought home (since it's supposed to sit for a least a week) and it comfortably bring this place up to a '5'.\n\nI tried the dunkel again - this time at home - and enjoyed it even more than the first tasting on location. It's likely because I had it refrigerated this time. It's all a matter of taste, and I know some aficionados prefer just cool (or even room temperature); however for me, I just loved it. I offered some to a friend who couldn't believe it was a u-brew. A wonderfully rich, full tasting beer with maple added.\n\nCompletely sold on being a regular at this point and can't wait to try their other offerings. \n\nAlso, if you don't read my original review, just take away that you're getting excellent beer (by any standard) at very low cost.
