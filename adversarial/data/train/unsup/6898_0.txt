Right.\n\nSal: Ah, va fanicoula (stick it up yer ass)\n\nMe: Mangia merde e morte  (eat shit n die)\n\nThis place is one of the last bastions of Italian manhood I know.\nI love Sal.\nI hope he lives to a hundred.\nHe really screwed me over today with these bangs.\n\nWant a great haircut?\nCome here and see Rosario, Guiseppe or Sal.\n\nDon't engage them in Italian unless you want to look like Moe from the three stooges.
