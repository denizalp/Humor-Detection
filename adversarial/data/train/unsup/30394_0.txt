4.5 stars\n\nBeautiful decor - love the modern take on traditional Chinese decor, especially the giant neon lucky character. Staff were very accommodating and there was even a coat check! We came in for Winterlicious and we found the food to be very good overall. The Luckee soba salad that I had for my appetizer was surprisingly filling! It was also my first time eating salad with edible flowers in it. Surprisingly, the fragrant flavour of the flowers actually compliment the more \"ordinary\" ingredients of the salad such as the soy sauce, soba noodles and parsley. As for the Peking duck, the pancakes were cooked perfectly as was the duck. Wish the portions for the main was bigger! The dessert trio was also really good - my favourite was the chocolate covered jin dui! Given the intimate vibes of the restaurant, the good service and the awesome food, I highly recommend Luckee for anyone who is craving for some Chinese fusion!
