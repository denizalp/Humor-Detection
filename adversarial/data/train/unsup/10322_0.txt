I was eagerly awaiting the opening of this bar since it's owned by a couple of local guys and I love supporting local businesses. (Especially local businesses where I can get drizzunk.) I was intrigued by the name and came to find out from the bar tender working that during the prohibition era a \"blind pig\" was another term for a speakeasy. While I can't say that I get excited when I see another storefront turn into a bar in the Southside, at least it's locally owned.\n\nThe interior, while small, will seat a few tables at the bar and a few more in the back dining area. We've even taken a group of 6-8 people a few times and they managed to accommodate us. The front of the business is one big window which is nice, natural light and the ability to watch all those silly girls in big girls shoes stumble by. The walls are white with black script hand lettering. I have to admit, I don't know what it all says though.\n\nAnother fun fact, the ladies bathroom has a black sink and toilet. Every time I go in there I feel like I should be doing coke in a power suit with huge shoulder pads and teased out hair while talking about my stocks.\n\nThey have great specials every single day of the week for drinks. Not to mention a single pizza slice special after 9pm every day.\n\nSpeaking of pizza, HOLY BRICK OVEN PIZZA, BATMAN. It's the only food I've ordered from here but I have tried all but one of the varieties they offer. It's amazing. The descriptions on the menu are hilarious and every single pizza is great. I'll just leave it at the phrase, \"meat sweats.\" (Their words not mine, I'm not that funny.)\n\nSadly the place is usually pretty empty. Bad for the bar but great for me. They have two big flat screens right over the bar. Those who like the sports should be able to get their afternoon\/evening dose of athleticism. If you are looking for somewhere new to go have dinner and drinks on the Southside, this is a great place to stop.
