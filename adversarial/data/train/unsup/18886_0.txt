********I Found Another JJ Location ....... That Sucks*******\n\nThis one.......and the one located on Cactus......must be the same Franchisee.\n\nCarried out two sandwiches.......both were disgusting.\n\n (-) Want extra vinaigrette on the side ........ they don't have the small plastic cups.\n (-) a newborn Rabbit would STARVE on the amount of lettuce on the sandwiches.\n\nSubway on its worst day ........ beats this \"Crap Franchisee\".
