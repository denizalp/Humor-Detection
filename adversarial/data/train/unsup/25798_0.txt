I love this brewery! It's never super packed, the staff is as friendly as they come and the beers are excellent. Each beer is inspired by important female figures presently and in history. Awesome theme! Inside is always really clean, bright and inviting. Outdoor patio is a bit small but I've never seen it fully packed. They have a corn hole board, jenga and other games to play. Dogs are strictly allowed outside but they usually keep the garage door from the inside to the patio open, so it doesn't feel like you're shunned with your pup. Great place to watch some games, snack on a hot dog and relax!
