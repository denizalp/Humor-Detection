I can't believe I stood in line for 45 minutes for this place.  There was fireeeee everywhere haha.  This is a great lunch place if you're in Vegas and not having craziness 24\/7 on your agenda.\n\nB- : Hell's Kitchen burger - honestly, the ingredients were good but I didn't think it was ALL that.  The meat was fresh and juicy, perfectly cooked.  By the way, the burger just comes as is, no sides so you'll have to order the fries separately.\n\nA+ : Chanterelle Burger - my sister, Julie got this one, she's been on a crave for mushrooms these days.  Well I had a bite of it and this one was a winner.  The sweet onion jam made the burger, was a palate teaser! \n\nA: Truffle Parmesan Fries - carbs! YUM! I love the dipping mayo that came with it\n\nOverall, I was happy and would like to come back and try other burgers if I have the opportunity :)
