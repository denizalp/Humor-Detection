Oh B-Dubs. Came here to watch the game and chat it up with my homeboys. They ordered some nachos and a couple of beers. I didn't eat so I can't really judge the food, but they seemed to have dug the nachos with chicken. Although my personal preference is to have some extra chips to scoop up straggler toppings, they were fine with the chip to topping ratio. It was a pretty standard B-Dubs experience. The only thing that could have been better was the way the check was handled. Homeboy put the gentlemen's nachos on my bill, even though they and only they consumed them (I didn't even order them...so that was confusing). I mean whatevs. We figured it out. Then once we were ready with our cards, we waited a good ten minutes for him to reappear, which he never did. We went inside to try to pay but this seemed too much for ye old B-Dubs to handle. Other than that, an average place for average food and average experiences.
