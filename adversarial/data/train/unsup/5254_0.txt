Hey, I was impressed with \"This\" McDonalds!! My younger kids like to go here to play! I am NOT a fan of most McDonald franchizes as they have young people working there that are Rude & Lazy and they are NOT clean!\n\nBUT, This place was Clean! The lady that greeted us when we walked in was very sweet!\nThey were out of TP in the bathroom and just put the roll on top of the Handycapped Bar :-(      NOT a fan of that! Then when my daughter went to the bathroom it kept falling on the floor and rolling around the floor, YUCK!!!  NASTY!\n\nOther than that I would say they did good! But please teach your employees to put the toilet paper \"IN\" the proper container so we don't get everybody elses germies!!
