First time here. Very impressive. Authentic decor and music. Not a fan of spicy food, but I was able to find something that was not spicy. Antonio  was our waiter. Very professional and knowledgeable. Would definitely ask for him on my next visit. Mid priced. Paid $16 for my entree. With 2 Coronas and tax was just under $28.  If you love Mexican food. Check this place out!
