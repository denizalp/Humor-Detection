This review is based on my first visit, but I certainly feel I need to try it again under other circumstances. \n\nBy the time my lunch hour arrives, I am usually famished.  The name of this place caught my attention and decided to try it out.\n\nI was impressed with the large outdoor patio leading into the entrance. The interior is clean, colorful,and offers comfortable seating.\n\nOrdering process can be easy, once you finally figure out what you want. I know the goal is to simplify the menu, and ordering process, but  because there are too many options the opposite occurred. \n\nSalads rule here, toppings are in abundance, and the 14 freshly made dressings are as unique as they come.\n\nSince I was expecting to see hearty and healthy soups, sandwiches and other entrees listed on the menu, I wasn't prepared for the brunt of the menu options to be salads and broths. The salad I ordered was freshly prepared and tasted great,  but did little to satisfy my hunger for the price paid.  I was thankful they included a complimentary piece of bread with my salad.\n\nCorelife Eatery caught my attention, but I need to review and study the menu a little better to make sure I return from my lunch hour feeling like I ate lunch!
