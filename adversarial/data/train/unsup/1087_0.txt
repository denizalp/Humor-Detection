Why don't I hear people talking about herringbone more often?! \n\nDear all employees that assisted us last Sunday for brunch, you all rendered our experience as a 5 Star across the board! DANTE, the chef in the omelette station, your energy, your vibes, and the integrity behind your cooking is to die for! Your service with a genuine smile made our day! KRISTIN, our server, thank you for all of the great recommendations and always staying ahead of us! ALL THE BUSSERS, wow you guys rocked! Never one napkin left unfolded and never let dirty dishes sit on the table! Lastly, DOUG, thank you for chit chatting it up with us for minutes on end! We had to have talked your ear off for 30 straight minutes and never once did you make us feel like a bother! Thank you everyone! \n\nI love establishments where you can feel that he employees are happy to be there! Herringbone is that place! The service was so great and genuine, I wrote a novel before I can even begin to talk about the food! \n\nThe buffet style brunch is amazing! The seafood in this buffet is so fresh and so full of quality it's disgustingly good! When I think of buffet seafood, I think of low quality fish and shrimp and shellfish etc! Not here! The shrimp might as well be on steroids they're so large! And the lobster tail was phenomenal! I can brag forever, but if you couldn't already tell by my lengthy review, it's a must try! \n\nDon't hesitate, don't think! Just experience it for yourself!
