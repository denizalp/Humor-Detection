This place is pretty cool for how expensive it is.  It's really well decorated and has a pretty comfortable atmosphere.  It's small, but it makes the best use of it's space.  You'll enter the bar area first, which has a decent amount of space, but not a lot of seating.  The bartenders are pretty sharp, and there are some pretty cool beers on tap as well as a cool drink list.  The food is awesome, but there will always be a disconnect in my head when I pay a ton of money for something and I sit wringing my hands in anticipation, a gleam in my eye, fantasizing about the ginormous feast I'm about to have, only to be presented with a dish that will make you stare at your waitress with the sadness of an orphan on Christmas.  It is delicious, but you will want more.
