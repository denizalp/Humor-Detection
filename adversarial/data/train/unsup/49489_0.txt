Very happy with their services and price! Troy came and give us an estimate to remove or front lawn palm tree, gave us a great price and completed the work in a timely manner. Thank you!\n\n9\/25\/18 Update \nUnfortunately, I have to lower my stars to 3.  Once the company who's is doing my front lawn renovation started working on my project notifies me that my palm tree was not left to ground level as I paid for.  I thought it was dead grass but instead was the palm trunk above ground instead of leveled.  Unfortunately they had to do this for me in order to continue with the renovation,. I was charged to do this by Troy Service.
