Knowing my love of pizza and my search for an AZ favorite, a co-worker highly recommended that I try Ray's.  Wanting to to see if the pizza was really as good as he claimed, I braved the never-ending strip mall\/parking rodeo that houses this location and oh, I am so glad I did!  Walking up to the door, I nearly swooned over the beautiful aroma of baking crust, garlic and red sauce.  For me, it holds the same allure that \"new car smell\" holds for guys.  \n\nInside is even better!  It is kind of a controlled chaos near the entry - lots going on but somehow it all works.  The guys behind the counter were taking orders, handing out food and working 5 ovens that I could see at the same time - very impressive!  Initially I was just going to try a slice, but decided I needed a whole pie all to myself!  It was ready quickly, and I am very proud of myself that I did not immediately rip the box open in the parking lot.  I managed to wait until I got home to savor the flavor!  Of course I went with the pepperoni and mushroom new place test combo and I was very happy.  Even reheated for lunch the next day, very tasty.  Yay!
