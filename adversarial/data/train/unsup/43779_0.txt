I have an older Buick Riviera. They were able to quickly diagnose the problem with the speedometer and cruise control, offer a quote within minutes.. and when they finished the work, the cost was right in line with what they quoted.  They had to remove and replace the dashboard which was done with the utmost care. Everything is working fine...
