This place is A-OK in my book!  We called in our order to pick up. The lady was so friendly and helpful.  She asked me if I had any coupons...  rare that I didn't have one.  I asked her where I could get one and she told us Smith's had coupons on the back of their receipts.  Before my husband went to pick it up, I found an old receipt!  Score!  $5 off of 20.  Nice!  There is also 25% off if you check in with Yelp. I found this afterwards... I can always use it next time. When he picked up our dinner, great service from her in person!   We love that!\n\nI tried the Chicken Bomb Sandwich.  It had everything on a sandwich that I love... mushrooms, peppers, onions and chicken! Yum! I also got a side of their Clam Chowder.  (Also a fav of  mine!) The sandwich was stuffed with all of the ingredients. The mixture was very tasty.   The roll, however, was very soggy.  Maybe it would've been different if we ate there. I would have added a star if it was toasted. Just this yelpers opinion.  The Clam Chowder was delicious!  It had a great creamy flavor that actually could have filled my stomach on it's own.  \n\nMy husband ordered Boston's Own Roast Beef 2 way (sauce and cheese).  He added the french fries for a complete meal.  He enjoyed the sandwich. 'A good sandwich, not a great sandwich'... his words.  The fries were ok.  Good but nothing special about them. \n\nOverall we will try different items on the menu next time. It was mentioned by Shirley to try the haddock.  That will be my next order.  Since they are so close to our home, it makes it an easy dinner fix!
