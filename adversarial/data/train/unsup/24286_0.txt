This place was horrible! Not only was the place crowded, but it was super hot inside! They just had the fans blowing slowly. I swear it felt better in the 100 degree weather outside!\n\nFirst off, the Macaroons were mini. Which was okay for me until she told me it was $15 for a box of 10 mini Macaroons. What a rip off! They wern't even that great either. I ended up buying three boxes because it was for other people and I didn't feel like going to other places an hour before I left Las Vegas.\n\nThen I ordered a Nutella Iced Coffee. It didn't even taste like Nutella! It tasted like an Iced Coffee but it was even strong or sweet. So yea, not good at all!\n\nI thought this place was overpriced for nasty coffee and mini Macaroons.
