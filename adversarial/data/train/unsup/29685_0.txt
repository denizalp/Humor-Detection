Lovvvvved this spot. We got wild at the EBC. The water sofa was soooooo cool, I would def recommend it to all my friends trying to turn up in the club. \n\nMusic was tight, hopefully next time I go the DJ will drop my mixtape haha JK. \n\nGreat time tho, beautiful people, beautiful venue, beautiful weather. Can't ask for more.
