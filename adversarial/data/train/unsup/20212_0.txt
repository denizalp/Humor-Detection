We went here for my birthday brunch. I wasn't too thrilled they ran out of anything with Nutella. I didn't have a plan B so I had to dig deep and figure out what I want to eat. They had 2 frittatas of the day: bacon or goat cheese and zucchini. I got a Bacon Frittata (with sun-dried tomatoes and spinach) which came with a salad and 2 slices of fresh, warm, crisp and very yummy bread baked in-house. I love frittata and I love bacon so this was a hit.  My friend got a Tartine - an open-faced sandwich with eggs, potatoes, Canadian bacon, hollandaise sauce and asparagus. Very tasty and filling.\n\nThey also have palmier, macarons and all sorts of cookies and pastries. The service was wonderful. Plenty of space even though they were busy. The S-curve table in the middle has electrical outlets to plug on your portable devices which is a big plus in my book!\n\nMy friend got me a Nutella pastry and a guava pastry here before which were both good and flaky. Yum! I have to come here early next time.
