Another Vegas trip merits another trip to Bouchon.  We decided to stop by for breakfast this time.  We were pretty much seated immediately and had stopped by briefly the evening before to look at the menu so we pretty much knew what we wanted.  I got the omelette du jour which had cheese, spinach and tomatoes and the wife had the Le Jardin.\n\nOverall the food was good but the service was a little off, especially after the amazing experience with Daniel our last visit.  We actually tried to say a quick hello to Daniel the night before but the restaurant was packed and he was busy so, oh well.\n\nBut Bouchon can always be counted on for a good meal breakfast, lunch or dinner.
