I have a DSW problem...In the last 6 weeks I've bought 6 pairs of shoes, all from DSW. I'm one trip away from a shoeaholics anonymous meeting.\n\nThe Chandler DSW is big...Great selection, and the prices are great. Specifically, the clearance section is awe inspiring. A lot of the shoes I've bought have been off the clearance rack, with deep discounts (40-60%). The staff is friendly and helpful, and they're willing to go the extra mile if need be. I really loved a certain color scheme in some Nike runners that they didn't have, so they called around to all their other stores, found one, had it put on hold and it was waiting for me when I got there. That's service that's not typically associated with a store featuring the word \"Warehouse\" in their name.\n\nThey carry popular brands (Nike, Puma, Cole Haan, Creative Recreation, Penguin), as well as some random brands that you won't find everywhere. I got a great pair of grey suede slip ons from a label I've never heard of, but they're awesome and comfortable. It's all you can ask for.\n\nI recommend going, but you better just start writing a DSW line into your monthly budget. Go once and you'll be back.
