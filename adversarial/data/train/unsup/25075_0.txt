So, I was in Vegas again and decided to try it again.  The ceviche was still GOOD.  Not as good as the first time but it was good.  The waitress forgot to bring an appetizer and brought me something else that I didn't order... :\/ I still ate it... because I was too hungry to wait for what I originally ordered.  They had no bread at the start of my meal so I was very hungry... the wait was long.  Next time am in town I will give it another try... the food is still good just think the waitress\/waiter should be a bit more attentive.
