I'm not sure where to start. I am new to Nevada and wanted really good Mexican food which I have yet to find. I took to Yelp and found this heaven! The first table we got we weren't too satisfied and though we aren't picky I asked if we could possibly get a booth instead of a table and boy am I glad that I asked. We were seated in Amanda's section and she was just a blast in a glass! The food was great and the service was AMAZING!  We will definitely be back and will ALWAYS request to sit in Amanda's section! 5 stars, 2 thumbs up and a thank you very much.  Oh and we stopped by the bar while we waited to be seated and the bar tenders were great. I will recommend this restaurant and bring my friends and family who visit! Oh and the fried ice cream.... Omg and I don't even like sweets. Great great GREAT!
