Amazing atmosphere! They have a great patio in the fall it will be great. Just had a lovely Birthday dinner there. Chef Carter hits another one out of the part. I usually have the Ribeye, but opted for the pork chop. You need a to go box. They have redone the goat cheese cheesecake, birthday boy not a fan of goatcheese wants to go back just for that. And I would be remissed if I didn't mention the Brisket and Biscuit! \n\nI will be back for sure!
