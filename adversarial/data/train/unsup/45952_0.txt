Jill is the best!!! I used her for my second birth and my first time home birth. From the first meeting to birth to post-natal care, Jill was professional, knowledgeable and just a pleasure to work with. Every meeting made me comfortable for the baby's healthy and happy arrival. Highly recommended!!!
