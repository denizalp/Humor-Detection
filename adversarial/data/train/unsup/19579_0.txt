Been dying to try this place and it was absolutely worth the wait. For apps we did the empanadas and chorizo cheesy corn. The empanadas were fine, different from the puerto rican ones I have grown accustomed to. I wouldn't order them again unless I was in a large group. However, the cheesy corn is very original and unique and definitely not what I was expecting. It was like a cheese dip, with corn and chorizo in it. An absolute must have, every time I dine here. \n\nFor entrees we did the ropa vieja and the bisteak. The ropa vieja was delicious, its going to be so hard for me not to order this every time I return. I took the plantain, topped it with the garlic aioli, added the meat and some of the spicy house made sauce on top and went to town. In one word, incredible. The bisteak was not what I was expecting either. Instead of little steak medallions, we received a huge, tender, cooked medium, 12 oz steak. Seasoned or marinated to perfection and grilled just how I like. This was a great steak and if you go with this it will not disappoint. Great concept and even better food.
