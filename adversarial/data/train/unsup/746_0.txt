I lived in North Las Vegas from 2008-2012 and, during that time, visited Aliante Station on a pretty semi-regular basis. Sold by Station Casinos a few years ago, it is now simply known as Aliante Hotel and Casino.\n\nToday we had some business to tend to in the north when we decided to swing on by and revisit the place. I mainly came here to watch Game 7 of the Western Conference Finals between OKC and Golden State.\n\n(+) Casino is spacious and clean. They have a full size movie theater, a large Race and Sports Book, a food court with many options, and tons of food and entertainment choices. \n(+) Slot attendant and cocktail waitress I encountered were both friendly and very personable. Great customer service from both of these ladies.\n\n\n(-) Service at the Race and Sports bar was, for the most part, pretty terrible. I had a free drink ticket from the Sports Book and had to wait for-ev-er to get my drink. When I finally did get some attention, the short older bartender was gruff and curt. I even tipped the guy and still got attitude! Wth? Went back a second time at halftime and there was a younger gentleman who was much, much better! He was friendly and thanked me for the tip. Just how it should be.\n\n(+\/-) Older machines gave me great play while the newer one robbed me of my money. lol Just my observation from the day.\n(+\/-) Made a $20 parlay at the book which qualified for (1) one free drink ticket. Writer never told me what it would take to get two. Apparently it's not a tip on the front end lol\n\nI'm almost never on this side of town anymore, so I don't see myself making a ton of repeat visits here. It is a nice casino with plenty of options and I can see myself coming here gain when the opportunity arises.\n\n3 stars.\n\nA-Ok.
