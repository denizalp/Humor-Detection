Heart attack grill offers a simple menu of burgers ranging from the Single Bypass Burger through the wheelchair-to-car-included Triple Bypass Burger and the unlisted Quadruple Bypass Burger.  In theory you could get your leftovers to go (and you will have leftovers) but in practice the staff recommends against this.  The single bypass burger is more burger than you care to eat.  Price is by burger size and includes lard-fried fries and a beer or soda, as well as taxes figured up front..  The burgers are tasty, with lots of fixings (onion, lettuce, tomoto, special sauce, bacon, ...) but if you come here for the food you're missing the point.\n\nWaitstaff are dressed in slinky nurse's outfits, the gimmick of this prototype of what will prove to be a successful franchise business.
