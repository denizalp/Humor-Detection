Another review update for Firefly and another perfect 10, or 5 in our yelp world.  I know that most of my hardcore friends here on yelp have some mixed reviews which is totally understandable.  However, I through different situations at these guys\/gals and they always seem to pull through.  17.... Yes, 17 people at 8:00 for a birthday dinner! Guess what, we arrived at 7:55 and were seated at 8.  \n\nThe service was some of the best I've ever seen.  I've been to this location numerous times and they were packed and just flying around the restaurant taking care of their patrons.  The food was all fantastic and the drinks matched perfectly.  For the money, its one of my favorite places to go and to take others along with me.  I cannot wait for a yelp event to take place at one of their locations.
