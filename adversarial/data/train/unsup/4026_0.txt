I wasn't in this H&M for too long, but I did manage to take a quick glance around. This H&M is nothing out of the ordinary. It seems to carry a fair amount of clothes, and is the same in size compared to other H&M's that I've been to before. What I would have liked to see though more people working the cashiers. I had to wait quite a while to buy my one item. Also, while i was waiting I noticed that the cashiers were quite talkative with one another, rather than concentrating on the customer.
