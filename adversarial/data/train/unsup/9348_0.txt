For all the vegetarian people out there me and some of my friend went there. And among them two were vegetarian. And with the veg biryani they found chicken. And when we tell them the waiter didn't' even said sorry he did changed the plate with no sorry and attitude. And when we said that you should have said sorry he said he did. And also said \"I asked chef and he said there's no way it should have happened\" as if we did it. And then we put a review about It on yelp he commented that we did this to make fun with our vegetarian friend. Please maybe stupid people like you find this funny we don't. And please check your cctv before you accuse someone. Next time if you don't accuse someone with out hard proof you stupid fool. And FYI no one is paying us for this review. It's an honest review for good people who are going to treated bad in the future by you.
