I like this place. I think that a lot of people jumped on a bandwagon and decided to slam the new owners and I wholeheartedly disagree with most of what people are saying. Granted, it's not really a gelato...so fine, change the name, but to say that it's overpriced, chemically tasting or too sweet is absurd. The product is good and they're teamed up with other local confectioner's like Popped and Jean-Marie Auboune. Give it a try, decide for yourself. Haters gonna hate.
