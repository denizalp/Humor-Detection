I haven't been here since 2005, when it was dingy and ghetto. I took a trip back in time on Saturday, wow, pleasant surprise! It is definitely anti- Scottsdale, although the Valet price will make you think you are in Scottsdale lol ($7). I paid a $5 cover even though I'm female, but when I met up with my friends, I understood why. The remodel is beautiful. It's not \"fancy\", but it's nice. I support charging to get in, because it keeps a good cash flow to allow for enough quality staff, etc. \nI will never know for sure, but i am pretty certain I was drugged there at least once before back in the day. I did not have fear of that during this visit in the least. I didn't feel like I was hanging out with a bunch of riff- raff, just a bunch of people meeting up with their friends to dance, sing, and have a good time. I won't be frequenting nearly as often as I did when I was 21, because I can't keep up with that girl from the past, but I look forward to another visit soon. I had to laugh when I saw the same bartender from back in the day,  and just one thing- this is AZ- there are no shortage of girls with flat abs, so maybe don't have a beer tub girl who is wearing unfortunate fitting shorts.....
