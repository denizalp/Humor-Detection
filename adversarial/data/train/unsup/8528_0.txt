The old town, nightclub area of Scottsdale needed a sports bar\/restaurant and Majerle's fills the bill. Food is good, prices are reasonable, and flatscreens are everywhere so you can watch any game that's on. I'm sure it gets crowded at night, but for a lunch spot its not too bad.\n\nOh, and like almost everywhere in Scottsdale, the serving staff is very attractive, but don't be that creepy old guy who moves to a different seat at the bar to get a better view of the bartender bending over in her tight shorts (yeah, I heard you dude... and so did she)!
