Came here looking for a good pie. I was not disappointed. Started off with honey hot wings. their wings are damn good. Perfect crispness and the sauce was great. Really enjoyed it. Ordered half a Hawaiian and Delux pizza. Thin New York crust. Most delicious. Great pizza pie. The crust was crisp and not doughy. If your looking for a great pizza joint this is the best in the East Valley by far. \nThe service: greeted by Tony. What a great personable individual. Learns your name and checks in on you another 3-4 times to ensure you liked the food. \nlove this place. Great little find
