I was recently in a car accident that required me to obtain an injury lawyer. Being a Vegas local, I knew of Adam Kutner so his office was my first try. I called and spoke to his executive assistant or whatever  and said I could come in any time to get a consultation, etc. \n\nAnybody who's been in an accident knows how stressful it is to deal with all the legal bs that comes afterwards. That's pretty much a given. \n\nI walk into this office and I'm sorry, but it is super ghetto. It's like a dirty waiting room at a medical office in an old part of town. The receptionist is behind a glass window she has to open every time you need to talk to her. Not very law office-like. So I'm thinking, ok, -1 point.\n\nThe TV in the waiting room has daytime crap TV on it, and when I was there, it was SO LOUD that you could barely even think. I'm a young girl in my mid 20s. And it was LOUD. -1 point.\n\nThey give you this huge packet you have to fill out with all these specific questions about policy numbers, dates, times, this and that and all the while you have this obnoxious TV blaring right in front of your face. Maybe its just me but the whole environment was not conducive to stressed out clients who will potentially make you a lot of money. -1 point.\n\nFinally, I get taken back into their \"offices\" by a perfectly pleasant woman who I'm assuming was a legal assistant. She never actually said what her role was there. They basically have a back room of cubicles. There is absolutely no privacy. You can hear the person next to you and they can hear all about you. -1 point.\n\nSo by this point I've filled out my life story on this packet. The lady then proceeds to ask me all the questions I've already answered on the packet, and scribbles them down on a yellow notepad. I'm thinking, great, why the hell did they have me fill out this essay packet if they're not even going to read it. -1 point.\n\nWe're talking about the accident, and we get interrupted 3 times by another employee who can't find a stupid file in the back room. The woman helping me finally interrupts our conversation to go help him. Annoying. Not that she helped her co-worker, but that my legal consultation is being interrupted for a file. I'm sorry it's just not professional. You don't interrupt a legal consultation. The formalities of this place are just not up to par. -1 point.\n\nThe woman tells me they'll take my case and gets the agreement papers. 33 1\/3% they take, on top of $600 worth of \"office fees\", which I get because they have to spend money to work on my case. That's totally fine. Once the agreement paperwork was on the table I felt like I was in a high pressure sales situation getting a car or something. She made me so uncomfortable. -1 point.\n\nI tell her I need to think about it, I told everybody that I was here just to get a consultation and see what they were all about. She questions me as to why I won't sign with them today and like a true salesman, makes me tell her NO at least 3 times before she stops. -1 point.\n\nShe goes to \"talk to Mr. Kutner\" and comes back and says if I sign today they'll only take 25%. Only if I sign today. This may sound weird, but I didn't like that they were #1. presenting their services in this way, and #2. that they were willing to basically haggle with me. This is a law office, not a car dealership. I don't know, it was weird and made me feel super uncomfortable. -1 point.\n\nI again told the woman no, and her pleasant demeanor slowly faded. -1 point.\n\nI didn't even meet Adam.\n\nI leave, and get a call from the executive assistant. \"Hello?\"\n\"Hello my love, oh my gosh I had no idea you were even here, what happened?\" Like something big and catastrophic had just occurred.\n\nFIRST OF ALL.\nWe do not know each other. You're telling me in the 30 seconds of interaction we've had you already see me as \"YOUR LOVE\"??? Get the hell out of here with that. Honey, Sweetie, etc are barely tolerable in a professional environment. She said it at least 10 times. *vomit* -5 points.\n\nAnd you had no idea I was in the office? At the time I said I'd be there? That's great. Way to keep your eye on things. - 1 point.\n\n\"What happened, my love??\" AKA why didn't you sign up with us???\n\nI told her I just needed to think about it. She said she'd call the next day to follow up.\n\nI never heard from her again.\n\n\nI went with another law firm just around the corner from Kutner, a family run law office with amazing legal assistants, awesome attorneys who are all father and sons, with a beautiful reception area with leather chairs and stone tables, and a proper reception desk that does not require you to talk through glass. I met the boss, head attorney, and he talked to me and acknowledged my case before they even had my signature. + a million points.\n\n\nIf you're looking to be legitimately taken care of, and to feel like you're hiring an attorney with all around professional qualities, consider a firm other than Kutner.
