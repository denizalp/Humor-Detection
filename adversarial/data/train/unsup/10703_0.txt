I love this outlet because all the high-end stores have an outlet here! Also, they opened up a Lululemon outlet here recently and I was able to get 2 sports bras for $30 each!\n\nThe parking structures are great because they have lights on top to show you if the parking spot is available.\n\nWe came on a weekday during off-season and were very happy that the crowds were at a minimum! \n\nI highly recommend the North outlets because they are nicer than the other ones.
