The theater is pretty well kept, if a little old and dated. The location is great, the popcorn is top notch, and there is always a great selection of movies.\n\nBut that parking! It is a battle every time, no matter what time you show up. 1 in the afternoon, 10 in the evening, you are still driving around for 10 minutes at least, likely parking far enough away to work up a mighty sweat. And that's on a good day. If it is prime time Friday, make that 20 minutes, and you also likely yelled and cursed the heavens.\n\nIt is for this reason alone that my experience is consistently a 3-star experience, no higher. Despite everything else being good, that parking situation is just awful.
