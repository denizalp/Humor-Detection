Yawn...\n\nI am a huge music lover, but was hugely disappointed by this architecturally awkward, chaotically organized, overpriced, and user-unfriendly museum slash h.o.f.  I don't know what it was I wanted, but this place certainly didn't give it to me. Don't get me wrong, they have some fascinating mementos; I really enjoyed the Jackie Wilson, Beatles, and Michael Jackson exhibits, but there's nothing all-too compelling here. Everything is sort of one-note: coats, record covers, guitars, sheet music, guitars, etc. etc. Occasionally there's a piano or car or something. And as far as monuments to music are concerned, there isn't really that much...well...music. Ya know, like, rock and roll. It just felt very corporate. Thus, very overpriced. Did I mention overpriced? Even the snack shop sucks. \n\nOh yeah, and I got a fucking parking ticket outside. The Law is THICK in Ohio.\n\nSo I'm really, very surprised to see this many positive reviews. But hey, to each their own. Personally, I'd recommend spending the money at Cleveland's West Side Market instead. (Read that review on my page.) Or do the truly rock and roll thing, which is just walk through the museum without paying admission. Normally I don't advocate such reprehensible, unlawful behavior, but I wish now that I had at least tried. So you definitely should.\n\nAt least they have a free coat check.
