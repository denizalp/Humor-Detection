I came here after a suggestion from a few folks at Magnums. Curious to see the jazz element in town, I showed up and loved it.  \n\nIt was a bit strange coming in, I entered and there were a few older gents hanging around the curtain which seperates the entry from the lounge. I could hear the music playing and knew I wanted to see what was happening inside.  I didn't know where to go to pay and one of the old gents came to me and asked \"Are you here to see the show?\".  \nI barely understood him because he was speaking in hushed tones.  He directed me to a table to pay the cover, of which I did happily.\n\nI went in and there was a group playing on the stage.  They were very talented and I liked the vibe of the place.  It's the kind of place I'd take a date for an informal sophisticated evening.  BOYB if you want something to drink, but very high quality music.  \n\nIf it weren't for the mouthbreather next to me or the lack of a date, I probably would have stayed longer.  It was a good night and it's worth a check out if you enjoy calm deep music.
