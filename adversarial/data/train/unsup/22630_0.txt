Getting a bikini wax is never fun, but if you go to the right place it can be bearable. After passing by, and hearing a lot about Shari's in kensington, I decided to give it a go. My esthetician was named Sammy. I was pretty nervous, since I hadn't had one done in a few years, but Sammy put me at ease. She told me to relax, put my music on and even keep me chatting to keep my mind of things - such as the embarassing positions you need to get into (sans pants) to get a good wax! After 20 minutes, I was done, and I wasn't crying, or in immense pain. Not to be too gruesome, but after having some bad and painful waxes, I was pleased to see that there was barely any blood. \nShari's is a very small, and basic studio. The room itself is a bit crowded, and could use a hook for clothing, but aside from that, it was as good of an experience as it could be.\nPrices start at $30 up for basic bikini, $50 up for what they call an exotica, not quite brazilian, and $60 for the full brazilian. Prices are slightly cheaper than other downtown salons, which is nice.
