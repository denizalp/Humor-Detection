PRETTY DAMN GOOD \n\nThis one is inside the Caesar palace casino food court area & you just go right up & order then they give you a buzzer to pick up your food.... it was our FIRST TIME... guess it was written on our expression as the cashier guessed & said it's our first time... ahahhaa\n\nCHICKEN FINGERS - I'm gonna have to say these chicken fingers definitely reminded me of chicken fingers that i used to eat when i was a kid & it brought back so many good memories. The chicken was thin & tender while being well battered so that it is not just all batter. The ranch dressing was AMAZING for some reason... it could be because i haven't had any in a while... or theirs is just dericious.\n\nSWEET POTATO FRIES - we got it w\/ their truffle rosemary oil tossed into it & a little extra crispy & it was so so so DERICIOUS!! These fries were DEVOURED & being fought for!
