i have only been once but I am impressed. Saw Dr. Ibe based on Annie W's review and am so happy to have found a \"one stop shop\" doctor- know what I mean girls? \n\nMy whole experience started off a little rocky- they asked me to show up early to fill out paperwork and then the doors were locked due to a staff meeting so I had to sit in my car for 25 mins waiting for them to open at my actual appointment time.\n\nOnce inside though, things started looking up. The front desk staff was friendly and the process, even as a new patient, was quick and smooth. Wait time was minimal and before I knew it I was back in the room with a super friendly nurse  who took my vitals and whatnot. \n\nA few mins later Dr. Ibe came in and I was instantly at ease. I felt super comfortable with her and was asking questions and talking about all of my issues- never feeling rushed. Test results were returned in a timely manner and thoroughly explained. \n\nMy husband saw another doctor in the practice and had issues getting test results back. He had to call several times before he was able to track someone down who could get them for him and then it took another 4 days or so before he was able to get someone to confirm his prescription for him so he wasn't overly happy. He says that he wants to switch to Ibe and I am encouraging him to do so!
