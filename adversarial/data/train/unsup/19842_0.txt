I love this place!!! We stopped in for a snack and went up on the outside deck and stayed for hours! The house made margaritas were great! Served in mason jars with fresh lime slices and salty rims.\nWe started off with the queso fundido which was very tasty, great chips and spicy cheese. We then had the fries that were served liked nachos!!! Wow they were so good with fresh quac and salsa and fresh jalape√±os slices.\nSuch a cool vibe, good music great food cool atmosphere.\nNext time you're in Larry-vile, stop in!!
