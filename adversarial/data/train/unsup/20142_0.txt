I have flown allegiant at least 8 times over the last 3 years. My flights have always been on time and baggage has never been lost. Stewards have been great and besides some awful turbulence here and there I have been very happy flying allegiant.  \n\nHowever I am really upset at the lack of customer service reps when you have to call for any reason. If you are booking a flight you get through immediately. I had a typo in my last booking. It says 24-7 help and I realized my mistake at 11pm at night less than 6 hours before my flight. I had Spelled Jennifee instead of Jennifer. Not even a little bit exaggerating I waited on hold for 1 hour and 51 mins before i finally got an answer!!! It took then less than 45 seconds to fix the issue and i wasted almost 2 hours. Please hire more reps to answer phones!!!
