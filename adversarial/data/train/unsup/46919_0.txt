I can't say I've had the opportunity to experience a party - as just trying to book one has been more hassle than what it's worth.  Disappointed as I apparently am challenged in trying to communicate what I want and that actually translating.  I'm sure the parties are great - but after 4 phone calls on this to sort through - I give up.
