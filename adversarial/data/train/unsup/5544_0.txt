well, that was gross.\n\nThey seem to be unable to cook Thick Crust all the way through and your pizza will be a barely edible gooey mess.\n\nI ordered the pizza online and they called 3 times to tell me they were out of different toppings.\n\nWe called and complained about the uncooked pizza and they promptly sent out another uncooked pizza to us.\n\nIn the end, i still ate the pizza, but it was pretty gross.
