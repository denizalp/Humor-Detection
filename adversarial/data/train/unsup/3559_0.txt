Wow so many 5 star reviews, I was sure I would enjoy this show, but Nathan G's review hit it right on the head.  We could not even get past the first seconds of the roller skating duo bc the Gazillionaire and the horribly unfunny Penny did us in.  Just could not stand to be in there any longer.\n\nThe beginning is cool.  The chair stacking guy.  Looks like he's gonna start to tell a story by sitting there and taking a shot of absinthe.  But then nothing else makes sense.  It falls apart from there.\n\nOk the tent is cool.  The stage is small.  But the acts are not unique, in fact I've seen better at the free shows at Circus Circus.  For the price of the tickets (even though we purchased thru Tix4tonight) still not worth it.  Even if they were free I would still be upset that I wasted my time there.  \n\nYes I know they said, if you're offended by words like fuck and shit then the show it not for you.  I am not offended by words like that.  I am offended by old ass jokes.  Group of guys sitting together? Must be gay!  Old people over there? Must be Republicans!  Har har har.\n\nThis show is like a kid who just learned his first swear word and now can't stop saying it.\n\nThis is not like Family Guy humor.  To say that is a big insult to Seth macFarland.\n\nHowever, worth noting, it is no longer general admission.  They do have assigned seating now.
