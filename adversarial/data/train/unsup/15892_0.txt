*Thumbs up*\nIt seems like every time I pass by, they always have some sports athlete signing autographs and taking pictures. Of course, they will block off the area. They want you to purchase their merchandise and that will guarantee you the autograph and picture. People working there are pretty helpful and friendly.\n\n*Thumbs down*\nYes, the prices are on the high side but that is expected. But the prices are not set in stone -- you can try talking them down a bit, especially if you're buying more than one piece of merchandise.
