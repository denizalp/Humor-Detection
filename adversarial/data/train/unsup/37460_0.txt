I started out by calling Morris Jenkins about my damper motor being bad and that it was under warranty as my unit was less than 5 years old.  They told my they don't warranty parts.  So, I called one hour air.  \n\nWill Beard was my service tech.  He was at my home the same day on time and very respectful.  He took the time to Listen to me explain everything, went and verified that it was the damper motor gone bad.  He also verified the part was under warranty and that would I just was responsible for the labor costs.  He took the time to also explain their service plan as well without any \"high pressure\" tactics.  Thus, allowing me to make an informed decision.\n\nI had to leave for work so we had scheduled for the next day for him to come back and install the new part.  Will called about 45 minutes before arrival to make sure I would be home and again was right on time.  He replaced the defective part, tested it.  And explained the warranty on the new part.  \n\nOverall I am pleased with One hour heating & air.  And, Will Beard provided a positive experience, excellent workmanship, and great customer service.
