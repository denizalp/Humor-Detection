This was my first Japanese\/Peruvian fusion restaurant and I was pleasantly surprised! Our table got a variety of plates to share, the most memorable being the Chilean sea bass, salmon tiradito , and the creamy scallops (which weren't on the menu, but when we asked the server, she said they could make it for us!). All in all, the food is pretty tasty, but my only qualm is the price. Even for a Vegas establishment, it's a little on the higher side for what you get, so if you go, be prepared to spend around $80 per person to feel full!
