After shopping for awhile we got parched and very hungry. I really enjoy good coffee houses and macaroons too. We wandered into this establishment looking for some delicious food and that pick me up from something with caffeine but found a new place to drink coffee at.\n\nI ordered two mocha espressos and they make them for here so the fabulous cashier said go upstairs and she would bring them to me. When I ventured up the stairs I was blown away. They have these great couches and a tele that is just write for chilling out after a long day of shopping . \n\nWe recharged our batteries here and were able to hear the gondolas go by and sing Italian. The sound of the water under us is so relaxing as well is the Italian gondolas singing there sweet tunes. The view of the canals from here is breathtaking and it is so wonderful to watch the couples so in Love go by and celebrate their love for one another. If I had a glass of wine it would be more complete.
