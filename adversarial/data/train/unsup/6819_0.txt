We've seen 2 shows there in the last few months from different viewpoints and both have been great. For Wayne Brady we sat in the front row of the balcony. For Colin Mochrie and Brad Sherwood we actually got front row seats. I think the only downside here is marketing. It was luck that we happened upon these great shows. Then it was even better luck that we had grey seats to both. Great lineups and reasonable prices.
