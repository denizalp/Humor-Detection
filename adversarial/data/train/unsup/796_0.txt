Stars are for the service. Well done folks! Though, even the service wouldn't bring me back. The food, subpar for the EXTRAORDINARY (not in the good way) price. \n\nI had the shrimp. Husband had the crab stuffed lobster tail. The portions are good. At the very least, you won't leave hungry. I felt like if I had read that there was going to be cheese in the couscous, I would never have ordered it. I don't know whose bright idea it is\/was to put cheese with seafood, but it is by far one of the most disgusting combinations in my book. Having said that, I didn't eat the couscous. Understand that all that's left is the shrimp. Which were HUGE, but also not mind blowing as far as texture and taste. Maybe it would taste better with cheese? Maybe not. \n\nI had a taste of the crab stuffed lobster tail and well. It's lobster. It's good. The crab stuffing though...salty with...too much. Like. Why waste crab if you can't taste it? Also, beware \"market price\". Just saying. It was 100% not worth it. Even if it was lobster.\n\nThe meal was wrapped up with a complimentary...dessert? Pallette cleanser? It was strawberry milk with a white chocolate and cranberry cookie. Didn't quite take the taste of the exorbitant price out of my mouth though. \n\nTry at your own risk.
