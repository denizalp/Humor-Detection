Hexx, you put a spell on me! Thanks for the fabulous chocolate tasting experience (don't forget to get it on Groupon)! My personal favorites were the Ecuadorian milk and dark chocolates, they were amazing. The tasting also includes 2 free bars (retailing at around $7), so it's an awesome deal, just keep in mind they do charge a tax on those.
