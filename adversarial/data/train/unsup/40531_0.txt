I am not one to review a place but this experience was so exceptionally unpleasant I feel the need to do so. I've been ordering pizza and wings late night from Geno's for a few years now. I would say for a light night spot it is clutch for that. Tonight I ordered tacos (seven total) for the first time and when I got home I noticed they forgot to make the quesadilla taco. I was already bummed because after we ordered guacamole and paid they came out later to tell us they were out. Although the refunded us it was kinda a buzz kill that we would be eating them without the guacamole. When I called in to let them know they forgot the quesadilla taco they were very rude and said that they had put it in the bag. Therefore calling me a liar. I'm a fair person and again I have never been upset enough to take the time to write a review, but after they rudely hung up the phone on me (Margaret specifically), I felt the need to do this. I will not be going back to Geno's unless I receive an apology from this company. And when I say I order a lot of food from there I'm talking about 100 a week. I also tried to explain this to the gm of the store to insure that I'm not trying to get a free handout before she rudely hung up on me.
