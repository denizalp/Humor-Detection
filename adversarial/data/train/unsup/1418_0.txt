Had a appointment to get my winter tires changed. I was near the location and called for directions. A female voice answered, put me on hold, and then told me that due to an emergency, I would have to come back another time. \n\nI loaded the tires, on and off, and I ended up losing over a hour plus gas. No Thanks I will look else where.
