I am blown away that I am stuck with this terrible company. It started with the sign-up process. The price the guy gives me on the phone turns out to be bogus. Then after I finally give up on getting that honored we move to installation. They say they will show up at a within a huge window of time, and they STILL don't show-up on time. You would think after the install everything should be fine but no. Problem after problem. Calling them gives me nightmares the hold times and the automated system is so bad. What a monopoly. I can't wait for something to come out and run this crap operation out of town.
