They didn't even show up...\nFound them on Amazon locals. Booked them for the 2 hours for the coupon and then 4 additional hours. Called and spoke to the girl there who said she could not book me on the phone. Had to use their online system. Booked the cleaning there. Seemed simple enough... They were supposed to be there at noon. At 30 minutes after I called to see if they were lost. No? They were double booked and couldn't make it. Apparently letting me know that was too much trouble for them. \nLots of other companies out there. Will use a reputable one that actually shows.\nToo bad because we wanted to use them on a regular basis. Crappy.
