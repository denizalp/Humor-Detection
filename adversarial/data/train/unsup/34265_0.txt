We rented a car from Phoenix, Arizona and returned it to St. George, Utah. Upon return, the St George office was not able to provide us a copy of our reciept and cannot close my rental. The Phoenix office was called several times but nobody was able to answer the call. This is the first time I had an issue with any car rental company, and I am disappointed by the communication and service provided for us\nM
