It hits the spot. If I'm in the neighbourhood, I like to grab a quick $2 patty. It's well-made, hot, and gets the job done. Don't ever go to a convenience store for a patty. Go here.\n\n4 stars out of 5.\n\nJimmy's Yelp Ratings Scale for Food:\n[*] Disappointing. Just...no. \n[**] Not very good. Will not return. \n[***] It is what it is. Go enough times and you'll break even on quality. \n[****] My go-to place. Rarely disappoints. \n[*****] Everything on menu is good. Every time.
