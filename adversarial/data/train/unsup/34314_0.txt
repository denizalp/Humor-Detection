I'm not a seafood fan, so I wasn't very impressed with the selection and the price. My friend was pleased with the crabs. Although, he suggests avoiding the hot ones as they seemed to have an overpowering salted water taste to them. The cold ones were more flavorful. I did like the selection of gelato, including their Elvis flavor, made with peanut butter, jelly, and banana. Also good was the pistachio flavor. Very nutty. If you're a seafood fan, I guess the $38 price can be worth it. The tempura shrimp seemed to have a bit too much breading. There does not seem to be Diamond Tier service there. I prefer to go to the other end of the Rio to the Carnival World Buffet and be pampered in the Diamond Tier seating area.
