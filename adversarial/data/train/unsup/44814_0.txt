I have been to Lakeshore a couple of times before and always passed by Scoops but i never had the chance to try it out. Funny enough we were initially going to go ahead and have some Gelato down the road but ended up skipping on the place due to the lack of flavors offered.\n\nScoops offers a huge variety of ice cream flavors to the point where i was a bit lost on what to get !! One major thing is that there were a couple of unique flavors which caught my eye but i ended up going for the campfire smores flavor on a waffle cone of course !! The ice cream was so creamy and soft just how i like my ice cream to be. I personally am not a fan of hard ice cream so these were perfect !!
