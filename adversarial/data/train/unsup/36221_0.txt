What a treasure Cleveland has in this gorgeous library. It's a real escape during my lunch hour downtown. I can go in for half an hour and feel like I've been gone all day. I sincerely hope that real books don't disappear during my lifetime, as that would make me sad. But it's not just books- this branch has a ton of CDs and DVDs to borrow too. The staff is friendly and eager to help. Whether you feel like reading the latest bodice-ripper romance novel or are looking for an esoteric history book, it's all here. The outside reading garden is beautiful in nice weather, too.
