Finally, a wonderful spot in Paradise Valley to visit often; and bring friends to. Every. Single. Thing.  Perfect.  Amazing drink suggestions and paired to my food choices by Brandon. (He was spot-on with every one).  Such a refreshing place where the people that serve you are as happy as their guests.  Even if I move away from the area I will absolutely come back to the Covenant every chance I get. It's THAT great.  Thank you, and very well done in every way.  Tomahawk Steak was the best steak I've had anywhere.
