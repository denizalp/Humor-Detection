Yup, I'm reviewing a 7-Eleven. Why? Because on Yelp you can review ANYTHING... and I mean anything and a convenience store is easily reviewable since they service customers 7 days a week 365 days a year.\n\nTwo things I go here for, propane refills for my BBQ (cheaper than going to other local spots... save for COSTCO, but who really wants to line up and deal with that hot mess) and coffee.\n\nYes, coffee! Surprisingly their drip coffee self-serve station is great quality. AND Cheap! They have 4-6 varieties always freshly brewed and every possible coffee additive you could hope for (FOR FREE). That means if you were feeling something pumpkin spice you COULD grab a large latte or coffee for about $1 and add the flavour shot(s) yourself - free. Sbux charges you almost $1 (maybe more) to add a shot to any of their existing beverages!\n\nI won't give this place a great or best in class 4 or 5-star but it definitely hits the mark on being convenient and having fair pricing.
