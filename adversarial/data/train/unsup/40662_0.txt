I spent last weekend bustin' a move at Bamboo and I gotta say - best music I've heard being played at a club in a LOOONG time.\n\nThey played everything from Aretha and Sam Cooke, to Young MC and Hammer. At one point I even whipped off the heels in order to ensure that I'd be the last one on the dance floor at the end of the night.\n\nThe crowd was feelin' the music for the most part. Yes, there were a couple of creepers loitering at the bar, but far fewer than you'd run into at other random bars in the city.\n\nThe music was hype, the crowd was cool and I bet you just wish you coulda seen how Sapna got her groove back ;)
