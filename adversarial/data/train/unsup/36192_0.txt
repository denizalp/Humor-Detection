Food was fresh and came promptly after ordering. The reason I didn't give higher stars is the cashier\/server Brandi, had a bad attitude. She was huffing at customers, walked right by with the trash can, almost ran into me and rolled her eyes.....instead of saying excuse me. Part of a good restaurant is good customer service.
