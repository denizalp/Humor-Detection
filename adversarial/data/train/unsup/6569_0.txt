First visit and I started with a cakeshake. If you like funfetti birthday cake you'll absolutely love this shake! It's a shake that tastes just like cake batter with a slice of funfetti cake sitting on top. It was like a birthday party in my mouth. \nI ordered the Texan burger cooked medium and fries. The burger was flavorful with a side of sweet baby rays bbq sauce. The fries were crispy but soft, pretty perfect if you ask me. I personally didn't care much for the pickle but the onion ring was really good. \nDid I mention the shake?!?! OH M GEEEE!! \nService was good. Our server was pleasant and personable. A few people stopped by to check on us which was nice. \nI'm only giving 4 stars because my beer wasn't all that cold. I got the Firestone 805 blonde but I wish it were colder. \nI wish they would put one of these away from the strip, like Henderson or Town Square.
