Wendy's cheeseburgers are probably my favorite fast-food burgers, although I have to be honest, I don't really eat their food too often. There is just something about those burgers...although they do try to mix it up and try to bring out more exciting items than the standard burger joints. Their spicy chicken sandwiches are pretty on point too. \n\nThe restaurant itself was recently remodeled so it's still fresh, it has a more modern look about it, which is also mirrored on the Tim Horton's side. Service is like all fast-food restaurants, mediocre and apathetic - but I can't really blame them, I'd get annoyed really quickly behind the line too.
