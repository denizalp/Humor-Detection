I've eaten here twice. I appreciate somewhere where I can go and get a meal with some green vegetables that are more than just the garnish and also have some vegan options. My first meal I got a rice bowl and I enjoyed that although it was a little spicy or than I had expected. I realize the description said spicy garlic but I assume the spicy meant the garlic and not the red chili pepper that was also in there. I kept reading about the thyme fries so and my second visit I decided to take the leap and order the fries which is rare for me. I also ordered the peanut bowl gluten free option. The fries were a huge disappointment. I ordered them as a treat, I eat fries once or twice a year. I have no idea what is so special about these fries. There was never a hint of thyme flavor and it's certainly wasn't visually observable. They were just regular fries, nothing special at all, a little greasy and their ketchup tasted weird. The peanut bowl was okay. I'm pretty sure they're fake chicken is deep fried. In my opinion its a wash as far as vegan chicken that's fried vs regular chicken breast as long as its raised properly. If I return to the area in the future I might stop in but I think there's very little on the menu for me and if you want to stick with healthier food you need to order carefully here.\nThe food arrived super fast, a little too fast as I like to wash my hands before I eat. I had no sooner ordered and gotten some water and the fries were on the table. The cashier was friendly and helpful when I was ordering.
