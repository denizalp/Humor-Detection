If you're trying to book for business and you want to pay for a third party stay at this hotel hold onto your hat. \n\nA lot of people know that you need a credit card authorization form to pay for rooms of a guest when your not the guest at the hotel. Due to scheduling my executives rooms were booked last minute and TCH is telling me that I can't add my corporate card for the room charges without  10 day prior approval. \n\nThere was not 10 days between my call and the check in date, so how could I do this? They said it was due to fraud that they limit this action. As an executive assistant I book a lot rooms in many different hotels for many different people and I have never encountered this scenario. This rule that the cosmopolitan has is needless and is not conducive to the business needs of their guests. \n\nI received no help in resolving the issue and needless to say I am not happy with this rule nor the customer service received.
