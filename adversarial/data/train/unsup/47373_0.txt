The 4-star is for Tennessee, her exceptional service and I guess for the food. When it finally got to me. Tonight was our first time dining here. The decor was great and ambience was even better. The service is a little slow. Our drinks from the bar took longer than normal. \n\nDespite getting my food 50 minutes later, we will definitely go back.
