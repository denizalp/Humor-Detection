Went for the first time the other night and it was really nice 80 ' s style diner with a retro 50 ' s flair. I had a half sandwich and salad for 10.95. A bit pricey but the server was really nice. The only male server. Peggy the GM was really nice and said hello and goodbye upon arriving and departure.  I will be back.
