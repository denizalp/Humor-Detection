If you need gas, I suppose this place is ok, but I consider this my back up of my back up gas station.  Usually not the cleanest, often the pumps dont print receipts, and the \"no touch\" car wash is only ok, leaving lots and dirty areas. Inside the mini mart, it does have a really kool LED lit candy rack.
