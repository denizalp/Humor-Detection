Came here for Winterlicious Lunch ($33 per person pre-tax and tips).  Delicious food and attentive service, would recommend! \n\nMany options to choose from for appetizer, entree, dessert! My boyfriend and I had the following: \n\nAppetizer\nGrilled sardines, lemon, garlic, extra virgin olive oil - great grilled flavor \nTartar of Salmon, avocado mousse, fresh apple - refreshing starter, you will like it if you like japanese salsmon sashimi! \n\nMain \nGrilled Squid, roasted potatoes, seasonal vegetables - squid is creamy and not chewy at all! \nComfit of Duck Leg, white bean and rapini casserole, port wine sauce - great portion and the skin is crispy \n\nDessert \nChocolate Bourbon Cake - wish the portion is a little bit bigger, but it's chocolaty and I really like the sauce. \nMolotof - it is a very light dessert (kinda foamy), not for my personal taste, but it is interesting!\n\n*bread and olive oil was also served with the meal\n**weekend lunch is only available during winterlicious, normally they are only opened M-F for lunch.
