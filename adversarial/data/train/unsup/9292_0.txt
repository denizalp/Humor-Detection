A good portion of my student loans went to paying for sushi at Yama when I was in law school. This place was where I developed my love for sushi, so it has a special place in my heart. Notwithstanding my emotional attachment to Yama, I still feel that this is the best AYCE sushi in Las Vegas.\n\nThe restaurant is very cozy, as they have a small space to work with. It can get very busy, deservedly so because the sushi is amazing. If I had to recommend something to order, it would definitely be the seafood salad. You can only order one per sitting because it's one of the \"special\" items on the menu. Understandably so. If I had the ability to, I'd order only seafood salads and put Yama out of business. Also, if you get the seafood salad, order it spicy.
