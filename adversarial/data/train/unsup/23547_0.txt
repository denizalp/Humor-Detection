So I've been in here twice and I'm like, best friends with the guys that work there already.  Beach hardware has all your odds and ends needs for the house, including both decorative, cleaning, and regular hardware here.  The Canadian Tire nearby (on Lakeshore) cannot - I repeat - cannot make keys no matter how many times they try.  So, we went here instead and they were able to make us keys!  Doesn't sound like much but apparently it's a big deal when you can't get keys made.\n\nReally friendly and helpful staff.  I kinda just want to go in there to hang-out, we spent 30 mins comparing Canada to the US, and what Canadian doesn't enjoy that conversation?
