I just had my tummy tuck and breast aug done this past July. Dr. Heffel was my first and only consult.  After meeting with him and discussing my goals I felt very comfortable with him and had no reason to consult with any other surgeon. The surgery coodinator Michelle was extremely helpful and practically walked me through the entire process.  She even helped me get paperwork for my time off work  completed several weeks prior to my surgery. Dr. Heffel is very nurturing and honest as can be. I absolutely appreciated him and the entire staff at NVPS.  And yes, my results are beyond what I could have ever expected.\n\nAlso recommend checking out their website for monthly specials on surgeries and services!
