Longo's is the best locally owned restaurant!  More then just their delicious food, awesome patio, and great staff- it's how they give back that stands out.  They give $10,000 to the local humane society every year while also supporting local schools with discount card promotion deals.  They're the epitome of a local business that gives back.  The only place we will go for pizza!
