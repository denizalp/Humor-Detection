Cinnamon Toast Crunch Martini.... YUM!\n\nWith an amazing list of mixology gold you cant go wrong ordering a cocktail at this restaurant. from the Twinkie Martini to the Swedish Fish cocktail you will find something to quench your sweet tooth. \n\nFor dinner i had the chicken Cesar salad. And as simple as this item is this salad was by far the best Caesar Ive ever had. The dressing was light and creamy with a hint of garlic. defiantly a fan! Whether your coming here for just a cocktail or an amazing experience for dinner I highly recommend this place. \n\nWhy only 4 stars? I over heard a manager scolding an employee in front of many guests. That was not a nice thing to hear.
