I'm usually stay far away from buffets, however I am very happy I decided to give this place a try.  My mom and I were both in the mood to try some place new and after driving around and checking out all of commerical center we decided a Indian food sounded pretty yummy.  After eating there, I decide this really is the only way to go out for Indian food with just 2 people because I always want to try just a little bit of everything.  At Namaste you can, and everything I tasted was fantastic!
