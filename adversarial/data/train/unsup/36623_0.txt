First impression is really important on the first date. \n\nBrass Taps Pizza Pub really makes a good impression. The dark and \"cozy\" down to earth vibe, the friendly crowd and the helpful waitress.\n\nMy quickie Tequila shot ($6) sealed the deal.\n\nI will be back again, my second date will hopefully involve some finger licking food!
