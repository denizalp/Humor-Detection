On Wednesday the 8th  the guy came out... Explained what was going on, said they replace the whole thing and it is 9000...I said it doesn't need a blower for the heater. It works fine.  He went in the attic. Was up there less then 5 minutes. Never turned the unit on. Went out side to the unit , hooked something up. Then said NOTHING was wrong with the A\/C. And then wants 49.00 for a service call. He did nothing.... This is what i was told to be leary of... Trying to take advantage since i am female... I wasn't born yesterday.  I wasn't going to post any thing but this just really made me upset...
