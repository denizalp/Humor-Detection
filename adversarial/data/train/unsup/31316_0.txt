I wasn't feeling sushi, but I went with it. \nMy expectations were low, just another sushi bar in Vegas...\nWe gave our server, Veronica, a per-person budget and let her pick.\n\n I was blown away!\n\nWe were served Mini Tacos, Sea Bass skewers, Sashimi Ceviche, Seared Wagyu Beef, Salt & Pepper Squid and more. The plates just kept coming. How did they get such incredible flavors into the food? I would put Sushisamba up against the best. Sure, Nobu (Malibu) may have great atmosphere, but the flavors, quality, variety, and probably 100 different sakes here, make them a strong competitor. \n\n\nService was impeccable (Ask for Veronica).
