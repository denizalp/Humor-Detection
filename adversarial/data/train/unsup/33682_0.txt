One of our favorite date night spots! Obviously they have an amazing beer selection & we almost always order a few samples of their newly tapped beers so we can try them all. The headwiches certainly live up to their name,  they're giant. We have yet to find anything on the menu that we don't like. They do get really busy though so expect at least an hour wait on Friday & Saturday nights.
