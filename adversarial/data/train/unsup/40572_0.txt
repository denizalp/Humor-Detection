I'm SOOOO glad that I was given a coupon for a free breakfast for THE RUSTIC CAFE.  I know its a breakfast\/lunch establishment but they DO stay open until 3 pm and open at 6:30 am.  They are open 7 days a week - so - you can have breakfast any time of the day you like.  My personal favorite breakfast item is the Country Style Eggs Benedict - the best of both worlds. Hollandaise sauce AND a hearty country gravy with bits of sausage in it.  The menu is quite extensive for being a smaller local restaurant.  For example:  Chicken Marsala, Quesadillas, Soups, Salads, Sandwiches, Wraps, Pasta, Fish and several Meat entree's.  The waiters are all very accommodating and the owner, Eric, makes appearances now and then in the dining room.  A dining reward program \"sweetens the pot\"!  To view their menu online:                www.rusticcafeaz.com\nI'm almost ashamed to admit this but I go there 2-3 times a week!
