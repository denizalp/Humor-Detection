Oh... my... goodness... this is by far the BEST ramen I have ever had. I have tried the majority of the ramen places in Seattle and I must say that none come close to Ramen Sora. Ramen will never be the same for me....\n\n\nCame here on a weekend night and came in right before a huge rush of people. The restaurant isn't very big and the place seems very popular. I ordered the spicy miso ramen with extra chashu. The broth was amazing and it wasn't too spicy. It was just enough to give it extra flavor without burning your mouth. I don't know how to describe this broth. It was warm, rich, and absolutely delicious!! The chashu was cooked perfectly. It was tender and practically melted in your mouth with the miso broth. I also thoroughly enjoyed the bamboo shoots that were still a bit crunchy, perfection!\n\nI tried the shoyu broth as well, which was good, but nothing compares to the miso broth. If you come here, don't even contemplate about getting anything but the miso. It is a MUST! The ramen comes in regular or large, and by large I mean ginormous. It's a pretty big helping, so you've been warned. \n\nThe service was on point. We were seated immediately. The waiter was very attentive and informative. He was able to explain the different broths and the different menu options. Everyone was able to decide what they wanted rather quickly after he educated us on the menu and everyone was satisfied with their order. So job well done. I can't wait to come back to satisfy my ramen cravings.
