The Korean food here is SO good! It's a fairly new restaurant open for a few months now. They don't have a liquor license which is honestly the only con. There's a liquor outlet right next door so you can BYOB. I've stopped by to grab sake twice (they don't have soju at the store) and they'll provide shot glasses for you at the restaurant. \n\nThe service was great the first few times I've gone and has been a little slower recently but the food is delicious which trumps all... The best Korean restaurant I've been to in Las Vegas. \n\nThey have a lot of fusion dishes (I saw a bulgogi burrito on the menu) and also authentic Korean dishes. I prefer traditional Korean food but tried both here:\n\n- Yukaejang (Spicy Beef Soup)\nVery spicy and hearty! Comes out piping hot with lots of meat, veggies, and egg. A large portion - I can't finish myself. Highly recommend this soup\n\n- Haemul Pajun (Seafood Pancake)\nA great appetizer to share - the size of a large plate. Made with a variety of seafood (octopus and shrimp to name a few) and green onions. Comes with soy sauce for dipping\n\n- Dduk Kalbi (Kalbi Meatloaf)\nVery flavorful for a big potato sized slab of meat. Tastes like meat jun without the egg\n\n- Mozzarella Cheese Katsu\nAn infused dish. The mozzarella oozes out when you cut into it and it's wrapped in meat and fried breading. Paired with a BBQ style dipping sauce\n\n- Tofu Kimchi\nSlices of tofu served with warm cooked kimchi. The kimchi is very dank and spicy, I personally loved it. I imagine other Koreans and adventurous foodies would enjoy. My American friends would run as far from this dish as possible\n\n- Dolsot Bibimbap (Stone bowl Bibimbap)\nA variety of veggies and bulgogi on rice topped with a fried egg. Filling portion and pretty good but nothing extraordinary\n\n- Jjolmyeon (Spicy Cold Chewy Noodles)\nNoodles  topped with veggies and sliced boiled egg. Hot sauce comes on the side. We needed scissors to cut the noodles because they're incredibly long. The flavor was so-so\n\n- Spicy Cream Jjampong (Creamy Seafood Noodle Soup)\nAnother infused dish, noodles and seafood in a creamy Alfredo broth. Had a spicy kick to it which is unexpected in a white sauce\/soup base. Very different that the normal spicy red Jjampong\n \n- Jeyuk Bokkeum (Stir Fried Spicy Pork)\nIncredibly flavorful, spicy, and tasty. There are some fatty pieces but that's not a huge surprise in pork dishes \n\nThe banchan (side dishes) are pretty standard but tastes authentic. Usually they provide kimchi, pickled white radish, fish cakes, and some sort of seasoned veggie (broccoli, zucchini, etc). Of course they will replenish upon request.\n\nIf you're a fan of Korean food I definitely recommend MAMAOH. I've introduced my Korean friends (and one Hawaiian friend) to this restaurant and they all love it. If you like Yukaejang as much as I do, you HAVE to try it here!
