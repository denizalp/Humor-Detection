The place was busy.  Still had plenty of seating outside on their patio.  Good vibe in the place, reminds me of liberty market in Gilbert.  \n\nI had a egg sandwich called killer. This sandwich had some cheese (forgot what kind of cheese) that was really strong.  It over powered the sandwich so I didn't care for it.  \n\nMy wife had the pancakes.  Banana fosters pancakes I think.  These were really good.  I had half of her order since she never eats all of her food (lucky me;).  \n\nWe also had a body Mary.  It was a little spicy, the way I like it.   It was not to strong, which to me is good if your having one with breakfast.   \n\nNext time we hike A-mountain,  we will stop in there to share the French toast.
