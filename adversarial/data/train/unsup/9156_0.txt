It's a Dutch Bros clone.\n\nIt is sooooo a DB clone. \n\nBut when it's got a decent product, and even more accessible hours, is that honestly a bad thing?\n\nI mean sure, the baristas haven't yet quite nailed the matching brand of over-the-top enthusiasm, but they try! They're cool. And the beverages they've made for me so far haven't been half bad, especially with the 'white coffee' that kept me up for hours. \n\n(I thought it was unique to this place, but it turns out DB did that first as well)\n\nI really set low expectations, and they delivered. I trust this place to get a good, sugary mixed beverage or an OK black coffee in a grab-and-go location. Sure, I think it's weird that they copied everything except combinations of flavored syrups in signature beverages. I think they should continue to develop themselves and create something no one else in the area has. It's a large suburbia with virtually no competition from other independent operations, so please take risks! Add something a little out of the ordinary to such a boring corner! \n\nUntil then, it might sound like I dislike this place, but I know I can trust them to make me good drinks. And that's what matters most! Support small businesses and make this your spot in the northwest valley. =)
