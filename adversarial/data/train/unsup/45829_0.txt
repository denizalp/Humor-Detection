Bottom line- great theater to watch a flick in English.\n\nThe scotiabank bank cinema is a four-level movie theater inside a mall that plays movies in English (rare in Quebec). When you purchase your tickets you get to pick your exact seat- which is good for me since I always like a buffer! The food is more than U.S. movie theater snacks- you can get legit meals and beer! The seats recline but sometimes it's hard to keep it reclined without putting your foot on the seat in front of you. \n\nI'm sure I'll head back to Montreal one of these days and if I need to see a flick- this is where I'd go!
