Cool venue for sure. The middle is open and their are couches and tables on the side. They ave a VIP section upstairs. We had a blast at the USO Heroes Jam. Drinks are expensive though and for some weird reason the women's bathroom stalls are built in such a way you can not exit the stall. I can't imagine what this looks like with ladies who have had a few too many. They must find a lot of cell phones flushed down the toilet. Ha! Rock on!
