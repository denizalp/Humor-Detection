I had John rebuild two suits and modify a winter dress overcoat.  He works out of his home.  He is an old school tailor and a great craftsman, but he is not inexpensive.\nHe took the suits apart from seam to seam, altered the size, had me back on two occasions for fittings and when he was done they were perfect.  He can make a suit from scratch, and there are not many in Champaign who can do that.
