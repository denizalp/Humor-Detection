It has taken me a long, long, long time to write this review. To be transparent, I went to Luna's in May, 2015. I try to write reviews that are fair, so it has honestly taken me time (see aforementioned timeline above) for me to unpack my thoughts about my experience. \n\nI went with my sister whom was visiting from California. She's a vegan, so Luna's was to be a high point of her visit restaurant-wise to the Charlotte area. The ambiance of Luna's is great and our server was delightful. We popped in for a late breakfast after a Pilates class on a Saturday, but by the time we were seated, they had stopped serving breakfast by like 2 minutes. And no, ordering breakfast wasn't a choice at that point because I asked. I had actually really wanted breakfast too, so that started me off on a bad note. I ended up ordering the living bagel along with the purple rain juice. The juice was fantastic, and I can see why they are so popular. \n\nThe bagel looked beautiful in presentation, and was pretty darn tasty until I pulled a black wiry curly hair out of my mouth that was enmeshed in my bite of food. I have blonde hair, so it definitely wasn't my hair in my food. Further digging in the bagel revealed another strand of hair. I am guessing that \"living\" part of the name doesn't imply protein filament from the human head. That honestly turned me off so bad that I couldn't finish my meal. I didn't make a big deal of it at the time we were there, but that's because I didn't want to bother our nice server who was super busy.\n\nI think it is definitely fair to say that I am not heading back to Luna's again.
