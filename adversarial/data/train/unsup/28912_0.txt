As with most sky\/roof\/hotel bars, you're really paying a premium to be up really high. Not to say the wine list wasn't impressive or the cheese and charcuterie not of high quality, but you're probably going 40% over cost to see things from on up high.\n\nSadly I'm just not that in to that and I've yet to go to one of these sorts of places and be convinced otherwise.
