I live almost right across the street from the new Walmart Neighborhood Market, and I've been anxiously awaiting its opening. Til now, I've been venturing down to the Super Walmart in Indian Land, so this is a much better commute!\n\nThe convenience is great, parking is ample, it's 24 hours, and it's shiny and clean. The staff was friendly when I was there, and my only complaint was that the selection wasn't quite as vast as the Super Walmart. I couldn't find some non-food iteams like washing machine cleaner, Puffs without lotion, Clean and Clear oil strips, or Almay cosmetics - staples at Publix. It's possible they had sold out, so I'll check again. On the other hand, their selection of frozen meals\/breakfast was pretty awesome! \n\nI'll keep visiting, and I'm sure I'll start to love it even more when I get in my groove of knowing where to find everything. Til then, I'm still super excited to have a Walmart in the neighborhood!
