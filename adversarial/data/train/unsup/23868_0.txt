The first time we went to this place we found that the food was amazing, but the service was absolutely terrible.\nMe and my friend decided to return to this place because we were starving and craving their amazing pho. When we arrived I went straight to the restroom to wash my hands. I look down at the floor of the restroom and what do I see? A cute little baby ROACH!!! Yes, a roach! Where's its mother I wonder? Probably with daddy roach reproducing more and more brothers and sisters so that baby roach won't be alone. Or maybe they are in the kitchen feasting on the delicious pho (hey, I don't blame them). Yes, it was just a little roach and yes it did freak me out, and yes we all know that when there's one theres probably many... However, when I got back to the table my fatass ordered some pho and eggrolls. I guess I wasn't too scarred! I refused to let the baby get in the way of my dining experience. I'm just glad the pho was delicious!!!!! Might have been the best and worst decision of my life \nPho= 5 stars\nMy friend in the restroom=0
