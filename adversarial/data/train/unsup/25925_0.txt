Really disappointed in the service at this place. Bought a groupon for a 1 hour RMT massage with insurance receipt so I called and booked the appointment. I mentioned on the phone that the option I had was the RMT option and the girl said no problem. Showed up only to have the receptionist YELL at me because according to her I didn't tell her. I conceded and said maybe there had been a misunderstanding (to which she continued to yell at me I hadn't but whatever) so I asked to rebook with the RMT. She put up a bit of a fight so I gave in and asked if she would charge me the non-RMT price and she said no which I don't think is fair. Really not wanting to argue anymore I said fine, I'll just get the massage. Massage was fine, nothing to write home about but I'm in shock that they refuse to honor the service that I paid for. Definitely won't be going back and have put in a complaint with groupon. It's a shame since they seem to be treating many customers like this.
