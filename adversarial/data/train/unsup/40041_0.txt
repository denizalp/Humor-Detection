This place has such great food. Thus far I've had their dumplings, calamari, and Mango Tofu. The Mango Tofu is amazingly delicious and I'm not even a vegetarian.\n\nMy fiance loves the seafood special, which I'm also particularly fond of.\n\nThe staff is also very friendly and attentive. Overall, my favorite Thai place by far!
