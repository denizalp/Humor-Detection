It's been a few months since I've been to this location.  I pulled in last week on my way to work to get coffee for myself and a coworker.  Nick and Heidi are still working the morning shift and I remembered them but I didn't expect them to remember me.  I placed my order and both of them asked me how I was doing and that it had been a while since I was in and they called me by name!!!  Yes, almost 4 months since I was in and they still knew my name!  And the fact that they are still both working there must mean something right??  Turnover at other places is high.  So I figure they must get paid ok and treated ok by the company but most of all I think they both truely enjoy their jobs.  I have never seen either one of them without a smile on their face.  They always have an awesome attitude no matter how busy it is.  I wish they would bring a Dutch Bros. out to the East Valley so I can get my fix on the weekend without having to drive to far.  Thanks Dutch Bros. for having such awesome folks working.  It really helps make my morning!!
