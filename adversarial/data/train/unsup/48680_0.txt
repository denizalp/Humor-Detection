Typical Thai fare but small portions and over priced. We ordered bucket drinks (12.95) and they tasted like juice. The mussels appetizer were basically plain cold mussels placed on top of raw lemongrass-do not order! The description was deceptive. We ordered calamari, pla pa sa (fish), pad thai, curry, som tum, and pork bone soup and were disappointed. I felt like there was no effort in balancing flavours that Thai food is known for, as these items were either too sweet or too sour. The only upsides: nam tok, (although was 5 thin slices of pork) was tasty, and service was friendly.
