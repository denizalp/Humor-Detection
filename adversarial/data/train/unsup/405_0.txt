What better way to undue a 40min workout than to head to the nearest Asian bakery for sweet buns...\n\nUnder new management, the bakery inside Super G Mart now represents Hong Kong and serves up fresh goods daily. I know, because I fortunately\/unfortunately live in walking distance and sometimes boil a cup of tea and head over there for a freshly baked taro bun. They are often on the rack and hot when I arrive.  \n\nThis bakery is a massive improvement from the former, and from what I've observed, the main reason is the owner. He is a stickler for quality.  He is friendly, and takes his baking seriously.  Once the baked goods leave the tray, they are individually wrapped in little clear bags and placed on the shelves. With the previous Mexican bakery, they would put the stuff out bare, open for everyone to grope & sneeze on, not to mention the stuff was frequently stale.\n\nI skipped my signature taro bun and went wild; got both a pineapple coco bun (it doesn't have pineapple in it; the owner smiled and said he calls it that because it is shaped to look like a pineapple. *right...(smile)...hardly, but okay*), and a mung bean paste bun.\n\nSoft, sweet, fresh & comforting....they were good.  The ONLY thing that irritated was that the coconut filling was too lite and flaky, so easily spilled out the bun. See photo.\n\nNever mind the extra 10min on the bike I'll put in for them in the AM. Worth it :)
