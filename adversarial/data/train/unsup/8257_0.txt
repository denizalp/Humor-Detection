Just saw the lady transport at China Grill transport veggies in her light blue Honda CRV.  She took a tray of half cooked noodles out of her trunk with no covers!  I was shocked!  She put it on a cart and kicked it back into place with her dirty shoe going up the ramp.  So much sanitary issues going on with this place.
