Needed to find something in the area that was fast and different.  We ordered the seafood soup and the won ton soup.  Glad to see there was a kid's menu too which offered some small noodle soups.  Since me and the little one are allergic to eggs they substituted for rice noodles.  Won Ton soup lacked a little flavor nothing exciting. My sister loved her seafood soup.  Service was pretty good, very friendly. The mango shrimp salad picture looked amazing so if I come back maybe I'll try that?
