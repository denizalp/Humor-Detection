Paul was recommended to us through a friend and at first he was very nice.  He showed me homes over the course of 3 days and I found a home on the third day, which was very quick, and makes most realtors very happy.  Unfortunately, during the negotiations Paul became very overbearing and opinionated on what amount we should offer on the house as our opening offer, even when I told him the amount at which we were comfortable starting.   It was not only that he thought that he knew better than I did how to spend my own money, but the way in which he spoke to me when I disagreed.  I found the way in which he spoke to me disrespectful and rude.  We did purchase the home, and unfortunately had to deal with him throughout the process.  Had we been able to get rid of him and still buy the house we would have done so happily.  Since then I have been asked by numerous friends if we would recommend our realtor to them.  I told them that I couldn't do so in good conscience since I  didn't want them to experience the same disrespectful and unprofessional treatment that I had endured.
