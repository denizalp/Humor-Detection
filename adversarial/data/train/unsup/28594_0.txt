1st time here. Great place, totally worth every penny.  I had a great time, my masseuse was great she hit all the stress spots. I would definitely recommend this place to go to when u want a massage!  Its off the strip but not too far; its in driving distance an cab distance.  Everyone here is so nice & comforting and welcoming!  Definitely coming back!
