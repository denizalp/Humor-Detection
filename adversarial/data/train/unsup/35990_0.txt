We have visited Vegas about 10 times over the years, never staying at the same hotel twice. This was our first stay at the Venetian. Compared to our last two stays at the Aria and Bellagio, the Venetian is the best bang for your buck. At check in we were offered to upgrade and we are glad we didn't. The standard suites are more than sufficient. Large spacious rooms with separate living and bedroom areas, spacious bathrooms, 3 tv's, comfortable beds. No complaints about housekeeping, everyday our room was done before we returned. The room was clean and everything restocked daily. Between the Venetian and connected Palazzo there are more than enough dining and nightlife options to keep you busy. I do have a couple of complaints that prevented this from being a 5 star review. First the resort fee, it is the highest I have encountered in Vegas. We reserved 2 rooms for 3 nights and paid $153 per room at checkout. Once the taxes were added to the $45 dollar per night resort fee, I found this ridiculous. Also the annoyance of the constant hawking of products by store employees in the Grand Canal Shops was terrible. I could put up with this if I was just visiting the shops for the day. But when you are constantly coming and going from your room night and day and harassed every time it gets extremely annoying. We were at times literally shouted and yelled at down the hall until we were finally out of range. If I didn't have these two issues this easily would have been 5 stars. One of the best and flawless hotel stays I can remember.
