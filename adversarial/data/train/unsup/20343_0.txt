Came here yesterday for the second time... to give it another try. Came here about a year and a half and didn't like my acai bowl. \n\nHad the regular hula bowl and I won't be back. I make acai bowls on my own at home for over 10 years. The bowl here lacks acai. Acai is dark purple my bowl was very light purple and didn't taste like acai. I feel like the bowl is blended mostly with banana and other frozen fruit not acai. If there is acai in there it's not much. \n\nI won't be back.
