My family still loves this place. The dishes are still solid, prices are reasonable and service is good for the most part. \n\nWe came for dinner around 6:30pm today and it wasn't busy at all. We were the only customers during our meal which we found a little worrisome in regards to their business. I hope it was just a slow day. \n\nWe ordered the Cashew Chicken with Rice, the Broken Rice with Pork, Chicken and fried egg and the Pho with Rare Beef and Tripe. \n\nWe enjoyed our meal tremendously.\n\n#56 of 2018
