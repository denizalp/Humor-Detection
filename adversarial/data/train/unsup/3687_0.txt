Ho Shim is a very cozy little place in the Financial District.  It is really a hit & miss since it is located in the basement.  Good quality food for a very modest price in this area, which is unbelievable.  I think they do not believe in inflation, at least over the years they have not inflated their prices.  I usually go to their take out window when I need to grab a quick lunch (less than $10), food is served hot always.  I have been a patron more than 20 years and I have never been disappointed.
