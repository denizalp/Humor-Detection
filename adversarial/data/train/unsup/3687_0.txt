I ordered a large 16.6 oz. bottle of Lavender Population, the same (supposedly) oil I've used on my daughter for a long time to help her sleep.  Previously I'd bought it from a different company.  Upon receiving it, I immediately noticed that the oil did not smell as nice, and that it was oilier (didn't evaporate right away) when rubbed between my palms.  I used it for about 2-weeks, when my daughter started complaining about dry skin and rash where we applied it (ears and neck).  This had never happed before with the Plant Therapy Population Lavender oil, nor with the Lavender from Young Living.  When I called New Directions, assuming that I would simply return it under their \"100% Satisfaction Guarantee\" policy, they a) told me that my daughter was reacting to the coconut oil that I use as a carrier oil, and b) that they do not take back opened product.  Explain to me how a company has a 100% Satisfaction Guarantee Policy if you can't open and try the product.
