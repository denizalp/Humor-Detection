Bravo Timo! Well done. \n\nI loved Bomberos and Timo has moved in to the beautiful spot and went easy on the remodeling.. If it ain't broke don't fix it! The patio was left intact and is gorgeous. I would recommend this for groups or for a romantic dinner for two. When it is cold the fire pit is awesome and it is quaint and charming. \n\nThe inside is cozy and well designed, I usually opt to sit at the bar so I can watch them prepare my food and slide it in to the wood fired oven.  I went for brunch last week and it was awesome (see pics).\n\nI had the benedict with avocado, tomato, black truffle, prosciutto and hollandaise  and it was simply divine!  I could not leave without trying the grapefruit brulee, equally scrumptious.\n\nI can't wait to go back for dinner. They have a bottle of wine and a flatbread for $20 on Mondays!
