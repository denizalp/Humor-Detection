Tons of parking spots to choose from, store is very neat and clean.  Yogurt selection was ok...nothing that wowed me but the stations were very clean so that was a plus, not like other places were there is melted yogurt everywhere...same for the toppings, but a lot of selection but station was very clean.  Staff was friendly.  Store decoration was kinda boring and the seats aren't that comfortable, but there's a great shopping center to walk around with your bowl of yogurt.  I recommend this place.
