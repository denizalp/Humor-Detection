This event was a lot of fun! Lots of delicious food and it was a beautiful atmosphere. I loved the Christmas music and the huge tree in the center of the lobby. It really got you in the Christmas spirit. There was a ton of gourmet food to go around all night long. 20 drink tickets was plenty since they were giving pretty good pours on the wine and beer. \n\nMy only con would be that there was no coat check so we were stuck carrying around our winter jackets. Who knew since the day before it was 75 degrees, only in Ohio right?! Other than that, I had a great time!
