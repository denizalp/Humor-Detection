This place is always crowded, and with good reason. It's a great neighborhood joint with good food and a friendly staff that get to know you.\n\nIt's my favorite breakfast joint in Middleton (well, it's a tie with Bloom in the summer when Bloom has outdoor seating). You can't beat the prices, either.\n\nBe ready to wait a few minutes for a table to open up, and bring cash (don't worry--they have an ATM if you didn't). The cash thing is the only reason I give them 4 stars instead of 5.\n\nAlso, the tables and booths are old and tired. If you're a snob about these things, spare yourself and them the trouble. You come here for the food, the service, and the old-timey diner atmosphere. \n\nParking in the lot is annoying. The lot is tiny. Ain't no thang for me - I just walk. :)  There's plenty of on-street parking for those who don't have that option.
