Vicki, the manager, invited me back in for an opportunity to make things right. It took a couple of weeks for me to get out to Peoria but glad that I did. We ordered a large deep dish Meat & More Meat. This was shared between 4 adults and a petite Asian and there were still 2.5 large slices to take with us. We ordered some traditional buffalo wings and calamari to share while we wait for the pie to bake. I like my wings a bit more crispy but they were still good; not too tangy. The calamari wasn't as crispy as the last time we were there but still not bad.\n\nWe had all three of their desserts: Tiramisu, triple chocolate cake with ice cream and cannolis. Most of the table liked the Tiramisu. My favorite was the triple chocolate cake with ice cream. The cannolis were the least favorite of the bunch.\n\nOur waitress was very attentive even before we asked for Vicki. \n\nI really appreciate a business that takes pride in their product and customer service. But what I appreciate even more is when a business owns up to their mistakes and goes above and beyond to make things right! I would definitely stop in to try some of their other offerings.
