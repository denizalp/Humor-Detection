\"The barbarian weapon is fission: the splitting asunder. It has been perfected for death. Our only weapon is fusion: an imperfect process still, though designed for life.\"\n- Marya Mannes\n\nTrattoria Nakamura-Ya is probably what Mannes was talking about when she referenced fusion...I mean after all, who else in Vegas has brought Japanese and Italian together as beautifully?\n\nTrattoria Nakamura-Ya is famous for two dishes: \n1.Linguini \"Uni\" Tomato Cream consisting of premium \"Uni\" (sea urchin) cooked in rich tomato cream sauce and served over linguini pasta with basil and saffron\n2. Spaghetti \"Ikasumi\" Squid Ink consisting of saut√©ed calamari and diced tomato in squid ink sauce, served over spaghetti. While both are good the Linguini \"Uni\" Tomato Cream is outstanding.\n\nTrattoria Nakamura-Ya was the first place I tasted an uni cream sauce at...since then I've had it at a couple other places. But I'm not sure that anyone in town does it any better than Trattoria Nakamura-Ya. The first time I had the Linguini \"Uni\" Tomato Cream was also the first time that I enjoyed uni. Uni is an acquired taste for sure. It took me a few years of trying it at various restaurants before I started truly enjoying it on its own in dishes like uni nigiri. I love that Trattoria Nakamura-Ya makes it more approachable in this pasta dish, but I also appreciate that true fans of uni typically adore this dish as well.\n\nI've been here twice and have only had the occasion to taste a few items on the menu. My favorite being the Linguini \"Uni\" Tomato Cream with added Scallops from the Specials board. This is a lovely 5 star dish for me. The linguini was cooked perfectly al dente and uni and tomato cream are a perfect marriage. The basil and saffron finish the dish wonderfully--rounding out the flavors and providing clear freshness.\n\nThere are a lot of other dishes to explore here, but problem lies with the Linguini \"Uni\" Tomato Cream being as good as it is...I don't see myself skipping out on this dish and thus limiting my ability to try a lot of other options. The last time I came in was with my love and we also shared Grilled Vegetables in Bagna Cauda Sauce and Chikodai (Cubehead) Carpaccio. The Grilled vegetables were fine, but not really special to us in any way. The Chikodai Carpaccio on the other hand was delightful. I don't recall having this variety of fish before in a sushi form, but I enjoyed it quite a bit and I will certainly order one of the Carpaccios offered on the specials board again. \n\nThe ambiance leaves a little to be desired. At this proceeding and quality of food, I'd prefer a little more attention to the dinning space which is rather plain--consisting fir several 2 top and 4 top tables with chairs...almost like a mini cafeteria. Then again, did I mention Uni for the win...?
