Let me say something first, if you read any other review that says don't believe the hype  or blah blah blah, look for that yelper and slap them and their mother. This place was amazing. After seeing the bento box constantly show up on my facebook feed, I finally got to find out how delicious this place was. I ordered exactly what they have on their facebook ads. The bento box with beef and salmon. I checced out the condiment station and I strongly recommend the Japanese Salsa. Not only was my order done in under 10 minutes but I think my tastebuds had an orgasm!!! Fittingly, the restaurant had H-Town's \"Knoccing The Boots\" playing and that's exactly what my tastebuds did with the bento box. They made extreme passionate, whispering sweet nothings into your ears type of love in my mouth. I will most definitely be coming bacc to this fine establishment.
