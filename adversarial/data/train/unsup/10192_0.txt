hm..............\n\nmy last trip to vegas was with my dad and sister who was visting me from nyc.. so we decided to watch a show.. but the only shows that were playing sunday night werent that great.. this was the best pick... i dunno if it was us... (being super tired from the short trip stay at vegas) or the show being super..... uhmm... how should i put it nicely... i fell asleep... we all did.. :(\n\ni thought..... hm... we spent about 130$ for each ticket... and fell asleep..... the last time i was in nyc.... i was really really tired after helping my sister move into her fabulous apt in manhattan.. and unpacking everything.. my sister had already purchased student tickets in the morning for about 26.50$ and i really didnt want to watch jersey boys... i thought what is that about? ew... but we went there super tired... but omgggg the show was soooo amazing that it actually woke me up.. so my point is.. no matter how tired i am... if a show is as good as they say it is... you wont fall asleep! \n\ni dont reccomend anyone to watch this... super boring.. :) but if your okay with pay over 100 for each ticket and falling asleep... then be my guest!
