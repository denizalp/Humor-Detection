Found this company through HOA to fix neighborhood desert landscaping a pool contractor damaged. Tony came over and fixed it perfectly.\nWe wanted to make our pavers to look shiny wet look so asked Tony if he could do it. It took him 5 days to coat (double coat, over 4,000 sqf. of pavers) our pavers to look like brand new pavers. Now, our pavers look nice and shiny. Again, he did a perfect job!\nIf we needed any future landscaping, I would call Tony. First choice! Very neat and meticulous. Super nice person. (Hope he doesn't move to FL...) He even washed our sliding glass door windows (which he didn't have to do)!!\nThanks Future Yards :-)
