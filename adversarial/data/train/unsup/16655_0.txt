Earl of Sandwich was the first place I ate at with my friends when we arrived in Las Vegas. I had the Caribbean Jerk Chicken, which is grille chicken, roasted red peppers, banana peppers, and the jerk sauce. To me it's tasty and not that spicy and I liked it. It's affordable, too, compared to all the places we would eat and go to in the course of our trip! Pretty lively even that early in the morning, but expected in the city that never sleeps.
