I went here to check out the facilities, and they are pretty spectacular.. Although, it seems like it's geared towards the \"older\" crowd.. which is fine, because that was the majority of the population in there when I went.\n\nFor instance, the whirlpool is warm, but not too hot as to burn any elderlies, the steam room is steamy, but barely, and the sauna seemed like it may have been turned on but I'm not entirely sure..\n\nThe facilities are super nice though - what a \"health club\" should look like.. I'm just more into the \"gym\" vibe so it's not for me..
