Came here a couple days ago through a recommendation. Upon entry I was immediately greeted and had my name put down on their list. The place was full and very busy, however according to the guy that didn't my nails (Joe was his name I believe) this was one of their \"slow days\". Impressive. I've never seen a nail salon so busy and I've been to quite a bit. So if this was any indication of their service, I was excited to see the end result. \n\nI opted for a mani pedi. Joe was very entertaining and even made conversation, which is nice. He even helped me decide what color to go with.  I'm giving it 4 stars because there was a noticeable small bulge in my pinky and he didn't fix it, but it was probably because there was a long line of waiting customers. So I didn't get too upset about that. \n\nWill definitely come back.
