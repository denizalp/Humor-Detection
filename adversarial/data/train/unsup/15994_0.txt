Tonight, I check-in at my hotel, unpacked...I needed dinner. I perused around Yelp looking at various restaurant venues...too many really good restaurants makes it difficult to choose. I reached out to EAT24 from Yelp. After I decided upon the cuisine...it started lightening and thunder, followed by it raining to beat the band. \n\nNo problem...let's have it delivered...!!!\n\nTonight I went for something that I very rarely ever have...pizza...not just any pizza, but a small, pepperoni and tomato pizza...but I need some veggies so I also elected for the antipasto salad...this is going to be good...oh wait, dessert...how about the cheese cake...!!!\n\nRemember, there's a storm brewing out there...\n\n...dinner arrived on time, complete...and hot. A simple little pepperoni pizza, and my goodness, what a tasty pizza...my taste buds ignited like 4th of July fireworks...perfect. The salad was refreshing...and of course the cheese cake...awesome...\n\nRemember, this is a family owned and operated small business, doing their best to share some great Italian food. Give them some of your support, you will be pleased. :-)
