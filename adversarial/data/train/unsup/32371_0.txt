My husband and I have been to this restaurant several times and have almost always been happy with the food.  The steaks are always cooked to perfection, the cheese curds are yummy and their house peppercorn ranch dressing is,delightful.  My husband always orders this chicken pasta dish they have and he really loves it.  The one thing I have started to notice is that the service is not always up to par with what you'd like it to be for this class of a restaurant.  When they are seating large parties, they still assign those wait staff members normal small tables and heaven help you if you are sitting at one of those small tables.  Last time we couldn't get bread, we couldn't get our drink order taken and our regular order was not taken till 25 minutes after we were seated.  In their defense they were very busy, but I was irked because we had a reservation and because there were many other servers and the greeter walking by us and could see we had no bread or drinks and yet no one would help us.  I think the servers should be more helpful to each other, but maybe they have a policy against it? Not sure, but I really think this place could benefit from assistant waiters whose sole job is to deliver bread, drinks and extra condiments, etc. to ensure the meal experience is a great one.  We love to frequent the Triple George steakhouse in Las Vegas, and they have the assistant waiters and I tell you that it elevates the dining experience from good to exquisite.\n\nThat being said, I will still go back.  As I said, the food and the ambience really just make this a wonderful dining experience and our family all really loves this place!  \n\nThe desserts are awesome, as another review said, I do advise refraining from the appetizer so you can save room for the fantastic and delectable ever changing desserts!
