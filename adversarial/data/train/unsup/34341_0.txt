This is my first visit to Yardbird.  This is an amazing restaurant.  We had the fried chicken and waffles and the shrimp and grits, don't know which one was bettter!  The drinks are perfect, the food is delicious and the atmosphere is warm and welcoming.  Our server, Christina was the absolute best.  She was attentive,  knowledgeable about the menu and how the food was prepared, and just all around an amazing representative of the restaurant.  The Chef came to our table to chat for a hot second. .. she was very nice.  Definitely coming back here every time I visit Vegas!  Thank you Christina!!!
