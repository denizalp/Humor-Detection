I have been to many nail salons in the GTA, but have never had an experience as horrible as the day I attempted to get my acrylic nails removed NAILSENSE last July. I had called in ahead of time asking if I could drop in to have them removed and they assured me it could be done. I had to pay for parking and they made me wait only to tell me they could not do it, despite what I was told over the phone. I felt judged by the workers here eyeing me up and down and they made quite a scene out of this apparent \"miscommunication\", embarrassing me in front of all the other customers and sending me away without an apology. All in all, would not recommend this salon due to their appalling customer service.
