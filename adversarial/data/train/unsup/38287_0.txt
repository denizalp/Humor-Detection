Great building and scenery!  I love the inside but the lighting is really dim. My girlfriend and I both ordered pasta and it was delicious. Our server was very nice but a little too nice. She acted fake a lot of the time. Moving forward I also got the Oreo cheesecake it was so tasty! I recommend coming here!!!!!
