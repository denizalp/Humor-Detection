I literally just left and when I was given my order at the drive thru I asked for their pickled carrots and was told I should have told her before because she was now busy with the next order....WOW great customer service guys! Never I have I ever been told no at a restaurant. I mean we're paying for the food! It's not free. She even hesitated and looked bothered! That's what you're there for, hon! It's not like there was 20 cars in line it was just 2.
