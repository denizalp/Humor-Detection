The pharmacist at this Walgreens is extremely rude and unprofessional. She was trying to play doctor and she is not a doctor she is a fucking pharmacist.  This women had the audacity to question my family's intent and our doctors education. We have been loyal customers of Walgreens for 15 YEARS!!! I understand their policies and we weren't asking them for special treatment. We were merely asking if it would be possible to get a certain prescription on a certain day because of the holidays. She questions our doctors integrity who has also been our family doctor for 15 years! We usually use a different Walgreens and the reason we were using this location was because the other one didn't have our prescription in stock so they referred us to them. Our other Walgreens knows us by name and they are all very sweet. This pharmacist then begins to insult the other location to us (the CUSTOMER). She also says that our doctor who has been prescribing the same thing for the 15 years is wrong and he shouldn't be prescribing that to us. She said that wouldn't fill our prescription. Feeling so insulted we then proceeded to call the corporate office and they said they would have someone call us that was in our district. They still have not returned our call. Overall i think that this pharmacist should have some repercussions for her attempt to \"play god\".
