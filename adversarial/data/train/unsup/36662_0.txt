The buffet experience is one of the reasons why you go to Vegas and Bellagio satisfies that craving... somewhat.  For meat eaters, your taste buds can dance as they have an array of meats, ranging from salmon to veal.  While their prime rib is not quite as good as Mandalay Bay's, their kobe beef is very delicious.  They also have beef wellington, which is rare.  Their specialty, I believe, is the dessert bar.  They have creme brulee, which is my favorite and they don't disappoint.  I couldn't help myself and had about 3 of those.
