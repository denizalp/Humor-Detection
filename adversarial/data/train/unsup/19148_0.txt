Racist or classist? You decide.\n\nMy boyfriend bought me a groupon here as a gift. My Abuelita (grandma) passed away 2 days before my birthday so getting away to be pampered was going to be well deserved... I was beyond excited for my first blow out! I was already planning on purchasing a membership during my visit and thinking about all the loved ones I could treat here.\n\nNow, I have heard of unpleasant service being common when you take advantage of a groupon offer, but I knew I was going to tip my hair dresser generously to make up for that.\n\nI check in, and while I'm seated and checking out the cute decor, I catch the disappointed look on my hairdressers face when he was told who he would be servicing that day....\n\nNot comforting to say the least, but I think past it because I'm out of my comfort zone and I want to enjoy my day.\n\nI was the odd one out. I'm treating myself for my birthday, not just a normal for funs and a glam day - I wish. And I don't have blonde hair and blue eyes like all of the other women being serviced that day, and my hair is dark, thick, and long. It defines me and my heritage.\n\nHe was obviously upset because he had to take the groupon girl with the nerve to show up with this much hair!\n\nI chose the cosmo and it turned out luscious, my hair had so much body and bounce.\nHowever, I wasn't spoken to the. entire. time.\n\nWhile the chairs filled up next to me, every white woman was offered complimentary drinks and I believe sweet snacks as well. Every one of those hairdressers made small talk and laughed away with their clients while I sat in a chair on my birthday - lonely - while a stranger unhappily did my hair. Inevitably my thoughts would drift to my Abuelita and I'd have to fight back the tears. Worst birthday of my life.\n\nI kept a smile on my face for a good while. I was never asked one question (besides what I want done to my hair,) and when I would bring up conversation, I was met with short replies. All of it was very rushed and the girl next to me got 2 dutch braids and we finished around the same time.\n\nChecking out, I was tempted to not tip at all but that is just not the kind of person I am. I kept my word on my generous tip. I did not purchase a membership after all.\n\nI enjoyed my hairstyle and eavesdropping on all the other friendly hair dressers but I can't say for sure that they wouldn't treat me, an obviously thrifty latina woman, the same way - before seeing that generous tip.\n\n0\/10 Would never recommend unless they are the last place on earth to get a blow out.\n\n\nUPDATE***** I posted this same review on Drybar FB page... A bunch of people started commenting on it and db asked that I DM them my info... I did so and all they did was add me to their email marketing list.. WTF!!\nI go and check for the review today and DryBar deleted it!!! Since you can't post reviews and it was just a post on their page.. Wow. I just feel so let down.\nI will be contacting the info they dropped here below, will update afterwards.
