A very disappointing experience. My stylist was chatting the stylist beside her for the whole duration of my hair cut. Using inappropriate language and my 11 yo daughter was getting her hair done in the chair beside. My stylist addmitted that she was too tired to even wash her hair that day and decided to just wear her track pants.I could tell and would prefer to get my hair done by someone who takes the time to do their own hair.  I felt uncomfortable when the receptionist continued to bad mouth a client after she left the salon. A very unprofessional establishment. How was my haircut? Meh?? And more expensive than Valentino's.\nI'll stick with Valentino's in Whitby!
