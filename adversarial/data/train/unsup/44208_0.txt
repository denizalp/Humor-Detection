I'm no where near being a vegan, but I stopped in with some true vegan regulars. I ordered one of their burgers that was made with garbanzo beans, spices and vegan-mayo and a side of fries. The burger and fries were delicious (couldn't even tell fries were not fried in animal fat). Most importantly, everyone walked away totally stuffed (this is important for us meat eaters). \n\nThe only problem I had was there seemed to be something missing about the burger. Its really only sauce and patti. Even if it was a meat pattii it wouldn't be right. It needs a little something more so that Its not just a simple flavor.
