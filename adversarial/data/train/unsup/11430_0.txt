Fact. This is the best sushi in Arizona. \n\nOk, I can't back that up because I haven't been to every Sushi restaurant, but I have had the pleasure of dining at fantastic spots around the country (coastal cities) and this one is solid stuff! \n\nI never really understood why Sushi restaurants existed in places like Arizona, Utah, or any other state that is not California or New York. \n\nHere is why Toyoma rocks my socks:\n\n--FRESH fish.\n--Chef\/Owner handles your stuff.\n--Crazy Unagi Roll--The Unagi was absolutely divine!\n--Sashimi Platter--Holy balls. The fish was not warm, and the fragrance reminded me of my favorite sushi joint in LA Katsu-Ya (the original location in Studio City).\n--Mo and Giro are super sweet and know how to treat their guests\n--The pièce de résistance? Random selections provided by the chef. I had this Hamachi sashimi which seemed nothing less of a religious experience. So smooth, and like butter. My God.\n\nI am definitely coming back here. This is the perfect restaurant if you love Sushi.\n\nA little on the pricy side, but who cares? It's worth it.
