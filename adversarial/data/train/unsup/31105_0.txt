Alchemy never disappoints.  From a ever changing beer menu to their very solid menu (heavy on the sandwiches), Alchemy fires on all cylinders.  Be forewarned...it is not a huge place so it fills up quickly and they don't accept credit cards (but there is an ATM onsite).\nLast Saturday, I started off with the sweet potato fries.  Homemade and twice fried, they were absolutely delicious.  It is accompanied by two different sauces for your dipping pleasure-one a tarragon mayo, the other a jalapeno-blackberry jam.  On their own or together, they rock.\nMy entree was the Tinhouse Smokeshack Burger,  A bison burger topped with smoke and carmelized onions, green peppercorn bacon, greens and muenster, the burger was ever better than the description.\n I have been there too many times to count and the consistency shines through.  Be also to try their homemade desserts as well as their daily soup and entree specials.\nOne of my go-to places...you can't go wrong!
