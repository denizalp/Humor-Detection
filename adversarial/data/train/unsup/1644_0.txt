Can i start by saying its hilarious they were checking id at the door and once inside the place is crawling with young children. You need to set boundries!! If you want drinking adults there, 2 year old children shouldnt be a drunken tripping hazard at 10pm. My husband and i got a babysitter and were excited to adult with other adults (away from children). I felt like i was at chucke cheese.\n\nBartending service sucked, took 20 mins to get a drink and it wasnt even that busy.... we went with a group of friends and he wouldnt even ask seperate bill just looped it all into one multiple times, leaving us there calculating how much on each card
