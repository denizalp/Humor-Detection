Ridiculously good. The only other kouign amann ive had is by dominique ansel in Soho in NYC. And I actually this place better. Flaky, sweet, butter, crisp. We also ordered some of their croissants. All were good.  So im by no means an expert of what the kouign amann is supposed to be.  This has an open bakery in the background where u can see their bakers hard at work
