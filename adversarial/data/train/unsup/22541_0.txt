Holy MaryJoseph&Jesus!! One of the best foods I have had in my 23 years of life. EVER.  I am utterly smitten and involved in a whirlwind infatuation with their TUNA MELT! \n\nSee here, I'm super picky with sandwiches, and find myself over them by the 3rd bite. But with this hunk of morsels, I didn't want the love to end, especially since unrequited love is hard to swallow!\n\nThe succulent Albacore tuna (w\/no fishy smell) is so fluffy as it's bathed in rich mayo, melted w\/savory swiss cheese, and built between a fresh, buttery artisan loaf.  Tastes exquisite even after a 4 hour drive, fridged for 10 hours, and re-heated. It will make you CRY.\n\nI'm usually not into tuna melts, but Earl has clearly converted me into a total committed lover!
