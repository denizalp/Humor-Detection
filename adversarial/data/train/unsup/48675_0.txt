I live within 10 minutes of this restaurant and was excited to hear a restaurant like this was opening near me. I had high hopes. However I was extremely disappointed. It took the staff 10 minutes after seating us to get me and my mother 2 glasses of water we ordered upon being seated. Our alcoholic drinks even came before the water. We order the shrimp and again were disappointed to find the shrimp were tiny and not much better than what you can buy at Vonns. We also orders the foie gras Benedict and steak and eggs. They were alright in taste, but it took extremely long for them to come out, about 20 minutes after the shrimp for the foie gras Benedict and 30 minutes for the steak and eggs. When the steak and eggs came out they originally gave it to the wrong table and they cooked the eggs incorrectly. We ordered over medium and they came over easy. As it seemed the food takes a long time to cook, so we ordered the strawberry champagne pancakes while still eating and the waiter assured us it will be quick. This was not the case and after another 30 minutes we cancelled the order. The owner saw that we were unpleased and came to talk to us. As she was talking to us the pancakes came out, probably due to confusion on the staff. Instead of just giving us the $8.00 pancakes the owner told the waiter to take it back after already presenting it to us. Giving us the pancakes for free after enduring the mediocre brunch could have made up for the bad service but the owner did not.
