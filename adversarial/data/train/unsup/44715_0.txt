top-notch, well stylized rooms, relatively new furniture, etc.  Zero complaints in three days (well, a minor tiffle regarding an airport shuttle, but in the long run, James took care of all the issues.)  Good for kids, nice pool, with hot tub and slide.  Pretty ordinary work out room.  \n\nWas checked in by Dee who was wonderful (maramang salamat) and the rest of the staff was great.  Honest, too--recommended a place outside the hotel even with competing food interests in the hotel.\n\nWalk to pretty much everything; 3 minutes to a theatre, 2 to drinks, 2 minutes to a wonderful walk throughout Calgary.\n\nNothing wrong with this place and almost everything perfect.
