I've enjoyed every meal i've had here and can't leave without getting the grilled meats and Chimichurri. Don't expect a fancy atmosphere as in most places here in Vegas. Feels like im in SF, a whole in the wall deli, family owned with some tasty food.  Haven't tried there sandwiches yet but the Lomito sounds delicous. The empanadas were good but not the best i've had.
