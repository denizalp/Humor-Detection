Based on recent reviews, I gave Sicili's a try - and was pleased.\n\nI had $5 lunch special - 1 personal pizza, which includes 1 topping and 1 drink. \nWhen I mentioned to fellow who makes the pizza that he didn't sound Sicilian, he joked I should try the pizza first, which I did:  thin crust, chewy cheese with mushrooms that was just right.\n\nYuri (right, Russian) and his family have been owners for about 5 years.   He learned his craft well.   (I asked Yuri about Russia and  Putin, but  Yuri probably thought this wouldn't be good for business.  I'll ask again.)\n\nThe reason they don't keep slices ready is because most of their business is either pickup ( or delivery) and he'd rather cook it fresh, not reheated.   But the pizza I ordered really was ready quickly, ~5 minutes.\n\nSicili's is small, simple, storefront, in a strip mall and probably most of their business are locals who order and then  pickup (or delivery to hotels, I image).   There are 3 small tables, so I had no problem eating-in. \n\n[Actually, I  took the CX bus, which runs between downtown and UNLV, and then walked ~10 minutes to Sicili's.   But I admit the location is 'close' but not the Strip, not UNLV, not downtown.   It is a 2-3  minutes walk east of Hughes Corporate Center, which itself  is just east of the Wynn and the Strip, and I could see the monorail (closest stop?)    ]\n\nOn the walk back to the CX bus,  I had the nagging feeling I should have ordered a second one,  to go.    Next time.\n\nFor those who care, I checked here too (http:\/\/www.cchd.org\/restaurants\/inspections.php)\n all As.
