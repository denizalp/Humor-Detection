We went to Roy's to use our $25 dining credit and before we ordered we asked if we spend the pre-requisite  $50 even if it was for happy hour items can we apply the dining credit and the server said yes. But he didn't seem familiar with the promotion. We had a good meal at the bar, the bartender was pleasant but when we wanted to use our dining credit, the same server said we can't use it. I looked him straight in the eye and said, i specifically asked you about happy hour and you said yes. He called the manager over and he let us but explained that happy hour would be considered to be promotion but they'll honor it this time. Suggestions to mgmt: train your people on what you offer or all of the money you spent on marketing just went to waste and be very specific on what's excluded when you have a promotion.
