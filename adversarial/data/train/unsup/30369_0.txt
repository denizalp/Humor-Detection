Asian hot bar!  Still undergoing it's renovations, but already an inspiring update to my neighborhood HT.  The Starbucks branch inside is impressive and way bigger than I anticipated.  Clean new design and brighter lighting with wine tasting or eat in area not that we have pizza and hot bars, too.  Must hit the breakfast bar soon!  \n\nI am so a regular here for prepared meals, and sushi that the sushi chefs always know me now!  Hope the Kroger buy means the chain won't suffer from a fall in quality.  Wait and see...
