Situated in front of the Showtime Carwash, I had driven by this taco stand several times a week for the last month.  I am not sure exactly when they're open but definitely on Friday and Saturday nights.   \n\nAfter subpar al pastor tacos a few days before, this was a must check out.  You're clearly able to see the gigantic spit of al pastor even going by at 50 mph.  It's almost as if time stands still and you hear voices singing from the heavens!  Not really but it looked pretty fucking good.\n\nThere were 6 people in front of us with a few waiting for their orders but the cooks churned out the stuff pretty quick.  Most tacos were a $1.50 but we splurged (wink) for another 50 cents and got 2 lengua tacos along with 4 al pastor and 2 carne asada.   I was immediately psyched when the guy taking our order asked if we wanted pineapple with our pastor.  Yes.  Yes we would.  \n\nThey also offered quesadillas and burritos but we were in total taco mode.  I was impressed with the condiments they offered including 3 salsas (mild green, really spicy dark green and mild red pepper cream), very spicy onions (awesome), chopped raw onions, cilantro and radish.  They also offered grilled onions and whole jalapenos which were also free.  Most customers chose to stand and eat but we bagged everything up and ate at home.\n\nThe pastor was pretty good but not the best I've had.  The carne asada and lengua were very solid too.  We actually contemplated driving back to get a couple of more tacos. Definitely will be back.  Maybe we'll bring lawn chairs and a six pack of beer next time!  I hope they stick around.
