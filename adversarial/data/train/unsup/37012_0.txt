This isn't a bad spot if you want decent Chinese, don't want to overpay and don't want to wait hours to complete dinner service. Some of the dishes didn't hold up to other options we have back home (mushu chicken, Shanghai noodles) but the won ton soup, steamed won tons and Mongolian beef were very good. I'd come back if I was traveling here alone, but likely wouldn't make it a location for dinner otherwise.
