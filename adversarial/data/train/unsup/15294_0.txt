If they put half as much effort into the food as they did the decor then this would be 5 stars.\nSuch a pretty, pretty, empty place. A mega casino brunch buffet more than $30 with no line to get in is a sign to stay away.\nWe were kindly treated to Saturday brunch by our new South Bay elite friend on yelp Spring Break. 5 stars for him and his generosity. No one could have predicated that this elegant looking buffet would be this bad. \nWe took a fly over to see take in the variety...or lack thereof. Nothing adventurous, exotic, luxurious. Meat, eggs, pastries, corn beef hash. I was thinking that since Aria costs as much as the Bellagio buffet, that it would be comparable as in terms of fancy foods. Nope. Aria's unadventurous variety is on par with the Circus Circus Buffet.  \nThe food was basic in terms of preparation There was not one wow dish. Our friend had an omelette. Eggs are a test of a chef's technique. Will the egg be bright yellow, or burned and browned? The egg was brown....severely overcooked. \nService was impersonal and not friendly. They were kind of like robots. We opted in for the $6 bottomless bloody mary's. The drinks were clearly printed on our receipt that was placed on the table for our server. After we came back from our first trek for food, we had no drinks. Our server had to ask us what we wanted. Let us unlock the mystery....Bloody Marys?\nFor this $32 price point ,the Aria has to provide more in terms of variety, technique, quality, and service. The one saving grace from 1 star is the fancy architecture and decor and we were treated by our new friend. \nI am a buffet aficionado and I know I will not be coming back here. Save your $32 brunch buffets for Bellagio, Wynn, and M Resort.
