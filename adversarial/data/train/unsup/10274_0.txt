Bonjour mes amies! \n\nThis hotel is perfectly located within walking distance to shopping and is right on the edge of Old Montreal. Parfait for a luxurious night's sleep. Admittedly, we didn't spend much time in the hotel, and the time we did spend here was pretty much drunkenly walking through the lobby and going straight to bed. \n\nI do remember that the decor is art-centric, and most of it is pretty lovely. The staff is super friendly and the rooms are huge, colourful and come with everything you could need. I'm a big fan of hotel rooms that aren't trying to be modern-chic and house real wooden furniture, and this place suits my taste juuuust fine.\n\nMy only complaint is that the elevator is small, old and gave me the willies.
