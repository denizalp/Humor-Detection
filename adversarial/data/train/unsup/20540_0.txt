GO SEE THIS NOW!! Acrobats + Burlesque + Naughty Comedy + Cabaret +Awesome Venue! Zumanity's edgier, funnier kid brother! Never been to a show where the standing ovation was so quick, automatic and sustained!\n\nThis is the BEST show ever. Though lovely, I've gotten sleepy eyed at many Cirque shows -- but not here! Everything about this show, from the moment you walk into the beer garden to when you exit is designed to transport you to another place and time. The ambiance totally makes you forget you're in Vegas in the middle of the Strip. \n\nThe show is held in a sectioned off portion of the Caesar's Palace near Serendipity called \"Spiegelworld.\" When you're about to enter, there is no hint of what to expect beyond the gates. Once in, you're immediately struck by the Tim Burton-like set featuring a central \"tree house\" constructed from metal railings, chairs, birdcages and a spiral staircase. The string lights add a whimsical, carnival-like feel. Dotted around the grounds are various tables and chairs made from various odds and ends like bathtubs and wooden crates. This area is called the beer garden.\n\nWhen we entered there was already a line even though we arrived 30 minutes early. From my understanding, all seats are general admission. Even though we were near the end of the line, we got fabulous seats only 3 rows from the stage and didn't miss out on getting some great beer.\n\nFor anyone who has ever seen Cabaret the musical, this show will be totally up your alley. Cabaret has the Emcee; Absinthe has it's Gazillionaire. He's really the driving force behind the feel of the show. He's kitschy, naughty, hilarious and has incredible chemistry with his assistant Penny.\n\nThe performances are fantastic. Of particular magnificence were the skating duo (amazing!), the strong men acts and the parody-performance by the Gazillionaire and Penny.    \n\nThough we got same day tickets at the 1\/2 price vendors, the show was so good I would have gladly paid double. Shows are Tuesday to Sunday, dark on Mondays.
