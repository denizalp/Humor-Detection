This place is delicious!!!! My husband and I had jalape√±o chicken and beef with broccoli. Both dishes were made fresh to order and tasted amazing. Great value lunch spot because the prices are unbeatable. The waiter was a very attentive and pleasant man who constantly kept our drinks refilled. I dropped my fork on the floor and he immediately came and offered me a clean one. I will definitely have lunch here again before leaving town :)
