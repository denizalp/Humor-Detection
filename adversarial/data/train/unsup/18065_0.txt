I needed to dispose of some prescription medicine.  After a search online, I learned that all Metro substations will accept medications.  Since I needed to be near Ann Road for a volunteer project today, I decided to stop on my way home.\n\nI went to the window to sign in and when the woman went to help me, she showed me a green machine in the southeast corner of the building.  You empty the bottles into a mailbox kind of opening.  No bottles or caps go with the medication.  \n\nIn a brief time, I was on my way out.  The woman waved to me as I left.  Very convenient way of disposing medications no longer needed.  I don't think it's necessary to sign in if all you're doing is what I did today.
