Read my last review on this place before you read this, then compare. \n\nOnce again like in years past, the workers were having some kind of altercation with each other when I got there after midnight. \n\nLike usual the host lady had her back turned and pretended she couldn't see us waiting. She and the other host lady have been doing this for over 2 years. This time I asked the server why that lady always ignores us. He actually explained that she does in fact ignore guests intentionally and that she is just a very jaded and angry worker. \n\nI'm one of those guys who write detailed assessments of food, for example I might say: \"The quality and attention the chef put into perfecting the filet to a juicy medium-rare was impressive and well represented the integrity of this restaurant\". But really, the only thing I can say about Grand Cafe is that the \"FOOD TASTED LIKE SHIT\"\n\nIf it's not bad enough that the clientele here are usually extremely drunk and shouting disgusting and stupid things, the food takes about 30-40 minutes to come out so you have to sit there the whole time and endure that shit. And most the time, the customers leave after about 20 minutes. I recommend not coming here anymore, even if you are at Santa Fe Station. Read my review of the Fatburger here at Santa Fe....I would still rather endure the service over there than eat at Grand Cafe. There are so many local 24 hour gaming bars around town that serve exceptional food and have great service and low prices. Just go there instead.
