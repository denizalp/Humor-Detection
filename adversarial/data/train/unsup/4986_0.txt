Okay super yummy.  Don't worry about only being served cakes because they have the bundlets serving sizes here too.  It's all up to you on which flavor you prefer, my personal favorite is the white chocolate raspberry and double chocolate on top of chocolate.  The staff here isn't like the location in the southwest, it's funny when the female serving you is covered in hickey's.  But you know what though, keep making these delicious cakes.
