Me and my boyfriend were craving some Chinese food, so I yelped the closest location with the best reviews. This one popped up and I'm glad it did. I never really expect too much going to a hole in the wall Chinese restaurant, but this place was good.\n\nWe ordered the cream cheese wontons for an appetizer. They came out fast and were fresh! Also, was a big serving.\n\nWe came during lunch so we received egg drop soup before our meal as well.\n\nI had the sesame chicken while my boyfriend had the orange chicken. Both were tasty! And again came with a lot of food. Lot of the chicken, fried rice, an egg roll, and two wontons.\n\nLots of good food and a check of $20. Yes please! \nGood place if you're hungry and on a budget.
