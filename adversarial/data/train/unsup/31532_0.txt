I recently had my bathroom remodeled by Holtzman.  They did an excellent job.  Johnny the residential designer arrived on time to inspect the area, and put together a design per my plans.  A visit to their showroom allowed me to view my design along with choosing from a variety of products.  All of their contractors are personable, professional, and were able to work around my busy schedule.  Brandon and Judy have impeccable follow up.  I would highly recommend for any remodel.
