Moved from AZ to FL.  Paid North American Beltmann Group 9000$ to pack and move our items.  Contract states deliver between 7\/1 and 7\/5(with me choosing date).  North American delivered our items 17days late.  We did not get our household until the 18th of July!  My family was forced to live in a single bedroom we rented, my baby slept in a pack and play.  \nNorth American also lost several items.  We received the PS3 box, but when you opened the box, the console was missing.  They lost a comforter, art, a doll, ribbons and awards.  Not to mention the broken items. We purchased MVP protection which states it will repair\/replace\/reimburse damaged and missing items.  \nNorth American has not reimbursed us for anything.  I just received a letter today stating they will no reimburse us our missing items. They will not honor their own contract.
