I haven't been to River Cafe in years, so when a couple out of town guests suggested we go here for brunch I didn't object.\n\nLucky for us, the weather was nice so it literally was a \"walk in the park\" to get to the restaurant lol\n\nIt was quite busy but they had no troubles accommodating our large reso. Coffee and teas were poured, specials were read to us and orders were promptly taken. I love a good eggs benny and I wanted to try their bison bacon so that's what I settled on for brunch.\n\nEveryone's food looked amazing, and I had a bite of my friend's brioche french toast which had the perfect amount of sweetness to it (white chocolate creme fraiche!) \n\nBison bacon is not as fatty as regular bacon, but it's definitely up there for savory flavor! And they didn't go with the usual english muffin, a fluffy biscuit soaked up the eggy and saucy goodness and brought the dish to a whole other level!\n\nA brunch place that takes resos and serves quality food? Hard to come by in Calgary, but if you find it (River Cafe people!), take advantage of it!
