This was my first time to claim jumpers in years and it will be my last. They have a gluten free menu which I was thrilled to see since my kids and I can't eat gluten.  I ordered a plain burger with nothing on it but a gluten free bun. It came with fries. My kids had gluten free pasta which also came with fries. My order came out and the burger had pickles and mayo on it. My moms calamari was soggy. The waitress apologized and took both back. \n\nMy second burger came out but was on a gluten bun. By the third burger, a person who I assume was the manager (she never said), brought it out and informs me the fries have flour sprinkled on them so they aren't gluten free. At this point I had been eating my kids fries for 10 minutes. I couldn't figure out why fries would be offered with two orders that I specifically stated need to be gluten free. The manager wasn't very apologetic. She brought me a potato and left. \n\nWhen we tried to order ice cream for my girls the waitress said they weren't sure if the ice cream had gluten in it and they had no ingredient list. Normally I wouldn't think ice cream has gluten but who would have thought fries would have it sprinkled on. When the bill came I thought my burger might have been comped after all the issues we had but it was not. We definitely won't be back.
