Lana is the BEST! \n\nI got my wedding dress as a sample and it was a bit shorter than I would like, plus had some tearing on the lace detail. Not only did she manage to fix all these issues (and making it longer is much harder than making it shorter), but she also had creative solutions to improve the dress!\nShe truly knows what she is doing! I trusted her with my beautiful gown, and I recommend her for anyone who truly cares about quality tailoring! \n\nThank you, Lana, again! You are amazing!!!
