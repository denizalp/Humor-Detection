Best place to go when you have friends with you!  I told my girlfriend I knew of a place that has exceptional service to get Pedicures done. Very reasonably priced, detox was only $10 more and I needed it.  This was so much fun here, the owner is very hard worker.  She is welcoming and will make you feel so relaxed in her care.  She is always gentle and I trust her with my toenails.\n\nThis visit was just what I needed.  I felt so refreshed after the detox and I had more energy!
