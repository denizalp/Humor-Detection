Ambiance: 4\/5\n\nBeautiful settings and great ambiance. From the moment we walked in we were greeted by the host.  There was a gentleman playing an acordeon and  singing around tables. He lead the crowd to sing along Italian songs and clap.   The theme of the restaurant's decor was right on for the name of their restaurant \"Pirate\". We felt we were in some old historical ship.  The clientele was a much older crowd that night. Average mid 40s and plus but it was very lively. \n\n\nService:5\/5\nThough it was a very busy night, the young server was very polite and ensured we had everything we needed.  They were definitely understaffed. He was the host, server and the one answering the phone!  With all of these responsibilities, our server did it with a smile. \n\nFood: 3\/5 (overall)\n\nServing bread (2\/5)\nLike the other reviewer, I was very disappointed in their commercial bread they serve at the beginning.   It was dry and cold. \n\nAppetizers: 2\/5\nThe calamari was served with a lemon wedge only! When asked if they forgot to bring the sauce to dip in, the server said well I can bring you the marinara sauce ( I hope so) . The calamari was lightly breaded and not over cooked. It was just ok, nothing out of the ordinary. Did not like the marina sauce he brought in a soup bowl size! \n\nThe escargots in the garlic butter was just ok as well. This appetizer fell flat because the bread should be highlighting this dish. \n\nMain dishes:3\/5\nSeafood linguine- the ingredients were very fresh. However I felt the tomato sauce lacked some richness and the flavour tasted just one note. I added a lot of black peppers to bring up a little flavour. My partner ordered the lasagna.  I can't comment since it didn't try it.
