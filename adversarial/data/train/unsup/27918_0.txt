They close at 10pm and it's technically not a bar, but a tasting room. So, they only serve drinks using their alcohol. It's a great place for big and small groups. You can sit in or out for a different experience; both equally great! The staff is very good. I love how laid back it is and my only complaint is why I don't get to go as often as I would like :) One caveat, there's no food besides chips and small cheese and meat platter available (from Underground Kitchen).
