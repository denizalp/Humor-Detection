Shaina is just amazing. She is so friendly and professional, not to mention efficient- I got a Brazilian done a week ago and it was quick, easy, and almost PAINLESS! (I used the \"Relax and Wax, No Scream Cream\"she sells there, before I did my Brazilian and I'm telling you right now.. this product WORKS!! If you don't like pain.. then I definitely encourage you to buy this cream.) I've done my eyebrows, underarms and Brazilian with her for almost 3 years now and have gotten nothing but GREAT service and results. The staff is always so nice and courteous.They are very flexible with appointments and always try to accommodate to your schedule. The boutique itself is absolutely BEAUTIFUL; it's very well decorated and clean.  Highly, HIGHLY recommend you to come here :-)
