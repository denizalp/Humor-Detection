I was surprised to find this boba shop inside the Tomo Noodles & Dumplings restaurant. My first impression was that this is an afterthought boba shop since the menu was limited. The menu didn't offer much variety with teas or toppings; no grass jelly, no crystal boba, no sea salt either. They do get credit for offering the split cup option which is great if you have a hard time deciding on one flavor. But honestly, I was not satisfied with the 3 tea flavors we tried. We tried Matcha, Honey Black Tea and Jasmine Milk Tea and they all tasted watered down like they have been sitting in a pitcher with ice all day, just melting the flavor away.\n\nCustomer service was great and they were willing to change my drink since I didn't enjoy it, but the remake was worst than the first. It's just way too watered down for me. Not enjoyable at all. As the ice melted it just got pointless to drink. \n\nI left in a bad mood and I didn't feel like dealing with another remake. I already knew they are all going to taste the same, since the 3 I tried all had the similar watered down soapy taste. The boba texture and flavor is off-putting as well, it lacked the slightly sweet bite and chew that I am so use to. \n\nThere are far too many great boba shops in town that pride in their tea flavors, variety and toppings for me to ever come back to this place. It pains me to say this, but meh I've had better.
