I go to this shop because of their professionalism and family style craftsmanship that is slowly leaving the Barber trade due to facades for fronts of other alternative business, Egos, and Quantity.  Ace of Fades offer Quality with a safe environment to bring your infant child or your elderly mother to wait while you get a cut. I have watched the proprietor build his business from ground up and he prides himself on customer satisfaction and as we all know a new venture has its growing pains.  If at anytime there is an issue, the owner will address it with professionalism and takes ownership thus rectifying any challenging situation.  Ace of Fades is a premier Executive Barbershop and I strongly recommend getting a haircut there.  Keep up the great work!!!
