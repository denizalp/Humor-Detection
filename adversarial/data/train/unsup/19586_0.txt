I have mixed feelings about this buffet, but I'll most likely try another place on my next trip to Vegas.\n\nThe selection is much smaller than I expected, and quite honestly, it reminded me of a very upscale Hometown Buffet. Don't get me wrong: they have some gourmet items here, like a variety of meats and a nice offering of seafood, but nothing to get overly excited about. Except maybe the macarons.\n\nSurprisingly, this buffet's seafood selection was close to awesome. I usually avoid eating seafood when visiting landlocked states, but everything was great! Loved the miso-marinated bluefin - it was fork-tender, if a little undercooked. Their spinach salmon was tasty, as was their spicy tuna poke and crab legs. \n\nTheir meats, however, made me a bit sad. I'm a wimp and prefer my steak medium...and if I'm feeling particularly savage, medium rare at best. Everything here was moo-rare: the prime rib, the kobe, the flank steak...Nothing says \"yum\" like a river of blood flooding the rest of your food! My asparagus, broccolini, and mushrooms were probably tasty, except I couldn't really discern any flavor other than blood. Nice.\n\nMoving along. Their desserts were all delicious and beautifully presented. Le macarons, creme brulee, sorbet, and chocolate dome cake were all fantastic. If this place were renamed \"The Dessert Buffet At Bellagio\", I'd give it a standing ovation worthy of Celine Dion. Alas, the hefty dinner price doesn't justify an awesome dessert assortment and \"just okay\" food.
