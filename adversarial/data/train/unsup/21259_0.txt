Just got a take out order from here and was thoroughly  shocked as to how this place has good reviews. First off we called in our order and was confused as to how a pizza place only has one size pizza?! Whatever it's only two of us and not a big deal, but then the lady on the phone says it will be done in 5 minutes?! This is where the red flags start flying. I don't understand how it's fresh made to order in 5 minutes, but whatever we will give it a chance. So we get there 6 minutes after we called, and there is our pizza just on the counter already in a box with nothing keeping it warm. Still we think let's just try it. So we open the box and we are met with one of the greasiest pizzas I have ever seen. I picked up a slice and all of the toppings just slipped off and revealed a nice underdone crust. Still I took a bite and was overwhelmed by the amount of basil and a very generic sauce with really no flavor. I don't know how this place can call itself a pizzeria and serve me this disgrace.
