UPDATE 8\/21\/15\n\nThe owner has reached out to me on Yelp and personally apologized and invited me back. I think that is very classy and shows they truly care about providing good service. I will update my review after I nosh on their fresh food and sip on their fresh juice.\n\nI was impressed with their timeliness of their response and their invitation to have me back and do it right. Everyone deserves a chance to make it right.. I'm a happy camper. Stay tuned... \n\n______________________________________________\n\n8\/20\/15\nMy homie and I popped in here to give em' a whirl. We attempted to place an order and were told they didn't offer their soup yet (listed on the menu but not offered) and the salad I wanted was waiting on toasted chickpeas. I inquired about a timeframe and she said it'd be five minutes and they'd call us up. \n\nOk... Not good.. Not bad... We opted to wait. Well... we waited... waited... and waited some more... 20 mins later the girl we spoke with disappeared and they now had a line with what appeared to be a disorganized staff. We ended up leaving due to the time crunch. What a bummer. \n\nThey're clearly having the opening blues. I don't want to rip them a new one (hence the 3 stars vs 2 or 1). But I really wish there would have been some sort of \"I'm sorry\" or \"we apologize for your wait\" prior to our departure. We were simply ignored an overlooked. My hungry turned into 'hangry' and we were out of there.  It stinks that we waited there for 20 mins just to leave empty handed on empty stomachs.  Ugh.. makes me hangry just thinking about it. \n\nI will still give them the benefit of the doubt being brand spankin' new.  I gave them 1-2 stars for utterly crummy service and 1 additional star for convenient location and nice ambiance. Hopefully, I won't experience the same fiasco if I opt to visit them again. #ignored&hangry
