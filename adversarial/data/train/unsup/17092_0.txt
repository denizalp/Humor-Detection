I found it or maybe it found me. I don't know, but this store gives me a girl boner.\n\n$8- $15 scarfs that I actually like. \n\n$15-$30 unique and very stylish purses and bags that could pass as vintage.\n\nOH WAIT. I was only writing for the women and my girly men. Here's for the men who actually have a say in what their homes look like (and the women, too).\n\nFabulous home accents. Don't go by the sticker price. Everything in the store that can not be worn is an additional 20% off. I did not see one item damaged or As\/Is either. This stuff is cute! I LOVED the varieties of trays, wall decorations and accent tables. Really sharp. They get most or all of their items from the World Market Center. They have that unique piece you are looking for.... It's huge inside so don't just go to the right. \n\nNext time you are in the area I HIGHLY suggest stopping by my favorite coffee shop  thirty steps away from here and then slowly browsing through this store for anything that you may or may not need. I call this sport Retail Meditation. Regardless if you buy something you still had a Namaste moment and hopefully came out of the store with something to show for it.\n\nYou ain't lost anymore. Come to this store. The Find on Sunset. Yeah. I just did that.
