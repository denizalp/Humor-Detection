Food was great! I was originally thinking about going to chipotle (cedar road location) but figured what the heck, I'll try this place out, and I'm glad I did. I ended up deciding on the pesto chicken pasta bowl. Filled me up good and hit the spot. It's a little pricey but well worth it in my opinion. Especially if you're deciding on between here and chipotle...prices are not much more. I'll definitely be back to try out the other items on the menu.\n\nThe staff and every one working here is super friendly and courteous, even when they are busy. It's refreshing :)\n\nI heard their online ordering system is good, never tried it out though. Overall this is a nice place to come with your family and\/or friends to grab a meal. Or just take out...which is what I did. Good atmosphere all around. Highly recommend!!!
