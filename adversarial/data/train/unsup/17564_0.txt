Went here with my boyfriend the other day and he got chicken fajitas and I got steak tacos. No drinks and nothing else totaled up to $23 dollars before the tip. \n\nWe sat down in the world's tightest restaurant imaginable and they brought us chips and salsa and water. The water was luke warm just like the salsa. There was enough chips to feed a small baby. As frequent Mexican food goers my boyfriend and I were expecting bottomless chips and salsa that we could smash for 10 minutes before the food came. He asked for another round of chips and salsa and they looked at us like we were nuts. \n\nThen the food came and I looked down at the meat and the first thing I saw was fatty meat that was grey. It was super gross looking. I took a bite and it was pretty delicious. However I had to spend some time picking out the gross fatty pieces. \n\nAs for coming back in the future.. not for awhile. My boyfriend and I can get Chipotle burritos with guac for that price so that is what we will most likely do. To be honest, it was disappointing since I thought it was supposed to be one of the best Mexican restaurants in the U.S..
