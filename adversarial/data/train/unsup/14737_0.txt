If you're interested in good food I'd recommend not going.  I came here with a few friends the other night to check out what all the hype was about, and we were all extremely unsatisfied and disappointed. More annoyed, really. The music was SO loud (and bad, clubby, obnoxious), our server was clueless about the menus but was very honest and nice; most importantly the food was really atrocious. \n\nCalamari was like bar\/pub fried food, the lemon soup was maybe one of the worst culinary experiences of my life (taste and texture), the oysters were foul and disgusting (both the oysters themselves and the ingredients accompanying), the edamame was salt overload and just not a good combination (supposed to have been covererd in chile and lime and just tasted gross), and our pizza (there's an option to add meatballs?!?) was subpar. \n\nWe didn't smoke a hookah and we went there after 11 pm so the menu was a little cheaper, so I can't speak of what it's like aside from that. All of us agreed, however, that we'd never go back. All around a very unpleasant experience.
