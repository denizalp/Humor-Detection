They were dispatched to one of my rental properties by American Home Shield (AHS)to look at a stackable washer\/dryer that was not working. All Desert Appliances ordered a transmission and after a few weeks without the use of a washer or dryer my tenant finally replaced the broken fan belt himself and it has been working fine ever since. I contacted AHS and notified them that they were being charged for a transmission that was not needed either through incompetence or malicious intent. I still have to pay the $100 co-pay to these for these guys to do nothing, but try to rip off AHS!!!
