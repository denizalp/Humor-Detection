The service was really bad and the food was not even good. First off, when we asked if we could be seated at the booths, the server insisted that my friend and I sit on the small table, when there was no one else there. Many of the food that we ordered never came, and they gave us less than what we ordered. The shrimp tempura was undercooked, and their food taste and look like the person who made it doesn't care. It's not worth going here, especially since there are other ayce Japanese places in Mississauga that provide better service, food, and experience for the price you pay.
