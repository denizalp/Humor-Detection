I go back and forth on this establishment - waivering between 2 and 3 stars. I'm feeling generous today, and my last visit here was decent - so 3 stars. I love Chicago dogs, and for awhile, this was the closest Chicago dog place to me. I will say that it has gotten better over the past year.\n\nThe hot dog itself is good. And they do Chicago-style right. But the ingredients aren't the best quality. The tomatoes are mushy and really thin slices, etc. The fries are ok. They're shoestring and sometimes undercooked.\n\nThe place is a little messy looking - tables not quite clean, etc. The Coke on the fountain machine is always \"out of order\". And they never seem to get my order right - though, this is usually to my advantage, giving me a free extra hot dog, etc.\n\nSo, all in all, it's alright. There are better places, but there are also worse places.
