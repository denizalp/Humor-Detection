I'm not quite sure what the deal is with all of the negative reviews.   Everyone should know that when it comes to buffets, it's all about timing.\n\nWith 50-60 different entrees at any given time, some will be near empty, or will have been on the floor too long, and will need refreshing.\n\nWe hit the buffet for dinner, and were very happy with what we saw and tasted.\n\nI made about three trips to the hot crab leg station, and encountered fresh and delicious crab legs every time. \n\nThe craving station had prime rib, turkey, and sausages with an assortment of toppings for the meat.\n\nI also tried the mexican station, featuring chicken faijitas.   The beans looked a little stale, but as I was spooning out the chicken, a fresh batch was promptly put in.\n\nThe one time I went by the Italian station, the pastas looked a little tired, but I imagine, like everything else, that they were changed out and constantly freshened up.\n\nThe service is very good, and the desserts are amazing.\n\nThe dessert bar earns an extra star for the assortments of desserts, along with the numerous toppings for the self serve ice cream.\n\nIt appears there are some campaigns against this buffet, but this one is pretty good for all the MGM resort buffets.\n\nDon't be scared off by the haters.   We almost were, but we were glad we went.
