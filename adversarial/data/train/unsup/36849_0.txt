Love this place.\nI've been living in Henderson for about 6 months now, and this recent discovery is an off-strip gem that few tourists will ever discover......and that's a shame for all fans of the genre.\nThis place is a pinball lover's paradise, and arguably houses the most comprehensive collection of pins through the ages, right up to the present, in the world.\nSprinkled in for nostalgia, are a wonderful selection of 80's vids.\nI've been 4 times, and I love it. Simply, a no frills amusement hall, that is all substance, no fluff.\n5 stars.
