This is a place you would take Grandma that requires bland imitation homestyle cooking. Nothing wrong with homestyle if done well! They also try to be too much with below average Mexican dish, like a carne asada burritos.. really? And for the 8$ they charge you would be thinking it was as good, if not better than Filbertos, but sadly, no it is not. This place if over priced for microwaved mediocre food that wants to be cracker barrel but falls short at every turn. Service is hit or miss. My son had ordered a burrito that was as big as the plate and enjoyed it, he does not have a refined palate, anyhow, he conned me into going a 2nd time and order the same breakfast burritos, it was literally 1\/4 of the size as the week before. Worse yet there table next to us ordered the same and they were regulars and guess what the burritos were humongous. So I asked the waitress if they accidentally sent my son the child size and showed her the extreme differences in sizes, she gave a weak excuse and told my son to order something else. No problem, but that same waitress 2 min. Later came and sat at the table next to us with the burrito and starting eating it. She then proceeded to call over her co-workers asking them to help her eat the huge burrito. I am not joking!  The worse part is she was not in a break she has at least 5 tables including ours and really thought she was putting me in my place. Needless to say that hole in the wall will never get a cent from me again. Furthermore, I paid for the burrito she ate!! Ha ha.
