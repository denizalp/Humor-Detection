I don't think this place is worth the price.  Sure the rooms are big and everything appears to be super clean, but the noise you can hear through the walls and the smoking on non-smoking floors kinda ruin the experience.  Some redeeming notes:  no casino (so you can get away from it) and the non-smoking restaurant.  The gym there is completely over-priced ($20\/day) given that it is about as big as a closet, but the gym's shower\/locker room are great.  Nicer than Mandalay Bay, but not all it's cracked up to be.
