This show was pretty amazing! Any classic rock fan should def catch a showing. I loved the setlist and sang along to every song. They were extremely entertaining to watch. I would definitely watch this show again the next time I'm in town. \n\nI also loved the souvenir guitar cup my bf purchased for us but they can just put water in mine next time. The drink was pretty gross.
