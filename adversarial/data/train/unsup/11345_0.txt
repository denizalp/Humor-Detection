Went here 3 times during my trip to Toronto (just because it was so close to where we were staying). Tried to order a raspberry margarita and the waitress tells me they're out of raspberry flavoring, so I asked for a mango margarita and the waitress says \"sorry, we're out of ALL frozen drinks\". I then proceeded to order a Caesar wrap for my meal and GUESS WHAT!! they were out of Caesar. The three drinks I did get at Hoops were actually pretty good so I'll give them a two star review for that, but don't even bother ordering food. The fries were dripping in grease and had no flavor. Also, the woman's bathroom here is absolutely disgusting. All the door locks were broken so I had to hold the door shut with one hand and try to do everything else with the other!! Cheap drinks is the only thing I would come here for again
