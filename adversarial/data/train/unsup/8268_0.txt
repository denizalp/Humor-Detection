I don't feel FULLY at liberty to make a full Yelp-worthy review for Mint as I was highly intoxicated on Saturday night, but I will do my best.\n\nWe met ppl here who did have bottle service, so no lines to wait (plus for me and my braced up knee!). Music was cool and had good systems. \n\nPretentious? Absolutely. Great for ppl watching? Most def. \n\nService there was great, IMO. Just not my crowd, is all. :)
