Ah yes, the pound. This is the place where you assholes bring your dog that you don't want anymore... some people even get creative and say \"Oh, I found him running along the street..\" and then they burst out in trears when they get into their car..... Or you dumbasses who say \"Oh, I just wanted her to have ONE litter.....but I can't find homes for all the puppies\" D'oh! You shouldn't be breeding unless you have a SHOW QUALITY dog and are a reputable breeder..........I could go on and on with this.....\n\nOther than that, MCACC does vaccinations, spay & neuter and dog liscensing. \n\nIf you do not plan on getting a dog from a show breeder, then you should definately check out the pound! This is where I got my 9lb Miniature Pinscher last year. He is the BEST dog I have ever owned! He's so smart, funny and cute and is overall a great dog..... (too bad he's not a guy! damn!). I got him for 60 bucks and that included all his shots and his neuter surgery.\n\nAlmost all the smaller dogs (chihuahuas and the like) are going to be more expensive, but you can get a big lovey pit bull\/mix for less than $50.00! Soooo many cute doggies at the pound too! Oh, and I believe the kitties run at about $25.00.\n\nDon't shop, adopt!
