I waited and waited paitently for IKEA to come to Charlotte and now it's here!  Pretty much grew up with an IKEA in my backyard (from Northern Virginia) so I was shocked when we moved down here and the closest IKEA was 5hrs away in Atlanta - or driving back to the roots for 7hrs.\n\nMy suspicions are that the NC traditional furniture industry were not easy to convince in getting a new competitor in a tough market, but anyways - it's here!\n\nWhen you plan on going, make sure you wear comfortable shoes and be prepared for a lot of walking.  Of course you can always take your time since the showroom has plenty of spaces to lounge in, but I don't know if the store owners would take to kindly to finding customers sprawled out on their furniture for hours at a time.\n\nI'm definitely attracted to simple, clean lines and the store really caters to that.  The price is even better too.  Compared to some sleek, modern furniture stores in the area, IKEA has them beat.  The \"do-it-yourself\" mentality also is a great feature for those that like to use their hands since most of the furniture you buy here has to be put together\/assembled by you.  It makes for easy transport in the car... and moving too since you can break down the furniture neatly (granted that there wasn't any gluing involved).\n\nTheir cafeteria\/restaurant offers some simple menu items, but the price also carries into the food!  I don't know how they are able to do it, but I will keep enjoying all the Swedish meatballs w\/ mashed potatoes and lingonberry sauce that my heart desires.
