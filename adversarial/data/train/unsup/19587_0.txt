I heard about this place several weeks ago on the news when the local water company was affecting businesses in the East End. So I decided to wait until the crisis was long over and then visit. I was able to park in permit area where you get a free hour. That is essentially all you need here.\n\nThe place is beautiful when you walk in and very tiny. They sell coffee. loose leaf teas and small baked goods. In addition I was told that they offer full floral arranging for a special event such as a wedding. All merchandise is available for sale. In addition to plants and flowers, they sell soaps, candles, high end candy bars (I was told these are not the same candy bars you find at a competitor in the Strip district), pots, pottery, and silk art to name a few.\n\nI am still wrestling with this cold so the lady suggested a tea for me to try. She recommended a mint and ginger tea to help clear my sinuses. She told me that if I have it there I get a glass pot to go with it. Cost whether you take out or enjoy it there is $3.00.\n\nAll they have are bar stools but they are a little wobbly so I would advise be careful. I looked over some of the artwork on the wall and learned that the other man who works here makes those pieces which are for sale. Outdoor seating is available but limited.\n\nThe tea was just what I needed to provide me with relief from my cold symptoms. It is located on a not too busy street so it is quite easy to miss. Still I truly enjoyed looking at all the beautiful arrangements they had and it had that calming effect when you just want to unwind and relax. Their tea is loose leaf and is also for sale.  Located midway between Lawrenceville and Bloomfield off Penn Ave it is a charming place to get away from it all.
