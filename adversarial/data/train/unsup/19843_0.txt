If you've visited the Strip any number of times, you'll notice that things are always changing; new casinos are being built, old casinos get imploded and what happens next?  If they're lucky, they might have their iconic signs memorialized at the boneyard.  \n\nThe Neon Museum offers tours every half hour throughout the day.  I found it was easiest to order tickets online since it tells you which time slots are full and I booked 2 tickets for the night show. \n\nI came here once before when it wasn't open to the public for a photography class field trip and we were able to take pictures of all the old signs for the time we were there.  \n\nThe night tour was a little different from what I was expecting (due to my field trip). You're on a tour with 10 other people and your tour guide walks you through the aisles, letting you know about the history behind the signs and Las Vegas during that period.  The tour guide was very knowledgeable and interactive, asked us a lot of questions since most of us on the tour were locals.  The only downside to the tour was that you had to keep up.  You weren't allowed to stay back too long or venture off to take pictures because it was the guided tour and not the photography tour.  \n\nSome iconic signs we saw were the Sahara, old school Tropicana sign, Stardust, and the skull from Treasure Island.  \n\nThe Neon Museum is for both locals and tourists alike. They also offer a local's discount which is great to take advantage of!  If you're looking into a photography tour, the cost on the website is $75.
