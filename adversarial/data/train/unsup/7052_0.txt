I wish I could give them zero stars. I came here with my family hoping to stay for a week in what was advertised as\"lush\" and \" beautiful\" setting.  Instead I was greeted with attitude by a woman named kinyata who refused to give me her name and proceeded to give me the wrong number to corporate. She also flinched at me like she was going to hit me when I asked for corporate number. I did my investigating and found her name. She was rude and I will never return. I would not being your families here!! The staff is dangerous! !
