I simply can't foresee Borders lasting the next decade.  Why, even now, would you go to Borders?\n\nTheir prices are the highest you'll find for most every product they sell.  Their superstores seem to create huge overhead costs that then have to be absorbed by their books, food\/coffee and movies.  \n\nWhy would I pay over $20 for a movie that has been out for over a year?  Why would I pay $30 for a new release?  Why would I pay more for a book that I could get on Amazon for 20%-30% less?  Even when I get the occasional Borders gift card from the in-laws, I still leave feeling like I've been taken advantage of.\n\nI imagine the Borders founder proposed his concept the same way that the Starbucks founder did.  \n\"See this paperback book?  I'm going to sell it for $17.  See this cup of coffee? $6.50\"\n\"That's ridiculous.  There's no way people are going to pay that much when they can go elsewhere.\"\n\"Oh, but they will.\"\n\nI'm going to start the next mega chain by charging $70 for an oil change and putting a chandelier and leather furniture in the waiting lobby.\n\nYet Borders always seem to have a steady supply of patrons.  I can only imagine that every one of them is unable to use a mouse and keyboard, or simply has more money than they know what to do with.\nNothing against Borders fans, of course.  To each his\/her own.  \n\nBut why?!
