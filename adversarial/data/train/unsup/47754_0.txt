One of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte! Their steaks have so much flavor. Most of the other steakhouses in Charlotte - which are chains - require you to order your sides separately and your bill can get very expensive. You definitely get the most bang for your buck here. The food is always good and it is not overpriced!
