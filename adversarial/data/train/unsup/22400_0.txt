We have been trying to give these guys chance after chance for years! No More! Tonight was the last straw. Every single time we have tried to eat here, there has been some issue from the food to the service. It's Saturday night at 7:00 pm and they have about 12 tables. Nello's across the parking lot is mobbed with patrons waiting outside. Umm, what's wrong with this picture?\n\nTonight, we came in and were seated right away but it took awhile for our server to get to us. She came and took our drink order then left again. She came back with the drinks and took our order. We ordered the Grazing Platter with 3 items. We were pretty disappointed with the quality of the meats and cheeses on the platter.\n\nOur food came and the server dumped our plates down and didn't even bother to pick up the dishes and so forth from our appetizer. Then my husband looked at his Croque Madame. His over easy egg looked like rubber and was so overcooked it the yoke was solid. The sandwich was charred on the edges and pretty much inedible. We tried for 15 minutes to get someone's attention, including calling out \"excuse me\" and we were ignored. When we finally got her attention and my husband let her have it, he didn't ask her to take the food away because he was starving and had decided to make due. She took the food without asking, my husband having said he didn't want anything else. She left him with a tiny cup of berries. He refused to take half of my burger until I said I was full. Which I did on purpose so he had something to eat. \n\nWe saw her go talk to the manager, who incidentally was expediting and the one who let the food go out in the first place,  and heaven knows what was said, but he obviously didn't want to be bothered. \n\nShe finally came back - 10 minutes minutes later - and we asked for the check. She got no tip and a note on the bottom of the receipt.
