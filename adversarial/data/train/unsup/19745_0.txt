Stopped in for a celebratory breakfast after signing some paperwork on a new house across the street. I love vegan food and they had some good relatively \"normal\" food for my partner. Everything was just not good from the start. The guy behind the counter seemed hell-bent on detailing the ingredients of every. single. item. on the menu. It actually took us longer to decide because he would not stop talking. \n\nWe waited for our order... and waited. It definitely was not worth the wait. I asked if I could have just regular iced coffee with whole milk and plain syrup. He assured me I could. What I got was an oversized cappuccino mug with watered down,  unsweetened coffee with almond milk and no actual ice. Gross.\n\nI was excited for the vegan biscuits and gravy, but no. Just no. I guess technically it was biscuits with a \"gravy\" on top, but the taste was super weird and was completely overpowered by tumeric. I would much rather have a rich mushroom gravy to satisfy the craving. Whatever that was is an abomination.\n\nIf an insufferable hipster with handlebar mustache, a bookcase full of homeopathic self-help books and a \"gluten intolerance\" were a restaurant, this would be it.\n\nAvoid.
