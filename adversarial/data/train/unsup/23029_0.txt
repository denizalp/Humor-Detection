What happens when hundreds of horny hardworking bees get together ....Honey. What is possibly the best use of honey? A magic alcoholic beverage which will turn you into a wise scholar.  Mead, Norse mythology tells us the poet Mead drank the wine and was suddenly the Einstein of his time. \n\nI was unaware of Mead but decided to have my first here at Apis.... In Carnegie of all places.  It's very neutral and inviting inside. A nice sit down environment to enjoy tingling your taste buds and chatting with friends. It looks restaurant like but only cheese and crackers are served so don't come looking for food.\n\nThe wines range from 7% to 14% alcohol they can be a traditional flavoring which is a tad more bitter and dry. Or meads which are brewed for shorter periods may have fruit flavors or even grape added. \n\nI tried the blackberry-raspberry mead and apricot peach. I was looking to stick with lower alcohol content. Both were light and delicious. But I taste tested the dryer meads and they reminded more of champagnes and whit dry wines. Still nice but a different feel on the tongue. \n\nYou can buy by the bottle glass, or after doing my research drop in and have bottles filled. The owner was a penn brewery employee branching off and doing this now. So great to see this addition. Pricing was decent, honestly not anymore then you'd be paying for a half glass of box wine or cheap bottle wine at a restaurant. It all depends what kind of experience you're up for. \n\nI prefer new local flavor myself. Cider lovers take note mead is up your alley... Craft beer lovers branch out try some mead.
