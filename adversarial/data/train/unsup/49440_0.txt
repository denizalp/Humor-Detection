Sparkling's is a fancy shmancy place.  I went here with a few friends for happy hour and we felt out of place right away.  We ordered a few appetizers and drinks so this review is not for any dinner items.  For a place to go to and have a few drinks and good cheap food, Sparkling's is not the spot.  The appetizers were just okay and nothing to rave about.  They were also quite expensive because appetizers were not discounted during happy hour - just drinks.  However, it definitely seems like it is the spot to take your date to - an intimate and fancy setting.
