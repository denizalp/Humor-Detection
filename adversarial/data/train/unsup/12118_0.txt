5 Stars! \nLisa, the owner, is the best!!  \nGet your #vegasstrong t-shirts here!!!\n\nI recently purchased a couple of #vegasstrong t-shirts at Big Frog Custom T-Shirts & More.  #Vegasstrong t-shirts can be found all over the internet as well as a few more places in town.  My decision to go with Big Frog was a simple one.  I wanted a guarantee that the funds are going to the families of the Las Vegas mass shooting victims.  Lisa, the owner, made that guarantee and stated that 100% of the net proceeds will go to the victim's families.  Even better, Zappos is matching whatever Big Frog can raise.  #Vegasstrong t-shirts are available in white or gray for only $10.  Keep in mind that these t-shirts are in high demand.  The demand is so high that you may have to place an order and pick it up on a later date.  \n\nOverall, I am impressed with Big Frog Custom T-Shirts & More.  The quality and service is top-notch. I guarantee that I will be back to make a few more purchases.  And when I asked what the turnaround was for custom t-shirt prints, their response \"give me 24 hours\".  Wow!  That's what I call service.
