Its been SIX years since my last visit where i said i wouldn't return, and STILL Bachi manages to fark up the service portion of my meal. \n\nSo disappointing. I brought my Grandma\/pa so that he can eat a burger and my Asian grandmother can have ramen (perfect, or so i thought). Ordered, ramen for her, a burger for me and pops, 2 fries, and a milk shake. Ramen comes out in normal 12-14 minute time frame. Milkshake comes out next 8-10 minutes later. 15-18 minutes from there (yes, over a half hour and 70% through her ramen our burgers come out. And how about another 10 minutes for our fries when i was taking my last 2 bites of my burger. What the hell?! No updates from the waitress, no apology or even explanation for the delays or for our meal coming out deconstructed. We asked for no lettuce on one of the burgers and it still came out with it on. I simply do not understand! Its simple... other restaurants can handle a simple burger with NO LETTUCE, why cant you? You did it six years ago when we asked for no onions. AMAZING! \n\nPeople make the comment that it takes time to make a good burger. I may be ok with that if you can at least bring out the meal so we can eat TOGETHER. And maybe get the order correct at LEAST. Part of the dining experience is service, and Bachi fails at this and has not attempted to remedy it since they opened years ago.
