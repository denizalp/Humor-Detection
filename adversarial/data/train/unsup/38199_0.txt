One of the best dessert place in my opinion! Great varieties and prices. I also tried their 'dome' dessert which isn't on the menue. You can always ask for it and it comes as a chocolate dome that melts beautifully when the waiter pours hot chocolate on it. It is simply delicious! The service is also pretty good,
