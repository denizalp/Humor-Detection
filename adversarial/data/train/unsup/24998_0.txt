The greatest pool in the free world. Actually six pools...do yourself a favor and hang at the director's pool, which is brat free.  All kids are given the bum's rush and asked to leave nicely.  Drink yourself silly and find Michelle, she will take incredible care of you, and will find you when you need another drink. You will not have to find her, she is that good. I've been going to the MGM for ten years straight, and it's all because of that pool.  Have a few pops then go hit the lazy river...if you're a hipster hit Wet Republic and see Paris Hilton, whatever.
