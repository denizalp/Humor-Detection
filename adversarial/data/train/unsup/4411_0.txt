THE STORY\n\nI was in a hurry and stopped by the corner McDonald's for a quick cup of coffee and breakfast, and they didn't even have a breakfast menu up to order from. So, I left McDonald's and went next door to Wildflower Bread Company, which is what I should have done to begin with.\n\nI walked into Wildflower Bread Company and was greeted with a happy \"Good Morning!\" by two different employees, including Jason. \n\nThe store was big and bright and had tons of treats in the front cases. There was even Chihuly glass overhead. Wow! Definitely NOT McDonald's ahaha\n\nSERVICE EXPERIENCE\n\nThe staff told me about the seasonal specials, including the chorizo fritatas, which sounded so yummy, except I had my heart set on pancakes.\n\nI ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes and both employees at the front were so polite and told me they would bring out my breakfast when it was ready.\n\nI only waited less than two minutes and was eating delicious lemon ricotta pancakes. \n\nI already love the Tempe location of Wildflower Bread Company \n(read my review:  https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/wildflower-bread-company-tempe) \nand I'm completely in love with this location now too!\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nI've said it before and I'll say it again: You can tell everything you need to know about the management of a company by how the employees treat the customers.\n\nAnd Wildflower Bread Company must have awesome management!\n\nI see established Yelpers agree with me too! \n\nWildflower Bread Company is definitely worth checking out!\n\n5\/5 HIGHLY RECOMMEND\n\nOF NOTE\n\n*Parking: Plenty of parking out front.\n\n*Hours: \nMon  6:00 am - 9:00 pm \nTues  6:00 am - 9:00 pm \nWed  6:00 am - 9:00 pm \nThu   6:00 am - 9:00 pm \nFri     6:00 am - 9:00 pm \nSat   7:00 am - 9:00 pm \nSun  7:00 am - 8:00 pm \n\n*Also, they have a newspaper reading area, which had all of the major latest newspapers!
