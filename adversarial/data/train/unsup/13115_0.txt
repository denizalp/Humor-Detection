Hole-in-the-wall mom-and-pop budget Mexican place with a snack shop in the back. There's usually just one girl running the place and she's very nice. Vegetarians beware: it is pork heavy but there is veggie tamales ($3.50 each according to the menu, but who knows because I keep eating about $30 worth of food here with my friends every time). I think this is as close to authentic and low priced Mexican as you can get in Toronto. If you liked Tenoche you'll like this place. No room wasted on stupid lettuce and tomatos and sour cream or whatever white folk put in tacos these days. There is meat, onions lime and cilantro instead.\n\nRead this: They have barbecued tripa (tripe), lengua (tongue) tacos on the menu! YES! (Those were $12)\n\nThere's nachos with zesty hot salsa with every eat in meal. The chicken pozole ($5) is super savoury with pieces of shredded chicken, hominy, chiles and jalapenos (perfect for a cold day) and the bistek and tripe\/lengua tacos came with a couple globs of fat but were not offensive. \n\nThey may be in a rush, the meat may be dry, and they don't double-tortilla your tacos like some tacquerias do but you will do just fine here. There is usually a taco special or deal every day of the week by the way.
