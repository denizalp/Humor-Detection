Vegas has the best collection of awesome sushi joints. The abundance of great sushi spots in this city make every trip worth it. They're all located off Strip too. You gotta drive out and some of these places are locals favorites.\n\nSushi House Goyemon is another sweet spot. AYCE and open really late, it's simply heaven. AYCE includes not only sushi but salads, appetizers, side dishes, and dessert too.\n\nPoki salad - Fresh tuna and addicting tangy dressing.\n\nGrilled tofu salad - The grilled tofu had a perfect seasoned taste.\n\nGrilled pork belly - 2 slices of tender melt in your mouth pork belly.\n\nAlbacore - Above average albacore nigiri.\n\nCajun Albacore - This is my favorite nigiri here. Super flavorful.\n\nSuper white tuna - Excellent but not as good as Hikari's.\n\nSpider roll - Very well executed here. Wrapped with soy paper.\n\nPixie roll - It's like a spider roll with more stuff. Also excellent.\n\nO.I.D. roll - Baked roll with salmon and asparagus. Not bad.\n\nBeing super hungry, we made the fatal mistake of ordering too much too fast. By the time the first wave digested, Sarah A. and I were in sushi hell. We were struggling to breathe or move. Be sure to finish or else you'll end up paying in more ways than one!\n\nIronically, I ended the night with a bowl of lychee ice cream :D
