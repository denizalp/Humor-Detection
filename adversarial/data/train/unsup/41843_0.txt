Great quality seafood and wagyu beef, but everything generally ran sweet, or very salty. We ordered the whole squid with Peruvian corn, yamato roll, sea bass skewer, and seared wagyu beef.\n\nTo start with my favorite, the wagyu was amazing. The jelly that it comes with on the side however was very salty, so use it sparingly. The yamato roll and sea bass skewer were both too sweet - I guess this could be part of the fusion thing, but it was really too sweet for my palate. The whole squid was very, very good, but also too salty.\n\nI let the manager know that it was my boyfriend's birthday, and he came by at the end with mango ice cream pops and a candle! It was a yummy dessert to end with.
