Came here for brunch - brunch is $29.95 all you can eat tapas style plus $5 for bottomless mimosas. The mimosas come with different flavors - orange, pomengranate, peach, and mango. The food is pretty good. I would recommend the sweet corn tamale and the potato rojas taco. \n\nOn my blog (wordpress.dplumly.com), I wrote a full critique of all the dishes that we tried. \n\nFor Vegas, I think its a pretty good deal. \n\nTIP - It opens around 10 for brunch and ends around 3 on Saturdays and Sundays. We came at 2:30 and the kitchen closed down on us so we didn't necessarily get to try everything and they \"ran out\" of champagne. I highly recommend getting there early and planning to spend your morning\/afternoon eating and drinking away.
