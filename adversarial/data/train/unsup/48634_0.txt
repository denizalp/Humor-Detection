A great place to start the day with a custom made omelette or any of the breakfast specialties throughout the week.\nBut the best is the coffee, the way it is prepared, served and obviously the taste itself.\nThe owner is super friendly and shows passion for his business and his clients. It is one of the independent shops, so come and support they, this is real craftsmanship!
