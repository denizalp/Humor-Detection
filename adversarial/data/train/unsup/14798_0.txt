Would NOT recommend\n\nChose this hotel because their studio had jetted tubs\nHopped in with the hubby this morning and it shut off after 5 minutes. Ok so we try to restart it... well, it's 9am and I call for help and now they are sending someone to my room. Um, great, but I don't really want some stranger coming to my room while I am in my skivvies, thanks.\n\nWell, they gave no other option so I am now in a towel waiting.\n\n___________\n\nFirst issues: called for a duvet at 215pm.\nBy 615 one had NOT been delivered (that's 4 hours later)\nI am forced to continually go downstairs to discuss with EDISON what the deal is. Well it took 4 hours, him calling housekeeping TWICE and being promised a duvet in 10min. Nope! Instead house keeping calls and says they do not have duvets. Um, yes you do I told her because every room has one and in fact I was looking at one. A comforter? she says. NO. A duvet. This hotel does NOT have comforters. But for some reason the hotel housekeeping doesn't know that a duvet is not a comforter and that their hotel doesn't have comforters. Basically it wad an english lesson for their staff who don't know they have duvets here NOT comforters. Edison was very helpful even though the other housekeeping staff is less than schooled on bedroom terminology. Basically it was presented to me by that staff that I was wrong - um, ok?\n\n4 hours and 32 minutes later I get a duvet. Thank the baby Jesus.\n\n_________________________\n\nSecond issue: a maid or something decided to OPEN OUR DOOR without knocking or announcing her presence while I was NUDE! Called front complaining and they made me fill our a form with a sprained finger. His name was Billy - I liked Billy :)\n\nWell, I call management (Jeremy) and went down to fill out the form. Almost an hour later he calls back and tells me \n\n\"We checked the video footage and the woman knocked before she went in\" \nNo she didn't! Three people in the room and nobody heard a knock\nNot only that but JEREMY is basically calling me a liar when he says the video shows her knocking but when I go in the hall there is NO evidence of ANY camera. I plan to call back today and ask him to come up and show me where the camera is. Unless it's cleverly hidden in the smoke detector I'm lost.\n\nAlos - he was making excuses either way wether or not she knocked BECAUSE the room has a moth-trukkin-DOORBELL !!! No excuse about knocking when there is a DOORBELL. So wether or not she knocked (she didn't) she SHOULD have rang the bell.\n\n\n\nABOUT THE ROOM:\nRoom 36218 Studio - floors are noisy and woke us up whenever someone had to go to the bathroom. Couch bed was AWFUL and you could feel every spring in the thing. Should be replaced.
