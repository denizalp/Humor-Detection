Well, I was gonna write a review of this DUMP but then I saw Aaron A's review and think it'd be better just to re-post his horrible review!!!  (how's that for a first line of a review, Aaron A?)\n\n\"... I would not step back in this place for a taco.  Fatty pork is fine, if its cooked nicely, but this was not. Green beef was ok, as long as I piled the pretty good tomatillo salsa over it.  The fish...let's leave it at ugh.  If this is their specialty, it's over already.  (no more lines waiting, I see that much...)\n\n\"This is Sunnyslope, and with the authentic delicious taco and burrito choices around here, this place is only competing with the tacos across the street at Jack in the Box, and I would probably eat those before I'd touch another one of these, it was that bad for me.\n\n\"SORRY HIPPIES.  THIS WASN'T GOOD.  IF YOU ARE GOING TO COME INTO A MEXICAN PART OF TOWN YOU'D BETTER BRING THE MEAT TO COMPETE.  YOU ARE FAR OUTCLASSED IN TACOLAND.\"  (Bold mine)\n\n\"So, after some thought I decided rather than just pan the place, I'm giving suggestions:  \n1. use a paper or wax paper between the aluminum and taco, or you have a mess.\n2. do something with that too cold cabbage\/cheese\/tomato\n3.  grill the fish and don't smother it \/ chop it up.  make sure its fresh.\n4.  get a better cut of pork, go organic (maybe it is), season it better\n5.  keep the happy people in front, they were nice\n6.  don't blend your lemonade with ice, it was awful and too sweet\n7.  quit buying your chips at Costco, those round ones suck\n8.  do something with the guacamole, it was ok just being avocado and lime, but it was pureed.  keep it chunky.\n9.  get more input from your mexican chefs, they probably know what is wrong\n10. Both the red and green salsas were good, just need a taco to go with it\"\n\n------------\n\nBE SURE TO LOOK FOR ALL THE FLIES THEY HAVE IN THE KITCHEN DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS.  Ugh.\n\nHORRIBLE FOOD.
