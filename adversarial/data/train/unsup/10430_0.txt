When you first walk into the dim lit area, you are greeted by a friendly smiling hostess. Odd place next to a strip club, but come to find out the restaurant is owned by the same owner of Sapphires. The decor is a great hip new look that seems to flow nicely with the vibrant red color. Was there to support the three squares restaurant week. Price fixed menu that included table side guacamole, three street tacos, and a dessert. The chips and salsa was good. The orange habanero salsa was, well you guessed it, HOT! The table side guacamole was awesome. The pork street tacos had slices of pickled habanero peppers on it. Was a good flavor! The Tres Leches cake was excellent. The best part of the dining experience was the waitress. Phenomenal service!
