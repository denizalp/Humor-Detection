Just an update because my old review had out of date info - Dinette has now extended into the room next door which gives them a bunch more tables, and they've got there liquor license and are serving up incredibly delicious cocktails. \n\nYou can and should order a picnic to go and if you do this, don't be ridiculous, please call in your order in advance. Then you can walk up like a rocker to hear them calling your name and serving up your picnic right on time and you will be the hero of dinner, which is a brief and fleeting glory but an easily attainable bit of awesome for you and your pals.
