I'm certain most people have no idea what Hungarian food is. Sure, you've probably heard of  or even had \"goulash\".  But I assure you, that barely scratches the surface of this tasty, real comfort food cuisine. I consider myself a subject matter expert on Hungarian food. A dubious distinction you say? Ha. Taste the food at Huszar and then say that. I grew up with Hungarian food, my Hungarian grandmother taught me to make some dishes (along with a few curse words), and I've sought it out in my decades of travel domestically and internationally. I've eaten it all my life and even in Budapest. I can assure you I know legit Hungarian cuisine. This place has legit food. Full of flavor, comforting, appealing on every level, and a pure taste sensation. \n\nI was able to talk at length with the owner, Judy. She brought the chef out to introduce him to us. She recruited him in Hungary last year and convinced him to come over. He is doing fabulous things in that kitchen. We started with some red cabbage and cucumber salad appetizers. Both incredible. On to the chicken paprikas and porkolt. Awesome. Finished with the real test - sour cherry strudel and cottage cheese palacsinta. They were perfect \n\nWe each had a Joe IPA draft (from Oregon) - haven't seen that beer anywhere around here. Delightful. \n\nSure it may not be the high end restaurant you may normally seek out. This is a bar with great food. Solid 4 plus stars. Next time you're thinking you'd like some ethnic food, pass on those Italian, Indian, middle eastern, Chinese thoughts. Go for comfort. Get to Huszar. You'll be glad you did.
