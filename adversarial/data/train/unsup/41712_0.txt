Very disappointing experience at the Hamburger Works.  Last night, the H.W's hit a new low in poor service and dirty tables.   I had ordered fries with my burger, only to have the burger served w\/o the fries.  With receipt in hand, I brought this to the cashiers attention.  She acknowledged the over sight and reordered my fries.   I finished my burger while waiting for the rest of my order.   Which never came!   I requested to speak to the manager.   A guy named Sean seemed totally indifferent about the screwed-up order.   It will be a long time before I will eat there again.
