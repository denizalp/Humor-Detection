Great spot for breakfast without a wait.\n\nThere's a pretty large selection of to-go items as well as omelettes and other things you can order in. Although the Le Gourmand is typically a little busy, it always seems to have a seat or two open - so never worry about the stress of waiting too long for a spot.
