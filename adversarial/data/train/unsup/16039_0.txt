I only write reviews on Yelp to help people save their money.\n\nTen bucks for a small sandwich and a drink.  \"The Bobbie\" which is supposed to be their signature sandwich is cold shredded turkey (maybe a 2 oz portion at most) cold stove top stuffing and cold cranberry sauce smushed in a rubbery piece of bread.  No sides!  If my co worker wasn't the one who picked this up and I was eating it inside the restaurant, I would march up to the counter and ask for a refund.  \n\nMy toddler could make this better in his sleep.  \n\nOf all the years working in Scottsdale, this is hands down, the biggest ripoff for lunch.  How they are still in business after a year is beyond me.  GARBAGE.
