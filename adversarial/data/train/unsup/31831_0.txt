We started off with the goat cheese dumplings and cheddar nduje biscuits which were delicious.  We enjoyed good wine.  \n\nHowever, the entree left a lot to be desired.  I had the pork (as I was told this was one of the most popular). The pork shoulder lacked clean chunks of meat.  There were Brunswick stew pieces pieced piled up and many of the pork pieces were pieces of fat.  Now, I am fully aware of the shoulder and the expected fat as I smoke these many times per year however at $26\/plate I feel the meat could be a little more select.\n\nMy wife ate the gnocchi which in her opinion were well overcooked, slightly mushy (big no no in gnocchi land) and really lacked flavor.\n\nThe last thing I will comment on is the server, she was on it at first and then fell off.  When we didn't eat 75% of our entree she didn't once ask if they we were ok or how are meals were...\n\nUnfortunately we will not head back to this place even with a great wine menu.  If you're gonna eat there I might recommend sticking to starters, sides, or charcuterie.
