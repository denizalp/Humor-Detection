On July 25, 2017 I was on my way to An appointment and wanted to grab some coffee and a breakfast sandwich. This place was the closest so I pick up food and head to my appointment. I start to eat in the way there and I found pieces of egg shell on my sandwich! Like really? Can't crack an egg?? Any who the coffee was not fresh and I didn't eat nor drink my coffee. I went back after my appointment and told the manager that I want my money back. No one was in line and they took forever to refund my money! Like really? Retrain your employees how to crack an egg!!
