Needed to do a few hour's worth of concentrated reading in an isolated environment so I went to my closest library. My back was sore that day, so I wanted to relax in a beanbag chair versus sitting upright. \n\nAll three beanbags were isolated in an area marked \"teen only\". Two out of the three were empty.  Rather than just plop down,  I thought I should go ask somebody if I could just move one of the beanbags a couple of feet away into the adult environment.  \n\nI was passed around through THREE different employees before I finally encountered someone with the executive authority to make such a crucial, mission-critical decision. The answer was no. No I can't sit there and no I can't move the beanbag a few feet. Really, it's that flagrant of a violation?  Are we in China, Russia or the Middle East?\n\nOther than that, the place is quite noisy and most of the employees I talked to reeked of smoke.
