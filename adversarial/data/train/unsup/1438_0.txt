So. Many. Books.\n\nI really didn't intend to buy anything. I thought I might just take a look inside, nose around, and leave. Instead, I found books and I bought books.\n\nBooks in reasonable sections and the shelves (at least in fiction) were in alphabetical order by author. Easy enough and I was surprised to find two from authors I like that I'd not seen before.\n\nPrices are pretty reasonable and the folks working were helpful.
