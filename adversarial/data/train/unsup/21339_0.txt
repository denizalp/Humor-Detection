This is where my indoor soccer teams plays. All they do is indoor soccer. There are leagues for little kids, on up to over 30s, co-ed and women-only. \n\nThe facility itself is pretty old and worn out, but it does the job. There's a gallery above the main field, where friends and family can watch the game. There is also a soccer gear shop, and a snack bar that serves beer (cheap!)
