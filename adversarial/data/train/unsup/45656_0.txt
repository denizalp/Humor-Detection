LOVE is amazing!!! \n\nPrior to watching this Cirque du Soleil production at The Mirage last week, I had never been a big fan of the Beatles. I respected their music and who they were as artists. After watching this show, I am a  huge fan. The great choreography and story line brought the music alive. This was my second Cirque du Soleil show and they never disappoint! The 360 around stage ensures everyone in the audience gets a great view of the show.\n\nSeats range from $75- 250. For your money, this show definitely satisfies! If your in Vegas, see this show!
