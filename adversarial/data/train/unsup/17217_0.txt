I received a rather uninviting email from Zvone from User Support in San Francisco stating that I did a review for the Spa and Salon at the Wynn in Vegas. Stating I had not attended. Actually my fianc√© and I booked a couples massage and spent well over $800 on the couples full body scrub, couples sauna, couples massage, etc! We spent four nights at the Wynn this same weekend and gave all great reviews.\n\nI am really offended by her email and would like to hear from someone regarding it. She said she removed my review which was ALL positive!\n\nThanks,\n\nK. W.
