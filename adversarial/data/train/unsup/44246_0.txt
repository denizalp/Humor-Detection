Our company ordered to cakes to be presented to our husband this weekend as a Birthday Surprise. The cakes were made beautifully looked better than anticipated and they tasted so wonderful. I had the peanut butter cream one made for my husband and it is a huge hit. So fresh and moist.. I think I might gain a pant size though!!!
