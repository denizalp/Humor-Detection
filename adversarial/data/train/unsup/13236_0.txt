Tonight I ventured into Shady's for the first time. And tonight I felt self-anger for a long time. Why? Because I've lived blocks away from this place for almost 10 months and haven't been there till now. Oh, I knew it was there the entire time. But I thought the crowd would be the general lower Arcadia biker posse with some loud CCR on the jukebox and PBR as the sole prized elixir on tap.  Talk about having my head up where the sun don't shine (and not to dog on bikers, CCR, or PBR - all deserve their due respect).    \r\n\r\nBut thanks to this here website, I learned something new about this place. As other Yelpers have mentioned before me, a really unpretentious yet cool little joint just nestled there on the corner of Indian School & 27th St. After 6 days home in the SF Bay Area, I was back in town, running errands when, well, Shady's just happened to be there. And I happened to pull into the back lot. And I happened to walk in.\r\n\r\n\"Fear & Loathing In Las Vegas\" was the movie for the evening (with subtitles). \"Papa Was A Rolling Stone\" and \"The Big Payback\" on the jukebox. A few folks hanging out and having a good time on a Wednesday night. Scene: late-20's\/early 30's. Hipster-ish but not pretentious-ish. Friendly bartender. Dark interior, but not divey (not that every great bar has to be divey). Shady's is definitely a place to come back to with some more folks to hang out at. \r\n\r\nAs for myself, either I go here before I go to Sprouts or the gym or afterwards. There lies the dilemma. Hmm..drunk exercising and\/or organic enzyme buying may not be smart after all. I think just answered my own question. \r\n\r\nSo. Shady's is the place to hit once you're done with the rest of your shit for the day and you happen to be cruising with the homies on Indian School. \r\n\r\nAnd there you have it.
