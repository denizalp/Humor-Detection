This was my first time eating vegan food, and I was pleasantly surprised. Service was friendly and quick, and portion size was huge. We ordered the poutine and wings for appetizers. Poutine which was delicious, crispy fries and delicious gravy. The vegan cheese didn't add much to the dish. The wings were ok, but would not order them again. \nI had the chicken and waffles, which was the highlight of my meal. Flavorful, crispy and hitting the sweet and savory balance perfectly. With the Philly cheesesteak, the bread to filling ratio was too high, even for a cheesesteak. Lastly, the steak and dumplings was ok, too salty for my but others enjoyed it. \nOverall a good experience and would go again!
