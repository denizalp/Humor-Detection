My husband and I went here because of our $50 Groupon. We showed up around 5pm on a Monday evening, and we were the only patrons.\n\nWe sat down and ordered:\n\nMt. Everest Special Biryani - great spice, with big shrimps, and tender meats. This is one of our favourite dish.\n\nGarlic Naan - a must have, you can smell the garlic and it tastes great\n\nHimalayan Hunting - mix platter of tandoori chicken, seekh kebab, a tandoori shrimp, and some assortment of other chicken and beef. The tandoori shrimp and chicken were the highlight of the dish. We would come here, and order the tandoori shrimp and chicken as separate dishes.\n\nLamb Vindaloo - if you want some tang and major kick, this is your dish! I love the heat of the dish, and the lamb was fork tender. Delicious!\n\nBhindi Masala - a bit bland compared to other dishes that are packed with spice. But I still enjoyed it, more than my husband :)\n\nOverall, we will be back! My husband and I agree it's one of the better Indian food within the GTA. It is WAY BETTER than Lahore Tikka (we don't understand why people go there)!
