A comedy of errors MADE RIGHT by management and staff\n\nFirst the errors 1) missed reservation time by 20 minutes; 2) Waited 50 minutes for food to arrive after order; 3) served beef burger instead of turkey burger. Now for what this restaurant did right; 1) got apology from no less than 3 different people and a drink comp for missed reservation time; 2) apology from waiter and the owner for long food wait; 3) burger comp, price cut on rest of food, free appetizers on next visit, more sincere apologies; 4) Another free appetizer and apology from hostess on the way out the door. This is a textbook example of how a restaurant should handle customers when things go awry, and yes, at ALL restaurants things do happen, but it is how staff and management correct them that makes all the difference. I think the problems we experienced were due mostly the unexpected popularity of this restaurant and a crush of people at the time we visited. We will definitely be back to this restaurant for sure, they took a few bad things and turned them around and made the best of it. As for the food, well it was wonderful; the pistachio salmon was well prepared on a bed of orzo (barley) and the burger was prepared just right, the Greek fries could have used a tad more time in the fryer, but they had a great flavor with the feta and herbs on top. Keep up the good work Salut, this review would have been very different had you and your staff not stepped up to the plate.
