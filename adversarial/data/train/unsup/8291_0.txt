Purchased 2014 Rogue last October - received call from them about coming into look at new car - they wanted mine blah blah blah and they would give me a $25 gift card for 25 minutes of my time.  Went in yesterday after 2.5 hours of bullsh*t- was offered $12500 for my Rogue with 16000 miles on it.  Obviously Nissan cars do not hold value!  The car I drove had a totally different price than what was offered on their website. I got some half baked answer when I showed the salesman the website price.  They kept my drivers license.  Sent my husband to get it and the gift card this morning and he was told they don't give gift cards.  What a scam.  Berkshire Hathaway should be ashamed of themselves for owning a dealership like this.  I guess Warren Buffet has friends in low places.  What a shame.  This place is the reason the public has such a low opinion of car salesmen.
