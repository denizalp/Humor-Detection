I love Costco! I am a Costco junkie. I get all kinds of stuff here and yes I have occasionally even bought clothes. Now in retrospect I think I have bought all of my swimsuits here for the last 6 years. Hey back off they carry speedo's for about 20 bucks now that's a deal! \n\nI love the shrimp cocktail here I get that at least once a week you get like 30 beautiful shrimp for 10 bucks with sauce and lemon. The chicken salad is very good. I always get, french beans & hard salami as well. The prices for the cheeses are really good as well. \n\nI get my puppies dog food here too! You can't beat the ready made food either. The roasted chicken is fantastic! The cuts of beef are amazing. Sometimes about half way through my shopping I will call the food court and order an everything pizza. Once I go to the checkout I let them know I ordered a pizza and they ring me up there and I go pick it up on my way out. Also the twist frozen yogurt is yummy! For 10 bucks that's a good pizza! \n\nDo park in the back on the montebello side, or if it works for you take the light rail.
