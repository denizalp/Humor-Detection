I never thought about going to a Sauce restaurant until they opened one down the street for my house. I had the arugula and quinoa salad with goat cheese.....lots of yummy delicious goat cheese. My husband had the kale and salmon salad. The salmon was broken into small pieces instead of whole. I think it's because they could skimp on the salmon and you'll never know the difference. We each had a piece of artichoke, mushroom, roasted red pepper & goat cheese bruschetta. Everything taste delicious. Our total for dinner plus a glass of red wine was $32. We didn't know fresh bread came with the salad, we'll probably skip the bruschetta next time and just eat the bread. The table next to us ordered pizza. The crust looked super thin and short on toppings. Being from Chicago I'm picky about pizza. That being said, I'm not in love with deep dish, but I like a substantial slice. I'll try for myself next time.\n\nSauce is VERY, VERY kid friendly. If kids are not your thing (they are not mine) then I would go later in the evening or for lunch. Babies screaming in the line. Kids running around the outside patio. Little girls making a mess at the self serve beverage bar. All in all, a pleasant experience and we will return.....for lunch or when it is past the kids bed time.
