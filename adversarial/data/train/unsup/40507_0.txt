Fantastic displays of historic and modern art, architecture, ceramics, furniture, and American Indian\/ Egyptian\/ Alaskan cultures housed in a gorgeous building with modern accents. Docents and tours are very helpful. Put the \"Carnegie International\" show on your calendar starting this October 2018. The Restaurant is delicious and gift shop is very eclectic.
