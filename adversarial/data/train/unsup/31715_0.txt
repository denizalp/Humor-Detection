Called to schedule an estimate for an AC replacement.  Unfortunately I am out of their service area but I was so impressed by the professionalism of Tanya that I felt the need to write a review.  It's a wonderful surprise when someone takes the time to provide assistance when they already know they aren't able to serve you personally or sell you anything personally.  She gave me some great information and advice, which she certainly didn't have to take the time to do, and I really appreciate it.  Seems like a company with a lot of integrity.
