I had one of the worst shopping experiences last night at NM Last. Very disappointing considering I WAS a loyal fan. Maybe its my fault but I had a return that was less than 60 days old and the Manager at NM Last Call pretty much told me sorry about you luck we have a 30 day return policy. I was very nice to the gentleman explaining that I was trying to exchange my jeans for another pair but there weren't any that fit. Manager was like too bad we can't give you a refund and you are lucky I'm authorizing an exchange because we're not supposed to do that either.\n\nLike I said probably my fault that I didn't read the back of my receipt but since when does a store like NM not make the customer happy: I even had my receipt. BAD customer service soooo disappointed and may never go back to NM Last Call because of this. Hopefully someone high up will see this posting and take action. Bad news travels fast.
