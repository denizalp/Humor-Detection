If you're a local music fan, downtown Phoenix was your Mecca last night. When I say local, I don't mean the band that fills a room with 5 people, but the bands that bring along a hundred or so doting fans. There were also a few anchors that brought people out like The Neighborhood and Sir Mix-A-Lot.\n\nSetup across 13 different venues in downtown Phoenix, such as Crescent  Ballroom, City Scape, Hard Rock Cafe, and Last Exit Live - something like 60 bands rocked the night until 2am. Music from hip hop, rap, folk, rock, electronic, indie, dance, singer\/songwriter could be heard in 30-60 minute sets. Make your choices, or don't and just wing it. It was a fun night of music, hanging with friends, strolling downtown, dancing, and chillaxing and I can't wait for the next one!\n\nFYI tickets sold out about 8pm ish. If this event happens again, buy your tickets early -- like I did. ;-)\n\nHappy Yelping Phoenix! Time to get your groove on.
