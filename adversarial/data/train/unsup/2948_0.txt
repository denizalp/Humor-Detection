Nicest Towne Suites of the ones in the area. If you advertise that the beds are queens, they should be. Felt more like full size beds! It is kinda of old, the light over the table didn't work, there were two microwaves as one was broken, there was a huge dead bug on the floor, and the walls are thin. You can hear the traffic outside and unfortunately, you can hear your neighbors.
