Definitely buyer beware. \nI'm not angry, just sad.\n\nOnline, I found a really neat car but needed $1000-$3000 put into it. They aren't open Sundays, so I spent my day making pros and cons lists and doing my research. \n\nThe salesman was a new hire and did a good \"cold read\" on me the day of the test drive. I knew the negotiation would be hard.\n\nWhen I came back to buy the car, we could not come to terms and I had to walk away. The out the door price was even higher *with* my trade in. How does that work? I had a low offer, true, but it was what I thought was fair for a high mileage car with bald front tires. \n\nThis is my third try buying from an independent dealer in Charlotte. All these independent dealers are making each other look bad. \n\nAdams tries to act like they are Carmax.\nCarmax they are not. \n\nSee you on my next Yelp review when hopefully I will have found a car and made a good deal. At this rate, it will be sometime next year!!
