LMAO, Don't ever come here.\n\nThe staff are rude they talk behind your back in Mandarin, from the way you dress to the way you look. The food is pretty mediocre for the pricing. 23$ for Dinner, rip off.. \n\nWhen our waitress brought our bill it came with fortune cookies, we decided not to tip due to their lack of good service. When the waitress saw our receipt  she was astonished and told her manager (who walked by) that we didn't tip and then proceeded to picking up the fortune cookies and walking away. \n\nFood was mediocre I've had better sushi from 12$ AYCE restaurants or T&T Supermarkets..\nI do not advise coming here as you will be ripped off. AVOID THIS PLACE
