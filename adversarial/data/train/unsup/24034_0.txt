Iced milk is what sets this place apart from other boba shops. \n\nMe: \"What is iced milk?\"\nCashier: \"It is a blend of ice, milk, and brown sugar.\"\n\n**RANT: Rude customer comes up right next to me next to the cash register. Hands over cash and stamp card to the owner. Seriously, who the eff are you? This guy had a pick up order. It's not like I asked a million and 1 questions or was shooting the breeze. \nI look at the rude guy, the cashier, and the owner. We all make eye contact, but it's awkward silence. I really wasn't in the mood for this, so I kept my mouth shut; however, no apologies from ANYBODY. I thought their customer service\/people skills lacked. \n\nI noticed that there were some menu changes, like more toppings! Grass jelly...ooh! I usually like KFT's grass jelly so I went with the iced milk with caramel, grass jelly, and honey boba. \nThe drink tasted great, but the toppings were horrendous compared to what I am used to. Definitely not the honey boba I am used to with KFT or BTB. The grass jelly was off and not enjoyable. I once tried their iced milk with taro pudding and another time with egg pudding and these were not impressive either. \n\nA gripe I have are under utilized space. Not really a good place to hang out. Maybe that is their intention?! Lots of individual chairs, but no tables. There is a couch, but it limits it to only one party to lounge. Another annoyance is the early closing time of 8:30! Hmm, what is going on behind those tall, frosted glass barriers? Makes me wonder! \n\nCashier: \"Shake it all up before you poke it with a straw.\"\n\nIs it me or does anyone else try to strategically avoid the cute baby girl face on the lid?
