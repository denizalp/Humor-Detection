Easy walking distance from the Renaissance Southpark hotel. Healthy beakfast selections look tasty as well.\n\nThe food was good, even superb but $42 (before the tip) for breakfast?  WTF?  Was here with the GF on a quick trip to Charlotte.  Granted, this is in the South Park area which is quite trendy and upscale but still, 42 bucks for omelettes, juice, coffee and pancakes...helllllllll no.  Won't be coming back here unless it's on the company dime.
