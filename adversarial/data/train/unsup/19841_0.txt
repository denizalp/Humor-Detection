Yoga on a vibrating plate? \n\nSounds weird, works amazingly. Not only is Vibetality a welcoming and relaxing atmosphere with trinkets, clothes and accessories to buy, but Patrick and Erica are two of the most kind and thoughtful people I've met yet. \n   After encountering two girls raving about Vibetality and how amazing the 15 minute classes are--WITH actual results, I was determined to check it out. I emailed them and got a reply within the hour welcoming me and wanting to include me. Each class fits 10 people and they offer different Vibe classes like yogavibe, renewvibe and fitvibe.\n      I did both fitvibe and renewvibe and not only do I feel relaxed and calm, but stretched and literally still buzzing. \n   Other participants were praising their results and with the first experience I just had I don't doubt that I am hooked already--I'm already going back Saturday morning!
