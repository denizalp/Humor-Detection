I had great (and friendly) service, tasty calamari (in a spicy sauce that I couldn't stop eating enough though it made my chapped lips burn), and some kind of fruity lemonade drink that the waitress recommended.\n\nBooze - \"Would you like a small, medium or large? The large is $22 but you get to keep the cup.\" Oh, Vegas.... you truly ARE special.\n\nI think Seattle has spoiled me a little, though, because I was rather disappointed when I learned that the only thing they had on tap was..... bud light (or something of the sort).\n\nI missed out on the bartending contest and all that because I was headed to Mystere, but this was a pretty sweet place. Oh and the \"loudest section of the bar gets free shot\" contest sounded like fun! I almost watched part of the contest after the show, but there were just too many people in there so I took off.
