If you are noise sensitive, this is not the place for you. The men making the noodles slap the dough against the counter as hard as possible, and so there was a constant, extremely loud pounding noise throughout dinner. I started to cringe from this intense pounding noise and left with a headache. (see other comment from guest who said they \"jumped\" a few times due to the intensity of the noise made from the pounding\/slapping of the dough against the counter). My dinner companion  asked a host or waiter if there was any way to lessen the intensity of the noise, and the host\/waiter laughed and said no. \n\n.
