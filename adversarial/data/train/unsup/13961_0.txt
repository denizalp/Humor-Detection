Why you ask? After all I gave it 1 star last time around. \n\nAs I mentioned before it is the ONLY eatery in walking distance from the business park I work in. \n\nSo reluctantly I entered through their doors again. First thing I noticed upon entering was the wall sized paper menu with black magic marker drawn through half of the menu items. \n\nLooks like the nixed all the appetizers,salads,hamburgers,catfish tacos and OKRA. Raised Sweet Potato Pie to $3.95\/slice. \n\nWell the only things you can get on the NEW menu for under $5 is Seasoned Fries for $3.95 or Hot Link Samich w\/side of potato chips or potato salad. \n\nI went for the later-BBQ Hot Link Samich w\/potato salad.$3.95-Not bad. \n\nI was completely suprised to see a poppy seed HAMBURGER bun when I opened my to-go container since I had ordered a link. \n\nThey slice the link into pepperoni thin slices and smother it in super spicy but bland bbq sauce and a doughy bun. WTF!! :( \n\nI had faith that by ordering a link I was playing it safe, I mean how the F*#% can you screw up a HOT LINK Samich. Harry O's has figured it out. Slice it to shit,smother it and pretend it's bbq. \n\nBad location, competing with super popular Polaris Street Cafe and the taco truck in the neighborhood. \n\nFood is way overpriced takes way too long -I mean Famous Dave's has a full rack rib meal for $20. Here they want $30 and I never smelled any smoke in this place. What gives?!? \n\nDefinitely not worth the money or the wait. 1\/2 star for giving it a go.
