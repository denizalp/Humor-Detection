It's a consignment shop, so it's always going to be hit or miss inventory wise, but what I'm far more concerned about is the staff. \n\nIt's totally OK if you want to employ angry hipsters exclusively but just make sure they're *somewhat* congenial. I counted at least four stink eyes during my last visit for seemingly innocent offenses ranging from knocking a pair of jeans off their cheap clippy hangers to putting a pair of Dr. Martens back on the shelf two spots down from where I grabbed them. C'mon, man. I'm sure people commit much more egregious fouls.\n\nI'll keep going back because I love the thrill of the hunt but I won't do so expecting to be charmed.
