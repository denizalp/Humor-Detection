We went here kinda buying into the yelp hype and we were slightly let down. The coffee was fantastic and strong. The food was just alright but I may be spoiled comparing it to other places around town. I tried the bmoc some crepes dish and the Mexican Benedict and all were tasty just not really my cup of tea. I would say the chorizo on the biscuit with a poached egg tasted the best of everything I tried. The service was great and the atmosphere was trendy and hip. This would be a good place to take someone new on a breakfast date. I may give it another shot later down the road and update my review but as of right now I think the stars fit the place.
