Ever since the Elite Event at Orange Theory, I've been looking for any excuse to come back and nosh at Flower Child. \n\nA long three months later, the opportunity presented itself on my way back from some meetings.\n\nYeah, it's that delicious. Locally sourced food made with love. \n\nYou order at the counter, and are given a number. \n\nTake a seat anywhere, the staff will find you and your number even if you go on the patio! \n\nSince I had been CRAVING the Mediterranean Salad with a healthy portion of Salmon, I didn't try something new.   \n\nIt's the perfect blend of greens, tomatoes, onions, cucumber, garbanzo beans and lightly dressed with feta and an oregano vinaigrette. \n\nThis is what I love about Flower Child: Simple ingredients are the star on their own, without being drowned out in cheeses or sauces. \n\nAlso, the seasonal Apple Cider Lemonade was phenomenal. Was not expecting that combination to work! \n\nCan't wait to try the rest of the menu.
