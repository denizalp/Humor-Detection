I think most of my excitement came from the adventure of just being there. The class was ok. Didn't get the full hour and 15 as promised. \n\nSpent too much time learning how to touch the chest and cookie. I would have much preferred to just learn a cool routine and more awesome tricks on the pool.\n\nI do, however, have a new respect for these ladies. My sheens were distroyed after taking the class. lol
