The owner Scott sent me a message saying that my reviews contradict themselves which they don't. Here's how it goes: A customer takes the vinyl he would like to purchase up to Scott who then looks on Ebay or Discogs and tells you what he will sell them to you for.  A record which Scott wants me to pay 25 bucks for can be had for 7 or 10 bucks at the most at places like The Record Room or Revolver. \n\nScott also said in his message that I should come down to the store and tell him these things face to face. Is he being threatening or trying to win over a customer? That's no way to win business
