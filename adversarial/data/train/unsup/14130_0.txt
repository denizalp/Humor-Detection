At first, I thought I found a fairly good price room for a holiday weekend stay... [I figured it must have been because it was for the Friday night of the fourth of July weekend.]\n\nBut boy, WAS I EVER WRONG!\n\nLittle did I know, THIS WAS JUST THE BEGINNING OF A HORRIBLE ONE-NIGHT-STAY AT THE OLD TOWN SCOTTSDALE RODEWAY INN!\n\n[When I booked the reservation, I was already aware that this location is ENTIRELY A NON-SMOKING FACILITY, and I KNEW THIS COULD BE A POTENTIAL PROBLEM... since I do NOT SMOKE CIGARETTES, but I have multiple health issues which are eased by medical marijuana use.]\n\nWhen I checked in [at 3pm on Friday afternoon July 1, 2016 - per my reservation, and at the regular advertised check-in time.] \n\nA curt, petite Hispanic woman was working the front desk, and she checked me in. impolite - [Actually, borderline-RUDE]with short salt and\n\nDuring our extensive financial transaction, she asked me for an unexpected $50 room deposit that HAD TO BE PAID BY THE SAME CARD OR CASH - whatever was your chosen method of payment.\n\nFirst of all, this $50 deposit was not stated anywhere on the site through which I booked the reservation.\n   \nSo, that, in itself, was UNEXPECTED AND INCONVENIENT.   \n\nTHAT WAS MARK #1 AGAINST THEM.\n     \n\nIn their front office, I read [and signed] the paper that stated a specific receipt had to be presented in order to get your room deposit back.\n\nI had to SPECIFICALLY ask for the special receipt [and I wondered at that point, if this whole deposit thing, was a scam...]\n\n\nAt the time of check-in, all ID's and reservation documents were provided.\n\nMy reservation was for ONE KING-SIZE BED [for 2 adults].\nShe gave me 2 QUEEN SIZE BEDS, INSTEAD.\n\nTHIS WAS MARK #2 AGAINST THEM...\n\n\nShe proceeded to collect the previously undisclosed $50 deposit - which left me with very little money [even though I had just received my sole income source, Social Security Disability - I am a DISABLED SENIOR.]\n\nI am still relatively unsure what THAT was all about... \nWas I witnessing some sort of discrimination, as it turns out?\n\n\nAnyway, after numerous attempts to get a 'key' card  that would work right, for the door, from her [I just ended up NOT LOCKING THE DOOR UNLESS SOMEONE WAS INSIDE TO LET ME IN].  Simply because I WAS UNCERTAIN AS TO WHETHER I COULD REGAIN ENTRY.\n\nTHERE WAS MARK #3 AGAINST THEM\n\n\nThe MATTRESS WAS EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE, AND I COULD BARELY WALK IN THE MORNING!\n\nMARK #4 AGAINST THEM.\nUNCOMFORTABLY POOR MATTRESSES\n  \n\nAt 9:50am on Saturday, July 2, 2016 - I went to the front office to check out.\n\nSince we knew it was a non-smoking facility, we took extra care, and ABSOLUTELY - DID NOT - SMOKE ANYWHERE NEAR THE DOOR OF OUR ROOM - but instead, we went across the parking lot when we DID smoke [this MAY HAVE occurred 3-5 times for the duration of our unfortunate stay].\n\nShe took my 'keys' and went to 'check' the room... she MIGHT have taken her own dirt to put on the sheets and look like ashes... who's to say?\n\nAfter a 15 minute wait, she returned, telling me that SHE KNEW we had smoked in the room, and she would not be giving my extra $50 deposit back!\n\nTHIS WAS INSANE!\n\nShe said there was marijuana all over the bed, and floor...\nI am currently a card-carrying Medical Marijuana user, but would NOT be careless enough to leave it laying around...\n\nAlso, the presence of un-smoked material, does NOT prove there was any smoking done in the room, [which was supposedly the WHOLE ISSUE!]\n\nTHEN she started to get rude, upset, and saying she would call the police... [which wouldn't have mattered to me otherwise, since I had done NOTHING ILLEGAL OR AGAINST ANY 'RULES'...]\n\nHowever, I did NOT have 3 hours to spend on a holiday Saturday morning, to fight this absurd and unreasonable lady's ordeal and accusations.\n\n\nI WILL NEVER BE RETURNING TO THIS [OR ANY OTHER] RODEWAY INN!!!\n\nThey have POOR BUSINESS TACTICS, and THEY ARE NOT ACCOMMODATING, in the least! \n\nThey also trick folks into ending up with a $100 room [when it was supposed to be closer to $47.]\n\nI am contacting their main office to discuss this further and possibly rectify a wrong... [Hopefully, I CAN GET my BADLY NEEDED $50 DEPOSIT  REFUNDED].\n\nBECAUSE:\n\n#1  They misrepresented themselves concerning their $50 room deposit policy \n\n#2  They CHARGED AN UNEXPECTED $50 ROOM DEPOSIT [Of which I was  NOT informed when the room was reserved]\n\n#3  There were cockroaches in the room [Bug-infested accommodations!]\n\n#4  Poor quality, UNCOMFORTABLE MATTRESSES on their beds\n\n[THAT was the 4th NEGATIVE POINT - and NOT REFUNDING THE $50 ROOM DEPOSIT was the 5th and FINAL straw!]\n\n\nI sincerely would like to WARN THOSE OTHER, FUTURE UNEXPECTANT GUESTS who are on a tight budget, like me, and help them NOT TO GET SCREWED BY RODEWAY INNS [LIKE I DID!]\n\nProviding they are looking for returning\/repeat customers, I sincerely suggest that they BEGIN TREATING THEIR GUESTS WITH A LITTLE MORE COURTESY, KINDNESS, COMPASSION, and UNDERSTANDING!
