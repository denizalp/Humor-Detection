I stopped in here for dinner with a friend while on a trip to Charlotte and the food was pretty good. The service wasn't bad either. The building seems a little small and when there are a lot of people there it can feel a tad cramped, but otherwise the atmosphere wasn't too bad. I liked Landmark Diner and would eat there again if given the chance.
