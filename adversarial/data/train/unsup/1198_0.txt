The decor is great, convenient location. My friend and I were seated, very friendly waitress. No complaints about the service. Food is where the issue is: my pizza was lukewarm, under salted, didn't get offered fresh ground pepper or parmesan.\n\nWhat really got me is I asked for olive oil... and the waitress told me they didn't have any. I was in shock, it  felt almost laughable. What Italian restaurant don't have or offer olive oil.\n\nOverall, won't be going back. It's a higher price point reasonably for the area and vibe. The food was a huge disappointment. Won't be going back or recommended Oretta.\n\nIt felt like all flash and no substance.
