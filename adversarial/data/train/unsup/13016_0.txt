This haunted house was cheaply put together and just a knock off of Rob Zombies movies. Sadly there wasn't very much originality and the tickets were overpriced for what it was. It was maybe a step up from a kiddie carnival haunted house at best.  My friends and I were baffled that Rob zombie could put his name on this
