Jillian really takes the time to listen to what you want and she even sits down with you for 5 minutes to talk about it. I have had times where I'm coming in for an appointment and she's running to get food and asks me if I want anything. She really cares about her customers and will do anything she can to make sure you're happy with your hair. Love her!
