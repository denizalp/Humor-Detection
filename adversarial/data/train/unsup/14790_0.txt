Upscale, trendy, city club done right. Def the best club I've been to in Charlotte, but, really, I haven't been to too many here. \n\nDress to impress, have a pro-female group ratio, go before 10:30pm and it shouldn't be too hard to get in. Oh, and it always helps to act like you know what's going on, not cocky, but confident with a dash of douche. Friday had a $10 cover, drinks are gonna cost you more than the Charlotte average, but def not over the top expensive. \n\nTwo levels with dance floor and bar on each. DJ was good (finally no Journey followed by Gaga!), spinning better mixes of top 40\/electronica\/hip hop (it works, I swear). I certainly danced my butt off. \n\nCrowd was more mature, everyone was dressed up, and no creepers were prowling the sidelines (that I could see anyway). \n\nPay for parking close to the club and free parking just a short walk away!\n\nLet's go again!
