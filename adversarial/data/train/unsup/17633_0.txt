The second highest population of Hawaiians are located at The California Hotel in Vegas. It's true! If you've been at this hotel, you'll know what I'm talking about. You know this place is good since you'll notice the amount of old timers here. \n\nAloha Specialties is my must visit when I'm in town. It's the same order every time. Garlic chicken served crispy on both sides. Gravy on the side. Comes with three slabs of chicken, rice, and mac salad. Hawaiian Sweet Punch is a definite must. One of these days, I'm going to ask them to spike it with vodka. I always forget to ask. \n\nNothing fancy. Just good comfort food and friendly people.
