I AM THAT KID IN THE CANDY STORE\n\nAfter eating dinner next door at Greens and Proteins, my friend and I walked by and I did a double take, not realizing Sweet Ruby Jane's was in the same shopping plaza--score!  Two bookmarked places in one night!  Alas, it was 6:20pm and before we could get inside, one of the ladies was already locking the door--closing time was 6:00pm!  As we stood peeking through the windows at the goodies inside, the kind lady had pity on us and unlocked the door-- talk about sweet customer service!  Because I then felt pressure to hurry and up and not delay their closing for the night, I didn't get a good look at everything Sweet Ruby Jane's had to offer, but what I did see  was delectable.  Chocolate-covered strawberries, pretzels, cake pops, chocolate-covered Almond Rocha (my favorite candy!), peanut brittle, and more.  We chose a few of the pretzels, a cake pop, and a brownie pop--for a sugar addict like me, that's nothing.  I highly recommend this place for its freshly made sweets and the outstanding customer service--you know I'll be back, giving myself plenty of time to browse the selection and spend more on the sugar.
