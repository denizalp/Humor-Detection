I stopped by Garretts to pick up a bag for my coworker who could not stop gushing about how great their popcorn is and I ended up picking up a bag for myself as well. The Garretts Mix is a great combination of sweet and salty (cheesy).  They mix their caramel popcorn with their cheesy popcorn together in one bag.  You basically get the best of both worlds!  The caramel is really sweet but the cheesy popcorn helps with the sweetness so it's not as overwhelming.  I'm not a big popcorn eater but the mix is pretty darn good!  Plus, for only $5-6, a small bag gets you a pretty decent amount of popcorn!\n\nIf you're in Vegas, stop by and ask for a sample!
