Someone suggested meeting here for lunch on a Saturday and since I've never been here, I decided to give them a try after checking out their website.\n\nTo get to Les Enfants Terribles, you have to go to what I consider the RBC area\/section of Place Ville Marie. There are signs within the main PVM complex so it is almost impossible to get lost. Once you get to the RBC area\/section of Place Ville Marie, you take the elevators, get out of the elevators and take another elevator to get up to the floor where Les Enfants Terribles is located.\n\nWe were asked if we had a reservation and we mentioned that we didn't and we were asked if we had an issue with sitting at the bar. We didn't so we were seated immediately.\n\nI ordered the fish & chips while the person that I was with ordered a fruit salad. I found the fish and chips to be very good. The fries were the type of fries that I liked (cut potatoes and didn't seem like they were purchased pre-cut from a grocery store). The fruit salad looked tasty as well.\n\nThe washroom\/toilet was relatively clean and well maintained. It is located outside the restaurant where you have to go past the elevator.\n\nAfter eating, we went to the outside to take a look at the view and take a few pictures. To prevent accidents or possibly jumpers, the entire area is enclosed behind glass so pictures don't really show an unobstructed view of the city as the windows weren't \"crystal clean\" on the day that we went due to the weather (but pictures were still nice)\n\nGoing to and leaving the restaurant, I found that the elevator can get very crowded which was a minor inconvenience.
