Very disappointed! I went once and got the spicy chicken sandwitches witch are my all time favorites there and I got sick and was in the bathroom. I didn't believe it was them so I went back two weeks later got my same and what do you know same thing happened this time to me,I say watch out here cause something isn't right witch is a total bummer:(
