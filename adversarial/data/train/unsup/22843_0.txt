One of my favorite casinos on The Strip for several reasons. One reason is the free parking and YES that is a valid reason to like a casino. \n\nThe restaurants here are excellent for those who are in it for the food. My  suggestions for eating at The Venetian are Bouchon by Chef Thomas Keller. I have eaten here many times and it is as solid as a restaurant from breakfast until dinner that you will get. Chef Thomas Keller also has two little bakeries inside the Venetian which are also called Bouchon. Other restaurants to try are Luxe Caf√© and Chica, also favorites of mine.\n\nFor those visiting Vegas the Canal shops offer decent shopping options but I know you can find better deals off The Strip. If you like pseudo gondola rides go for it! I did it once with out of town relatives and it was fun for my little nephew. As for me, I liked my gondola ride in Venice, Italy but my nephew was little and I don't think he knew the difference.\n\nHonestly, I do not gamble or have never stayed overnight here so all I can evaluate are parking and food. I think for a Vegas local, those are the main casino objectives anyways. ;)
