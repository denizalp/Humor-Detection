The business really makes a good impression.  The office is clean and welcoming compare to the other collision centers we have been to.  The staff are professional, friendly and very down to earth.  We were just driving by and I am so glad we did check this place.  The estimate was reasonable and lowered than the other quotes we got.  We got our car back today, and I think they did a good, neat job! Please continue to provide an exceptional service; it sure not easy to find in this city.  Thank you!
