dropped by tonight (saturday) around 7:30 and only one other table was busy.  Cool place to look at.  Only the chef as staff.  He had a limited menu and no license however we chose from what he had.  Food was really quite spectacular.   I had the 18 hour cooked pork shoulder and thick cut fries.  Companion had the steak sandwich.   We kept stealing bites of each other's food - as it was so good.  Prices were beyond reasonable.   This place is definitely an overlooked gem.  Hopefully, the clientele will grow - I really don't understand why it's not packed - I'm assuming the LLBO license has a lot to do with it but seems crazy to me.  This place needs to flourish.  Would have given 5 star for value if they had LLBO license.
