It's next door to the American Legion hall. That must be where most of their customers come  from. Everything just lacked flavor. Heck, I'd even take some salt. \n\nI wasn't expecting spicy or seasoned, as that's a whole 'nother cuisine. I just wanted some kind of flavor. \n\nAnd if I can't get flavor, I'll at least take some texture. But no. Instead of a fluffy, crispy batter on the fish, it was tough and a bit chewy. The breading on the clams was a little better, but still flavorless. \n\nThe only bright points were the steak fries and cole slaw, both made well. But how hard is it to screw those up?
