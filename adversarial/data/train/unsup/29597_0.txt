I've been going to Venetian\/Palazzo since 2007, It's was a wonderful hotel\/resort\/casino back then and it's still a wonderful hotel\/resort\/casino til now.\n\nTheir \"suites\" which are the base rooms for their hotel offer a more spacious accommodation than most hotels you find on the strip and the best part is that their prices are typically better too.\n\nI has been quite a while since I last stayed at the Venetian every since my in law's purchased a couple of time shares in Vegas. So twice a year, we go and stay for a few days and I get to stop by and have dinner at the Venetian\/Palazzo. This time, I had a seminar to attend and luckily, the seminar was at the Venetian. For the participants of the seminar, we had a special price of $149\/night. I checked in Tuesday evening and checked out Friday afternoon. Even if the hotel room was comped by my company, I still did the $20 tip during check in. The guy was pleasant and I got an upgrade with a view, view was decent, I was facing the T.I. hotel and was placed on the 24th floor.\n\nCheck in and check out was a breeze. No issues.\n\nThe only reason why I did not give this a 5 star is their gym. The gym itself was showing it's age. The free weights isn't really the best kind but overall the gym is \"okay\", usable for someone who just need to get a quick exercise in.
