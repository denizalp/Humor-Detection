Good family restaurant w\/gr8 gluten-free menu.  Variety of standard dishes.  I like the shrimp salad, gluten-free pasta, tomato soup, margarita pizza, duck tacos, tapas and drink selection.  The food isn't gourmet but it's well prepared, amble and the service is good.  Prices are decent and the place is spacious.  Menu is always changing.
