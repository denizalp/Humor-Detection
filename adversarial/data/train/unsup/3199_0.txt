This Cracker Barrel is located in North Las Vegas.  It is like all other Cracker Barrels in the USA, located right off the freeway.  Because it is away from the strip, coming here was easy.  \n\nI had the steak and eggs.  My wife had the catfish and my daughter ordered the Mac n Cheese.  Food was good and tasty.  The steak was cooked perfectly rare for me.  My wife was satisfied with her fish and the child all of her Mac n Cheese.  \n\nService was nice and quick at this Cracker Barrel.  We told the waitress that we were in a hurry.  She made a note to rush the order.  She came out to check on us a couple of times.  The bathrooms were clean.  \n\nIt's a nice little chain restaurant.  If they only had locations in California.  If they were closer, I definitely would be back.
