Everything was great for the first two months. Then he continued to change and push back my service day every week. Few weeks after that he came at 5:30 in the morning to service it because he was going out of town again. I texted him later to see if he came, because my pool was still filthy. He claims he had already cleaned and put chemicals in. He showed me a picture to confirm he was there. That's great, but you never cleaned my pool, and it was dark out. Why didn't you turn on the pool and spa light so you could see what you were cleaning? Long story short he decided to cancel my pool service, refunded me my money for the few weeks he didn't do. Stay away. He's always out of town on the weekends, constantly changing your service days. He has way to many contracts and not enough help or people to do it all. That's when you start to get real shitty service. My new pool company is available 7 days a week and even comes out on a Sunday to shock the pool after a kids birthday party.
