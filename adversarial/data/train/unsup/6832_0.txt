I love the way Phoenix has protected so many gorgeous mountains for use by the public. This is a favorite hike when I go to visit my family there. Squaw Peak is referred to as the \"stair master\" of hikes and it is pretty much just that. You will see runners up and down the trail, lots of dogs and families with small children. The trail is a bit rocky as well so wear sturdy shoes and be sure to bring water! Even if you are used to the desert heat, it's better to go early. Parking can be a real problem on weekends and holidays so you may have to stalk someone to get a space.
