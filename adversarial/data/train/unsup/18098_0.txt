Came in at 12:30pm on a Thursday and had no wait for a table. Score! The interior reminded me of a Friendly's, simple wood decor and very family friendly, but also a bit messy. There was a soda lid on the floor by our table and a fly that kept landing on my arm, but let's be honest, you're not here for the ambiance, you're here for their amazing selection of pancakes. \n\nThose babycakes...whoa. So good. I would suggest starting out with a short stack bc the sheer amount of sugar in these things will start to get to ya, but holy is it worth it. These bad boys are delicious. I had the pleasure of taking down a few cinnabun style today and I'm thinking of going back for more. Sweet icing on the top, cinnamon sprinkled throughout and just a few crumbled nuts on top, it was just like eating a cinnamon bun (Costanza style), but you get to dip it in syrup. Win. \n\nNot a sweets person and looking for eggs? Yea, they got that. They omelets are pretty standard and the hashbrowns are crunchy and not over-salted. You won't be wow-ed, you won't be disappointed. You WILL get jealous of your friends eating amazing pancakes.
