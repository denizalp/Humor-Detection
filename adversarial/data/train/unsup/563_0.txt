Chima is much better OUTSIDE of restaurant week. \n\n$35 option is the full rodizio, salad bar which isn't as full with a variety of offerings like standard days. \n\n$54.95 option includes above plus dessert and a few extra cuts of neat including lamb chops. \n\n\nIf you've never been then your first dining experience is best served during restaurant week. Afterwards go anytime and you'll be impressed. \n\nKudos for holding our reservation for 15 minutes over. I believe 10 minutes is usually the max but I called while en route. \n\nDined upstairs with a view of the realty office and I'm fine with that. \n\nThe gauchos that were attentive and thoughtful enough recalled medium well red meat. \n\nDined at 2:33p and it was a full house. Should have went for 4pm as it cleared out pretty decent.\n\nThe vegetable soup was more of a roux carrot base. Similar to baby food in a jar.\n\nOur server assistants were nice but I noticed one \"fake\" fold a napkin to stare down a diner to see how much he'd tip. \n\nMy server, Renzo, never brought out lemons for the water. \n\nUpon entry the seat was dirty. Idk how since they had only been opened 30 minutes -  cleaned it ourselves. White crumbs on a black seat... they stand out folks. \n\nThe attendant that clears the dishes was adamant about taking all things. No worries take the dishes. But seconds later she, Joheny, returned to ask if I was finished with the bill & I was so I replied in a knee jerk automatic, yes. She proceeded to lift my purse off the check holder - this caught me off guard -  and took the check book. \n\nI don't know if tips are not being shared equally in this place. Or if someone has hurt their trust but apparently tipping\/tips and the sorts is of urgent importance that service goes out the door along with manners. \n\nIf it hadn't caught me off guard I would have addressed it. Instead, it sealed the day to teach me never again will I dine here during restaurant week. \n\nI genuinely hope no one has taught them these habits. \n\nMy only other visit was wonderful and full price. Lesson learned: always opt for the full price day to get the full effect.
