Holy cow (may he rest in peace), they make a good burger!\n\nNow I can eat a 6 pound burrito without taking a breath, but there's something about burgers where my appetite suffers.  I love a good burger, but about halfway through, I fall apart.  The meat just makes me sick.  I end up throwing it out and eating the bun.  Not at Smashburger.\n\nI can order a small Smash and eat every last bite, and still want more!  And their fries are among the best out there.  I'm not sure what there isn't to like about it.  I guess I'll have to find an excuse to head to Marketplace this weekend and see if I can find something.
