Went here and had a great experience. The queso dip was different and really flavorful. The Sonoran hot dog was reasonably priced and tasty. Also had a shrimp taco which was probably my favorite. For dessert we shared the churro fries. Super fun way to finish the meal. All of this was made even better by our rad server, Shantel. She was very helpful and sweet. We will be returning here to try more of this place's unique tacos and their variations of hot sauces.
