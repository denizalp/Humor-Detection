Five stars for a five star experience. \n\nWe arrived at 11pm on Sunday evening and were escorted to a table where we (and a couple other girls) got a free bottle of vodka. Once that ran out, one of the guys at the club (a promoter? I'm not even sure--dont drink on an empty stomach, kids!) personally got us more drinks. The party was great for a Sunday evening and roping off the dance floor to keep it packed\/in front of the stage was a good idea. \n\nBasically learned the perks of being a woman. Ladies, find a promoter and get yourselves taken care of at Drais. Highly recommended.
