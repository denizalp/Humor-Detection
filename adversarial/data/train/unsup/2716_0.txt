Nice upend, slightly sophisticated feel to this place which I like. I've met friends here for civilized drinks (i.e. wear something other than jeans and a T-Shirt and not having ten drinks and getting smashed) and for dinner. What I like most about this place is the atmosphere and the service. One thing I dislike about Phoenix is that EVERYWHERE is casual. When I come here I like to dress a little nicer and like sitting at the bar having a glass of wine or a nice cocktail rather than slumming it elsewhere over a Miller Lite. \nThe food is good, not great. I am always bothered by a restaurant whose Surf and Turf is a New York Steak and Shrimp......in my opinion, the \"Surf\" should always be lobster. Not a deal breaker but that is one offering on the menu that bothered me. The best part of this place is the bar, and you should definitely check it out.
