With little to show from our shopping adventure, my friend and I treated ourselves to some refreshments before heading back out into the searing Vegas heat. \n\nOnce we walked in, the initial greeting was a good way to start our experience. The girls were quick to see if we were ready and then waited for us to make up our minds. A great thing about this place is that they know their clientele very well. I love how they list the item, price, and caloric value. My pomegranate ice tea was around four dollars and my friend's mango smoothie was $5.25. For the size, and where we were, this was a reasonable, if not surprising price. I was expecting something smaller as well. I wondered why ice tea would be 200 calories and then found out that they use the Odwalla pomegranate juice and plenty of it. The drink was tart and strong. It took a few sips to adjust, but this person who normally complains that food could use more of a zip was reeling. It was refreshing. The mango smoothie was sweet. I could not drink too much of it, but that is probably because I knew that one cup held 400 calories. Maybe what initially impressed me is more of a double edge sword.
