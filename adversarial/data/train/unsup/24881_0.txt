Ray's Return To The Chocolate Bar...a highly anticipated sequel to Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory starring me and lots spirits LOL jk. But there is lots of spirits and lots of chocolate.\n\nI always try a different martini when visiting and the martini of choice this time around was the Peppermint Pattie martini. Of all I've tried here, this one takes the #1 spot. The vodka is smooth, there's hints of chocolate throughout the cocktail and lots of peppermint. You also get the cool feeling in your throat that peppermints produce when sipping. In addition there's a York peppermint patty placed on top to enjoy after the martini is finished or while drinking, your choice how you eat it. \n\nThere's still quite a few martini's I haven't tried so the Peppermint Pattie martini will hold the throne until dethroned by another. \n\nThe Chocolate Bar continues to impress with great chocolate cocktails.\n\nDrinks 2\/11\/2018
