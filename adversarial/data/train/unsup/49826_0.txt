This review is based out of their freshly squeezed drinks. I haven't tried anything else yet in their store.\n\nI haven't been to Promenade in a long time, so I decided to stop by last weekend to see if anything new opened up. While shopping I started to feel thirsty, so I decided to stop by at the food court and noticed this lovely addition (yeah...I know it's been open for at least 4 years. It's been that long).\n\nI've been to the one in Eaton Centre, so I kinda have the feel what to expect. I took the small orange juice in addition to a small lemonade. I know they are freshly squeezed and not from concentrate, so I'm getting the pureness of orange and lemon.\n\nIn terms of the taste, it wasn't anything special compared to the Eaton Centre, but I enjoyed it. I can definitely feel the healthiness of freshly squeezed juice, knowing I went here instead of going to McDonalds to buy pop or something.\n\nA great addition to the Promenade food court overall.
