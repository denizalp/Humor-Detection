The clinic might be clean and the receptionist nice and polite, however, I couldn't get any medical attention at all. I drove 45 min from work to get to the clinic, walked in at 6:25pm and asked if I could see a doctor since the clinic closing time was 7pm. Immediately, I was told the clinic was fully booked. There was only a handful of patients in the line... When I asked if they could help me find any other location because it was important to me to get treatment asap, I was politely refused. Is healthcare a matter of luck?
