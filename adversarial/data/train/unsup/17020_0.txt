This is a toy store from the past and new. They have many original toys from the past like cabbage patch I've always wanted but never gotten one. If you're in Fremont downtown area it's worth checking this place out. \n\nI'm not sure if they have parking. I happened to be in Container Park area so I just walked over. It's located across from Walgreen store. It is downtown area so be alert.
