I have been going to this excellent hole-in-the-wall family run Chinese restaurant for 20 years. I introduced my wife to it a few years ago, and we go about once a month since. It is better than any place else you can find and the prices are excellent. Get the Dragon Dinner Special for enough food for leftovers for days, for $15 a person!
