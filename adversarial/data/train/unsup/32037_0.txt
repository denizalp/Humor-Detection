The beer selection is obviously very good. The food quality is nice, and really complements the beers, I guess everything really is centered around beers. Service is very friendly. \n\nThe draw back is that, it's not that big, and the bar area is usually packed. They do take reservation over Opentable though.  \n\nOh, order the duck fat fries, you are welcome.
