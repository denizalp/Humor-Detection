I like steak. After wanting to try this place for years, I had the open face steak sandwich yesterday for lunch. When it arrived I thought ok, I'm taking half of this home. Yeah, right, good luck with that one Anne ol' girl, as I licked the last of the juices off my plate. Onion rings, slaw, pickle...all good but a waste of stomach space compared to the meat. My associates both had the prime rib sandwich and loved it. \nThe atmosphere is completely old school, and the crowd was mostly men who, from the sounds of the conversation, are in the construction\/mining\/manufacturing\/heavy equipment industries. I can't wait to go back for dinner - maybe take the light rail.
