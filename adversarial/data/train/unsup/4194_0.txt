Walking through the hallowed land which is Tremont, Ohio on a warm, sunny, Tuesday afternoon. My stomach told me that I fucking needed ice cream; immediately. Turning my gaze to the North, I came upon the wonderfully simple, yet oh so elegant Churned Ice Cream Shop.\n\nDo not be fulled by the decor, this place knows gourmet ice cream. Flavors of a level of creativity I have not seen before, it demands an abuse of the unlimited free sample policy. Chatting with the eccentric owner while filling my mouthhole with the magical flavors she has concocted with her God-given ice cream talent (aka SKILLZ), I learned that all of the ingredients are organic (okay, aside from the cocoa puffs) and many local. \n\nI decided to get the purchase the carrot flavored ice cream (with coconut!) and chocolate passionfruit. It was awesome! Next time I am in Cleveland, I may undergo another quest for the magnificent frozen bovine mammary extract produced by this wonderful woman in her amazing, local establishment.\n\n\n\n                                     ***********   !!!!EAT ICE CREAM HERE!!!    ***********
