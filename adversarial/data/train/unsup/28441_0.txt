Arts On Atlantic is a very cool gallery in town. They carry everything from jewellery, journals and tea sets, to hand-drawn fairy tale books! \n\nWhat I absolutely LOVED about this store however was the service. Every single person that comes through the door is greeted personally. Then, on their way out, again, every single person is thanked for having come in. \n\nThe majority of the work in this store is sourced from local artists which proves just how talented our fellow Calgarians are. \n\nThe owner of the store, Stephen Murphy, happened to be in-store while we looked around and he was extremely welcoming and helpful. \n\nOh, and I haven't even told you yet! When I went over the weekend, all guests were offered cookies and juice while they perused the art! A very nice touch! \n\nOverall, I was quite impressed with this gallery. Between the art and the service, Arts On Atlantic has got a lot to offer our city.
