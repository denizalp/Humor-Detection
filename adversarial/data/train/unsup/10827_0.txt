Duck Poutine Pizza! \n\nWhat more can I say? \n\nWas recommended to this restaurant by the couple my fiance and I were getting dinner with. The couple is getting married soon and actually set this place as their wedding food caterer! My fiance and I knew this place HAS to be good and can't wait to try it.  As couples, we each shared a duck poutine pizza. We also ordered the fish donut appetizer and split it 4 ways. I wasn't too crazy about this dish so I saved room for the pizza instead. The caramelized onion and fries on the pizza.. what a delightful flavor profile! A good amount of duck but i'm not a big meat eater.. i would trade it for more caramelized onion any day. For desserts, we ordered butter tart and s'more pie? The s'more pie was sooo rich and I got chocolate-ed out fast. The butter tart on the other hand.. i can totally eat.. a dozen of these babies! The pie crust was amazing.. and warm sticky center. YUM\n\nA great dining experience. Hope to return to try other amazing dishes in the future!
