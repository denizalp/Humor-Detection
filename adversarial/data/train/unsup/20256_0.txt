The food was just ok. The prices are too high for the size of the portions, and the restaurant itself. The restaurant is small, very casual, and imitates a street taco style. There is only one kind of salsa at the salsa bar and no free chips are given. $7 for churros and ice cream? We left hungry and disappointed after the amount of money we spent at this place. Forgot to mention, we waited a super long time to get our food.
