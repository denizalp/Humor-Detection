After trying more items on the menu, sadly I have to downgraded the rating to 3.\n\n4 Star still for the Spicy Chicken! I would not hesitate to come back to just eat 1 bucket all for myself. Good tasting fried chicken worth all the hype and the wait!\n\nThe Yum Burger ($3.49) was the worst burger I tasted in my life. One bite that's all it took. I never want to eat something like that ever.\n\nThe lines are not as bad as before. But if you want no lines, come weekdays before 10:30 am.
