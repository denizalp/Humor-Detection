Took my fianc√©e here on a spontaneous date. Got the \"Secret Stash\" which was just the right amount of sweet, refreshing, and satisfying. Light, fluffy, pistachio-flavored snow (this isn't shaved ice like you're used to) with almonds, custard pudding, and caramel drizzle on top. We shared a medium and it was more than enough. \n\nIt seemed pretty quiet (although it was a Sunday) but most of the tables were still filled. I'd be cautious going on busier nights as you might get stuck without a seat. \n\nAll in all, a pleasant experience and a nice change from ice cream or frozen yogurt. We'll be back!
