(@Uber_TOR) UBER has become an integral part of my life. The convenience of the service and the fact that I never have to stand outside waiting for a taxi is incredible. From my condo, on average, if I order and Uber while in my unit, by the time I get to my lobby the Uber is almost always already there and waiting. \n\nWhat I also love is the variety of services. Most times I simply just use the taxi service, but when I want to make my dollars stretch a little I'll try the UberX option which is pretty much just a regular Joe like you or I, who has been screened by Uber and approved to accept fares.\n\nFor special occasions, there is nothing better than the feeling of ordering an Uber Black car or Uber SUV. The drivers treat you like a celebrity and many have little extras like candies, and water bottles to make your trip more enjoyable. \n\nI think some people contemplate driving after a few drinks when it's late at night because it can be so difficult to catch a cab. With Uber you can order one and relax, you have your cars specific number, you see a picture of your driver and they see a picture of you. When your cab arrives, no one else can take your cab.\n\nLastly with regards to customer service, I have to say that the few times I've had a less than exceptional experience, or felt that the driver didn't take an optimal route, I've sent an email to their customer response team and they've always been quick to respond and make amends for any issues - at the very least they're quick to respond and acknowledge that something is up.
