Decided to try something other then the usual dessert spots, we spotted c chocolate and have it ago. When we first walked in we noticed how big clean and spacious. I'm not a big chocolate person but the menu really had my mouth watering. We decided to get milkshakes to start we had the Oreo cheesecake and my match match man. They were a decent size and very tasty and are pretty to look at ! Next we had the icy hot pot which is a deconstructed s'mores with a scoop of your favourite flavoured ice cream which was good however the crumble in this dish could have been a little sweeter. The tiramisu I had was light and tasty and offered a real authentic taste. And some how we had room to still split a rocky road waffle which blew me away it was not to sweet but still really delicious would recommend this one for sure !
