My one star rating is based on my take-out experiences.  I occasionally get the lunch special which isn't terrible. I have had multiple issues with my take-out order, especially the order I placed tonight. \nI ordered one small white pizza and a large cheese, both well done. The white pizza was ready at least ten minutes before the cheese, and was in the warmer. Neither pizza was hot and the white pizza was dry and was lacking in the cheese department. I'm not really sure why it costs $12.00. It's basically just crust. The cheese pizza was better, but still not that hot considering I was waiting ten minutes for it to be ready. \nOverall I can't see myself going back. I've already stopped going to my local Barro's and I thought my go-to pizza place would be Venenzia's, but I guess not.
