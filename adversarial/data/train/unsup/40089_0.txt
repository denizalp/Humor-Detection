We went here before a show and I have to say everything was bad. We sat at the bar and didn't know we would be offered a limited event menu. We were granted permission to order nachoes off the menu which for 18 dollars had hardly anything on them. Both drinks I ordered were horrible. Also the chicken tenders hardly has chicken in them and were so gross. The bartender did the best she could but we will never be back to saddle ranch ever. PS the glasses hanging from the bar were filthy.
