I'm really torn between a 4 star and 5 star rating for this place but decided to round up.  Coming from New York, I definitely have my share of top notch sushi establishments in the city to choose from, but $80 CAD (~$60 USD with the current FX rate) for 18 pieces of fish plus dessert in an intimate 12 seat omakase restaurant is something that does not exist in the city.\n\nThe fish was very fresh, and you get some really high quality cuts as well (ie. uni, otoro).  Otoro and scallops were probably the highlights for me, and I also quite liked the monk fish liver which you don't normally find in a lot of omakases.  The fish was brought out at a measured pace (everyone is served at once) and the portion was just right although you can get additional pieces for a surcharge as well.  I loved the sesame ice cream at the end too since I normally like to finish with something sweet and not all Japanese restaurants will indulge me there.\n\nDO make a reservation since it is a very intimate setting, and request bar seats closer to the entrance since then you'll be served directly by Chef Yasu.
