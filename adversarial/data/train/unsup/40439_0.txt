Made the one mile walk along the strip to eat here for breakfast. Just like anything else in Vegas, it's overpriced but he food is good.  2 egg sandwiches with and orange juice was almost $30.  Everything is made fresh. It's located in a very fancy hotel\/casino. This place is BUSY! Get there early or you'll be stuck in line forever!
