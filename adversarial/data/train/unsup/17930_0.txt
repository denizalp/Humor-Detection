I tried, oink cafe, I tried.\nI came and ate your food a number of times.\nI had your coffee. I had your juice.\nBut no matter what I had it made no use.\n\nIt seems your staff would be somewhere else.\nIt seems you buy the cheese that comes pre-melt.\nI want to love you and to tip you well.\nBecause you're right there and you could be so swell.\n\nBut I work hard for the little money I make.\nAt a restaurant in fact so I know what's at stake.\nIt's not with pride that I make this 2 star review.\nIt's in hope that the truth will motivate you.\n\nBut for real, I've come in here like 6 times over the course of 8 weeks. The food is mediocre, edible greasy spoon stuff but that doesn't match the scenery. Though the staff is nice enough, I had the (mis)pleasure of sitting at the \"bar\" which apparently is where the staff goes to do their b****ing and I was thoroughly disappointed, particularly by the older one with silver hair - she doesn't seem like she has one sympathetic molecule in her body. All face value nothing genuine there at all. Anyway, I can handle all that I work at a bar and restaurant I know how it goes. But the final straw was waiting a longer than it took to cook and eat my food for me to receive my check. Quite actually, 21 minutes. And it wasn't even my server who noticed.
