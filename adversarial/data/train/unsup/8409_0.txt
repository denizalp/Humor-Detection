Many of us are aware of the story of Steve Wynn and Le Reve - that it's not a Cirque du Soleil production, but rather a Franco Dragone one which Wynn later bought the rights to so he could make his own little changes.\n\nYou can obviously tell when you watch it that it's not a Cirque du Soleil production - from the sense of humor, to the music, to the style of movement. They're all still incredibly talented and incredibly beautiful. It's refreshing, really................ except for the comedy, which is relative.\n\nWhen I had only seen two of the Cirque type of shows - Le Reve was my ULTIMATE favorite. After seeing the others... I'm ashamed to say, I fell prey to the worst thing one could do with shows like this - adjust their personal standards and allow desensitization. I know of many people who prefer Le Reve to O... and I'm not one of them.\n\nLe Reve is a must-watch and comes third in my list of Cirque & Cirque-like shows in Las Vegas, but if you could only pick two... I stand by Ka and O.\n\n__________________________________________\n\nIf I could do it all over again, I'd save the best for last and do it in the following order: 1.) Zumanity, 2.) Mystere 3.) Love, 4.) Ka, 5.) Le Reve, 6.) O - Haven't seen Elvis or Believe, but I'd bet they'd go well either before\/after Love.
