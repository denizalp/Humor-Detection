Not good at all and staff argued amongst each other the entire time and made the entire experience uncomfortable. Food is mediocre. If I could give zero stars I probably would. If you have work arguments with your employees (because yes, a manager was present) Do it in the back room!!!!\n\nRice is dry, and sauces are bland. Even the spicy one. The two other people I was with agreed that it is not good and we all ordered different things. Fish is fresh.
