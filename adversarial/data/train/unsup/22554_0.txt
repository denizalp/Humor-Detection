My man had a dentist appt right down the road and I NEEDED coffee so what a better way to have coffee is to drink it with breakfast! \n\nThe great review I had high hopes.  The food was mediocre, maybe I picked the wrong dish but it lacked flavor.  I choose the Leo the sandwich the flavors just all blended together nothing popped it didn't even seem to have salt, I was disappointed.\n\nThe service was great and everyone was very attentive but I probably won't spend over $2.50 for a cup of coffee again.
