This place services tasty dim sum until 3am.  The bartender at the sports book next door agreed with me that Noodle Asia is the best restaurant at The Venetian.\n\nThe shu mai and har gow are fantastic.  I usually get a beef dish over rice (can't think of the name) that is my favorite.  The service is very fast.\n\nI have eaten here at least 10 times and never had a sub-par experience so I would have to say they are very consistent.  The only thing they have done consistently that I have laughed about is that they always forget to give me a pen to sign the check with.  When I ask for a pen, they always say \"not again\".  Oh well.  I am never in a hurry near 3am.
