I am writing on behalf of a dear family friend who was diagnosed with stage 4 Pancreatic cancer.....\nAll I have to say is their Marketing team is excellent..My friends experienced the same treatment Cheri did in the previous review...They would not even talk to her until she paid up front?!\/! Excuse me, whey are we donating to \"Stand up 2 Cancer\" and other Cancer Funds if they can not assist the ppl who really need the help??Isn't that what CTOA claim..They have a heart...and care...Well all my friend received was a door slammed on her hope...I FEEL that they are despicable to do this!!\nCorporate America at their finest...No wonder our country is in turmoil...........If you donate money to this or any other cancer fund PLEASE check HOW the funds are allocated and make sure they assist the ppl that REALLY need it!!!\n\nYvette W\nSan Jos√©, CA
