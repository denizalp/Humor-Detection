Service\nFriendly staff. There were 2 servers looking after us. We always got what we asked for right away and never ran dry as far as water or drinks were concerned. \n\nFood \nFood was okay. I will think it was better in my previous visits. The curry was good, it would be a 10\/10 if it was a little spicier. Nothing a side of hot sauce couldn't fix. Unfortunately I can't say the same for the pad Thai. It was soggy and all lumpy. I definitely had better. \n\nEnvironment \nRestaurant was clean and cozy. Plenty of parking.  \n\nI would go back, the food is normally pretty good.
