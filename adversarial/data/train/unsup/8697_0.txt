You know what?  I take back my kind words on the spray tanning booth!  It's awful!\n\nOne day later and I'm left looking like I have some sort of skin disease!  The tan is uneven now and my hands have about 3 different shades of \"brown tan\" and my elbows are a weird shade of black\/brown.  This is horrible, no golden tan here!\n\nDO NOT spend your money on the spray tan booth.  Go somewhere where they spray it on by hand.  I know that's what I'm going to do next time.
