I've been to Landry's about 20 times in the past but have not been here for about three years so I went twice this week. The service is good, the ambiance of the restaurant is excellent. I usually sit at the bar this week I was with two small groups so I ate at the table. Got the crab cake both times. Super. It has changed from what I remember but is still excellent. A little bit more crab meat would be good but I still love it. The salad with house dressing is still as great as it always was. I went on Tuesday April 9th, 2013 the first time. My entree was the halibut which they said just came in. Now halibut was the first dish I ever had here about 10 years ago and it was so good. It was thick and just flaked apart when you touched it with the fork. On this day, it was about half the portion size, tough, and just didn't taste good. What a let down. The rest of the meal was great. I went again on 4\/15 and had the crab cake again (super), salad and this time I had the Snapper Hemingway.  Absolutely perfect. I woke up thinking about how good this piece of fish was. Can't wait to go back this summer for more. Its also about 8 bucks cheaper than the halibut. Also the light beers in the tall iced glasses make everything taste better.  Bill first time for 3 people with desserts $190 second time for 2 people no desserts $110.\n\nI guess I should have given 4 stars, but that Halibut was so bad and so expensive
