On the plus side, I was the only customer so there was no waiting. On the down side, I really haven't much idea what the place looked like or what kind of entertainment there was for people waiting. A TV? I don't know, once the stylist took my glasses off I couldn't see farther than about 10 feet. So, let's pretend it didn't have a pinball machine. \n\nThe stylist was young and hip and friendly. The haircut was quick and painless. I think I looked about 1000x better than I went in. So, that's worth something. \n\nOh, there was a TV built into the mirror. It was playing a baseball game so I ignored it.
