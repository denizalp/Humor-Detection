This is hands down my new favorite Italian style pizza place. I thought Brigade was \"it\" downtown but this is even better! I'm amazed it's a chain, but whoever is behind it is onto something good. If that means people all over Montreal get to experience some most excellent pizza, that can only be a good thing.\n\nSo the pizza. Oh the pizza! This pizza rivals some of my fondest memories of eating pizza in Italy (and no, not all of it was amazing there either). The perfect thin crust, but still a bit doughy at the edges. Enough toppings, but too much. Just right. I had a four cheese pizza (that day's pizza of the day) and it was delicious and the didn't skimp on the cheese, but there also wasn't so much that I felt ill afterwards (it has happened elsewhere). \n\nI found the price reasonable, especially the lunch special at $12. By no means a cheap lunch, but if you want to go out and eat a delicious sit down meal, it's perfectly acceptable. \n\nThe space itself is gorgeous. Lots of wood and light, and people crammed everywhere. There's a window counter for people watching while dining. The kitchen is right there and open, so you can watch the pizzas being skillfully prepared while you wait. It looked like they were working on an adjacent space that will add more seating, a welcome addition as most lunch hours there is a steady lineup of people waiting for takeout or to be seated.
