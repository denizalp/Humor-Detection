Not sure how this place has 3 stars. It is by far the best new york style pizza available in las vegas. I come from south green valley 40 min drive each way as often as i can for the excellent pizza they have there. If you are looking for the taste of an authentic NY pizza this is the place. I am from NY so my opinion holds a much higher value than that of a local or non new yorker. VERY GOOD PIZZA. Its that simple. I just wish there was a location closer to henderson ! \n\nPs please move store or open another !!
