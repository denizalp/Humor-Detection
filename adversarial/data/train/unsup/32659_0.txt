If you don't think honesty, integrity with reasonable pricing applies to most auto repair businesses, then you need to go to AJ's Auto Service.  They excel not only at being honest, helpful, thorough and customer oriented but they do great work as well.  I was referred to AJs recently.  My car just shut down on a freeway off-ramp - electronically, mechanically - with no obvious reason.   The car was towed and AJs was able to pinpoint the issue.  Can't say enough about the care and service - especially from Mark and John.  Highly recommend AJs Auto Service.  They will  certainly have my future business.    Mary H.
