I love to give a good review. Nothing makes me happier than spreading the news about a great business. However, sometimes an experience is particularly bad, and that has to be shared too.\n\nThis one star review is for their in-store clinic:\nAfter making an appointment online, I arrived at the clinic and the electronic kiosk would not let me complete the sign in process.\nSince the exam room door was closed and I could hear voices in the room, I sat down to wait.\nHalf an hour later, a woman emerged and called another name. I told her I had a 2:00 pm appointment and had been waiting since that time. \nThis practitioner proceeded to ask me and the next patient in line, \"What am I supposed to do about this?\" And also asked if the woman would wait while I had my appointment. When the woman said no, the practitioner rudely told me I should have knocked on the door to ask for help.\nI told her I would never knock on a medical exam room door when it was closed and a patient was being seen.\nShe told me I'd just have to come back later.\nReally??? \nThe long and short of this tale is that she should have apologized for her mistake. She had obviously been on a phone call and not stepped out to see if anyone was waiting. To blame a customer and then loudly berate them in front of a room full of people is unacceptable and the height of unprofessionalism.\nSave yourself the drama and go to Urgent Care at 3rd Ave and Thomas.  They're friendly AND professional!
