I still prefer my In-N-Out, which is closer to home.  I'm at this location at least once a month normally around lunch time.  This location is conveniently located off Sunset right off the freeway.  Entrance to this In-N-Out can be a challenge if you miss the left turn from Marks right before the Red Lobster.  I'm not the only fan of this In-N-Out.  The drive thru lines can get a little long at times, but I have yet to have wait longer than 10 minutes for my food.  I love the staff here. I've been here so many times in the last two months that the staff is beginning to recognize me. My order is simple...2 Flying Dutchman's, 2 waters, 1 spread, and 1 fork.  In-N-Out is still my go-to fast food burger.  See you soon!!\n\n2017 In-N-Out Review #2 \/ 2017 Yelp Review #19
