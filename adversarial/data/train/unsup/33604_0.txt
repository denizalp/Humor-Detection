13 minutes ago\n\nThis GameStop is the worst!! They lost my pre-order and had me standing their for 30 minutes while they run around to look for it, which they never found! So after all that time wasted they offer me like a $5 discount on another game was going to purchase right then. So I decided to not purchase it, don't wanna wast my money on pathetic service. \nI'll never go in to that location again. If I could give them 0 stars I would.
