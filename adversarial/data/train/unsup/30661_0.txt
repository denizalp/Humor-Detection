TLDR: Creamy decadent yummy ice cream.\n\nI have passed by this place many times and their line is always out the door. This is because they have a great assortment of homemade ice cream flavours to please all palates. I had to go with pralines and cream and maple syrup which both tasted like their namesake. The service is good and the portions are generous, but that may be because they are on the pricier side.\n\nPlease note this is a takeout ice cream place, they do not have any seating for you to enjoy your frozen treat.\n\nThe ice cream was tasty, but there are so many other places for me to try that I don't think I will be visiting again sometime soon.
