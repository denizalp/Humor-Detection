Went here last night with the hubby and a friend. First of all,  if you haven't been here before you are going to the Park Place Pub and the restaurant is in the back of the bar. \n\nEach of us ordered the Applewood signature burger with smoked gouda and apples on it. Though we all ordered a different doneness in the dimness of the restaurant it was difficult to tell if they were perfectly cooked,  but they were so juicy and delicious it almost didn't matter. \n\nThe fries were well cooked and seasoned and delicious, but if you like onion rings I definitely suggest and order of them. They were large and fresh and lightly battered with a delicious horseradish sauce. \n\nI personally thought that the drink ordering was a little strange. At the back part of the bar where the \"restaurant\"  is you can only order a few things like Mexican Coke,  IBC root beer and other bottled drinks,  but you can order regular sodas and drinks at the bar. \n\nI can't wait to go back and try more burgers!
