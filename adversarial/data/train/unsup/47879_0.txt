This place has so much potential but our first experience wasn't great. We started with the fried gnocchi and it was good but needed salt. We had a table of 7 and our food took an insanely long time to come out. When it did, my husband's baked scallops were dry and looked like they had been sitting under the warmer for quite a while. My nachos needed more flavor and had strange taste. Another person at our table ordered fish and chips and the fish was so dry is was inedible. We also ordered a margarita and ended up having to just send it back after two attempts because it was extremely sour and poorly made.\n\nOur server was friendly but not around very much. Knowing this place is owned by The Hub I have hope it will improve. We've been big fans of The Hub and enjoyed The Vue when it was open, but this food does need a lot of improvements.
