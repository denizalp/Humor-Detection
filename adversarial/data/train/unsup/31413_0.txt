After reading the great reviews here, we decided to stop by and try this establishment out. \n\nUpon walking in we were greeted immediately by a very nice female. We ordered the classic burger and the bacon burger. The classic burger was good. I asked for medium well, but my burger was served medium. Not a big deal, as I was starving. The burger itself lacked flavor. The bacon burger was good. Again, nothing spectacular, the burger was over cooked (asked for medium well) and lacked flavor. The fries were soggy....Quite disappointing! The tater tots were good (great concept), but lacked flavor. The food was good, but not good enough for me to want to return and have a cheat day. The service was EXCELLENT!!!!
