What a horrible club. So overrated\n\nWe ate at the restaurant and got free entrance to Hardwell, the dj for Saturday night.  Place is super crowded, literally no space to walk in the main floor. \n\nHardwell didn't show up until 2am! So I'm assuming all feature dj here don't show up till late to make sure you spend $$$$ on drinks\n\nBouncers incredibly rude they would not let you get on the main dance floor, he said it was \"Too crowded...back the f! Up\"  like it's our fault they let too many in, for a place too small?\n\nI yelled back at him, no space to back up . So he yelled \"just stay there then!\"  Wtf is wrong with their security? Did I just drop $400 on dinner so I can get yelled at by the bouncer?\n\nThe crowd was meh, Not enough cultural diversity. If Asians and edm are your thing this is your place.
