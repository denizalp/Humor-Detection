Shocked.\nShocked at how wonderful my pedicure was!\n\nI was a walk in, and I'm usually very hesitant about these 'walk in welcome' places, but this place was and is amazing.\nIt's spotless, and the staff are all adorable.\n\nMy $35 pedicure was quiet honestly, the BEST one I've had in a reeeeeeeallly long time. \n\nThe polish job was perfect, and the shaping was spot on. I can't still barely believe it! They didn't even rush me out. They had me sit with my little perfect toes under the drier for a long time - with a stack full of NEW mag's. I was in heaven. I have to admit. \n\nMy leg massage. I could actually feel my eyes rolling back into my head. The tv was on softly, and the radio was set to a chill station.\n\nThey use OPI and Essie nail polish. It' s miracle!\nNone of those dollar store crappy gooey messed up nail polish bottles you see at the other discount nail places around town. \n\nI will definitely be returning as a regular. Lucky for me, it's across the street from where I live.
