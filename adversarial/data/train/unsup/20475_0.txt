This bar is at the Tahiti Village resort. The bar itself was ok, not remarkable, but the bartender, Jessica, made it a favorite last stop after a day on the strip. She was professional, friendly, fun and went out of her way to make us feel special and right at home. I would recommend this bar to anyone because of her. Looking forward to our next trip to Vegas.
