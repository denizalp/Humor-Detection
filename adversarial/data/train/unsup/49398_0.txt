- A wide selection of classic buffet eats with accommodation of different cuisines \n- Very early switch-over time from lunch to dinner (dinner prices begin after 3:00PM), but they won't require a clearing of the buffet in order to begin dinner, so you are welcomed to stay \n- Servers are hard to flag down, but you'll need to ask for drinks and utensils from them \n- They blast the air conditioning in the buffet, making the dining area very cold. \n- There is no ice cream\/gelato bar, just a machine that gives you a choice of chocolate or vanilla soft serve\n- Line ups become brutal after 2:00PM. Come earlier if wanting lunch...\n\nWHAT IS OFFERED EXCLUSIVELY DURING DINNER:\n- Crab legs \n- Nigiri and Salmon Poke\n- Steaks and a larger selection of BBQ items and higher qualities of meat\n- Oyster \n- More dessert options (Creme brulee, cake, etc)
