I came into this beautiful restaurant to meet a few friends not expecting to eat. Walking in to this restaurant was very appealing to the eyes. The decor is modern and beautiful, the restaurant is very spacious and cleverly designed with private dining rooms used for business functions. The waiters and waitresses are extremely professional  and cater to all your needs.  Between 4 of us we ordered a strip loin and a rib eye steak with lobster tail and vegetables and french fries on the side. The steak was one of the best I have ever tasted. The fat on the rib eye steak was perfectly marbled into the steak and the striploin was flavourful and cooked to perfection.  I can't wait to come back.
