- dont want to burst any bubbles. but maybe i should.\n- paying $10 (in advance tickets) or $15 at the door is pricey for food that was free at the food truck festival.\n- i'll be honest, the food was good, but nothing really stood out as being \"i need to stalk the vendors\". street food is big hype at the moment because of all those tv shows, and i'm a proponent for small businesses being successful. \n- the venue being outdoor but covered is not the smartest thing to host during winter. i heard one girl had frostbite on her fingers (that's dedication...) and the free shuttle from broadview wasn't frequent enough (lot of folks gave up at took cabs)
