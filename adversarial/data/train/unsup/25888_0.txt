I usually enjoy the food at this restaurant and maybe it was the time we came here but I did not enjoy 2 out of the 4 dishes we got. We got the pineapple bun with butter which was okay. Then we had beef intestines noodles which usually had a great aroma when it hit the table and it didn't this time around. We also ordered the baked rice with ox tongue in tomato sauce and it wasn't amazing. Lastly we ordered a baked rice with fish in cream sauce it was delicious. My mom and I had a theory that we came in at the wrong time when the head chef was eating his dinner so that the noodle and ox tongue rice wasn't good. Then when we noticed that the staff was done their dinner and we ordered the baked rice with fish, it tasted amazing again. So avoid the 5-6pm hours (if you believe in our little theory)!
