One of the better places to get some quality food at a decent price without having to leave the Encore or Wynn.\n\nIt's pretty much on par with Zooza Crackers but because I went to Zooza prior to being a Yelper, I'll talk about Terrace Pointe Cafe.\n\nCame in here for brunch and what I like about the restaurant is that it is spacious and has a great view of the Wynn pool and the sun shines through the glass doors that provide easy access to the pool itself. It really is a nice way to get your day started and a nice option if you aren't feeling like gorging yourself at a buffet.\n\nI had the Wynn Burger and it was good partially due to the fact I was craving a burger. Nothing too fancy but it also didn't disappoint. \n\nA quick tip in case you're coming wanting breakfast options but instead happen to stroll in well into brunch time is that you can ask your waiter to provide a breakfast menu and they're pretty good about making what you want. It was nice because I went in thinking \"pancakes\" but my stomach and the inner-dude in me said \"get the burger.\" Though I must say the pancakes did look tasty from watching the people sitting next to us enjoying various breakfast items.\n\nIn the end, this place gets the job done and is a good affordable (most items are in the $10-20 range)choice as a breakfast or lunch option where you can sit on the terrace overlooking the pool. As for later in the day, I'd opt for Zooza Crackers just because it's situated in the center of all the hustle and bustle and it's fun to people watch from their open booths. Also a great late night option for food.
