Green is my favorite restaurant ever.  Price, quality, service, taste.  I recommend it to anyone (omnivores, vegetarians, or vegans alike) to stop by if they're anywhere near the area.\n\nI usually have the no harm chicken parm, which is delicious.  I think I've tried about half of the sandwiches on the menu and while they are all tasty, none compare to the no harm.  From the appetizers, I've had the crab cakes, which are interesting, but I wouldn't feel compelled to order them regularly.  I've also had the artichoke dip, which i think is fantastic.  I've had a number of the soynamis as well and they are a wonderful treat.  Pick from the already creative menu or create your own.\n\nMy girlfriend went to Phoenix last month and brought back a no harm chicken parm on the plane for me.  It was the best surprise!
