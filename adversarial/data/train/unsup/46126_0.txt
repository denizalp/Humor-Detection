A very busy place we came in one server for like 2 big tables and 4 smaller tables. Got Our Drinks fast though.  Food was good I got the steak and eggs but the steak was very thin and I like mine mooing and it was cooked all the way which is easy to do since the steak was thin.  Getting refills took awhile. Finally more servers came on but service was just decent afterwards.  Pancakes was amazingly good. Overall I do like the place alot and our server was nice.
