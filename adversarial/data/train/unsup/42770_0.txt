Went to Island Cafe for dinner tonight. Let me tell you this place is the real deal. Being born and raised in Hawaii I know the difference between Real Island Food and the want to be's. The combination plate was for real.  The boiled peanuts for pupu's made me think I was back home in Hawaii. Russell the owner is a real cool guy. Super friendly and makes you so comfortable.  If you hungry for Hawaii food head on down and try it. You will love it!!!
