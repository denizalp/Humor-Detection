I was selling some stuff to Buffalo Exchange next door and saw this cute little Farmer's Market building! I was in need of fresh veggies for a Thanksgiving appetizer and thought, what better than locally grown veggies?! So I popped in to take a look at what they had. I have to admit, I was a tad disappointed by their produce inventory. It didn't look the best and some of it looked like it came from a vendor, not a local \"farm\". They also didn't have a huge variety of veggies. I was looking for pretty heirloom veggies, colorful carrots, etc. \n\nThat said, they do have a pretty decent variety of vegetarian and vegan food options, many local, many just from organic vendors. They also have grass fed beef, organic chicken, etc. If you're really into eating clean and all-natural, this would be a good spot to check out. For me, it didn't really serve what I came for so I didn't end up buying anything. \n\nThe best part about this place is that they carry a lot of local products and for that, they get the 3 stars! They also have a market where you can pick up lunch!
