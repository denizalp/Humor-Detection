Went on a Sunday morning with friends and tried all the flavours. They were amazing, super fresh!! Try the doughnut holes too, if you can.  Favorites were the green tea matcha and classic. Everyone there was super friendly. Super cool owl mural seating area and vintage comics at hand, donut miss the chance to visit if you're ever in little Italy
