I didn't believe it when I heard that this place was simply one bar and no other seating. I stepped in line (which really is just...a makeshift line in the middle of the casino floor) and...waited. It was a bit late, so there wasn't that much of a line and we ended up only waiting for about 30 minutes. We struck up conversation with the couple in front of us, who also happened to be from California. We got seated and perused the menu. Small menu, so we made our choices pretty quickly.\n\n1) I will say that the service is a bit on the slower side. One server and two cooks.\n2) The food was awesome. You'd never think it, but the food is in total contrast to the looks of the place.\n3) Even though the service was a bit slow, we had a fun time joking around with the staff. The banter between us made up for the slow service and made the night that much more enjoyable.\n\nThe food was great. We pretty much licked everything clean. There was one thing that was even more amazing, though...So we look across the bar, and there was this girl that just could not stop eating. She was at her seat with her boyfriend from the time we took our spot in line until after we had finished up and left. From my estimation, she probably ate about $120 worth of food and beer all by herself. The funniest part is that her boyfriend only had one dish, some oysters and a soda. My girlfriend and I were so amazed that this was the only thing we could talk about the whole cab ride back to the hotel. The look on the boyfriend's face plus his body language when he received the bill was priceless!
