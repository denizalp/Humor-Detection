I'm wary of Yelp recommendations, as I've been led to some seriously mediocre food and non-existent places based on rave reviews from either fake, paid, or foolish people. I decided to give this place a shot anyway; it was the most pleasant dining experience I've had in years. I had a truly outstanding Masaman curry, and there was a great mix of casual and fine dining atmospheres. I suspect this place will grow quickly and lose the affordable, sincere charm like some other Thai places I used to love (Hi, Archi's!), but I'm going to enjoy it while it lasts.
