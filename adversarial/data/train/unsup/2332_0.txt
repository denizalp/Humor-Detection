This was the first restaurant I tried at the m resort. My friends and I had a great experience and would definitely come back again. \n\nPros:\n-quality food with great prices\n-$5 beer?! Woot woot!\n-best sweet potato fries ever\n-juicy burger \n-most crispy wings \n-be sure to try the fried snickers, it's totally different than fair food. Not greasy at all. \n-large portion of food\n\nCons:\n-limited menu, dinner menu consists mostly burgers \n-closes at 11pm\n-restaurant is open for breakfast. However, be sure to arrive EARLY to avoid lines!! Everyone will be there for breakfast because buffet does not open until 11am!!
