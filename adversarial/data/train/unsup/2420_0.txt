Being bored as I was, stuck in a city that I didn't know, at an airport that I didn't care for, I got a great opportunity to observe everything around me.  Weird as it sounds, it's one of my favorite things to do....sit and observe how people can be assholes....or just plan stupid.\n\nWhat Carolynne R. said about being bullied, I definitely wouldn't doubt it. It personally didn't happen to me, but I did witness several people get yelled at and lectured by the lady behind the counter. People were already distraught that their first U.S. Airway flight landed late....throwing them off by a few minutes, but to yell at them when they find out that they can't board the plane?...that's pretty messed up.  Flying alone, I DEFINITELY wouldn't have known wth to do...and I know that her attitude would have made me feel 10 times worse. \n\nCustomer service sure as hell doesn't seem like a priority for some of these people. Good thing I didn't have to deal with them at the counter.\n\nMy flight from Phoenix to Oakland was pretty amazing though. The stewardess on our flight was kind of nice. Had a great conversation with a man that I like to call my \"Puerto Rican Dad.\"  Best flight experience thus far...but it doesn't technically reflect on their service.
