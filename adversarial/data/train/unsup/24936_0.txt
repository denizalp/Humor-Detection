Peanut Butter Brownie Ice Cream.\n\nYes.\n\nLet's all take a minute, pause and appreciate that combination.\n\nMmmmhmmm. I originally rolled into Cold Mountain's next door (adjoined) neighbor, Jackson's Java. And then I walked around the corner and BAM, ice cream heaven. \n\nYep, Cold Mountain offers a nice variety of delectable ice cream flavors like Chocolate Caramel Cashew, Spumoni, Cotton Candy, Anniversary Cake and Amaretto Cherry. But folks, I highly recommend the Peanut Butter Brownie. Creamy peanut butter ice cream swirled with thick ripples of caramel and stuffed with chocolately brownie bites. \n\nAnd while the best part was the actual ice cream, the super friendly employee gave me the largest single scoop of ice cream I've seen in quite some time. We're talking softball size here, friends. My belts are quivering in anticipation of my return.
