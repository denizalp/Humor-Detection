With a preterm pregnancy loss in 2013 that led to me giving birth early to undetected twins. My doctor referred me to the high risk specialists to keep a watchful eye this pregnancy. The same doctor who saw me in the hospital before with the unexpected labor is the doctor who took such great care of me and my son. Dr Masaki is one of the best doctors in Las Vegas hands down. Luckily I've  always been healthy but just as precaution I saw Dr Masaki. I'm so glad I did. I had ultrasounds every 2 weeks until the doctor saw I didn't need to be seen as much anymore. I was sad not to see him he's such a down to earth funny guy who is very informative. I would even drive to the Post Rd location just to see him even though it was a very far drive for me and being pregnant I still didn't mind. I had a fairly easy pregnancy thank you God. All the staff and nurses are very nice and these were appointments I loved to go to because I knew I would get to see my baby every time, the office are super clean and you get seen almost right away every time. I've yet to bring my son to their office and give gifts to the staff which I will be doing soon. Amazing doctors and nurses who are ensuring safe pregnancies for women which is truly an amazing job and I am forever grateful for my Rainbow Baby!
