I thought this place was my little secret....looks like it isn't. I bought shoes from here during boxing day (amazing amazing deals) and I have been a loyal customer since. \n\nIf you are tired to shoes that fall apart within a year, and you want something that you can wear till it's sole\/soul (lol my attempt at a joke) is ready for heaven...(because these shoes just may have a soul you know)...then, Balisi is worth it. (wait till sale days though...since the deals are pretty good) oh no...did I actually reveal this secret? well, as long as it makes someone's sole happy, the secret is worth revealing.\n\nYes, it is pricier than your average shoe store, but as mentioned, wait for sale days...how do you know when the sales will occur...sign up for the newsletter (they don't send that much junk mail at all, only when there is a really big sale or something really worth checking out).
