Yum!!!! \n\nCreated by Kelly and assisted by his team (including the helping hands of Chef Mayra of former Pura Vida) of compassion comes Vegas' first taste of veg fast food.\n\nOur first visit was on opening day and there was a huge line, we waited about 20? minutes in line and their card system and register system ran out out of paper. No worries we had cash.\n\nWe tried all three sandwiches and we split an order of fries. \n\nThe All-American was good but I would suggest adding mushrooms. It kinda has a smoky flavor, which we are not real keen on.\n\nThe Chicken Sandwich reminded me of a Gardien chkn cutlet, light in flavor and the ciabatta bun complimented it well. I dipped it in a mustard aioli and it was yum.\n\nThe shining star for me was the Spicy Black Bean. It's not spicy, has great yummy flavors and was super moist\/fresh not gooey or too firm. BB's are hard not to get a crumbled paddy so I really like this a lot. Now I think the menu said it comes with avocado but for some reason mine didn't have it. Maybe they ran out?\n\nFrom what I saw the fries were just bagged Alexia organics. Now I'm not sure why they didn't choose hand cut organic, but maybe they ran out prior to our order.\n\nAs far as drinks my husband got a lemon\/lime soda and I got a box of water.\n\nRumor has it that a brick and mortar is coming to The Lakes...but I don't have any more info on that.\n\nGreat start for compassionate fast food.
