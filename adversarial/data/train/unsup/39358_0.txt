Came here for a quick breakfast and coffee during a visit to Montreal not too long ago.\n\nIt was a bit later on a weekday morning, probably around 11:00am or so. The Mon Cafe was pretty empty, and I was able to place my order within moments.\n\nI had the famous Montreal bagel, with a coffee as well. Pretty standard fare, although it would be nice to see the choices dressed up a bit. I was underwhelmed by the presentation and the value for what I was paying for. A small plate with just the bagel and a tiny cup of coffee. \n\nI'd go back, but I'm in no rush. The food was good. Service was fine. But I didn't see much value.
