Of all the gyms I've been to, Jab Fitness is one that I'll vouch for any day. The staff can be hardasses at times but once you get to know them, they are all professional, personable and friendly. The men and ladies of Jab know their stuff, and willing to give pointers, and tips, as well as be supportive towards your fitness goals. I've been going since March and always look forward to my boxing\/kickboxing workouts. With their wide range of classes and times, it's hard to have an excuse to not make it to at least a workout. And, the boxing\/kickboxing classes held in the afternoons and evenings weekdays are total ass kickers, you might want to puke, and your fat is gonna be bawling but the feeling afterwards is unmatched! A totally great sweat cleanse and by keeping up with the workouts, you're gonna feel good and look good! I always sweat glitter at Jab!
