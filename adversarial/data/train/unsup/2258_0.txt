Service was a joke. It truly, absolutely took 11 minutes to get a waitress to acknowledge my presence. \n\nNo happy hour menu. \n\n\"Communal bar table\" is a great idea but situated that you get bumped in to by staff with no apology. Or at least I didn't.\n\nFood is good but no thanks. Won't return.
