We ended up here for lunch out of desperation on 12\/22.  We had a party of 12 and were heading to the Las Vegas Discovery Center (for kids) and was looking for a buffet.  Golden Nugget was closed as well as the one at Fremont.  So we walked all the way to Main St.  Buffet is pretty damn cheap at $9 per adult.  Kids are $1 less.  IF you sign up for their rewards program, you get $1 off.  There was actually a line for this place.  I would say that it is a tad of an upgrade from Hometown Buffet.  service wasn't too bad.  The place is big and they have decent variety.  \nSome of the standouts...\nFried chicken was surprising good\nTri-tip\/Brisket was ok if you covered it with Creamy horseradish\nDecent dessert selection\nMiso Soup was good\n\nThe Bad...\nNo Mac N' Cheese\nThey had cocktail sauce but no shrimp to go with it\nNot too much for vegetarians.\n\nYou basically get what you pay for.  I wouldn't go back.
