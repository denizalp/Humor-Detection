I need to speak to Mary Montes. I have had a problem with getting a couple prescriptions filled because my insurance changed to Mercy Care after I was laid off the end of June. They don't take Mercy Care but they were very happy to try & help get it filled. This was over 2 months ago & talked to many people along the way but nobody is communicating with anyone else, including me. Then today I hear back that they now won't even see me for my pellets, which are out of pocket anyway & I've always paid. I had been laid off for a year, 2 yrs back & paid for pellets out of pocket, as well as the office calls. But since I told one of the girls I was having problems with people communicating with me, she called the next day & told me I can no longer come in for my pellets. She also implied that Mercy Care was for poor people & I shouldn't be on it. She has no clue of my situation or the insurance system, apparently. I left a message for Mary to call me but I doubt she will receive it. I have been very happy with Mary Montes & feel the pellets have helped me, but now I can't even talk to her. My name is Joy Alberico.
