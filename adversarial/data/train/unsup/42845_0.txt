This is my go to pizza place in the Eglington\/Chaplin area.  Great prices, quality food (no skimping on pizza toppings and things like bacon are actual Butcher thick cut bacon unlike that dehydrated bacon like flavoured crap you get at other places) and the staff a great too. My only complaint is the acoustics in the place. It's often filled with families and screaming kids and it can be really difficult to hear who you are talking to. If you would prefer less kids dining and hear yourself think, head over after 8pm or do what we do often now, get the pizza take out!!!
