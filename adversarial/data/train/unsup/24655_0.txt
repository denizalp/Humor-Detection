Skip all the -berto's, skip Juan's, if you are looking for a consistently delicious Mexican taco\/burrito shop, go to Regio's.  When I first moved here two years ago it was called Antonio's, somewhere along the line they changed the name to Regio's and I was afraid my delicious secret was gone, but the menu remained unchanged.  LIke the others, the food is so cheap I periodically try to run the numbers to see how they could possibly be profitable (to reassure myself it is not a drug front), and while I haven't cracked that equation, I also don't equate them with crack.  See what I did there?\n  Standing favorites are: all of the breakfast burritos, Shrimp Burrito or Tacos, Carnitas or Adobada Burrito, and Ceviche Tostada.  My only real word of advice is if you order a standard meat burrito, tell them to go easy meat and load you up on the salsa, guacamole and diced onions and cilantro.  My first few burritos were so thickly stuffed with meat...(insert inappropriate meat-stuffing joke here).  The only things really preventing Regio's from five-star status are that they are not 24 hours, and I have an unconfirmed suspicion that one visit may have given me food poisoning.  I am still searching for the real killers.
