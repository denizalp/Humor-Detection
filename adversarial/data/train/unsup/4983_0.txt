OMG.  A Tahari OULET!?!?!  LOVE.  \n\nHalf of the store was marked down.  I love getting to the register and having the item rung up and shocking the sales staff.  \n\nAll the shoes were an additional 30% off.  \n\nBought an entire outfit for $460:\nPatent leather pumps $145\nBubble sleeve sweater $50\nButton down sweater w\/a chiffon neckline & belt $75\nStraight leg jeans $190\n\nService was fantastic.  She was quick and willing to hunt down the appropriate sizes.  \n\nOnly a stones throw away from the strip, selection and sizes galore, I'm bringing my winnings here everytime.  \n\nNot sure where the other outlets are in the nation, but I asked about CA, and it's in Palm Springs.
