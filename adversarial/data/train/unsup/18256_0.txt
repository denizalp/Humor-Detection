On Saturday night, Oct 30, 2010, I got a nail in my tire.\nI was just finishing up one Halloween party and heading to the next with a caravan of people when someone pointed out... \"YOUR TIRE'S ON THE GROUND!\"\n\nWell... of course it is, silly... but, OH! I see what you mean.\n\nSo a darling friend of mine with a gorgeous Spanish accent said, \"Girl, go that that fixed! That's dangerous! Follow me.\"\n\nSo I hopped in the car and drove slowly to this 24 hour tire shop. In my mind I thought, OMG. I'm soooo not going to make it to the next party.\n\nBut guess what? I was the belle of the ball because I drove into this shop and they had me in and out within 10 minutes. I still had plenty of time to go home for a costume change.\n\nIt cost me $15 to get the nail removed and the tire repaired. The blaring mariachi music made the ordeal all the more festive. Open 24 hours. This place was a godsend.\n\nDon't use fix-a-flat when you've got this place in your GPS!
