This was my second time to Thai House! My first time was a few months ago, it was my very first time trying Thai food ever. I stumbled across this little cute restaurant by looking for a restaurant close to ikea. I'm glad I decided to try something new that day. Since then I've tried multiple Thai restaurants & NONE have compared to this Amazing little authentic restaurant. The staff is friendly and polite. The restaurant has dimmed lighting, very relaxed. \n\nI recommend trying the Thai ice tea and the Thai ice coffee!! BEST EVER!!
