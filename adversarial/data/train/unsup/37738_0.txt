We engaged with Nicole Pavlik Law Firm to update our family trust and individual wills.  We found her most knowledgeable and professional.  She reviewed our existing paperwork, and Nicole made recommendations as to how we could streamline our documents and simplify the process for our beneficiaries when the time comes. We won't hesitate to work with Nicole Pavlik in future when we have other legal matters.
