I'm happy to have a breakfast here anytime.  Weekends tend to have longer waits than week days. They send you a text when your table is ready!  Starbucks next-door so you can chill with a coffee until your ready to be seated.\n\nSnooze serves different kinds of Mimosas that are refreshing on a hot Arizona morning. Seems like they are heavy on the OJ and light on champagne.\n\nI know their Breakfast Pot Pie is delightful!  It includes their homemade rosemary sausage gravy smothered inside a flaky puff pastry, topped with an egg anyway you prefer!  Comes with hash browns too. I have also had their Huevos Rancheros which is OK.  They have several different Eggs Benedict breakfasts on the menu - the Chile Verde Benny is good.  It has pulled pork over a stack of green chile sauced tortillas and melted cheese with poached eggs and green chili hollandaise, pico de gallo and cotija cheese.  FATTINESS!!\n\nClean bathrooms and lots of parking nearby.
