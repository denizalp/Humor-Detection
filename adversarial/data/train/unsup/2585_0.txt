Holy cow!!! They don't serve your food on a plate, they serve it on a big platter!! So much food that if you're not a big eater, I suggest sharing a plate.\n\nMy husband and I came here with the family and we both got different dishes to share. I ordered the granola waffles with eggs and a side of sausage. At first granola waffles didn't seem to appetizing but I wanted to try something other than the regular vanilla waffles. Every single bite of that granola waffle was yummy!! Every bite tasted fresh and not frozen. \n\nMy husband ordered the chicken and waffles and that tasted fresh as well. The chicken was juicy, nicely seasoned, and did not taste greasy at all! \n\nThis is a hot spot for tourists so if you're coming here I suggest you come early! We went around 11am and the waiting area was crazy! They are also remodeling the hotel so can you imagine we were like a herd of cattle waiting for our party to be called. I think for our party of 7 we waited between 30-45 minutes, but so worth it. Per our waiter, Lawrence- he said the best time to come is on Wednesdays. \n\nIf you have kids, don't bring the strollers if you don't have to. Although the dining area is big, they ask that you leave your stroller behind the hostess area, which is pretty small.\n\nFor the amount of food you get, the price is totally worth every bite! Consider me a fan and next time I'm in town we're definitely eating here again!!
