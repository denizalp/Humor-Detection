A fun experience all-around! My daughter and I just finished a photo shoot with Tolga (studio owner). We had SO much fun!! We weren't sure what creative direction we wanted to go but they have many different backdrops, furniture, props and even some costumes to help spark the imagination. At the end of the session we went through the photos and picked the ones we liked. Tolga did some editing on the spot to give us an idea of the finished product. He is a GREAT photographer who makes the experience fun and memorable. The proofs are already gorgeous. Looking forward to going back. Thank you!!
