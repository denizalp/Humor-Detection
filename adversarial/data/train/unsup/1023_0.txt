Food here is always very good. Great quality and quantity. I'm impressed, as I find it hard to get good sushi and sashimi. They offer a nice variety and the service was very helpful and friendly. \nThe parking in this plaza can be a little tight, so be patient and careful. I've almost gotten hit with a crazy driver flying thru lot. ;-\/
