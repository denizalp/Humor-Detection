This restaurant nailed it for us on service, fresh and delicious food, portion size and price. Our little group of three went for lunch to Marigold Maison on a weekday. Upon entering we were greeted by a friendly hostess and invited to sit wherever we'd like. Water was filled immediately and the service was outstanding, friendly and warm.  The platter offers a sampling of a few items and is a good way to go if you are unfamiliar with Indian food. Both the platter and the chicken kati roll were outstanding.  The flavors are fresh, tasty without being over seasoned, and if you like spicy don't be afraid to get hot.  This native Arizonan went for medium and found little to no heat - but I didn't miss the spice, as all the flavors blended together so well.  It was a completely unexpected treat to have cuisine that tasted this good in town.  Would love to have this restaurant in N. Scottsdale.  Prices were completely reasonable and portion size was perfect.  View the menus on their site:  http:\/\/www.marigoldmaison.com\/   A totally refreshing and enjoyable experience - we'll be back!
