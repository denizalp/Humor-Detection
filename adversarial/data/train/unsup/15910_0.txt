I love Trader Joe's! We are more than delighted that we no longer have to take the trek to East Liberty to get our Trader Joe's staples at their unbeatable prices. Sadly, it's still in PA and there's no wine section......sigh. \n\nI'm not sure how Trader Joe's consistently finds the most courteous, joyous people to staff their stores but that's what you find in every location - and we've hit a lot of them across the country, mainly to do a good wine & snack run for vacations. \n\nAlthough I love this store, they designed a couple of the spaces a bit tighter than typical. Exiting the cash registers is especially tight trying to navigate people bagging, carts, children, etc. The store can also get super congested at the entrance during busy times. \n\nEveryone can no doubt compile a list of the reasons they return again & again once they've discovered the goodies in store here. I've surely got a long list!
