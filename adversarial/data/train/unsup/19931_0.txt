I've had no complaints about Greyhound service to New York City from Toronto. Greyhound buses today have more legroom, and free WIFI! Greyhound and Trailways often share the same routes, schedules and most often, buses. At midnight or the wee morning hours, immigration and custom checks are a breeze. These  few reminders will make your trip to New York City a piece of cake:\n1) Reserve way in advance ( at least three weeks) and you will be saving  almost 50%.  Compare that to a $320 RT flight to NYC, and that's the cheapest!\n2) Take the last overnight bus. It's  just a matter of sleeping the trip away! Leave from Toronto  at 9:30 or 10 PM and by the time you wake up, about 8 am, you will be ready to have your breakfast at  Au Bon Pain at the Port Authority in New York City.\n3) Take a Tylenol, Advil , Melatonin, any muscle relaxant after the US Customs in Buffalo ( 2 hours from Toronto ) . This will help you sleep the rest of the trip.\n4) Don't forget your IPOD or MP3 to block out noise at night.\n5) Wear a sleep  mask or very dark sunglasses.\n6) Wear comfortable shoes or socks.\n7) Bring your own blanket.\n8) Bring your own pillow.\n9) Avoid  eating or drinking liquids after 7PM or  earlier so you don't have to visit the washrooms in the bus. Gross by many people's standards, IDK, as I've never been in one!\n10) Make sure you report to the driver any inconsiderate cell phone yakkers around you who yak long and loudly therefore disrupting people's rest ( remember you are taking the overnight bus for a reason). This  is your right! As for crying babies, well, sorry...\n10) Relax, stop stressing and enjoy the trip! These drivers are experts and have driven this route hundreds of times!\nAs a former New Yorker now living in Toronto, I've always taken the overnight Greyhound Bus to  New York. It saves me a lot of money and hey, no touring  time lost here as I'll be sleeping overnight anyway! Hope this helps!
