I used to visit LAS all the time. It's been awhile and I booked a flight\/hotel w\/Spirit! A reasonable tour package! Like 1\/2 the fare on the competition.  I flew w\/them before and it was a great bus ride. Just stuff your stuff under the seat. They lose a star because it's been my experience that  there are 6 wheelchairs on and 2 off!?! It must be what happens in  Las Vegas! A jackpot!
