My dreams are made of shops like these...\n\nMargaret's is a cute little store with a HUGE selection of loose teas and coffees that are ground to order. Shops like this are disappearing and i'm so happy to have found one here. \n\nIf you're looking for hard to find Torani syrups, they have a big selection of them here too. It's a great place for gifts as well if you have friends that really enjoy good teas and coffees, as well as all the fun little things related (sugar spoons, honeys, cute teacups and pots, biscuits). \n\nI typically buy a quarter pound of a few coffees every few weeks now; it's more expensive of course (slightly) than buying a larger bag of grounds at the grocery, but the coffee is fresher and tastier.
