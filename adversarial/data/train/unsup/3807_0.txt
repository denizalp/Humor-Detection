Yes..its big and confusing and my walk from the small prop plane gate to Customs was ridiculous.  But I can forgive all that because of the Excellent Customer Service in the form of guides and attendants to answer your questions.  \n\nI must have seen over a dozen in a half hour as I walked into the terminal, took that long march (no people movers and no bathrooms) to Customs, took the shuttle to my Terminal and then to my gate. \n\nThey were all pleasant,  all smiles, all professional as can be.
