Really well made food! Tastes just as if it were home-cooked. I discovered this restaurant when I was on vacation, as I needed a vegetarian place which served Indian food. Not only is their food amazing, but they also have very reasonable prices and a good quantity of food per dish. Their Shahi Paneer is amazing!
