SO MUCH FUN! I! I came here for my 24th bday celebration and this was the highlight of my trip! I gotta say Steve Kim was AMAZING. He is so sweet, nice, and genuine. Go to his facebook account write on his wall and he'll hook you up with discount tickets! The guys were a lot of fun! Come here if you want to see raunchy dry humping, people being tied up, personal strip dancing, gyrating butt cheeks, and hopefully you can get up on stage and get to cop a feel!\n\nThey were really interactive with the audience and were really gentle with the more hesitant audience members. By gentle I meant grinding their near naked bodies in their face to slap some fun into them. It was a fantastic show and it left everyone screaming for more. \n\nAfter the show you can go across to the bar Blondies to drink with the boys, take pictures, get autographs. This was an awesome show before you go clubbing. Really heightens your mood and pump you up. I had this natural high after coming out of the show for the rest of the night.
