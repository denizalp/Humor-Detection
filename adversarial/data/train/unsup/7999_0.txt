1p.  When there's a hot dog stand and 3 cabs waiting in the parking lot, it's officially a tourist spot in Vegas. \n\nWhat they need are cut outs of the Pawn Star guys for all the people posing for pictures under the famous Gold and Silver Pawn Shop sign. \n\nWhy am I here? Because it's still early and I need to keep away from the tables.\n\nAbout the place. while Rick and Chum Lee are the stars, the regular guys working there are pretty chilled. They actually do pawn, buy and sell stuff.\n\nWe checked out a pair of Art Deco platinum and diamond opera glasses; but passed on its pricey price tag.  How pricey? As in thousands pricey.\n\nWe left wondering who would pawn such a piece?  Celine the Queen needed some extra cash and cashed them out?  Next time i'm in Vegas, I'm going to ask about the opera glasses.
