Been DYING to come back here after Misti's wonderful CMYE at LVG last month.  The restaurant.com coupon made the meal even better although $35 worth of food for 2 is basically a buffet at the table :P\n\nLVG has the best ribs I've eaten in Las Vegas.  It's true!  I'm all about St. Louis style ribs now and on the verge of texting baby back ribs to tell them we're through.  The juicy tenderness and smokey flavor make them truly unbeatable.\n\nThat's not the only thing that's awesome here.  Thai green curry sausage!!  Amazing.  Phil's a genius!  Not me but the owner haha.  The bbq chicken is also super good.  The breast was actually juicier than the thigh somehow.  The red cabbage, red potato salad and pasta salad sides accompanied all the meats perfectly with the pasta being our top favorite of the 3.  \n\nWe were on senior citizen time and ate dinner around 4pm so we were the only ones in there.  We chatted it up with Phil for a good part of the dinner and he informed us of some great new additions to the menu coming up in December like prime rib and double smoked ham.  Like you needed more of a reason to come here...more of a reason to come here everyday!!!
