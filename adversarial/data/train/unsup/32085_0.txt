Decent pierogies but not the best I've had. I've eaten @ Pierogies Plus two times. Both times I got the potato & cheese pierogies. They are good however they come in WAY too much butter\/oil. They are probably soaked in at least a half a cup or more of butter\/oil. When I get them I have to take them out of all the butter\/oil b\/c it would make me completely sick if I ate them as is. Other than that the pierogies themselves are decent. \nHowever, they are pretty pricey. About $12 for 1 dozen. \nRecommend eating here if you're passing through or nearby but I wouldn't go out of my way.
