Today I'm sadden, I have been eating Thai Food from locations mostly on the east side, we happen to see this location and decided to try.  Mi Krob is my favorite appetizer except for Satay (beef) with peanut sauce.  The Mi Krob was NOT cooked (actually partially uncooked) correctly and tasted of dirty oil and maybe sweet and sour sauce gone wrong.  Shared with the server but instead server just said would you like to take home. Mi took it home becuz wanted a second opinion, they agreed nasty ended in the trash.  \n\nThe Pha Thai was okay except shrimp were not cooked crunchy.  Peanut sauce was okay.  What I did notice was that most people stuck with menu items that are more Chinese style than Thai.   Prices were $$$ pricey.  I'll stick to the East side for Thai Food.\n\nI've read some of the reviews and comment on soup right on...  Save your money and go East Phoenix for Real Thai Food.
