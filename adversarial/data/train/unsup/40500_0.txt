Went here with my fiancé before a TIFF movie a few weeks ago. It was completely empty. We got seated right in the middle and saw about 6 waitresses standing around doing nothing, just chit-chatting with one another, checking their phones, etc. It honestly took about 20 minutes until a waitress finally realized we were there. She apologized and said she didn't know that the section we were seated in was her section. She was nice about it so we let it slide (at first). We placed our order, she didn't write it down. She came back about 10-15 minutes later confirming our order (Ie: what flavour of wings was it again? Did you want beef on your nachos?) so she hadn't put in the order at all. We waited about 30 minutes for water, even after asking her two times. She came back and said, \"Oh yeah, the water!!!\" and still didn't bring it to us for another 10 minutes. She also kept forgetting my fiancé's rum & coke, took her another 15 minutes to bring it out. Mind you, the bar was DEAD the entire time. There was maybe 4 tables max. Every time we looked over, our waitress was chit-chatting, not getting waters and not getting our drinks. She was ditzy and very forgetful. She did apologize but after many mistakes after mistakes, apologies don't mean anything. We're lucky we got out of there on time to make our movie. My reco to the management: Efficiently staff your bar so that they aren't hanging around not doing anything, also, tell them to get the hell off of their phones and to tend to their customers. It's not that hard to fetch water when you've got about 11 patrons in the entire establishment and an excessive amount of waiters\/waitresses chit-chatting away and ignoring customers.
