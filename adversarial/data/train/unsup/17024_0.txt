It's Houston's what kind of revelation were you expecting? Uniformly excellent service administered by the manager \"T\", who is always gracious and helpful; and every dish prepared exactly the same way every time. My favorites are the Hawaiian Rib-eye, french dip, and Thai Beef and noodle salad. Ice tea is dark and fresh and cocktails are strong. Nice outdoor space for lunch as well, despite a bit of road noise from Camelback. I eat here at least once a month, typically more and have never had a bad meal or service. True, it's a chain a foodies like to bitch about \"the man\" but they do what they do very well.
