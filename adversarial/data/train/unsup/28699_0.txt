Today was our first time to Loco Patron (North Scottsdale location) and we were so disappointed. This is a new location in Scottsdale. At first glance the menu looked a little expensive for the items listed, but we thought perhaps they might be worth it. They were not. I had the Protein Salad. The ingredients sounded great but upon arrival, the salad had a very little bit of all the listed ingredients  (i.e two tiny pieces of cheese, the equivalent of 1 strawberry, and couldn't find the other items.)  with the exception of the black beans which covered the entire salad; and overwhelmed any of the other flavors, and the entire thing was one big soggy mess. I spoke to the server about it, and he said he would tell the chef, which didn't do much for me. My husband had the carnitas salad. The carnitas were very small \"pellets\" of meat. You couldn't really tell it was carnitas, and the overall taste of his salad was very bland. This was our Valentine's lunch and it was so disappointing (can't think of another word that best describes our experience). Doubt we will be going back.
