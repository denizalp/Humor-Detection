If you remember one thing about this review, remember this:  Olympic Garden is more about QUANTITY vs. QUALITY.  \n\nThe upstairs is more fun than downstairs. Naturally.  The environment is different.  More fun and relaxing.  Maybe a little bit of crazy.\n\nDances are $20. If you're going to get a drink, it might as well be an alcoholic one.. because they are about the same price.  (Coke vs. Vodka and Coke)\n\nIf I were to rate the women's area, I would give it five stars.  The men's area, is about.. 3 stars.  \n\nThis place is filled with smoke.  :P
