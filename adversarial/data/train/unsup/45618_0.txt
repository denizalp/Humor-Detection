I have been going to Shaina for a while now for all my waxing needs. I love her new location. It is so close to mountain's edge. It is a great addition to the southwest part of the valley. Ladies getting a brazilian never gets any easier. However, you are in great hands with Shaina. She has such an upbeat personality. Shaina will have you laughing during your entire appointment that you actually forget your getting a brazilian. Her technique is quick, so you're not there thinking how much longer is this going to take. Check her out if you live in the southwest part of the valley.
