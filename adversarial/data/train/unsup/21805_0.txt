When I think of a coffee shop. MoCa epitomizes this thought. Perfect intimate atmosphere. I took a hint from P.W. And got their chai tea, and it's pretty fricken good. I am a huge fan if their drinks. The guy there steams all my coffees to the perfect temperature. I hate when I have to wait to drink. Moca has a great menu and all their stuff is made in house. \n\nI often see the musician through the window at night sometimes. Which is cool where I'm from you don't see that in a coffee shop anymore, ironically. \n\nOnly con is that they have a $5 min on plastic. So I usually am forced into buying some chocolate expression beans. Which I'm not complaining about, I love those damn things. \n\nDon't bring outside food in. They have food there. \n\nKeep it up MoCa. I like your style.
