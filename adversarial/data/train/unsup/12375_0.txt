Do not, I repeat, DO NOT listen to the three star review below that states, \"This place sucks! Wtf is this??\"\n\nWell buddy, if you just take a few minutes to understand the whole concept of this restaurant, then you would know what this place is about and it doesn't suck! They serve the taco with meat plain for a reason!! You customize them the way you want with as much or as little jalape√±os, onions, salsa, etc you want! It's great and I love it!\n\nOnce you add all the toppings you want, that $2.99\/taco is a steal - hefty and delicious! They don't even skimp on the meat. Two tacos and some fries were enough for me and the service was really friendly too!\n\nOrder and pay at the counter, pick up, dress your tacos, eat it up then head out the door to go on your merry way - It's easy, painless and simple!
