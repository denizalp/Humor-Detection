I definitely love the vibe here. It's almost like a biker bar with live music every night and pretty good BBQ. The employees here are also quite interesting. They all look like bikers with long hair and beards with tattoos everywhere. I love the mismatching tables and chairs all over and there's a large patio outside as well as a larger bar downstairs when they have concerts.\n\nThe menu is loaded with pulled pork, brisket, burgers, steaks and basically any BBQ dish you can think of. It's also very well done. I would recommend the pulled pork poutine at least to try once. The pulled pork was my favorite thing here. They also have a decent beer selection and full bar which you should be glad to take advantage of. I probably won't make my way up to Calgary very often but when I do this will be a place I will come back to. Check it out!
