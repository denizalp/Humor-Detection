This place is truly amazing. Wasn't expecting much but was really impressed when I came. The pianist played so well and sang so well throughout the night. Was totally mesmerized by the music. The drinks were very cheap too. We order 4 drinks for only 30 bucks. Would definitely come back here again if possible.
