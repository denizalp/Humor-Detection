Brunch food, is always fun food; always social food. \nIf you're looking for quality and affordability, you're at the right spot.\nZada Jane's Corner is my pick for a relaxed Sunday brunch. While they have large outdoor area for when it is nice (isn't it always nice in Charlotte?!) they also have large indoor restaurant. \nMy friend got the hummus frummus salad, and I had the Blazing saddles. We opted for the coffee and we both left satisfied. However, If you like, you can treat yourself to mimosa or a manly man-mosa.\n\nFour Yelps
