Pretty impressed with this place. I usually go with my sister, so I always call to make sure nail places can accommodate 2 people at the same time for pedicures. And usually, they can't. But here, it was a little wait past the appointment time, but not too bad. The ladies were very nice. $25 classic pedi. All the techs were Chinese rather than Vietnamese, which was different. These ladies at least weren't busy talking to each other while working on your nails. My tech, Candy, took her time on my feet... and sad to say... I have bad feel due to work. Eww.\n\nTheir color and design selection was organized. Seems they only use OPI and Orly, or 3 different brand of gels.\n\nI would definitely go back, though it is a bit further out than I would like to drive considering there are so many places right by my house.
