holy hell, why have I not eaten here before. Bomb ass food!\n\nOk, so I had the thai ribs and the market street tacos. I got really ghetto and just ate in the car. \n\nThai ribs fell apart just from touching it with my plastic fork. It was a nice asianish flavor with a background taste of orange, which I normally hate but it was very good.\nCame with a slaw which I was put off by since I hate mayo. But to my suprise ....no mayo!!!! It was like a sweet vinagrette with cashews and cranberries. Very nice.\n\nThe market street tacos had some steak, cheese grilled onions and avacado. This was also very good. It would have been about 100 times better minus the corn tortilla. The steak was super tender. \n\nI am now obsessed with going back for breakfast!
