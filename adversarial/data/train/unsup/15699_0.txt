Really great hole in the wall place literally! Tucked into the corner of an abandoned liquor store building, we missed it when it was right in front of our eyes! Parking was easy, service was relaxed, patrons mostly seemed like local regulars who kept to themselves. Our waitress had professional service and was kind enough to ask how we wanted our checks split before we ordered which was helpful. I ordered a BLT on toasted sourdough with mashed potatoes & gravy. My SO ordered a steak dinner with peas & mashed potatoes with gravy. His brother ordered a Paul Bunyun no pickles or onions with fries and his girlfriend ordered home style potatoes with her three egg breakfast with wheat toast. Our son had chicken tenders with fries (he normally has an organic breakie of fresh fruit & veggie juice in the morning w\/egg, vitamins & 1\/4 whole wheat bread but we're on vacation so this is what he gets). \n\nGravy was okay, peas were canned, the steak was actually a large ground beef patty to my SO's disappointment but everything else was delicious and I loved my BLT.\n\nDefinitely a great locals spot to get some cheap eats as long as you have a decent idea of what to order ;)
