In short, my sandwich tasted like the great depression but the service was great.  If you need more info, read on.\n\nCame here after a 5 1\/2 drive expecting the best sandwich I ever had.  I was served grocery store-quality \"roast beef\" on stale french bread; their Roast Beef sandwich.  No flavor and a serious lack of saltiness.  I can literally make a better tasting sandwich using Oscar Myer lunch meat and table condiments than what I tasted in your roast beef sandwich.  The sandwich sucked; no flavor, no excitement.  We had to add ketchup, salt, pepper, and hot sauce to make it anything other than bland.  I have had better food from back-woods gas stations in Louisiana at mid night than what I was served here. \n\nAnd the beer menu was mediocre, at best.  No hard hitters, just a couple local beers and generic bullshit.  \n\nOn the other hand, the fried pickles were great.  And the wait staff were awesome.  They had some pretty big parties to deal with at really busy times and handled it well.  Wait staff was 9\/10 but the food was only good enough for the steel workers of the 1930's who needed to fill their bellies with something for energy.  \n\nI'm not planning to go back to Pittsburgh, but if I do, I'm not going to this place.  It wasn't worth the trip, wasn't worth the money, and the food (at the very finest) was mediocre(and that is being gentle), \n\nAlso, parking was shit.  Enjoy paying an additional $8 2 blocks away for something my kid could have made better in 5 minutes than the 80 minutes we spent there.  \n\nI get it, this place is a local legend, but it's sad when every fast food sandwich I have ever had in my life beat what I got for less money.  I've had better sandwiches at Arby's,\n\nMy advice:  Locals must not know shit from their asshole.  There are a lot of other great places around this location, go there.  This place really did suck.
