Canadian Tire is open for emergency car repairs on a Sunday. I glided into this location a few years back (pre-Zipcar) when my automatic transmission went out and I couldn't go or stop on command. They fixed me up for less than $200 and I was able to get in and out within a few hours.  Other local garages aren't even open on Sundays and probably would have taken a day to get my car back to me if I had waited til Monday. \nInside Canadian Tire, they have everything AND a kitchen sink.  New shower spout, deadbolt locks and little screws for every DIY project.  I use my Canadian Tire money when I go to distant lands in my fake wallet. I haven't had it stolen yet, but I'd love to see the look on the criminal's face when they open the wallet to discover hockey -themed money.
