$10 minimum to use a card....booooooo!!! \n\nVisited on Tuesday 7-5-16 around 9PM.  Once I got past all the cigarette butts outside the front door I stood in the foyer awkwardly for a few minutes wondering what to do.  There is no hostess stand...there is a counter but the cash register was facing outwards and it looked more like  POS for the waitress instead of a counter for ordering.  \n\nFinally a worker appeared and I ordered and she let me know it's a $10 minimum to pay with a card.  WTH?  You're running a drink shop...most drinks are less than $10!  It shows a lack of consideration for the customer and it also tells me the owners are cheapskates. It bothered me much more than it should have.  I should have walked out right then.  \n\nI paid almost six bucks for a strawberry-banana slush with boba.  Their boba is a good consistency...very fresh and squishy!  But the slush did not taste like real fruit and melted before I could enjoy it. Something was off about the flavor...I can't put my finger on it.  I ended up pouring it down the drain and THANK GOD I didn't drink the whole thing because the few sips that I had gave me the WORST upset tummy ever.  \n\nYou gotta pass up a lot of good boba places to end up here.  The place is dirty and laid out in a confusing way.  I'd say pass on this one!
