In N Out is always incredible! While some locations are busier than others, the customer service remains top notch all across the board. Frankly, with how busy they do get (there's ALWAYS a line) I'm amazed with both the food they put out, the time they do it in, the accuracy they do it with AND with a smile?! Really?! You guys are wonderful!\n\nThe short wait has a lot to do with the streamlined menu. Fries, shakes in three flavors, regular burger, cheese burger, double cheese burger.. yep. That's about it. Everything off the \"secret menu\" which is no secret, are just variations from the ingredients found on everything else. A simple Google search can pull up the entire menu for you. My cat would be upset if I got In N Out for myself but neglected to get her favorite- the Flying Dutchman.\n\nMy usual - a cheeseburger with light spread, grilled onions, add pickles. Their burgers are perfection in a fast food burger. Squishy toasted bun, sweet grilled onions, salty meat, cool tomato slice, crunchy cold iceberg that gets slightly wilted from the heat of the patty.. you just can't beat it. It's an experience!
