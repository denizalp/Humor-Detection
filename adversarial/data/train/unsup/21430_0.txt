Oh. My. God. I never want to step foot into Toys R Us ever again. I'm scarred. I should have taken the carriages blocking the entrance (and exit) as a sign to run the other way. I literally had to climb OVER the stores carriage to get in... the shelves were empty, the staff was playing Hide & Seek and the children were howling at toys they couldn't have.... I'd much rather buy something online through them and pay the $22 shipping fee than ever walk into the store again.
