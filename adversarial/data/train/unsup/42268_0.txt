One of the best restaraunt's in Las Vegas.  I always feel like every dish is prepared just for me.  Everything is fresh and done the long way, the chef doesn't take short cuts and every dish has the flavor to prove it. I love the staff who go out there way to make me feel at home,  Best Middle Eastern food outside of the Middle East! The lentil soup and the falafel are the best I have ever tasted and I get all the hot sauce I want!\n\nAfter a resent trip, I feel like I should amend this review. When the owners or family are not there, the food is merely ok. The soup was watered down and the food was missing its punch. No lemon juice squeezed on top, no spices.  You need more reliable employees. That care about your business. The food was so bland, it made me not want to come back
