I tried Taverne Gaspar for a 5@7 one night and was pleasantly impressed! I was worried that because of the location that it would be a tourist trap, and although there were tourists enjoying the place it was far from a tourist trap. The prices are reasonable with great oyster specials (1$ per oyster between 5pm and 7pm all week). There is an all-you-can-eat fish and chips night which is a great deal because you also get a litre of the Gaspar beer on tap. The oysters were nice and fresh! The service was helpful and friendly. I like it when you ask for a suggestion and they give you a straight answer. The worst is when you ask for a suggestion and they read you the menu - I can read thank you very much! The staff was knowledgeable and professional. I will definitively be back soon and often!
