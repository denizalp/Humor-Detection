This place is hidden in a little plaza south of Steeles Ave on the east side of Kennedy Rd. If I hadn't seen it on Yelp with all the positive reviews, I'd have never known it was there. That would have been a shame, the service was very friendly and the portions were quite big. \n\nMy friend and I each got the katsu burger, very nicely plated with coleslaw on the side. Pleasing to the eyes and the palate. With nice juicy pieces of chicken, shredded cabbage and some nice sauce to top it off. \n\nHave been back since my first visit and again was very pleased and will definitely be back again.
