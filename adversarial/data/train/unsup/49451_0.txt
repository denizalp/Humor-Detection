This review is late. I realized I hadn't written a review for my favorite boba place after I had been mentioning while reviewing other shops. (Shame on me!)\n\nAnyway, the girls who work here are friendly and efficient! One would be taking the order, and as soon as I'm done ordering and paying for 2 SUPER sized drinks, the other lady from behind the counter comes out with our drinks before we even step away from the counter. WOW.\n\nThe flavor of the Milk Tea is on point, in my opinion, and the boba has great consistency. I have also tried the matcha green tea, the passion-fruit mango, and chocolate chip flavors. I loved them all!\n\nThis replaced No. 1 Boba for me, and has been one of my regular stops.
