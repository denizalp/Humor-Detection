I cannot explain how much stress this man has put me through. After I scheduled my class, he called me explaining he didn't have the actual cpr cards but he would give me a copy. He seems pretty nice at first. He even offered me a refund afterwards because he coukdnt give me the actual card. The next day I told him yes, I would like a refund via email. He didnt respond so i tried calling him. He ignored all my calls. Finally, He told me he would issue a refund the next week (it was a friday). I then emailed him back wanting reassurance that he was sending it in 2 weeks via mail. It's been 4 weeks since our initial conversation about the refund. And 2 weeks since he \"supposedly sent the check\". I'm out 55 dollars and he refuses to respond to emails. I wish I would have never found this scammer. I do not recommend him at all.
