I chose Computer Repair Las Vegas because of their excellent reviews and I have not been disappointed.  I have gone to them for three times over the last two years.  Each time, excellent service.  Last time, DJ did not want to charge me for fixing the computer.  Very very knowledgeable.  They don't want to make money on you.  You get the feeling that they want to provide you the best service at the lowest cost.  I will continue to go to see them.  I can't recommend them enough.
