The museum was fun! There are some interactive features in almost every room. There's a lot to read but my boys didn't really want to read. It's takes about an hour to walk through unless you take more time to look, tread, or do the interactions. There's a flight simulator that most of the kids did. Only a few adults did the interactive games. For the price, I'd make sure everyone had a chance to do the interactive games. It's hard to get pictures of the costumes due to a glare from the protective glass. There are a few great props to take pictures with. I brought nine year olds, which seems to be a great age to see this place. We had a good time. We came here before going to see the new Avengers: InfinityWar movie.
