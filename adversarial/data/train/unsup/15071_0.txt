It tries, but at the end of the day 944 magazine is basically an Old Town Scottsdale party picture rag (usually featuring the Dirty Scottsdale crowd) written at the 8th grade level.  \n\nDon't believe me?  Flip to the back and see the last 30 pages or so.  Multiply by the number of cosmetic surgery ads and bar\/club ads and you've got a lofty quotient.  The party pics are usually why people check it out.  Kind of like when married men say they read Playboy for the articles.  RIIIGGHHT!!\n\nThey are starting to cover Phoenix and Tempe a bit more than in the past, but it's primarily a Scottsdale 20-something society\/nightlife magazine.\n\nPlus if you want to see a magazine clown and insult its unsuspecting and not-so-bright readers, check out the Letters to the Editor.  I mean, wow.\n\nbtw, 944 is named for its old address when its offices were located on Mill Ave.
