I have been to this restaurant three time so far and it's safe to say every time it gets better and better. The service is fast, the hostest is friendly, and the food is cheep. I have had pho many times before and this establishment stands out on a league of its own, for its great portions and food that is obviously cooked from the heart. I will continue to visit the great eatery, and enjoy every minute of the Vietnamese pop music ;) \n\np.s the pha thai is killer
