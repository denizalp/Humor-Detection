I'll start off by saying that I know I only saw a small portion of the overall museum (and I wish I was able to see the natural history side too). Despite that, I thought that this was a very beautiful museum and the exhibits were done very nicely. The Egypt section was probably my favorite and while the hall containing the sculptures was nice, it was kind of a bummer to find out that the majority of them are replicas. I would definitely recommend this to any art or history lovers out there and don't forget to go next door and see the dinos!
