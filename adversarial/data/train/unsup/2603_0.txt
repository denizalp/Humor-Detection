I came here tonight with Miss Sarah Louise. In the seven minutes we were there, we got tea, had a seat, and watched as an eldritch gentleman took a bite out of a cake; laughed loudly and muttered to himself, \"WHAT IS CAKE??\", threw it out and then paid for it at the front counter while giggling that it had been delicious. \n\nBut, my chai *is* delicious and warmed my hands on the cold walk outside :). Will have to come back in the daytime when cake wasters aren't afoot.
