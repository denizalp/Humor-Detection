I booked this place for Thanksgiving weekend because a friend of ours had a free room. \n\nCheck in left little to be desired. We got in around midnight and it still took us 30 minutes to check in. There was one guy working who I thought to be doing a good job whereas everyone else was either on their phone or talking to each other, obviously NOT helping us out. \n\nThe regular rooms (non promotional) are clean and spacious. I don't like that they provide you a tub but they don't give you a stopper so you can't even use it.\n\nThe selection of restaurants is okay, not great. The Starbucks takes forever.\n\nI do like their sportsbook. There's a lot of places to watch the game and the people at the counter are friendly enough\n\nOverall not a bad place to stay but definitely not my first choice when there is tons of competition in Vegas.
