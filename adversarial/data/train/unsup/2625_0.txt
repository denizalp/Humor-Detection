Hubby and I stopped by to grab some sandwiches to go. The line wasn't too long to order at all and it was about a 10 minute wait time to get the 2 sandwiches which isn't bad considering there were other take out orders waiting ahead of us.\n\nHot Pastrami ($17.99) - You can add cheese for an extra $2, I added Swiss. I asked for sourdough bread and that wasn't a problem. The pastrami was tender and delicious. I was impressed that the bread didn't break while eating the sandwich, it held the meat nicely. Some people think this place is too expensive. I personally don't mind paying the price per sandwich because it's stacked, tasty and filling. The sandwiches also come with a whole pickle and you can add a side of fries for $2.99. \n\nI've eaten inside a few times years ago, but have only done that when company is in town and wants to come here. Hubby and I usually just pop in to grab a couple of sandwiches to go. They also serve breakfast, soup, salad and have dessert. Carnegie is located inside The Mirage.
