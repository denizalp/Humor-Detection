Don't pay for their sorry excuse for a mini-golf course! It's like the zombie war already happened and they took all the mini-golf maintenance workers hostage instead of feasting on their delicious brains, they buried them in the Loud Bro-Overloaded and Depressed Pimple-a-saurus Teen Fist-Pumping Athlete volleyball court and then the zombies drowned their domestic beer cesspool of a crappy beach themed bar. The Radio Disney alone would've killed off most of the people but with thick skin, I endured one game of bowling in addition to the wasteland of a mini-golf. It was okay.
