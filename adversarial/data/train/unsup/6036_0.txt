Hopped back into Bath& Body last week and again today. Felt the need to let my fellow yelpers know how great this place is. I found everything I needed and left one happy customer with plenty of wall flowers ( plug-in air fresheners ) and yesss more lotions ,omg they smell sooo good with vitamin E too.  Yay!!\n\nThe trails supervisor Alex (also very helpful & friendly), is doing a great job making sure Bath & Body Works here in Summerlin has a friendly staff, super selection, and is very clean and organized.\n\n  Special thanks to Shae for my wonderful experience at Bath & Body Works today. Awesome customer service is a plus as well as product availability. This place has both.\n\nI highly recommend this Bath & Body Works for your go to location!
