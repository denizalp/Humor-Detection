I obviously can only give a Domino's a 3 star rating or else what would you think of me? but seriously Domino's is at least edible after decades of being part of the box it was delivered in. The cheese is stringy and tastes like real cheese, and the sauce actually tastes pretty good. Overall, I will at least consider Domino's for pizza when I want something quick and in a hurry.
