I had a great experience last time I came here. I was really turned on by the hot ass barbacks, so I came back to see if there was any fresh meat... and there was!!!\n\nI put on a sexy low cut dress just incase I caught the attention of one of them. They are always so HOT and are always working so HARD. God I was turned on (about a 9\/10).\n\nI walked past the glass washer and saw a NEW BARBACK! He was SO HOT. He looked like a cross between Michael Cera and that nerdy guy from Criminal Minds. \n\nI was so nervous I made a blubbering fool of myself! I wanted any excuse to talk to him, so I asked him where the bathroom was. He stopped polishing and smiled at me, my heart melted. He said, \"It's right there.\" As he pointed to the door behind me.\n\nI sat in the bathroom thinking about a time not so long ago where heads would turn when I entered a room. All of the men would lust after me, and now I am getting older and am losing my desirability.\n\nWill I ever love again?
