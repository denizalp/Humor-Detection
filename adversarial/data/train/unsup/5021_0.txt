Awesome job! I brought our man-child here for his pre senior picture haircut and shave...our kid had a huge head of hair and full beard, think Teen Wolf. Tony took care of us and did some great work. The shop is clean, he took his time and even had a good conversation to our son (who is autistic so that really was greatly appreciated). We found our new barber today. Thanks Tony!
