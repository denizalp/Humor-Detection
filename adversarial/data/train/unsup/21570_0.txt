Local businesses everyone: get out there and support em'! I absolutely adore Sipyard, from the cycling hipster culture, to the local brews including Triptych- in my opinion they can do no wrong. On this particular and first visit I had the Tart Blueberry Ale. They weren't lieing about it being tarty, it was more on the sour side, yet somehow still intrigued my tastebuds; it was the perfect balance of beer with a cider taste, perhaps cider notes from the blueberries? Upon furher inspection of my can, I noticed Tie-Fighters and Starships from Star Wars; I love it! Not to mention the slogan on the side of the can, \"These Aren't the Blueberries You're Looking For\" except to me they really were, go figure. From tasting to \"reading\" the ole' side of the cereal box, I was highly satisfied with my purchase and I'd like to try more. If you're a people watcher, their out outdoor, like further out front door, seating is great for relaxing and watching. For a Wednesday Sipyard was pretty packed and I don't blame the patrons- the seating was so creative and artsy, I can't wait to come back for the ambiance alone, and of course, to try perhaps another one of their brews. The bartender was highly informative and had great reccommendations which I'll have to save for my next review with more of my amigas.
