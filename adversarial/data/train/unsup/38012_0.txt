Good hotel off the strip, close to airport\n\nThis hotel is great if you want to be away from the crowded loud strip, the staff is nice and they have a shuttle to take you downtown. \n\nRooms are clean and well kept. I dont really care much for the free breakfast, but it is free so i cant argue with that. I always come back here when im just passing through for the night
