This place was impossible to find. Had to run around Planet Hollywood like two times before we figured out that it was downstairs. Ah well.\n\n$20 for the buffet, and you're in. There's a ton of islands along the wall for various food genres, including, but not limited to: seafood, Italian, Mexican, salad, Middle Eastern, Asian, and desserts. Kind of bummed that there's no crab legs or prime rib, but oh well. I didn't expect it to be there for such a low price.\n\nBuffet food is subject to being dried out\/unfresh after sitting under a heat lamp for a few hours, and some of the food was definitely suffering as a result.\n\nBut, some of the highlights: shrimp, loaded potato skins, burger sliders, tandoori chicken, enchiladas, and (wait for it...) the crème brulée. The crème brulée was such a pleasant surprise.\n\nWhile Spice Market has its ups, it's a more mediocre buffet on The Strip. I give it a firm \"meh,\" but I'd be willing to give it a second chance if there was a coupon.
