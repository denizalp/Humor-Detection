I had a great experience for my first visit. Our waitress was attentive and nice, always checking in to see if we needed anything. The cheese curds here are AMAZING! I'd eat them everyday if I could, lol. I ordered the cowboy burger & it was great- no complaints! I also had the cucumber-pomegranate mojito. It was very refreshing. I will definitely be back here.\n\nSomething else I like is that there is a private parking lot- thank goodness I didn't have to find parking around East Wash. I also took note to how clean the restaurant was on the inside. Great atmosphere, great experience overall!
