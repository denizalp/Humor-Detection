Awesome opportunity to get produce and help a great cause. \n\nToday I went with my mom and we got lots of veggies some fruit and even a sandwich, bread and butter. \n\nSo the way this works is that you give a $10 donation and you can take up to 60lbs of produce home. I split this with my mom as we didn't want to take more than we would use. There was a delay with the truck today, however this is for a good cause, so it's worth the wait! It's well organized and a great deal for everyone, while reducing food waste! Today I got 8 giant bell peppers (4 green 4 red), 8 zucchini, 2 pints of black berries, cucumbers and acorn squash were unlimited, 8 Roma tomatoes and 12 yellow tomatoes (mom also too a loaf of bread, a lb of butter and a deli Italian sandwich). \n\nCheck it out and they need volunteers! I'll be helping them soon.
