Lots of machines and pretty clean considering there isn't an attendant 24\/7. The owners are really nice and it is in a nice area. Lots of parking. Typical prices for a laundry facility. 1.50 for the washer and 25 cents for 5 minutes of dryer. The washers could be bigger but they do have bigger options in their defense. The dryers are huge and dry very well. \n\n***update: I washed a comforter in their large washers ($4.00) they did a fantastic job and cleaned my comforter better that's it's ever been. It looks like a brand new white comforter.
