Without question, without debate, the worst buffet I have ever eaten.  I read many reviews, and actually ate here many years ago, and was happy to bring my daughter here as she really loves seafood.  We have eaten at Bacchnal, and wanted to try something different, what a mistake.  To begin, there were no lobster tails, at least as anyone in the free world has experienced before.  There we were claws in a mixture of shrimp and some juices.  While I saw what looked like tails, none were bigger than 3\/4 - 1 inch.  There were King crab legs but all smaller than snow crab.  In addition. All the drawn butter had garlic which I'm not a fan of and while the waitress attempted to bring regular drawn butter, it still had garlic.  The prime rib was all medium to well  doe and when requested the carver said he could only cut from the ends.  Everything else was of a quality just lower than old country buffet.  Desserts, everything, just awful.  Biggest waste of $102 ever.
