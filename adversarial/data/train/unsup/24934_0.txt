Not the biggest sports book in Vegas, but certainly one of the very nicest.  Plenty of big screens to follow all the sports actions or ESPN commentaries.\n\nBesides the modern wall of monitors it is a great relaxing spot to watch the games. Except during March Madness, when this venue is packed like a tin of sardine in oil. Although for VIP guests, there are designated area of luxurious pampering in comfy seatings with a low cocktail servers to guests ratio during game time\n\nBut the main reason I think this is the best race & sports book to actually spend time in, is the fact that the entire area is designated non-smoking.  For anyone concerned about unwanted second hand smoke, worry no more!  Plus Five50 is literally around the corner, if good but pricey slices of gourmet pizzas.\n\nEnjoy the facility and wager responsibly.
