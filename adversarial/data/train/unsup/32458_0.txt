A cozy nook located on the corner of the street that serves good breakfast food is a hit with me. I've tried three of their dishes:\n\n- Eggs Ben et Dictine served on an English muffin covered with Hollandaise sauce. The eggs were cooked to my liking (the yoke was not cooked all the way through), the sauce was tasty, and the fruit served with the eggs was fresh. Suggested improvements: the potato wedges should be crispier, baking them with fresh herbs instead of pan frying would be a definite improvement in taste. Rating: 4 out of 5 stars.\n\n- French toast served with a mountain of fresh fruit. It wasn't anything special, just average. Suggested improvements: the French bread could be cut a little differently, then soaked in milk and eggs with a hint of vanilla and  maple syrup a little longer, then pan friend quickly, and finally baked for a few minutes. Rating: 3 out of 5 stars.\n\n- Crepe omelet stuffed with an omelette, severed with Hollandaise sauce, served with fresh fruit and toast. It was delicious! Rating: 5 out of 5 stars.\n\nAll in all, it is a good place that serves fresh food and offers many choices.\n\nParking tip: If you take a car, you can find free street parking a few blocks down. There is a parking lot right in front of the cafe, but they charge $20 for parking.
