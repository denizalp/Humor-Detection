So, the amount you will like this party store will depend on who you are as a person. If you are trying to eliminate plastic from your life and reduce your environmental impact and not buy cheap single use things mass produced overseas in countries with poor human and environmental rights standards then well, this place like so many others will give you hives. \n\nIf, like my bestie, you adore decorating on a theme. You love parties with goofie goodies and decor. You love knickknacks and all the accoutrements of celebration. You'll be in heaven at Giggles. \n\nI myself have both these people inside of me so I feel conflicted but I have to meet my usual standard of reviewing a biz for what it is. Giggles is a party store, and for what it is, it rocks. It's about the size of a small city block and it's packed with well-organized decorations for every possible celebration. It's affordable, the staff is young and not overly engaged but still present and smiling. If you need a pi√±ata or a theme balloon or a zillion other goofy things this is your place!
