First off, it's hard to compare this place with other sushi joints local to Las Vegas because I am technically a Southern Cali girl. But Overall, I did have a good experience at this place. \n\nSome friends and I were running some last minute errands in Las Vegas and we were way off the strip to take care of them. We were also quite hungry and just looking for some decent food we saw along the way. It was either Sushi or Greek. Everyone felt like Sushi so as soon as I saw a decent Sushi place, I said \"let's go to THAT one!\". \n\nSo we parked and headed inside. This place is TINY as heck. We luckily got seated fast but then a line started to form immediately after us. We definitely lucked out! I can only imagine how long you must have to wait to be seated when there are so few seats in this joint.\n\nThe service was not bad. But they did forget TWO of our orders. But the sushi was very good. We didn't opt for the All You Can Eat because there's no way I could eat $27 worth of sushi all by myself. I wasn't THAT hungry. I instead just ordered 2 rolls which came out to less than $15 total and I was a happy camper. The rolls were delicious and satisfying. \n\nThis place is busy and seems very popular among all. It must be a rare good sushi place in Vegas and so that's why everyone comes here. In my personal opinion, it's very hard to find good Asian food in Vegas. I have not been very impressed but this place is the first to semi impress me. I would actually come back again if I felt like driving off the strip for some sushi.
