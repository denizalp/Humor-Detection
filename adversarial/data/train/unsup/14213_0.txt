I've frequented New York, NY's interior several times enough to be in awe like a child going to Disneyland. The place is packed on the weekends, and elbow room only in the restaurant section during NYE. Had to experience that at least once.\n\nHere's where to go being in this hotel casino: Chocolate Bar, Hershey's Factory store, main center bar has a live DJ on weekends and dancing. Foooooood!!! You can't get lost looking for something to eat with their indoor NYC themed restaurant section. Oh and if you'll ride the roller coaster you might need ear pads :P their head rests aren't completely comfy.\n\nNeeding some outdoor exposure? Tell your lower extremities to trot around The Park, lovely on summer nights and it's kind of a light show. Then hike across the street to the Monte Carlo, Excalibur, or MGM. Dont forget to turn your back cuz Lady Liberty beckons your camera's attention.
