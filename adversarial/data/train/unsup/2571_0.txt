I have eaten here several times before and have had no problems. Margaritas and food are cheap but this last time i went, it was such a terrible experience and i wont be going back. I was swatting gnats away the whole entire time, managed to kill 3 of them and capture photos of them. Mentioned it to our server and she didnt even care, not only that but she charged us for the regular priced margs instead of happy hour like we were supposed to receive. Super disappointed.  I wouldnt recommend coming here unless you want to feel like you are on a barn swatting the flies away from the cows.
