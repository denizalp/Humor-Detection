We decided to put our rental house up for sale and I needed the carpets cleaned. After calling several places and getting quotes Sears had the best rate so i went with them. Everyone I talked to was friendly from the lady that answered the phone and set up my appointment to the two guys that came to do the job.  i was sent and email with a photo of the person coming as well as a text message with a link where I could track when they'd arrive at the house.  They arrived and were in and out in just over an hour.   The carpets look much better than they did.  I really appreciated the service provided and I'd use this company again.
