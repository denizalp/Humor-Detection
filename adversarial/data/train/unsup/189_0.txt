Yes 5 Star! \nI like the fact when you drive into the valet that they post the prices on a big sign so you know up front what you will pay to valet. $13.00 first 4 hours, $18.00 after that.\nThe valet was a ghost town!! Wonder why??\nValet girl was super nice and explained all the valet and garage parking fees. That's customer service to me. As a local I like knowing what the scoop is?\nAll good! \n\nDefinitely worth it, as I came out and my car was parked up front! Love that.\n\nThank you MGM!
