The new 32 Shea is just what our lovely little corner needs. It's a hip place to hang out with a nice patio, which I would totally sit on if the weather ever allowed it. I sampled a couple of sandwiches which were pretty good. However, I didn't think they were extremely unique or flavorful. Lots of fun drink options, though. I will probably return to try some more!
