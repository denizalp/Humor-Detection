*Sigh*\n\nThere are a lot of haters in this world - hipsters who think it's, well, hip to hate on Vegas.  I've lived here over 12 years and have heard all of their whiny, skinny-jean clad complaints.  \n\"Ew, it's like Capitalism on steroids there!\"  \n\"Ew, they don't recycle as much as the rest of the world!\"   \n\"Ew, it's too touristy.\"  \n\"Ew, there is no culture there!\"\n\"Ew, there is no sense of community!\"\n\nWell, hang on to your scarves and beanies (that you're wearing in 90 degree weather) because Downtown Container Park is the contradiction to all of the above statements.  Most of the business that reside there are local -  contradicting the complaint about capitalism.  Dudes.  The whole park is a grand display of recycling and reusing.  Um, I guess it is somewhat touristy - but what cool thing isn't???  Fact - not all touristy things are cool, but most cool things are touristy.  Maybe.  I dunno. \n\nThere are art displays, local musicians playing, a nightly drum-circle for peace, so there's your culture.  As for a sense of community, when I attended my first drum circle there I couldn't help but feel a swell of pride in my bosom (tee-hee, bosom)  to be part of the wonderful community that is Las Vegas.  Locals will love it - tourists will love it - it's one place we can all come together, beat on a drum, eat some tacos and just enjoy life for a bit.  Well done, Downtown Container Park.  Well done.
