Brought my teenage son over for some fun \"guy time\" while in Vegas.   The Gun Garage was highly recommended... and did not dissapoint.   Drake and Jonathan were our instructors (strongly recommend them anytime their available).   They were very knowledgeable,  patient,  engaging, and made for a great experience.    My son shot a Kriss, Rem 700, Glock 17, and a 1911 (my son's face was worth the price of admission).  Drake gave pointers throughout the session in building my son's confidence.  Right across the Strip - perfect for groups and a quick break from the daily tourist scene.
