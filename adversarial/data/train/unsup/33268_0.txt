She did a really great job on my gel mani. Plenty of coats...took her time because she asked if I had anything else to get to soon. She even massaged my shoulders while I was soaking off the old color! She was very nice and it will prob be my regular nail place now. Oh but she didn't ask how I wanted my nails shaped but it's ok I liked it. The man working there decided to take a nap in one of the massage chairs...not very professional but it was slow. Only one other person there beside myself
