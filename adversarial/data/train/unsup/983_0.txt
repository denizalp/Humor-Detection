The Clock Tower Restaurant is located inside the Renaissance Charlotte Suites Hotel. Is it convenient if you're staying at the Renaissance? Yes. Do I recommend dining here? I guess it depends on how patient you are and how much time you have.\n\nBy no means is the food below average. The food itself is actually quite good, but nothing spectacular for the price you pay and the amount of time you spend waiting for the food.\n\nI ordered the chicken BLT wrap ($10), and a crème brulee cheesecake ($8). Both were delicious, but by the time the food finally came out, I felt like I had been waiting for hours. In reality, I had *only* waited half an hour before flagging down the waitress. She reassured me it would be at most another 10 minutes.\n\nWell, she was right. My food came out shortly thereafter, but only mine (and the fries were starting to get cold, which means the food had been sitting for awhile). Another 10 minutes and all but one person had received their order. Noticing that his food had not arrived yet, he went out to take a call. Now it's been an hour, he comes back, and the food never came.\n\nThe one waitress who looked like the manager came by and apologized sincerely, offering him a free drink or dessert on the house while the chefs cooked his meal ASAP. Neither of which, in my opinion, justifies the fact that his order never got put in (I think his meal should have been comped).\n\nIn their defense, the night was lively, and there were but three waitresses, and perhaps not enough chefs. Whatever the reason for the inefficiencies, I hope that the Clock Tower Restaurant can figure it out and improve on them.\n\nThe food was great, the waitresses were nice, the ambience was there... But the wait is just way too long. Be it the entrée or a simple dessert, do not expect to see any food in front of you within half an hour (based on 2 dining experiences here).
