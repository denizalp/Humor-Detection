I was 100% satisfied with my stay here! The hotel is located in a great spot, and it was very easy for my sister and I to reach great attractions and restaurants nearby. The staff that work there are efficient and super friendly. The room that we had was super nice, spacious, and comfortable! I guess the only con would be the price you are paying, but in my opinion it is totally worth it!
