I've been going to this practice for over a year now.  This is the second time they have charged my card without permission.   However this time, I wrote an email in May staring that they did not have permission to charge my card and to please remove it .  Guess what?  Charges and overdraft fees because the money wasn't there.  I am done with this office!
