i'll tell you a secret.  i'm letting you in on the (common) ground floor.... this place is crazy expensive.  \n\ni've been a vegetarian for over 25 years, and eating healthy doesn't have to cost that much... but if you feel like getting the whole foods experience without going to chicago... common ground is your place.  \n\ni shop the bulk bins because there is variety.  i shop the sale items.  i don't buy much else.  if i need specialty items right away, i can find them at other area places at much less a discount.  if i can wait to buy a specialty item, i'll buy it online and save A LOT of money.  if i want local produce, i go to the farmer's market and just pay the farmer directly.  i don't need to go to common ground and hand the girl with the dreads and the all natural deodorant my money.  \n\nyou have to bring your own bags.  shouldn't be a surprise, really.  if you forget... you can do the walk of shame to their supply of recycled plastic bags.  the look you're going to get is pretty side ways so look out.  \n\nall i have to say... is the pretense in this place is rich.  watch out!
