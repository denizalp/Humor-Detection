Awesome service (for lunch at least). Our waitress was very nice, and suggested the tomato soup grilled cheese. We went with that and a side of the fries. Absolutely delicious. So much so that we have ordered the same thing on door dash a couple times even though we live right down the street. Just what you want on a rainy day. Definitely\nRecommend.
