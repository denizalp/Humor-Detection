The stairway leading up to the restaurant gave me the expectation that it would be filthy inside, but the restaurant was relatively clean, and the service was good considering it's a Chinese restaurant.  Food and prices were decent for dim sum.  Whoever designed the men's restroom did not care that the urinals are in the direct line-of-sight from the door.
