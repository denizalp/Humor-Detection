Really an amazing experience! The food was fabulously delicious. Although I couldn't see the food, it felt like it was beautifully presented. We had a 4 course lunch meal. You only get to choose your drinks and the type of food flavor (spicy\/savory\/sweet). What a great experience. I will definitely come back again. Super friendly staff. Comfy dining, you can actually have a conversation without having to talk over others.
