Excellent authentic chinese food. I eaten here many times throughout the years. Each time the service been fast and friendly. Food is great.\n\nThe combination soft noodle (chow mein) $16 is excellent. Comes with bbq pork, chicken, duck and others I can't remember. The best chow mein i ever tried. Not too oily or overpowering in flavor. Just perfect. \n\nThe bbq pork and duck with rice is also great. $12. \nThe beef noodle also great. I'm not a soup kind of guy but I do remember that soup. Was good.\n\nThey have little dim sum items also. \n\nThe service is always fast and polite. Sit at the bar. You get to watch the chef in action. \n\nOverall excellent place to get a bite solo or in a group. One of the best chinese restaurant I tried on the strip.
