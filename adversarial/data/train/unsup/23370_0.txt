i'm sure this place is better than 1 star, but let me tell you WHY i'm giving it 1 star.\n\ni've heard great things about this restarant from a friend so one night, we all decided to go.  since i recently got back from Japan, my friend wanted me to go to a japanese restaurant that is actually owned by japanese people here in toronto.\n\nwith a HUGE craving for tonkatsu curry rice, i believed i wouldn't be disappointed (again, from the great things i've heard).  arrived at the restaurant and ordered my meal.  30 mins later the waitress comes out and says this....\n\n\"sorry, we have no more rice\"  \n\nyes... you read that right!!  she said they were out of rice!!!  it was only 8pm *still some what dinner time on a saturday night*.  i'm so baffled beyond belief!!  how can you own a japanese restaurant, or i guess you can even say an asian restaurant and have NO RICE?!?!?!??!  it's like going to a bar and saying, sorry, no beer!\n\n*sigh*  at that point... i wanted to just leave.  u don't understand how disappointing it was when you have this MAD craving for something, and you're missing out on the most simplest thing!\n\nbtw, the waitress' english wasn't that great.  she later did explain that if we wanted rice.. we'd have to wait another 45 mins.  at this point, i'm NOT waiting that long for my meal since i've already waited 30 mins.  plus my friends who ordered sushi, already got and finished their meal!!  yes.. they had sushi rice.. but no normal steamed rice.\n\nanyways, i then asked the girl if the ramen was good.  of course she answered \"oishii desu!\" (it's delicious) ... i ordered it anyways.  soon after i got it and let me tell you folks!! do NOT ever.. i REPEAT.. DO NOT ORDER RAMEN at this restaurant.  worst ever!!  well... not WORST.. just in par with instant noodles.  infact.. it felt like i was eating instant noodles.\n\nso ya... that explains why i'm giving this restaurant 1 star.   i will go back cause i'm STILL craving that tonkatsu (been 3 weeks now since i've left japan)  but if they're out of rice again, i might just fall on the floor crying.\n\nNO RICE!!!  seriously!!! how?!?!?!? i'm still just as confused and surprised.  they totally dropped the ball BIG TIME!!!
