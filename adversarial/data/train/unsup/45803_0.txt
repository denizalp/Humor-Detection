I've been here three times on Thursday happy hour, so I'm just judging for that time and the dish we always share when there.  On Thursday it is two bucks for a plate of buffalo Parmesan ribs... They are excellent and 12 bucks normal price. Anytime I've been there I've had fast friendly service....   I'll go back...\n\nIf you're single like me..... It's not a place to stay the evening in hopes of meeting someone.
