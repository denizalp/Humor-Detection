I am a first timer to this event and it did not disappoint! The event was packed and full of beauties! The Rockabilly community was amazing. The event was well organized and security was on point. They had great performers lined up along with a massive amount of vintage cars. There were rows upon rows of cars and engines to peek at. I was checking out the girls and their fashion more than anything! I love it. The event had plenty of sellers that offered specialty clothes, makeup, hair products, accessories, and parts for cars.  They also had a fashion show and a pet adoption event.  It reminded me a lot of the OC Fair. What prevented us from enjoying the entire event was the weather....even though it was on the cooler side, it was still a bit too hot to do everything we wanted to do. \nI did notice that there weren't any food vendors just alcohol and beverage vendors on ground. But, nonetheless,  it was still a great experience and worth the event to check out!
