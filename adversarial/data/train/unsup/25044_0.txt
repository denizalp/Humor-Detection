Great place - what a pleasant surprise to find a place on the strip but very close by. We were absolutely amazed with the fresh selection of sushi and the special care taken to make us custom rolls. My wife is gluten and dairy free and they were absolutely awesome with making accommodations. Loved our rolls!!!
