I can't believe I never got around to writing a review on ACE. \n\nI'm so suspicious that I wrote one and maybe it was \"filtered.\"\n\nNormally, I don't like to review places that have been done to death or has a really high rating as not to skew their rating but man this is the place. \n\nWhat is that you ask? Does the family still own and operate = CHECK. \nWhat you bought that somewhere else and need our help without complaint = CHECK & CHECK. \nWhat you don't know how we have our tools out for everyday use by customers = check check CHECK. ( Maybe they're not for customer use but hey...we were being assisted and appreciated every moment)\n\nWould you like me to do it for you says the son or grandson and then talk about how my kid's school needs help from us from time to time so we get it when teachers say, \"I need help. I'm trying to improve the school.\" And yep! We will help you for free. \nCHECK CheCk UBER CHECK check ChEcK. \n\nThese guys are friendly, service-oriented and are so good that I feel guilty when going elsewhere. We only tried this place after the one on campus was so ergh disgusting and tried to rob us but this place is sooooooo the bee's knees that I happily patronize Ace Hardware throughout Wisconsin based on my 1st experience with this location. \n\nYep, the shelves are stocked jam packed. Not because they are not making sales but because they keep things in stock. You can't fund it - no worries. Real men work here and they know (1) what you're trying to describe, (b) what you meant to say, (c) what you really want and MOREOVER (4) Where it's located! \n\nYou'd almost feel bad that they're running out to get a product that you could have easily stopped overlooking but they don't make you feel bad about it. They offer tootsie rolls at check out (or some little candy). Why does this matter especially since I don't want the candy? Because this is how it was always done or at least throughout my childhood. If you went somewhere with your parents and just had to be forced to run errands - there was a sweet treat at all, if not every, stop. \n\nCan you tell I like this place? Lengthy review or babbling at its best. I heart this one and like the one on Park Street as well. I miss the one from Raymond Rd but will skip by the one off Midvale only to always miss their opened hours. \n\nI can get every little thing or buy in bulk. I can get great service without a bunch of teenagers - haphazardly making me look like an expert and even when the kids are at work.... they know what they're doing. \n\nSupport the Little guys. Be impressed then become LOYAL. \n\n5 stars for service\n5.5 for their attitudes\n3.5 for the parking on Willy St (which has nothing to do with them but I promise it feels like the lane expansion did nothing to help this place).
