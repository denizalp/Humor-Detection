I went to this med spa because they had an offer of $8 per unit of Botox. My first clue should have been that I couldn't just make an appointment, I had to leave my contact information and wait to be called back, which took more than 1 week after repeated calls and finally sending an email. First visit the \"nurse\" placed 20 units on my 11's, I complained because it left a bump in the center, I was called back in, another \"nurse\" injected my 11's and also forehead at $10 a unit, for a total of 50 units. I was told to call back in 2 weeks for another appointment to follow up in case it didn't take and they would take care of it. When I called back I was left a voice mail by the owner that since I didn't purchase 50 units on my first visit I couldn't come back for follow up visit? Needless to say I still have my frown lines on my forehead and 11's even after having 50 units combined on 2 different visits a couple of weeks apart. Never again! Ladies, save your hard earned money and go somewhere reputable with a Doctor!
