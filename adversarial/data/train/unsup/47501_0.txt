One of my friends introduced me to Ru San's. The first time that I went it was lunchtime and we got the lunch buffet. The lunch buffet is delicious and lots of hot options, tons of great sushi rolls, and even dessert! All of the food was great. My only complaint is that they do not have a \"permanent\" buffet area. So they set it up and break it down each day. So when you go into the restaurant you can tell that it wasn't necessarily designed to have the buffet. The spacing and set up is a little bit awkward. \n\nThe last time I went with my friend we got the soft shell crab appetizer! It was out of this world! I would highly recommend ordering it if you like tempura soft shell crab. \n\nFor our entrees my friend got a sashimi rice bowl that had tons of different items on it. It had a great variety. You definitely get your moneys worth when you order that dish. I got two rolls - one was from their specials menu and the other was on the regular menu. Both of them were good. One was a chipotle roll - I didn't like how it had like a dry seasoning sprinkled on it that you could feel the gritty texture of in your mouth. \n\nThe service the night we went was HORRENDOUS. After being seating it was probably about 5-10 minutes until the waiter came up to us and go our drink orders. Then it was about 5 mins for our drinks to come. Then he delivered our drinks and walked away from us even though we were ready to order. He disappeared for another 5-10 minutes. We placed our order. My friends entree came first. Then a few minutes later my rolls came. Then last to arrive was the APPETIZER! The guy was nice - but the service was a joke. I am basically giving them a higher rating because I love the food here. I also like the atmosphere of the restaurant - they play good music!
