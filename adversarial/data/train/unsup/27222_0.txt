Teresa & Moses are no-nonsense business owners who actually care about their customers. My Quartz kitchen was ready one week early, and National has some pretty caring loyal staff.. \nFor the guys on a skinny budget, don't go to National.l, go get sketchy service at the Chinese shop \n\nIf you're looking for great work at fairly competitive pricing, go see Teresa.  They had a couple nephews working at National who are a great asset to the logistics part of the operation.. They are all Great guys
