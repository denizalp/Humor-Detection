Monday night @ 6:30pm and this is where we were at. We stopped in to have some dinner and it was fairly busy inside. We stood at the front for a few minutes and there was no hostess in sight. \n\nThe manager who happened to walk by (he was wearing a polo shirt and looked like the one in charge) saw us and quickly came on over to greet us. He then was the one who took us to our seats. \n\nWe sat down and looked over the menus. We sat there for 10 minutes and our server had yet to come over and say anything to us. She would just walk by and continue what she was doing. The manager again saw us just sitting there and he then again came on over to assist us. \n\nHe quickly brought us our drinks and took our orders. We ordered..\n\nOne mushroom burger with garlic fries \nOne chicken tender basket w steak fries \nOne bacon guacamole burger w steak fries\n\nThe burgers were delicious and surprisingly the chicken tenders were great!!! They were so hot and crispy! I have never been a fan of the fries as they are very bland. I do pour the entire bottle of seasoning that's on the table on my fries, but nope they are still bland...\n\nThe garlic fries were plain and not worth the additional cost for them. Stick with the steak fries. \n\nFries are bottomless but we didn't order anymore. The manager was very friendly and made what looked like was going to be a hot mess of a dining experience, to a great one!! Thank you!\n\nFood was great and so was the service!
