Regal Colonnade is located in a shopping center right off of the 215 and Eastern. It can be kind of difficult to see since it is deep into the strip mall, thankfully they have a tall neon sign to catch your eye.\n\nThe line to buy tickets moved quickly. The snack line was short and the food was typical of a movie theater. The seats were clean. Overall, I like this hidden gem of a theater. Sure, its a little old and it could really use a renovation or two but I really enjoyed the simplicity of this place. It wasn't very crowded and that's a huge plus for me!\n\nAlso this theater participates in the Value Tuesdays where all tickets are discounted to $7. And they have those specials showings like the Studio Ghibli Fest and classic movie runs throughout the year, so make sure to keep an eye on their calendar. Who doesn't want to watch Totoro on the big screen?
