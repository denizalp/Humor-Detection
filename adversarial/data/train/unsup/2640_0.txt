It is my favorite restaurant on the canal.  After checking out the exhibits at Canal Comvergence we stopped here for a light dinner. I had the cheese and charcuterie board. The bread was the star, country sourdough slices very European!  Ron had lasagna served in a bowl, interesting take... We had dinner outside on the patio facing the canal. It was a cool 66 degrees but no worry, fire pits and heating lamps were all out glowing in the dark of this beautiful evening.
