I've been coming here for an oil change for a while now.. however this time, things were different.\n\nThey told me that my water pump is leaking & that they could fix it for $450 or so. \n\nI declined but they kept pushing me to get it fixed saying they would not risk driving the car & even offered me financing.\n\nI took my car to the car dealership (Honda, Toyota, Audi, etc) to have them look at it because I knew I would get the appropriate diagnosis from them.\n\nThey claimed Purrfect Auto lied to me & said my water pump is not leaking. I only needed something small & unrelated fixed that wasn't even half the cost of what Purrfect Auto quoted me.\n\nI should check my oil to make sure Purrfect Auto really did in fact change my oil. If they didn't, it is a lawsuit waiting to happen.\n\nPurrfect Auto just lost a loyal customer.\n\nStay away from this place. They are cheaters, liars, & scammers.
