This was the first pediatrician that I saw after my son was born in 2012. My experience at his office was so terrible that after one visit I went home and cried. \n\nFirst of all, his receptionist was wearing a see-through knit top that you could clearly see her bra and tummy underneath. I felt this was extremely unprofessional and made me uncomfortable. She continually referred to me as \"Sweetie\" and \"hon\" which is, again, just rude and unprofessional. \n\nDr. Barone came in reeking of cigarettes, with his top shirt buttons undone so I could see his chest hair and gold chain. He was also wearing flip flops. Eew. He had a medical student come into the room with him to do the exam and he didn't even introduce me. \n\nThey never had a nurse or assistant come in to take my son's vitals--who the hell does that? \n\nSo he asks me if I am formula feeding or breastfeeding: \"I see you have bottles there--is that formula or breastmilk?\" I told him I was doing both, to which he replied, \"Okay, that's not too bad then.\" And then went on a talk about how important breastmilk is. I am all about doctors informing their patients of the health benefits of breastmilk, but I don't need a lecture about how I should personally be choosing to feed my child, and I certainly don't need someone telling me that one way or the other is \"bad\". \n\nHe then started talking about a blood test that I'd need to take him to get. Being a new mom, I'd never heard of the test before, so I asked him about what it was--and he LAUGHED at me before answering. Seriously, I can't make this up. \n\nAfter coming home and crying, I switched pediatricians. They actually have adequate staff including nurses and physicians assistants and lab techs to run certain chemistries in-house. \n\nAs a consumer of healthcare in Scottsdale where it is so competitive, I think it is perfectly acceptable to expect to be treated with respect at your doctor's office, greeted by people who are decently and appropriately dressed, and addressed by doctors that are clean and who care enough to dress professionally. \n\nSorry, but I don't want some gross fat man's cigarette hands all over my newborn while he laughs condescendingly at my questions. \n\nThanks but no thanks. This guy sucks.
