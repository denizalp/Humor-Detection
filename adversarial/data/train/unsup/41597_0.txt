This place was VERY DISAPPOINTING! I walked in to order tacos on taco night at 5pm, and the RUDE waitress screamed at me that they were out of tacos! Umm ok that's fine, but you could explain to me calmly that they are gone (even though it was taco night?!?!) I work in the food industry and I would NEVER act that way towards a paying customer no matter how busy I was ( even though she wasn't busy. I will never go back there.
