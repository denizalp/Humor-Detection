Hubby was sad to see Planet Dallies go, and had high hopes for Cafe Hollywood. We decided to get breakfast here around 11am on a Sunday, we were seated after a 3 minute wait. \n\nThey have a pretty extensive menu, similar to Planet Daillies. We decided on breakfast. I had the egg white omelet, and hubby had the Big Breakfast. Both were good. \n\nMy only complaint was on the slowness of the waiters. It took about 10 minutes to order, around 20 minutes to get our food, and about another 20 minutes after our plates were taken away to get our check. THEN...another 15 minutes until (and asking 3 different people) to take our check! Not sure why our waiter kept skipping out on our table, I saw him talking to his other tables.\n\nDecor, BRIGHT! Definitely loved the decor. Planet Daillies was always very dark hidden. Cafe Hollywood is definitely the opposite, you can't miss this place!\n\nWe will be back!
