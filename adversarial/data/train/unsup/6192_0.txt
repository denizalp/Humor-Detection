Went too get dinner for my son and I and decided too stop at Subway.\nI ordered 2 footlong toasted BLT heros.\nThe staff where very friendly and fast and very helpful.\nSandwiches where delicious and prices are good.\nI was in and out in 5 minutes and could not complain about anything.\nI would definitely go to this Subway again
