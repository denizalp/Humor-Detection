Gaati is located across town from me, so this was my very first visit. Service was good -- nothing bad to say but nothing astonishing that I should note either. What really captured me was the food.\n\nMy friends and I ordered the curry puffs as appetizers to start which were good. We then shared a bowl of crab fried rice and pad see ew. \n\nI'm a huge fan of Thai food and love love love Pad Thai and Pad See Ew dishes. However, I find that most places don't satisfy my Pad See Ew cravings. The Pad See Ew at Gaati was delicious -- the noodles tasted fresh and smooth, not chunky and gross as in other places. The taste was just right... not too salty, not too spicy, not too yeck. The beef was cooked just perfect as well. The beef was not chewy like gum nor was it disgusting and tasted like fake meat. really enjoyed the Pad See Ew w\/ beef.\n\nThe crab fried rice was average to me. The crab did taste pretty good and, unlike some other places, had a pretty distinct part of the dish (some other places you can barely tell there is crab in your crab fried rice).\n\nI would come here again for the Pad See Ew alone!\n\nMy only complaint is the pricing is a little high compared to most Thai restaurants I've been to, especially being that this is more on the casual side despite the slightly upscale ambience.
