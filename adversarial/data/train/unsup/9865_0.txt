Are you on a somewhat healthy diet? Don't come here...\n\nThis is a few blocks from my house and it's a dangerous location...because I might gain some serious weight from the house specialty, fried chicken and french toast.\n\nNow, the traditional Southern dish has been tweaked to, IMO, a better pairing. The french toast is enormous, yet light and I could eat another serving easily. It doesn't bore your taste buds at all. The fried chicken, is one of the nicest offerings I've had so far in Montreal.\n\nHowever, my personal hangover favourite, is the shakshuka. Libyan by origin, this all-around savoury meal is great for breakfast, lunch and dinner. It's a very versatile dish and Prohibition does a wonderful take on it. Baked eggs over tomatoes, with hints of paprika and cumin, oh yes, my head and stomach feel better already. If you can't make it down here to NDG to try it, it's an easy home meal to create.\n\nI only wish their coffee was better, but that's minor pickings. Make reservations, as this space is small.
