the food here is decent, but as most people said, more expensive than it should be. \n\ni ordered the si jiu beef wok tossed noodle stuff and it was bland...i had to add spoonfuls of soy sauce, and i wasn't the only one that thought so..everyone at my table that tried it said it was bland too. to me, it was just like the chow mein from panda express, but with beef. sad. and it cost about $14 for that. \n\nmy bf ordered the cantonese beef stew i believe, and that was kind of flavorless too...tasted like ramen i could make from a bag....\n\ntwo of my friends ordered the bbq duck stuff though and they said it was heavenly. i didn't try it because i don't like duck :( \n\nmaybe we just ordered the wrong things. as for the prices, people are saying you're in vegas so expect to pay that much...and that is true...but i say, if you're in vegas, don't look for asian food and expect it to be good...and no matter where you go, you're going to pay a not so cheap price, but if you're going to do that, at least do it at a place that is not something you can find cheaper and better tasting in chinatown. explore different places that aren't offered around where you are from --- those are the places worth shelling the money out for :D
