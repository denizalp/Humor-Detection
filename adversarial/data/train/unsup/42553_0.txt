My husband flew in for an interview at Case Western and they put him up in this hotel for the night.  I wanted to surprise my husband with a little treat after a long day of traveling and wish him well on his interview.  I called the hotel and they said that I could pay for a (Great Lakes) beer and a cookie and they would give it him when he checked in.  I gave them my credit card number on the phone and they charged me but they never gave my husband the items. I called three times the next to tell them that my credit card was charged but my husband never received the items.  The first lady said she would have to check with her manager and promised she would call me back, she never did.  The second man I talked to said he was there the night before when the arrangement was made and saw today that the items were still there at the front desk and assured me the charge would be reversed.  It never was.  So now I have debate if I am going to waste an hour (or more) of my time to get this figured out.  I work hard for my money and I don't appreciate it being treated this way.  HORRIBLE customer service.
