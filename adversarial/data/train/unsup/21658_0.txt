Just had the worst service I have ever had. Sat for 10 minutes before we were even acknowledged. No menus. Waitress finally got off her cellphone and came to the table and said she doesn't start her shift for another 10 minutes but will serve us. Lucky us!  \nTook our order. Brought the food and no silverware. Waited 5 minutes for a fork. When she brought our wings a free basket of fries were brought as an apology. Wow. Never checked on us once during the meal. \nWe were done eating and watched the waitress eating pizza behind the bar while we sat for 15 more minutes waiting to get our bill.  I have waitressed for 16 years. Usually tip 20 to 25%.  Left her 0 on debit. she was complaining as she walked away all the while not knowing if I was going to leave cash.  See you never know who your customer may be.  Her loss. Maybe she should chose another career because she sucks at waitressing.
