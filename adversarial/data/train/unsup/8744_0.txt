Let it be known that I'm cheap. Two regular size boba drinks for $5? And they're pretty delicious at that. I'm usually unimpressed with boba and opt for lychee jelly if a place offers it. On this occasion, though, I actually enjoyed chewing every last pearl of tapioca in my green apple slush.\n\nThe verdict is simple. Five stars.
