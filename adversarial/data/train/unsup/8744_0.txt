Altona Kabob is a small restaurant located in a small plaza that caters to the middle east community. You could drive by or walk by the plaza and not even notice the restaurant.\n\nI had been meaning to try this place because of my love for healthy food and kabobs. I decided on the Vaziri Kabob combo ($12.99 plus tax) which consisted of one skewer of chicken breast and a skewer of kobideh which is a minced meat kabob made from either lamb or ground beef served on a bed of rice with a grilled tomato. The kobideh kabob was perfectly seasoned, tender and fresh. The chicken breast kabob was nicely seasoned but slightly dry and not juicy. The rice was nicely cooked and moist.\n\nAltona Kabob is not a bad option for the area and reasonably priced. The food is good but I wouldn't say that it was exceptional.
