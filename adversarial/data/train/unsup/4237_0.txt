I was referred to Scott by a good fiend of mine whose name is Gene and he said that Scott mounted some TV's for him and he did a great job and was very reasonable so I called him around Christmas of 2014. He proceeded to meet me at Costco and help me decide which TV to purchase which I thought was well beyond the scope of his assignment but he did it anyway.\nHe also loaded a tv stand in the car also. This was a 60 inch tv quite heavy I might add. He lugged everything in by himself and completed the whole job without a hitch and everything went smooth.\n\nI called him a few more times again to help program  the remotes and he came out with no problems.\nI would gladly recommend him to any of my friends.
