This restaurant is inside the Luxor, we came here to eat while waiting for the check in line to hopefully die down. Anyways this spotlight is on Tender. It is nice decorated the tables chairs looked a bit huge for smaller people but as I looked around everyone looked comfy and relaxed laughing enjoying the evening so I guess they knew what they were doing. We almost always sit at bar area if we do not have the kids with us and that is this trip. The bare was comfortable bartender very assertive. \nI had lobster bisque and my man a  steak. \nI tried his steak it was good. My lobster bisque was alright only second time I've tried this soup so it's hard to judge.  The chocolate cake I had was amazingly delicious, I'm not huge on chocolate more Carmel gal so this surprised me how I couldn't stop eating it. Ya gotta try it.
