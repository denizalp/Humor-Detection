Went here again today. Just a side note to what I previously mentioned. This is NOT the place to come and watch a game. Now that baseball season is back (FINALLY) I decided to eat lunch here and sit in the cocktail area to catch a bit of a game. Their televisions are tiny and from where I could see were neither flat screens or HD. Boo. \n\nService was bad again. The server was really cute but seemed not to give a crap. It looked like he was getting his bar cleaned and shut down so he could go home but there were three tables in the cocktail area, all needing to either be greeted or helped, and he ignored us. Oh and my salad came out with avocado slices, even though the picture on the table showed that it was supposed to come with them. So the servers don't really have a clue what they are doing and neither do the cooks, obviously. This is my strike two at this location. They have one more chance and that's only because their burgers are so darn good.
