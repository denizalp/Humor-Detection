The atmosphere feels like a restaurant along the streets of Korea (not your cleanest of places, but very cozy) with authentic Korean service (for better or worse), meaning the tones can come off rather rude if you are unprepared, but they mean well. For example, my friend had preferred a non-spiced soondubu (soft tofu soup), so she ordered the white soondubu (no pun intended... or maybe just a little pun intended lol). The lady made a face of disgust and said \"Ugh no spicy??? Spicy is much better!\" My friend was a bit surprised\/upset by the judgmental tone, but you just have to understand certain interactions among Asians and not take it personally.\n\nCons:  They are rather stingy with banchan, limiting refills to only 2 side dishes... even justifying by saying you are supposed to eat your main entree.  They also recently switched to cash-only (seemingly only for the Asian customers, though I cannot confirm this).\n\nPros:  Despite the cons, this is truly the best Korean food in Phoenix and comparable to that of K'Town in LA or Korea.  We've tried many of their dishes and some of my favorites are Haemul Pa Jeon (Seafood Pancake), Bibim Naengmyeon (Cold Noodles), Kalbi Tang (Beef Short Rib Soup), and Soondae Jjigae (Blood Sausage Soup).\n\nFrom our most recent visit:\nHaemul Pa Jeon (Seafood Pancake):  Tip: Extra crispy - the intensified aroma teases you from the moment the dish is served... and the satisfying crunch from each bite layers your tastebuds.\n\nBibim Naengmyeon (Korean Cold Noodles): I crave the naengmyeon I had from Seoul... to this day.  This isn't that, but settles my cravings more than any other naengmyeon in Phoenix. \n\nSummary:\nService: 2-3 Stars\nFood: Definitely worth it
