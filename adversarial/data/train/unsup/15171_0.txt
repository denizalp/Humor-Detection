Ok I am tempted to give them one star after my most recent experience.  Let me talk about the bad then I will roll with the good about this French bakery.\n\nI stopped in this morning to grab my normal small baguette with brie and a small latte.  To my dismay they have raised their prices on my little bit of paradise.  Now I don't want to be overly critical and I am willing to pay for good food and or service but this isn't right.  \n\nNormally I pay $1.30 for my \"roll\" and .50 to add brie.  The \"chalk board\" menu states \".50 to add to any item\".  Today the lovely gentleman charged me $5.50 for my bit of brie.  When I confronted him he said the prices on the board are not accurate so he handed me a paper menu with the update prices.  Ok, I'll accept that but this new paper menu says \"$1.00 to add things like butter, jam...\"  I ask why he didn't charge me the $1.00.  He said I created a sandwich. I reminded him I come in once a week for my snackwich and what I pay.  He said if I didn't like it I don't have to take it.  Not very customer service oriented.  I just think that the \"chalk board\" menu and the paper menu should reflect proper prices.  I added cheese to a roll.  \n\nOk enough with the negative.  This place has awesome food.  From the Croque Madame to the Croque Monsieur.  These sandwiches are insanely tasty and are served with a small side salad and a great balsamic dressing.  The coffee\/espresso is way better than any Starbucks or Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf you may enjoy.  They offer great sweet treats and quiche too.\n\nParking is pretty easy at this place.  They do have bike parking and an outdoor sitting area.  You could bring your pup to hang out while you eat your great meal.  \n\nTodays snafu won't stop me from coming here.  Yes I'm annoyed but I'm not chopping my nose off to spite my face...or tastebuds....
