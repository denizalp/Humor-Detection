Do you want to know a secret? Do you promise not to tell? There's a Korean karaoke bar with an entrance through the back alley! Yessiree sirs and madams, a central area, private rooms and.... no sticky floor!\n\nOh, a maraca and a tambourine so you can play along.\n\nSole Korea was a welcomed \"new\" karaoke hangout. I'm not sure how long it's been there, but it's newer (so is the song selection), cleaner and... did I mention the back alley entrance? Ooooo! That's the selling point. Right there.\n\nOh, there are drinks and eats too. We just partook in the drink, not the eats. So no comment for ya there yet!\n\nHappy karaoke-ing!
