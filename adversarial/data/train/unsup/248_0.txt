4 stars, really Yelpers?! Excuse a moi, but wtf?! My French is terrible, I know, but seriously just wtf?!! Either this place has gone way downhill (which I've heard from multiple sources) or we had an inexcusably horrible and overly drawn out experience. \n\nWe made rezzies for a Friday at 5, when they open! I heard this place gets packed so I thought it was best to get in early. Hello~ no one was there. LOL. We were the only ones waiting. After they opened a couple of patrons trickled in. It wasn't until we started getting our food that other diners started to show yet service was incredibly slow. It was almost deliberate and made all the more annoying when there were two servers there, but only one working.\n\nThe food, ugh. It was undercooked, overcooked, overly salty, and even needing salt. We ordered so much food and NOTHING tasted good. We left everything less than half eaten and tried to get out as quick as possible to go elsewhere, but getting our check took FOREVER!! The waitress started dropping off checks to every other table, BUT OURS! Without exaggeration, we sat there for 15 min. twiddling our thumbs and waiting for our check. Never again. Don't go here if you value your time, money, and tastebuds. Such a waste of calories. Ugh.
