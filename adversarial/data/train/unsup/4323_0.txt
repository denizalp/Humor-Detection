Red Lobster?  This choice was made strictly to cap off a day of nostalgia for certain members of our party.  We expected to enjoy the camp factor; what we didn't expect was the hordes of people there.  I had no idea that a Saturday night around 8:15 pm would be so damn busy!  We were told our wait was going to be one hour and ten minutes.  I wanted to go else where, but everyone else wanted to stick it out.\n\nFinally, over an hour later we got our table.  Our server, although very polite, clearly had too much going on and it took forever to get drinks and food.  I ordered the Seaport plate - a lobster tail, two kinds of shrimp, some rice, and broccoli.  I also had a salad and a biscuit.  Everything was extremely salty and bland.  The best thing about this experience was the wine prices - only $7 per glass for a serviceable red.  Otherwise, everything else was overpriced for what it was.\n\nI heard two birthdays being celebrated at nearby tables.  It reminded me that the only other time I've been to the Lobster since childhood was\ncelebrating a relative's birthday too.  Then I had a similar thought.  Why with all the interesting restaurants in Toronto, is this place still so popular?
