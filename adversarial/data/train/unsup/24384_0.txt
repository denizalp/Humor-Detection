Two facts:\nCulvers trumps In N Out.\nWhoever compared Culvers to Dairy Queen is bonkers. they don't even compare\n\nI have been hearing this dumb commercial about 'being culverized' on KTAR and all I could think was how dumb it was that we were getting commercials for places we don't even have.\n\nha, i was dumb. we do have a culvers!!! and i am now in love.\n\nreasons why it's better than In N Out:\n-while I love In N Outs meat patties, their cheese selection sucks. at culvers you pick your cheese- american, cheddar or swiss (i hate american cheese which is the only cheese offered at In N Out)\n- They have red onion, i love both onions but red is way better\n-I like their hamburger patties just a bit more than In N Outs(both are good)\n- Culvers shakes and custard are totallllllyyyyyy better than any milkshake In N Out could ever make.\n- I love all the options of burgers you can get at culvers! including bacon and if you dont want a burger their chicken strips look pretty awesome\n\n\n i am so excited i heard those dumb commercials and looked them up!!!!!!\n\ni will say that In N Outs fries are way better than culvers.  but that's it.
