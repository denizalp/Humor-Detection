Living in North Vegas, it's a drive out of our way to eat here for breakfast, but we've done it more than once, as we prefer it to Egg & I on Sahara.\n\nThere's a bit more room to breathe in this location -- people aren't bumping their asses into you while you're trying to eat your bacon and the staff is ultra friendly and FAST!\n\nWe went this past Saturday, ordering an omelette and a classic breakfast. Before we even finished checking in online, our meals were in front of us -- almost TOO fast, actually. I hardly had time to enjoy my coffee. But we couldn't blame them for being efficient. \n\nWe usually end up taking half of our breakfast home and making breakfast tacos for dinner with the leftovers, so it's a great deal at roughly $24 (considering we get two meals out of it). \n\nI do take issue with the frozen cubed season-salt \"homestyle\" potatoes they server (just like Egg & I). I wish they would make fresh hashbrowns. \n\nThe parking can be a little tricky, but there's plenty of places to park if you're willing to walk more than 10 feet.  This is part of the regular rotation of breakfast joints now, for sure.
