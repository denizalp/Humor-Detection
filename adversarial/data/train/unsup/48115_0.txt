We came here during the week for dinner.  We were seated pretty quickly.  This restaurant seemed like a cross between Denny's and a mom and pop diner.  We were served pretty quickly.  I ordered a salad and it was a gigantic serving.  I like the bright neon pink lights.  They make the place look cool.
