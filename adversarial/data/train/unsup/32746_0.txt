Most horrible service. I sat with a person that last name was nogn I think she is short  and not approachable. I was over charged about 11.00 and gave a tip also. She advise my nails were dry came home all the polish is now off. Not once did my nail tech spoke to she spoke to other coworkers in a different language which is super rude. I ask for a double coat of clear the once she spoke to me she argue with me. If I wanted 10 coats of clear I am a paying customer so do it. The ambiance is nice but people with horrible attitude do waste your money and go here. The attend to other minority's first before you.
