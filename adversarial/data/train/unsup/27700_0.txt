I LOVE Sonic.  I was raised in San Diego, and we didn't have any Sonics, so I was super excited to see them all over town here.  This is the location closest to my house, so it's the one I visit most often.\n\nI have never had bad service here.  All of the order takers and servers are friendly.  The burgers are nothing spectacular, but are good.  I love that you have the option to have tater tots, more fast food places should offer them as well!\n\nThe drinks are the best part.  I love that you can customize your soda to add any flavor combination.  There is nothing like a raspberry limeade on a hot day! :)\n\nThe desserts are also pretty delicious.  The best time of year is when they have the red velvet cake blast.  I wish they carried it year around.  :(  The pumpkin pie blast is also a really good seasonal treat.\n\nI do wish that they were open 24 hours, but I believe they are open fairly late, until 1am most nights
