I love Nathan's hotdogs. I used to go to Coney Island just for Nathan's - So I was shocked to see the menu and prices at Bally's ( 1\/4 lb is the smallest @ $8). Still the same taste but the wait of 15 minutes from two girls there - Ms. Slow and Ms. Grumpy - never again.\n\nI'd say walk 15 minutes to New York New York instead because the Nathan's there have better options and you'll save $$ and faster service than this joint.  (located on same 2nd floor where the roller coaster and game arcade are)
