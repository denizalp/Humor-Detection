So now and then I say to myself, I want to try that $5.99 steak! I really need to stop listening to that voice.\n\nI live fairly close to Longhorn and have wanted to try it for awhile. I'm craving steak so I head over with my husband. We enter and see the place is small for sure. I don't mind little dives but this was a bit more dive than I care for. Smaller than it looks on the outside. We get on the list for the cafe and play for awhile until called.\n\nWe both order the $5.99 steak special. I ask for medium and husband asks for medium rare. The cafe itself is small and quite hot. Food comes out, husbands steak is well done, mine is an OK medium, both are very tough. Well, it's $5.99. Our rolls are store bought, baked potato was OK. Now I'm really feeling hot so we finish up and move on. The rest of the casino lacked much variety in games so we left. At this point I would have given it a two star but within about 30 minutes I started having bad stomach cramps and we had to go home and cut our evening short. Not pleasant.\n\nSo the next time I crave a cheap steak I'll have to up the amount to maybe searching for a $10 one.
