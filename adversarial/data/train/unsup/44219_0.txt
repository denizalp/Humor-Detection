The staff is honest to the point of seeming put-offish.  I know it sounds wierd, but it's true.  If your body isn't right for a particular type of piericing, they won't do it.  Most people may be upset, but I'd rather a professional tell me that something isn't going to work and not get the money for it then to take my money and in a few months have something go wrong.\n\nOnce you get to know them, the owners are great.  They just don't put up with whiney frightened people who go in on a whim.\n\nPlus they're extremely clean to the point of feeling like a hospital.  They're extremely strict on policy as well, which again may be frustrating to some who want rules bent for them, but you can bet they know what they're doing.
