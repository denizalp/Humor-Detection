Good and plentiful food, and lots of meat.  We had fried chicken and short ribs.  The chicken was very good, but not distinguishable from other very good fried chicken.  The short ribs were phenomenal, melt in your mouth good.  The ambiance was okay, not too loud.  The service was very good, and they happily accommodated our timeline (we had a show to catch).  Our waiter was very friendly and looked the part -- straight out of Duck Dynasty, complete with short hair and long beard.
