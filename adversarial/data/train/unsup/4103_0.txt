Roaring Fork is strangely located next to some giant business complex.  They share the same parking lot and has every space marked with 2-hour visitor parking.  Since the business closed during dinner time, guests may park freely here.\n\nThe restaurant reminds me of an upscale version of Claim Jumpers. Dark, intimate restaurant with a Western theme and open kitchen.  Menu is highly meat-centric, and ideally you bring a large appetite and\/or completed a full day of hiking because portions are gigantic!\n\nWe started off with a Medjool Date Salad - interesting how dates and that fig jam works with candied walnuts.  To balance out the sweetness, they have arugula and large chunks of goat cheese.  (4 stars)\n\nWife got the Double Cut Pork Chop. Wood-grilled and served with an awesome squash puree. The chop was huge and had some poblano chutney on top.  I found the meat incredibly soft and juicy, almost unnaturally soft.  The wife felt some of the pork texture and taste was missing some how, and she still felt the best pork chops are served in San Francisco's Prospect. (4 stars)\n\nFor some crazy reason, I opted for the Big Ass Burger out of sheer, morbid curiosity.  I could of went for any of their other excellent-sounding entrees but the \"Big Ass\" just sounds so cool.  I indeed lived up to its name and was indeed big - layers of bacon, medium-rare juicy patty, tomatoes, onions, and poblano chili.  Pretty decent burger, definitely bigger but not necessarily better than some of the best burgers I've had.  Fries were super crispy and well-seasoned. (4 stars).\n\nClearly after that meal there was no room for dessert!
