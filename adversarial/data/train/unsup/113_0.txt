Better late to the party than never. \n\nThese guys helped us pack our truck when we were getting to move back to Atlanta. Having everything organized and ready to go into the truck was a huge job, but getting everything into the truck without begging and bribing friends with pizza gets old -- we've moved a lot in the past 4-5 years. \n\nThe two dudes had our truck strapped down to the gills with room to spare and not a thing out of place. I was really happy with their level of consideration in where everything went and their demeanor in handling all of our boxes and items. I even gave them pizza and Powerade!\n\nI'd hire these again in a heartbeat. Hell, with the way things go, we'll probably end up moving back to charlotte at some point in the next decade anyways. Glad to know they'll be around when that time comes.
