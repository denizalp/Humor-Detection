My boyfriend and I came here for our date night. We were seated right away, in a cute little two person table with a candle. Hostess came by with bread and water right away. So far so good.\nOur waitress came by and from the minute she was at our table I could tell she was in a rush, which really isn't her fault but she took our drink order and then after we ordered our meal. I had the filet mignon and my boyfriend had the king cut steak, which is 2 lbs. (Fyi, it was HUGE. He ended up taking it home.) Both of our meals came with a side we could choose from, and she listed them off like she was working at an auction. I could barely comprehend and asked her to repeat them and after she did I got so nervous I just chose the redskins. My boyfriend did the same. \n\nIt took longer than normal for our food, luckily we had the bread and our salads.\nMy filet was dry and not good, at all. Not worth the $26. It came with a huge piece of lettuce on the side which to me was pointless. The redskins came out and they were three boiled red skinned potatoes. I ended up mashing mine and adding butter and salt and pepper, however, both my boyfriend and I were under the impression that they would be roasted of the sort. I do know that my boyfriend did enjoy his king cut steak. At least one of us was happy.\nThe waitress came around every once and awhile but couldn't even stop at our table to talk to us. She rushed by and said, \"everything good?\" ...didn't even give us a chance to answer.\n\nOur bill was $72. It tasted more around $40. If we ever go back, I think I'll go with the pasta.
