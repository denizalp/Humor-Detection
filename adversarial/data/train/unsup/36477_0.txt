Visited the Las Vegas Speedway Christmas Light Show with my family and we all enjoyed the experience.\n\nThe cost is $20 per carload.  The Boyscouts will be selling hot chocolate, popcorn, kettle corn, and candy.\n\nYou drive around the Speedway in your car at very slow speeds and look at the millions of Christmas lights.  The whole tour takes about 30 minutes.\n\nMy kids loved it.
