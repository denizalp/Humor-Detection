Had a horrible product from the location on Stapley in which I was given a gift certificate when I returned the item. I noticed this location existed today and when to redeem my GC. The GC I was given was equal to the price I paid and I explained the situation and I was told that they were u see new management and they were not accepting coupons or punch cards from the \"old\" owners. First, this was an ownership change not a business change and I didn't have a coupon, it was a GC that money was paid for. The worse part of this experience after the 12 year old who initially was helping me refused to accept my voucher, is the shift manager still charged me for some of my overpriced item. Poor service, bad attitudes, and bad business. I will not be back to any sub zero... zero stars if I could.\n\nUpdate* after eating the small portion I did get and paid for (yet again) I am now at home in the fetal position sick to my stomach.... never again...as if the customer service wasn't enough to keep me away
