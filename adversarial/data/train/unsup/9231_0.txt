With total ignorance I thought the High Roller would be fun for our grandson, like a ferris wheel. We bought our tickets which were absurdly priced and that should have stopped me in my tracks. When I saw the bar before you get into the ride, I should have known this is not fun for kids. Nonetheless, like a newbie traveler I put my family on the ride.\n\nIt is a 30 minute ferris wheel that is so slow, you just want it to be over. There are great views--I bet your hotel has views as well. The bar has drinks that are priced as if the world is ending.\n\nMaybe I just don't get it. Maybe I don't see the point of watery drinks and 30 minutes of slowly, deathly slow, motion, around a wheel. I don't get the purpose. The view is great. Okay, if you must see all of Las Vegas from the air, cool, but it gets old very fast.\n\nDo not take a kid with you. They will see the rides from afar at Circus Circus and wish they were the family there.
