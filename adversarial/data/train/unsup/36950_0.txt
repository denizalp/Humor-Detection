Pretty good, they give you a broth like soup and a side salad before your meal. Since it was our first time there, my dad ordered teriyaki chicken & I had hibachi chicken. The service was great and the fruit punch is  super sweet. The lemonade & fruit punch made me feel like I wouldn't sleep for days. Good amount of food at a great price. Overall, I would eat there again.
