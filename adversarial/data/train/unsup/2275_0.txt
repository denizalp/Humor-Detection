I've been in the restaurant business for years and today was by far the worst service I've ever had. 5-10 minute wait on a Saturday night around 9:45. No biggie. Get sat, and wait another 10 minutes to be greeted. Another 20 minutes for drinks. Our salads and biscuits came out before a strawberry lemonade and a Budweiser bottle. I had to ask for a water to be started with. Really? Employees bickering back and forth loudly, screaming babies (I know that's not the restaurants fault, but just adds to my frustration) floors were littered with garbage. Our server sucked. We're currently still waiting on our food, but the other tables around all had something wrong with their food. If it wasn't for a gift card, we would have walked out. \n\n**update: finally got our food, 45 minutes later. And the server was complaining about the plates being too hot because they sat in the window too long. Anyone else see the irony here? \n\nI'll never come back here again.
