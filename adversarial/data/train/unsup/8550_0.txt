This company owns a few locations which I use to go out of my way and drive to but thankfully they decided to open a location closer to my house and now this is my new go to nail salon. \n\nI use Ann and Brendon. Both so great and very detailed- mind you I am very particular and pay attention to the smallest details and luckily they are always open and willing to accommodate me.  I'm not always happy with my ending product wherever I go but BC they make the effort to make changes I want I always end up leaving very happy. \n\nCustomer service is great always checking on me and my needs. Fresh smelling, always clean & well kept by the salon cleaning ladies. Doesnt seem like they have picked up a lot of business yet but I don't mind BC it's nice and quiet when I get there but it really is a great spot so I'm sure they will fill up soon. \n\nFYI- when coming here make sure you are not in a rush as they do tend to take a while when working on you and all though i can get restless it is always worth me being patient BC the ending result is always so good. REMEMBER... I am picky.
