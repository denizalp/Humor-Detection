Do not rent here!  Do not be blindsided by the employees in the office they lie to your face,  once the contract is signed they are rude and ignore maintenance requests.. They have this little prick called Ethan who supposedly is the maintenance manager who is very disrespectful and just plain rude, he accused us of things we didnt say or do like requesting our washing machine to be repaired because we wanted a new one. The property rents to section 8 people and they lied about it,  you see lots of unsupervised teens walking around and they destroyed the basketball court. At one point I called 911 because of a fight at the pool and one of the guys in the fight attacked my female friend. Dont bother cleaning your apartment at the end of the lease because the WILL keep your money regardless. Overall, the property is very poorly managed and they dont take care of the honest paying residents who follow the rules and pay on time every month. There are better choices out there even if you pay a little more.
