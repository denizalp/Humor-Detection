I'm a huge fan of this place, and it has a lot going for it. You need to take this place as is, and understand what it is. It's a place where you get cheap food, cheap drinks, and you treat this place as if it was a commodity item. The food is tasty, and cheap, but don't expect culinary excellence. I always get a side order of bacon with my pad thai here, and it always works out to be a great meal. Lately I've been enjoying the chow mein too. Overall, this is one of my favorite spots for Toronto and it's a must for those looking to get filled up with decent food, and cheap alcohol, on a low budget. The service is OK, if not friendly, and the crowd is a good bunch.
