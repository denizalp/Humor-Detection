By the time I get to Phoenix, I'll be hankering...for a taste of something from back home. Jimmy Webb was a great songwriter, wasn't he? Anyway, you never quite expect to find good pho in Glendale among the strip malls, but sometimes you just get plain lucky. I was down there for business (...what else?) when a new colleague of mine took me here for lunch. Little did I know he was into pho and good pho at that. It was indeed in something of a strip mall and looks to be family-run with the owner quite familiar with my colleague, a good sign. The menu was surprisingly robust, and the place was hopping during the lunch hour (photo: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2ae8v6a).\n\nI decided we should share the bargain-price Goi Cuon at $3.75 for a hearty duet of spring rolls with pork and shrimp, as fresh as I've had in Little Saigon back in San Francisco and accompanied by a particularly rich peanut sauce (photo: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2ae8gI7). For my bowl, I decided on the $7.75 Pho Ga, which was chock full of tender pulled chicken in a light, clean broth festooned with cilantro and onions (photo: http:\/\/bit.ly\/29Qfeks). Just wish they offered giblets, tendons and hearts on the side. Seriously. Even though we were starting to feel the Southwest heat outside, the comforting taste of pho was like balm in a burrito-saturated city like Phoenix. Food snob? Yep, right here.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...pleasant surprise to find a good bowl of pho in these parts\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...just a part of the suburban sprawl\nSERVICE - 4 stars...friendly and timely\nTOTAL - 4 stars...definitely plan on coming back on the next business trip
