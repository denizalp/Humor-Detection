When I was a little kid I had no problem eating a pint of ice cream in thinking nothing of it. But as an adult, with a waistline, I've pretty much given all sugary delicious dairy products the boot. This is turned into a distaste for mass-produced ice cream for me. Pretty much of you can buy it at the supermarket and it says ice cream I won't even bother reading it it's not worth the calories. We are in the west side of Cleveland and had just finished up a dinner with the kids and decided to stop in to Mitchell's ice cream. I have a co-worker who does nothing but Rave about this place at any given opportunity so we figured we would give it a try. This particular Mitchell is built inside an old theater or movie theater I'm not sure which one it was from the early nineteen-hundreds and they did their best to preserve as much as they could in there which is pretty cool. The counter with all the ice cream has what I thought was mirrors behind it turns out it was a glass wall that you can see into the bakery and kitchen where they manufacture all their ice cream and Cones which is super cool. That and you can go up stairs to the second floor look down on the kitchen and this is all open to the public. I got an ice cream sundae and I can't remember which one it was but they had peanuts and hot fudge and also so delicious goodness. This was the case where my eyes did not deceive me it was as large as I thought it was for 499 and I was able to share this with my wife and neither of us were able to finish all of it. If I'm going to bother wasting calories and ice cream I will definitely do it only one place Mitchell's.
