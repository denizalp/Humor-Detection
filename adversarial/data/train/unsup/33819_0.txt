This was the best ramen i have had in a long time. the portions were perfect and the pork melted in my mouth. the table had a bowl of chili powder that was perfectly suited for my broth. the ginger was tender and juicy. the service was remarkable and very friendly. i will tell my friends about this place and continue to come here.
