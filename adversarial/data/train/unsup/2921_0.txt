If you go to a Chinese restaurant to eat make sure you see at least 10 Chinese people eating not standing around watching TV.  If you don't see them run. One of Funniest things I ever heard in my life the owner or maybe not was talking to a couple next to our table saying I require my staff to speak English. Really?  I asked for a jack and coke what came to the table was regular coke. I asked the server what's up? He said we don't have that. I said take the coke away he gave to the couple sitting next to us.  Joyful house! Our shrimp in lobster sauce came out with canned mushrooms strange.  My wife Asian was laughing. She said check out your fork I think they used that one to fix the drain in the kitchen seems the forks and spoons have been there sense 1980's it wouldn't be so bad if the food was really fantastic. Costco has GREAT deals on quality table wear on MLK (TIP OF THE DAY) I asked the server what is in the dumplings he said chicken. I asked if they had shrimp of pork dumpling he said you can go up the street if you want that. OMG! I said we will try the dumplings how many do you get ?  He said 5 - I said r u sure the menu says 6. He said 5 only. Ok served 6.  Keep in mind we went in early before 5pm to check this place out. I was here 12 yrs ago and it was pretty good. How many signs do you need that say vote #1 in the 2011 RJ readers poll inside your restaurant? I think I counted 6 big ones and a CNN international one blocking the front door.  Don't believe everything u read. It's  Dec21st we are all still alive and the food is below average. RJ readers poll is rigged.  Look I have been to Asian restaurants around the world this place is NOT in the top 100.  Maybe the real employee's are on vacation?  Hmmmmm...
