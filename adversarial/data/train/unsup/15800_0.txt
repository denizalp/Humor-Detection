The shoe department here is the devil.......I always find myself loaded down with all types of shoes here only to talk myself down to 1 or 2 pair or none at all unless it's a deal I can't walk away from.  They really have a great shoe selection here.  I don't usually find many deals on the clothes, so I don't spend much time going through those racks and racks of clothing.  They have a small designer jewelry section with mostly high end watches and I've found really amazing deals.  It's not a large store, and it seems overly crowded with merchandise at times and even with that, I must say that I always receive great service in the shoe and jewelry department.  Thankfully, I don't get over to this side of town often but it is worth the trip when I do.
