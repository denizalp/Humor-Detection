This is my favorite buffet in Vegas.  Cheap, No Lines and all you can eat Crawfish.  Has almost the same selection of food as the Rio Buffet and you'll never find a line here.  The desserts are delicious too, plenty of southern favorites.  But yeah I cant say enough about the all you can eat crawfish.  You pile a plate full of crayfish, clean them, eat them, and go back for more.  So remember this place if your in Vegas and its lunch time and you dont want to wait in a long line to eat.  Oh yeah did I say they had crayfish?
