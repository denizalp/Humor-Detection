I walked in a 9:30pm when they closed at 10. Even though they were close to closing time they were very nice and helpful. I got the  caprese sandwich and it was great and fresh even though it was almost closing time. I also had the Mac and cheese, I throughly enjoyed that as well. It's a great spot and I will be back.
