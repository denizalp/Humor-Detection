This particular Shoppers Drug Mart location is unique and I've been told the only one like it in Toronto. I have always loved having a neighbourhood Shoppers and having one close to home is usually on my list of apartment hunting criteria. When I moved into the Upper Avenue neighbourhood I was pleasantly surprised to find that it is the 'organic Shoppers' of Toronto. It's like having a combination of the Big Carrot, Whole Foods and a Shoppers all in one store... \n\nThey carry mainly organic\/health food & natural cosmetics, other unique items and including a pharmacy. I can find stuff here, such as non-GMO Morinaga smoothie-grade soft tofu, that is hard to find elsewhere in the area (I only like this brand for making chocolate pudding!) I also found a favourite Burts Bees product here that I haven't been able to find at other Shoppers locations. Plus they have a great essential oils collection that seems to get a little bigger each time I check for new oils.\n\nUPDATE - Sept 2014: This Shoppers is currently completing a major renovation and product offering change. I am still evaluating whether or not it will retain the uniqueness that I loved about it before. So far what I can say is that they are loading their shelves with more food, mostly PC & Blue Menu products, and less independent organic product lines... To be continued.
