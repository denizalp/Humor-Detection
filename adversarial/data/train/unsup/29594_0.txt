Yum! The food at all Oregano's is always delicious and I'd have to say the same about this location. Both the food and service is good here. It is very consistent with other locations.\n\nIt also is consistent with most other locations in parking - or lack there of. Unfortunately, this is just something you have to take with most locations.\n\nOtherwise, great place to go! You can usually get two meals out of your entree, too!
