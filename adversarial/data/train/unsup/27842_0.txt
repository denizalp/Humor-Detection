I've gone to this place at least four times and it's pretty great. The guy that's there when I go in is super nice and friendly. I've never ordered delivery so I can't speak on that however I've walked in and ordered majority of the time and the food is out and ready for me in a reasonable time frame. Chicken fried rice is phenomenal, wasn't super impressed with the egg drop soup.
