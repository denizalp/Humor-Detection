This spot was better than expected- and I mean that in the most positive way possible! I am not a fan of Bobby Flay and was underwhelmed by his burger spot. I went in with my guy and we had a great experience, even sitting at the bar for our meal. Sidenote: those bartenders are on point constantly squeezing fresh limes and shakin' up martinis.\n\nPRICKLY PEAR CACTUS MARGARITA: It's bright pink. That was my reminder that this is the same marg they have on the menu at Bobby's Burger Palace. It's fresher here, and my BF really enjoyed it, but I would have picked the white peach version instead.\nLOBSTER TACOS: $20 for a trio of mini tacos, super fresh and flavorful. The blue corn tortillas are a nice touch, and there was a good amount of acidity. Wish there were more seafood options on the menu.\nCORNMEAL CRUSTED CHILE RELLENO: My main complaint about usual chile rellenos is that they are overbreaded. Using cornmeal negates this issue! The chile is large and packed full of manchego cheese and roasted eggplant, served in a roasted red pepper sauce with balsamic vinegar. I really enjoyed this and would get it again! \nCHARRED POBLANO SWEET PEA RISOTTO: DUHLUSHUS. I didn't pick this and didn't expect it to be very good. I inhaled it. Subtle flavors, great texture, creamy and comforting. \nPISTACHIO BROWN BUTTER CAKE: The cake initially seemed dry, but upon combining the ingredients of the dish, this seemed to be a strategic decision. Bites that combined the ginger caramel, white peach ice cream, and\/or fresh fruit were artfully balanced.\n\nIf you are considering this spot to dinner, I highly recommend reservations: I popped by on a whim on a Wednesday evening at 6PM and they were full until 9PM. I lucked out and sat on the couches to order a drink and two spots opened up at the bar right away.
