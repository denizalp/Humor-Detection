We had high hopes for this restaurant since it was right on the strip but we were super disappointed. The waiter seemed kinda chill at first, chatting with us but after the initial conversation he disappeared a lot, and it wasn't that busy. The calamari we ordered was amazing but that was the only good thing about our meal. I ordered the carnitas Cuban and in the description it says there's supposed to be pickles on it but half of the sandwich did not have pickles and the carnitas lacked flavor. My boyfriend ordered the prime rib sliders, and they were messy and flavorless as well. The French fries he ordered were very oily. Overall we spent close to $80 for sub-par food. Probably will not return to this restaurant ever again
