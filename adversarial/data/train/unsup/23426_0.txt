Oh my gosh. I stumbled in here one day in a desperate stupor to find a gift for my mom. It was clearly fate, written in the stars, that I found this shop that I've walked past so many times before.\n\nFirst, I have to speak to the product offering. It is so cool....candles, soaps, novelties, gifts, apparel, scarves, jewelry, cards, glassware, artwork, and oodles more. I disagree with Amy. I am a 20-something, I could have stayed in here all day, not only shopping for myself, but shopping for anyone and everyone! Ultimately, I left with a birthday gift for my mom, a Christmas gift for my sister (yep...I bought a Christmas gift in August), and a vase for moi. I wanted to get so much more but my wallet was bleeding out. The prices aren't cheap, but I haven't seen some of this stuff anywhere else. \n\nNext, I have to talk about the staff, which for me makes or breaks my opinion of a business. They were so, so lovely, especially the owner. I felt like I was visiting some sleepy town where everyone knows your name and treats you like family. She treated me like a friend and painstakingly gift wrapped some of my gifts and bubble-packed others for the plane ride they would have to endure that day. It was a slow process, but I appreciated their kindness and I'll be back with bells on.
