I used to come to this place a lot when I was working around the neighborhood back then. It's a great little cafe \/ bakery. The pastries are excellency every time pass by could allured by the irresistible toffee caramel scent of the chocolate chip cookie . They bake several batches a day they are super fresh the type of chewy gooey chocolate chip cookies that you can't say no to . I remembered once I came here and got really lucky the fresh batch just came out of the oven.  It was divine with chunks of gooey chocolate and intense caramel flavor around the crispy edge. It's the type of chocolate chip cookie you look for everywhere and normally only your mom or grandma baked for you when u were a kid . But once I asked them to warm up the cookie turned out to be a huge mistake . The server are no baker they didn't flash it for 10 seconds instead for longer so my cookie was rock hard when cooled down .  That's the secret for a chewy chocolate chip cookie is to undertake them ;)  but ya I guess I carried away a bit far here get all excited about my chocolate chip cookie theory . \n\nThey also have pastries brought in from Rahier and deli action which have all kinds of sandwiches and soups , salads etc . My favorite is the roasted vegetables and brie , they use panini to warm it up so the cheese melts and gets all delicious . Great with tomato soup !  They also have some gourmet stuff on the shell including bags of chocolate and fancy olive oils.
