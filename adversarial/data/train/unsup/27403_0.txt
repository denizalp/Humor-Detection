My niece and I had a great experience at this lovely salon! The first two things you'll notice when you walk in is how spotlessly clean it is and how friendly the staff is. My niece and I each had a mani\/pedi, and I also got my brows waxed. The staff was efficient and attentive, and we got out in reasonable time without feeling rushed. Great place! Highly recommended.
