Avoid, Avoid, Avoid! Victoria has a neat trick I only discovered after spending $$$$ there. She only actually zaps a few hairs with the electrolysis electrode. She had been using tweezers to pluck my hair for months before I caught on. Now, I'm left with hair in places I never had it before. I feel sick. It's actually fraud.
