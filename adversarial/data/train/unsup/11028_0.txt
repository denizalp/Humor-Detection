I don't want to turn this into a commentary on the sad state of Mexican food in Pittsburgh... but I don't know, man. It's like the city as a whole has just shrugged it off and moved on with their lives.\n\nNot that Cuzamil is terrible. It's just, if you're gonna spend $12-15 on an entree, you want to feel like it's worth it. If you order a pitcher of sangria, you don't expect to find canned fruit at the bottom of your glass. You know what I mean? As if there's a mindset that the people of Pittsburgh just won't notice. Rise up, Squirrel Hill! Demand better! Or just stay quiet, and pass me one of your soggy fish tacos.
