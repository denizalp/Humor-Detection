Great bar with super friendly and attentive bartenders! We were visiting Toronto for a long weekend and I'm so glad I found this spot. They had a really large beer selection and what looked like a great food menu. We didn't get to eat here but the beers were awesome! We tried \"octopus wants to fight\" lol that's the best beer name ever, I believe it was an IPA. Another cool thing is that when we were visiting other places and asking for recommendations, a lot of bartenders told us to come here! This seems like a popular spot amongst the locals!
