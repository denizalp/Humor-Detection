OK, this place deserves a way better rating than it currently has. Recently I came back from Texas, where I enjoyed some pretty great Mexican food. This place isn't authentically Mexican of course, but the choices are pretty tasty and fulfilling for a decent price, and fast. It's located on De Maisonneuve just outside of Concordia's GM building, so very convenient for me to pop down for a quick treat of a lunch. \n\nI've had the beef quesadillas and burrito, and both were savoury and satisfying. The beef carnita was verrrry good. Both my lunch date and I were \"mmmmmmmmmm\"ing the whole time we ate, happy with our choices to the last bite. I didn't really like having to pay an extra $2.50 for guacamole on my quesadilla, but it still def beats the other food choices within the same one block radius! My only eyebrow-raising criticism is that what they call \"spicy\" is not even remotely spicy, so if you are craving the lip-numbing, gut-burning heat of legit spicy food, you won't find it here. They do offer hot sauces at the utensil station, so you can ramp it up a bit yourself, though. \n\nThey have jugs of ice water available, so you don't need to order a drink with lunch if you like to avoid the sugary syrup water (soda) like I do. There are no bathrooms, but they do have a hand sanitizer pump right next to the cutlery and napkins. Seating is limited, but I didn't have any problem getting a table. I'll be heading back for sure.
