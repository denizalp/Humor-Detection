The Martini is a quality niche bar for me.  The drinks will not wow you, and none of the menu items put a craving in the bowels of your soul that needs satisfying...but there are several reasons why you should make your way in here from time to time.\n\nUpon walking in to the Martini you immediately realize that this is not your average Vegas neighborhood bar...it looks and feels too nice for that.  It is certainly aesthetically pleasing with a classy, warm feel.  They a lot of nice TVs here that make it a great spot to watch the game.  They also have an early Happy Hour with food and drink specials.  One of my favorite things is that the kitchen is open late, so you can head in to The Martini after 10pm when most other places have closed their kitchens and still order up some decent  food.  In general I would shell out 3 Stars for the bar & restaurant...but when you include these niche specialties it's and easy round-up for me.
