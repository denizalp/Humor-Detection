Visited for a quick meet with a friend on Monday lunch hours. Was quite excited to walk in and try this place out after seeing good reviews, don't let them get you that soon like it did for me.\n\nThe interior design is quite eye-catching, modern and clean. It boasts great atmosphere and my friend and I sat near the door. The staff are friendly and nice but also very professional. There was minimal wait on sitting down, getting the menu and getting to order. It's a solid 5\/5 up to now.\n\nThe menu is well organized, not much to munch-on for a lunch menu but we decided to get the burgers made of Canadian Chuck. I also ordered the suggestive pairing for the burger which was the Shillow Sass. It was definitely a good tasting beer and tasted just like how it was described on the menu, but I'm not a beer expert so I'll leave it there.\n\nThe burger came with cole slaw and pickles on the side, with the burger itself having just lettuce and tomato. The burger itself wasnt bad, the patty was cooked to perfection, it was very moist and tasty. However the bun really threw me off, its taste didn't blend in well with the rest of the burger and it left a strong weird taste after. The texture of the bun also was pretty weird compared to what traditional burger buns are like: soft yet mildly crisp white buns. I guess the focus really is on the fact that it's probably healthy and trying to be experimental. I'll give the burger itself a 3.5\/5 since there wasn't much in the burger itself and tasted alright as a whole, pickles won't change the score sadly but their in-house made ketchup (i believe) may kick it up to a 4, definitely try it out with their ketchup.\n\nThe cole slaw, however was the calamity of this dish. It tasted blend, it honestly looks like how most Mondays look like; like a lazy slob of slaw was lazily thrown onto the dish. It didn't compliment the burger nor the beer, the slaw could have been left out for a better experience. I know i walked into a beer restaurant but any part of a dish that's served in any restaurant\/pub\/bar should never be this bad. Solid 0\/5.\n\nOverall the experience wasn't bad, i just really hate that slaw. I'll definitely come back to try other menus and other beers they got, but based on what I got I'll only be able to give a 3\/5. Two burgers and a pint costed ~$55 after tax and tips.\n\nTl;dr: meh foor for too much $$
