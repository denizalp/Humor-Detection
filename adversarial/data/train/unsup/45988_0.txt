Visited this cafe and ordered Banh mi cha lua, tiramisu, mango and passionfruit mason jar refresher. The shop is in a plaza on a corner and probably seats around 40-50 people. It's a very relaxed and chill environment. You order at the front and can find a seat to wait for your order number to be called. Prices are reasonable to me, especially being in the Charlotte area. The mango and passionfruit refreshers were amazing! They came out both looking the exact same in color, but taste very different. Each tea has cut-up fruit, chia seeds, and jelly inside. The Banh mi was also delicious and the tiramisu was one of the most authentic tiramisu's I've had (wasn't expecting that at all). If you're into trying fun Asian teas or want a low key place to hang out and eat some Banh mi or finger foods, check out Tea Fusion!
