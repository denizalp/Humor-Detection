MOTHER OF JESUS I THINK I JUST CREAMED MYSELF.\n\nNo seriously, it's that good.\n\nWhenever an establishment has several hundred reviews, and averages 4.5 stars, you can bet that their shit is pretty good.  Tacos El Gordo doesn't disappoint.\n\nThere is nothing that I can write in my review that other Yelpers haven't already told you.  The food is fucking good.  It's fucking filling.  And it's fucking cheap.  That's like the Yelper dream trifecta.  So instead of sitting on your iPhone, go now, and thank me later.\n\nWarning: I'm part Mexican.  Which means that I fit in well in this part of Las Vegas.  This is NOT your Las Vegas strip by the Bellagio type of crowd.  This is your recently immigrated type of crowd.  So if you're not comfortable amongst ethnic folks, then you might want to hit up the location on the strip.
