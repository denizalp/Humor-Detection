The Build-Your-Own meal trend continues to explode and this time its bimbibap at the #HOTandNEW Bibim Kitchen here in Henderson. \n\nWhat's unique is this Korean DiY bimbimbap  has an option to serve your creation in a hot stone bowl.\n\nYou all should know the drill by now of BYO meals.. Pick this, then that, and so on, so not going to elaborate on it. \n\nFYI\n- the purple rice..it's mix of brown, white and black rice..(turns deep purple when cooked)\n\n-Hot stone bowl for additional $ it is the way to go. I didn't think spending $11 was that pricey. Compared to the prepped meal that costs the same ( at Fix8).. this place much better choice for healthy meal with protein.\n\nWhen the staff was making my bowl, it looked like they were skimping on bulgogi and toppings but when I got my sizzling hot bowl, I was really impressed. So good! And even ratio of rice, protein and toppings. \n\n-Service welcoming, friendly, the time I visited was just about 2 weeks new so still sparkling clean. \n\nLocation is in the former spot by Trader Joe's. The spot that used to be a pizza, then Mediterranean, then French, then Greek.. Korean cuisine's turn now.
