I have used Johnny several times in the last 4 years for my business and for my personal computer at home. He is very helpful and explained what was happening and recommended the the best course if action. \nHe seems very knowledgable and his fees were reasonable, especially compared to the geeks. He only charges me for the actual time he was in my home or office which in all cases was less than I expected. He also has fixed one of my issues remotely. \nI trust him and would recommend him to anyone whether you are a small business owner like myself or are having issues with your home computer or network.
