When we got to Eggslut, the line was around the corner and into the hallway.  There was a menu in the hallway which was allowed us to decided ahead of time.  We were excited and ready to order the Cheeseburger and the Slut.  My husband was contemplating on adding bacon to the cheeseburger, but it was another whopping $4, so we decided to skip the bacon.  When we finally turned the corner into the restaurant, the other menu showed the extra bacon was $3.  \n\nWhen we finally ordered, we were disappointed that they were out of the Slut.  At noon.  Already?  Are you serious?  They should have let us know while we were in the long line, because we could have been there just for that item.  My husband asked when they will have it again, and they told us in an hour.  We ended up ordering the Cheeseburger and the Fairfax.  The wait for our food was pretty long.  \n\nFinally the food came.  The cheeseburger was good.  The bun was soft and buttery.  The pickles were more on the sweet side and delicious.  My husband's Fairfax was eggy, soft, and fluffy.  Despite our disappointment that they ran out of the Slut at lunchtime, this place is pretty good.
