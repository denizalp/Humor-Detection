After getting preggos, I was avoiding the whole foot massage experience just because...y'know, just because.  \n\nBut since the Baby was born, it was time to go back to getting some serious work done and Best Foot Spa was calling!\n\nFirst off, I chose this place because it was blowing up on Yelp at the time and second of all, the famous Rex opened this place up.  So, I had to go where he was and experience his magical hand, right?\n\nIt was my mom and I on this experience and we made appointments just in case.  We were led into a semi-private space with two chairs.  Rex worked on me while my mom had Lee.  \n\nAs with all of good foot massage places, your feet start off in a hot bath while they work on you head, neck and shoulders.  Then they eventually move onto your feet and then have you sit up to work on your shoulders before having you flip over and lie down!  Yep, lie down I tell you!  I love it when they tell me to flip over and lie down!  (Not all Vegas foot massage places offer this \"flip over\" business!)  That's when they get to working on your back and pushing you this way and that way while your face is in this hole.  This is what I was looking for!\n\nOne of the cool things they have are hooks for your purse and jackets - nice touch.  It's the little things that matter!\n\nI definitely appreciated that Rex makes a point of looking at the clock when he starts and telling you what time it is so there's no confusion about that.  (Unlike a few other places that claim you're getting a 60 minute treatment, but it's really 50.)\n\nAt the end of our service, Rex assures me that it's always the same people working there - himself, Lee, Elaine (or Eileen) and Carol.  I think this is because there are so many places that contract workers here and there.  So that makes me feel that you are certain of getting a specific kind of experience there.\n\nThey also offer a Yelp discount too! \n\n4.5 stars.\n\n* Update! (09.20.11)\nGoing down to a 4 star rating.  Lee worked on me last night and although he was good, the smell of cigarette smoke is very distracting.  I hate to have to ask ahead of time if the person working on me is a smoker or not, but I have a strong sense of smell!  That put me off from the very beginning.  Also, Rex took a call while he was working on the Husband.  Yes, I know it's business and all, but very distracting and a big pet peeve of ours.  Get someone else to handle the phones please.\n \nRight before they started working on our feet, they mentioned that they could make my feet like a baby's butt...for an additional 30 minutes and a $29 charge.  It includes a hot wax...which I assume is a parafin wax dip. Although I love having my feet super soft, we had to pass this time around.
