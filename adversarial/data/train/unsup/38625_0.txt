One of the few places to get espressos and lattes in the downtown LV area. It's a small location with limited choices of pastries (at leasts the few times I have been there). It's on the Fremont side of the Golden Nugget which has another one on the Carson side. This one tends to be less crowded in the morning as the one on the Carson side is the near the place where people wait to hop back on their tour bus and take a coffee while waiting.
