I am\/was a long time customer of Kathy's (5 years!) of getting a reliable shellac mani but since my last visit, I will stick to Nails Boutique and Spa in Oakville. Upon closer inspection, I noticed that I had nail polish on the skin around my nails. Sloppy rushed work?After one day, my nail polish started to bubble and peel at the corners, showing the lack of quality products being used. What happened to my beloved nail shop? Including the nicer man that used to be at the payment counter? Now there is an older man there who seems to be grouchy towards everyone.
