Stopped into this restaurant for lunch with my coworkers and had a fabulous time. Our sever was amazing and made some really good recommendations. Our food came our quickly and was super fresh. The chef even took my friends challenge to add even more spice to her already spicy meal! (She loved her dish, by the way.) \n\nIt's an inexpensive place with great quality, and I definitely recommend it if you're in the area!
