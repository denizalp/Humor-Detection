I think often times when people are running blah errands, like posting things, they aren't in the best mood. Thus, they deem it a terrible experience. Recently I had to buy a buttload of stamps, so I popped into my neighbourhood Canada Post. \n\nThis old building is accessible, they can handle all of your postage and shipping needs, but most importantly: the people working here are so nice. Wake up from the horror that is your errands and realize these people are kind, funny and care about your mail getting places.
