Cute little noodle shop in Spring Valley. I've been to Shang twice now and I'm still a big fan that I'll keep coming back for more oodles of noodles!\n\nMy favorite dishes were the beef pancakes and dan dan noodles. The beef pancakes come in a set of 4 and they are pan seared and extra juicy. I really mean it when I say juicy. We had two juice squirting accidents (that sounds kind of wrong?) during our meal! The Shang beef noodle soup is also a tasty dish with good flavor and tender beef. Perfect for this Vegas winter weather!\n\nIt's especially fun with their open kitchen and work stations that you get to see the noodles being made and pulled right in front of you! You have the option of hand pulled or knife cut noodles. I've tried both now and prefer the hand pulled. The consistency and size of the knife cut were too all over the place that I didn't enjoy it too much. \n\nThey have a lot of different noodle dishes, both soups and dry\/saucy noodles so everyone in your party can be in for a treat. The shop is on the smaller side so I wouldn't recommend coming with a large party. There is probably 8 tables total. There is bar seating as well. \n\nParking can get cramped in the lot since it's shared with a few other businesses but it shouldn't be a big deal.
