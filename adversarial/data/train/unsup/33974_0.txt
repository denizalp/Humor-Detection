This is to report a dangerous driver of one of your school buses.  At 3pm on Friday, 8\/17 (last week), the bus with license plate number CJ-60589, when approaching the intersection of Higley and Pecos, in Gilbert, failed to stop at the red light.  The bus was south-bound on Higley and turned right onto Pecos, headed west, without stopping on red.  Additionally, upon making the right turn the driver immediately, and illegally, crossed all three lanes and went into the number 1 lane.  He cut off traffic that had a green arrow to turn onto Pecos when he ran the red, then he further blocked more cars when he drifted all the way to the number 1 lane.  Hazardous and dangerous driving - how can I pretend to be happy about sending my kids on one of your buses after this?
