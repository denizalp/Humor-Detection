Indigo is the lighthouse that will guide you home through the barren sea of consumerism that is the Eaton Centre. It is a place where you can feed your mind and nourish your soul, so that one day you will have gained enough knowledge to do something purposeful with your life; it is then and only then that you too will have the credentials to distribute your ideas to the masses in the form of a paperback book (preferably as a Heather's Pick - who the heck is Heather anyways and who let her put stickers on all the books).
