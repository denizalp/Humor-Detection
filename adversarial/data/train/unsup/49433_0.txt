I went to Lola Rosa during brunch hour. The brunch menu was quite limited so I was happy to learn that it was also possible to order from their usual menu. The service was quick and the restaurant was rather quiet when we arrived.\n\nI got half an order of the nachos they are famous for and my friends got the lasagna and the portobello. All three plates were good but the lasagna is what stood out for me. Topped with a mountain of deliciously melted cheese it was the best vegetarian lasagna I had ever tried.\n\nWe also ordered their trio of desserts which included a chocolate mousse, a cheesecake and a crème brûlée. All three are must tries.\n\nThe prices are fair and the portions are very filling. I would come again. 4\/5
