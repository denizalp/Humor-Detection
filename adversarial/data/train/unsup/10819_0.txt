First, I apologize for my friends...\n\nI realize that absolutely nothing we ordered was on the menu (or probably on any menu anywhere) but i sincerely appreciate you making it anyways. The concotions that sound appealing after a night of drinking, blow, blackjack, and hookers are endless, and you my friends, are A-MAZING. I apologize that i used the menu as a pillow and threw that straw at that kid (why is there a kid at dennys on las vegas blvd at 4 am?!) but that burger you made me with the peanut butter, avocado, and salsa was spectacular. And my best friend really enjoyed the buscuit and gravy covered waffle and hashbrowns. \n\nkeep fighting the good fight.
