Joey and Michelle are both amazing people. They're kind, patient, and as accommodating as possible. Joey is a kick ass tattoo artist, and Michelle is the lovely woman that keeps the shop running seamlessly. I adore this couple from the bottom of my heart, and I am forever grateful that my path has crossed with theirs. \nLove love love them, I would recommend their shop to anybody.
