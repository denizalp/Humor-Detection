I love shopping at the Forum Shops.  There's such a great variety of stores and the people watching is priceless!\n\nThe last visit here, I bought a set of Ping irons at the Callaway Store.....yes, I couldn't believe it either!  I normally don't buy items like this at a mall like this because 9 times out of 10 it's a ripoff.  However, this wasn't the case......they were significantly less than other golf shops.\n\nAfter I saw the price tag, I called around town to see if there were any better deals.....one guy said \"If that's the real price for those irons, you better buy them on the spot....you won't find them for that price anywhere else!\".....so, of course I did it!\n\nThe other fun part about this mall is that Pete Rose frequently signs autographs at a memorabilia store here.....he's always a character.  If you haven't met him, I suggest you stop by that store when he's there.\n\nOverall, it's always a good time at the Forum Shops.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%
