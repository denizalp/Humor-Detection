Schizophrenic...or Bipolar!?!\nSuzanne goes from crying and screaming at her employees, throwing tantrums like a child about how it's not her fault something went wrong to pretending to flatter you trying to kiss your @ss. Her half compliment\/insults shows how she really feels, she told me \"I hate you, you're so skinny, you make me sick.\" hehehe. Her alterations were even worse! When I came in for the fitting she acted surprised to see me even though I was on her appointment book. Since she had over booked herself she had to hurry as she jumped back and forth from the other bride, myself and sewing on someone else's wedding gown in the back of the store. She has the attitude that since it's only worn for one day, and no one will see the inside it doesn't matter. She owns her own business, I get it; it can be stressful, but if you're so miserable that you are yelling & crying in front of your customers, and taking it out on your employees like they are your personal whipping boys... Just maybe you should be doing something else with your life, and not ruining someone else's bridal experience. I own my own business too honey, and guess what? It's ALWAYS your fault, ultimately the buck stops right at you, and no one else BUT you takes the blame. As someone who works very hard to manage my own business, it made me sick to hear all her \"Poor me!\" Bullsh#t. I will never recommend this shop to any one, and stay away from Suzanne, she is one of the worse two faced people I have ever met!
