\"That might be the worst thing I have ever put in my mouth.\" - Scott Conant, Chopped.\n\nI'm so disappointed in this place.  Bad food, bad service, high prices.  How can it get worse?\n\nI figured with all the good things I heard about their brunch, if I chose my items carefully, I could turn this 3.5 star rated place into a 4 star experience -- so wrong.\n\nWhen over-done prime rib and dry turkey are what \"save\" a place, that speaks to how bad everything else was.  To make matters worse, very poor, rude service at the cashier --  felt like a stereotypical Chinese restaurant, killing the Paris escapism. And I'm Chinese!\n\n$25 for my 13 year old daughter who ate half a crepe?  \n\nHere's a rundown of the foods sampled:\n\n- prime rib - unevenly cooked, but mostly grey over done.\n\n- turkey - bone dry, the gravy was solidified and chunky so I didn't use it.\n\n- mussels\/clams - flavorless\n\n- pastas - bland, dry, room temp\n\n- fruits - not sweet, watery, flavorless\n\n- bread - stale\n\n- pate - big clunky pieces, no finesse \n\n- cheeses - ditto\n\n- orange juice - like tang\n\nI honestly can't understand why anyone would like this place.  Are they so excited to be in Vegas they overlook quality?  First time at a buffet?  Because they have a crepe station?  This place makes Hometown Buffet feel special.\n\nI REALLY hate wasting food and would always make an effort to finish something, even if I don't care for it.  But sadly on this day, we wasted quite a bit of food.\n\nI feel so violated.\n\nMy tip.... Go to somewhere like Texas De Brazil or Fogo De Chao for lunch, if you want a high quality buffet.  You'll spend less than dinner prices, and if you think Village Buffet is good, you'll think you're in heaven.
