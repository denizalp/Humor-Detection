I was in the area and hungry so I decided to let yelp decide where to dine. Kabuki (authentic Japanese cuisine and sushi) had outstanding reviews.  It's a small place located in the Sun Valley Commons center in Union County.   With such an extensive menu I went simple:  1) A House Salad: Crispy Iceberg lettuce, cucumber and green pepper with Kabuki ginger dressing and 2)  Chicken Teriyaki Entree (steamed rice and sauteed vegetables).  There was plenty of food for sure and it was fresh.  Two things:  The Kabuki ginger dressing didn't have the typical punch that I personally like and the chicken wasn't Teriyaki'd (is that a word?) enough for me.  Really nice folks though.  Go give it a try.
