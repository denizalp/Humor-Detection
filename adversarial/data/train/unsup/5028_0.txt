This was one of the worst dining experiences I have had!  I was excited to try this place because I recently moved to a house across the street.  I was sorely disappointed.  The place was being run by two teens.  Within minutes of ordering we spotted our first cockroach crawling.  We spotted several more during dinner and couldn't continue to eat.  The food tasted good for the most part but we a mild beef appetizer as something for our toddler to munch on.  They came out and said they didn't have anymore of that item and recommended the potato version instead.  When I told him it was for the toddler he said it would be fine.  What came out tasted good but was so spicy it would not be good for a toddler.  My chicken tikka masala said it was spicy on the menu but was not spicy at all.  The garlic naan did not have ANY garlic flavor whatsoever.  When I asked if there was a manager I could speak to they indicated that he was not there and that there was no one else present.  When we were pulling out of the parking space, we saw the two teens explaining everything to an older woman.  Clearly there was someone else present but they didn't want to talk to us.  With the spicy food, we had to ask several times to get our drink refilled.  Since there was no manager there was no adjustment on the bill.  The only thing I was told is \"sorry, the seasons are changing so the roaches are coming out.\"  Not a good answer.  Restaurants need to have proper vermin control.  This was just disgusting.  I do not recommend this restaurant at all.
