Don't eat here. Just finished my meal. Ordered the kimchee fried rice which already comes with an egg but I wanted it scrambled. When I got my bill they had charged me $1 for the egg. When I asked why, the manager said for labor. Never in my life have I experienced something so ridiculous as being charged $1 for a scrambled egg instead of a fried egg.
