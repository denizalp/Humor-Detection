I had come here with some friends in high hopes of having a fun filled night. After dinner, we hurried on over due to utter excitement. Upon entering, we were not greeted. We were just pointed in the direction of these screens lined up against the wall. At first, I didn't know what they were and that I was supposed to go over to the screens. I just followed the crowd and figured it out on my own. Once done, I went over to the counter to discuss which plan we would take in paying. The blonde girl at the counter was not friendly at all and was not very helpful when we were thinking out loud to see what we wanted. When we asked her questions, she would merely reply with a \"nope\" or \"yup\". After waiting for our races to start, we just sat and waited observing the racers before us. You have to watch an instructional video so you know what to do. All in all, it was not for me, the whole racing thing. I think people come here for times? Another thing is I believe that the polls or whatever the screen is where you see what place youre in is wrong. There was no way I finished last in one race, because this one girl had never passed me. I lapped her a couple times, but SOMEHOW she still beat me. I thought maybe I was wrong and just a sore loser, but my friends said that they thought the scoring of places was off too. All in all, I felt like the people working were just plain rude. If it wasn't for this, I would probably give this place another chance. Oh! and we didnt even get our \"free\" t-shirts.
