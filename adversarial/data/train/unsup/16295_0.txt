So according to an expert - authentic baklawa places spell it with a w, non authentic  places spell it with a v like baklava. Name seems legit so we stopped by for some sweets. \n\nThis tiny store is pretty pretty busy for an afternoon on a weekend. Surprisingly, it offers a ton of pastries and Turkish coffee for such a small store. They place your order in a cardboard box instead of paper bags which is great.\n\nThe baklawa was SO CRISPY and delicious. The sugary syrup oozed into my mouth while the top layer of the crispiness fell apart. \n\nSo far, best baklawa in toronto!
