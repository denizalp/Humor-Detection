I ate here with my 3 friends. We put down an insane amount of crab legs, corn muffins, prime rib, sushi, chinese food, pizza, carrot cake and ice cream.\n\nImmediately afterward, we all went to the bathroom next to the buffet, took a seat in 4 adjacent stalls, and we all had massive Mirage Buffet babies together while making fart noises with our arms. \n\nThe food was fine. No great shakes, standard buffet fare, followed by the standard buffet run to drop a major deuce.
