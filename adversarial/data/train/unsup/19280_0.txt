I wanted to wait before I wrote this review, so here we go ~\n\nI was getting my boyfriend's new car tinted as a birthday present, and my dad pointed this place out.\nI called in an appointment on a Thursday, hoping to get seen the same day, but they were booked - since it's our only day off together, we decided to wait a week. \nThe following Thursday, we headed down there in one car (my mistake), talked to Jay who was very friendly, although obviously busy. No worries, we can go walk around for a couple hours! We ended up walking to the Orleans for lunch, and Jay gave us an estimate time of completion and updated us as well. Got the car back, looking sexy as hell, and happily drove off. \nIt's been 3 weeks now, and I can say my boyfriend is extremely glad we got it tinted - I decided on getting him the heat blocker windshield, and I'm now pretty jealous of not getting my own car done. He has praised over and over how much \"cooler\" his car is than mine. \nOverall, very happy with the work done. And I'm getting more home-cooked meals from his appreciation. Woot!
