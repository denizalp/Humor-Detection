We went to Landmark Diner last week while in Charlotte because they had been featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives and were certainly not disappointed.  The menu selection was HUGE and the service was great.\n\nThere were 6 in my party and we all ordered different dishes and shared portions so that everyone could experience different things.  The favorites were the Lasagna and the Greek Combo.  The chocolate cake was absolutely massive and was fantastic.\n\nThe service was outstanding.  There was a very difficult couple seated near us and the staff handled the complaining diners with respect even in the face of extreme rudeness from the customers.  Our service was absolutely outstanding and the staff was courteous and engaging.\n\nI would recommend Landmark Diner with no reservations.
