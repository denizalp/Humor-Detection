Stayed here for a wedding with many other guests. The hotel is undergoing a renovation. From what I can tell we had a renovated room which was very nice and colorful with barn doors and a flat screen LG TV. The staff was friendly at check in. The valet is $20 and self is $15 expected in this area. Breakfast is free which is a plus but, really nothing special. It was packed. America . I would stay here again!!!
