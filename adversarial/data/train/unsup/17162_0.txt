Maui Dog has been the talk at the office for the last month so I decided to crash a lunch group and join. After hearing from countless people how amazing this place is, I was surprised when we pulled into the parking lot. Normally I don't event think about going into establishments like this...not even a consideration. However, I trusted my friend's judgment and he was totally right. All I have to say, is wow.....what a dive and an amazing little place! I'd call it a diamond-in-the-rough (the inside of it is a diamond in the sense the dogs were amazing, and the building is rough...looking). \n\nI think the dog I had was called the Sunset dog...pepperoncinis, spicy mustard, mango, and a mild spice to it. Let me tell you...this thing was unbelievable. It had a combination of sweet, sour, spicy, and salty all in one. I didn't want it to end. I realized once I had finished it was the best dog I've ever had. Now I can see the fad with this little place. I'm not sure if it's true or not, but I hear it might be moving a little more east, which is great because that is closer to my office. While we were there during lunch, there was a steady stream of folks coming in, so it has a good rep. \nThe lady working up front was very friendly and outgoing...another plus!\n\nTwo things I learned today: the rumors of Maui Dog are true in being an awesome bite, and also don't judge a restaurant by it's shell!
