Bakery On The Go, its located in Warden Station, which makes it convenient when you want to have a little snack while waiting for the bus. The prices are reasonable, for the types of food items that are offered. They open early and close late, meaning you can get something in the morning and evening. With that said, if you are purchasing a snack in the evening, they are generally leftovers from the day; this means they aren't the freshest. Finally, if your looking for award winning customer service, well, look somewhere else- the service level varies- depends on who assists you and their mood.  \n\nPersonally, I sometimes treat myself to a cinnamon-bun or a vegetarian patty. I've tried the beef patty, and ended up with indigestion.
