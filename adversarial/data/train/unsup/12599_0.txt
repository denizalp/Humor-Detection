After sampling their tasty roast beef and Gorgonzola mashed potatoes in a champagne glass at Yelp in Bloom I HAD to have this for lunch the next day. I woke up the following morning craving it and immediately looked up their menu online. I found the braised beef sandwich and called in my order. The quoted my 15 minutes, but I got there in less than 10 and it was ready. You can pick up call in orders at the first register when you walk right in. So convenient. They also have seating right outside on the sidewalk, but it's not covered so there isn't much shade around during the lunch hour. \n\nIt was everything I remembered. Whoever thought of putting mashed potatoes in a sandwich was brilliant. The sandwich comes with roast beef with Gorgonzola mashed potatoes and you get a side of horseradish and au jus on the side. It also comes with sweet potato chips. \n\nWell done, Wildflower. Well done. I was never much of a fan of yours before, but this one is a winner.
