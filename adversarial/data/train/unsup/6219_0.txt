3.95 steak n eggs! That should of got your attention! No player card needed. Available from midnight to 6 am. They also have other good choices off their graveyard menu. \n\nI love this place because unlike some other places, you don't get to breathe in cancer causing smoke while you are eating. The ventilation is really good here. Service is above average. \n\nThe only thing you gotta worry about is sometimes there is a long line just right before midnight just so everybody can get those graveyard specials. So if you are already starving, you will probably get all cranky waiting to sit down and order. You might wanna pack a snickers cuz just like the commercial, you're not you when you're really hungry.
