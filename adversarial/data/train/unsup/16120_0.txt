Dinner with my family started out enjoyable enough. The food was rather mediocre, though I wasn't expecting much being far from any sources of fresh fish, or Japanese cooks. I also decided to steer clear of the blue wasabi that looks like it's been dipped in anti-freeze. It was obvious their focus was not on food, but on drinks and creating a fun atmosphere. Their decor is hip and contemporary, with a color changing wall above the bar, and abundant flashing lights and TV screens. They try to continue the theme by naming their signature sushi rolls with silly names like \"Eating Nemo\" or  \"Kiss My Bass\", though a few like  \"Me Soy Horny Roll\" or \"Dirty Sanchez\" hardly make you think of sushi. Despite the second rate food and the epilepsy inducing environment, hanging out with your 4 yr old nephew is always a good time...or so I thought.\n\nClose to the resolution of dinner, I took a break to smoke a joint behind the restaurant. I'm from Cali, so...I was being a bit nonchalant and careless about it all, not realizing the laws here are a bit different. I was just chatting on the phone with my girlfriend while trying to mind my own business. A girl from Blue Wasabi who was also hanging out in back of the restaurant smelled it, and asked me to \"please move on\"...I replied \"Sorry! I didn't realize I was disturbing anyone, thanks for telling me nicely.\" And I put it out and returned to my table.\n\n10 minutes later the cops are hauling me out in front of my parents and little nephew. 5 minutes later I'm in cuffs and they're charging me with a class 6 felony.\n\nWow...I couldnt believe it. This girl, even described me as \"nice\" to the cops, yet she called the cops on me as I peacefully patronize her restaurant with my family! Does she have no heart? What a cruel and unnecessary thing to do! Things like this make me lose faith in humanity. Why would someone wish such terrible treatment upon a fellow human for no good reason? It makes me deeply sad. \n\nI can't in good faith recommend a restaurant where they treat their customers like criminals, literally.
