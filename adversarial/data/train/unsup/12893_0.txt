The worst part about this place is deciding what to have.  \n\nThe shop itself is funky and artsy and hip.  The menu is fun and unique.\n\nIf you want a shaved ice, you can choose to order pre- designed ingredients, like the breakfast bowl snoh or go rogue and mix and match what you want.\n\nI chose the latter and had mango shaved ice with pineapple chunks and caramel drizzled.  But also had to try the breakfast bowl Snoh too.  Who can resist fruity pebbles?   Both were extremely delicious and refreshing too.\n\nThe employee was very knowledgeable and patient while I figured out what I wanted.
