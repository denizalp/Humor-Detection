I started coming here for the medical weight loss program about three weeks ago and so far things are going great. Everyone has been super sweet and helpful. The girls up front are always smiling, Dr. Tynara answered all of my questions and concerns about the shots and medications, and Jamie, who actually gives me my shots, is really calming. I had a somewhat embarrassing question for her, but she was very professional about it, and I really appreciated that. This place is awesome!
