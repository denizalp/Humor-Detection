The food was excellent and the atmosphere was really fun for a girls night out. But the service was lousy. We waited almost 30 minutes to get sat even though we had a reservation. The hostess kept seating walkins before us and kept assuring us our table was \"almost\" ready, mind you, there was only three of us. Not a HUGE group.the tree in the middle of the place was very whimsical and the music was good. But the service was extremely lacking, would definitely not go back for that mere fact.
