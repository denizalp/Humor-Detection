My friends & I went for Sunday Brunch.  The food was really good.  The carving stations had lamb, prime rib and turkey.  The vegetables on the buffet were not overcooked and soggy.  The sushi was fresh, not gummy.  The shrimp was tasty, not mushy.  The desserts were delectable.  The only thing missing were crab legs but with everything else you didn't even miss it.
