I've got to be honest if this place wasn't next door to coffee bean, I would never go to this location.  We love Einstein bagels but I agree with the opinion that the service at this restaurant is extremely subpar! It is dirty but that is a reflection on the staff,  they never have enough bagels. It would be one thing if it wasn't the same every time you went in but at some point one would think they could do a better job of figuring out the number of bagels to make.  I have gone to the Einstein on Alma School andQueen Creek much,  much better.  All I can say is they're lucky they are in the location they are.  I can't believe people would ever make it back as repeat business once treated so poorly and food not prepared well!
