You never know what to expect at a WHBM store. There are times when you are smothered with compliments and attention and there are times when they don't notice you at all. \n\nOnce, I walked in with my husband and they must have thought \"here comes the checking account along with the customer\". That day I was spoilt rotten by the staff to the extent that I ended up buying two outfits at full price. The next time, I was alone and looking for deals. So I hopped over to the SALE section. That day nobody bothered to throw a glance at me.\n\nTalking about the clothes, I love their designs and cuts but the materials that they use are just not upto the mark, especially the winter-wear. They use a lot of faux materials and charge you for pure wool, leather or cotton.
