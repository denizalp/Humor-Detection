Wowie Zowie!\n\nIf you're even a little bit interested in cocktails, barware, or the finer things in life, you definitely need to make your way to BYOB when in Toronto. First there's the cocktail ingredients: bitters, mixers, syrups, etc. Then there are the glasses and barware--beautiful cocktail glasses, ceramic tiki glasses shaped like parrots and fish, shakers of all sorts of sizes and made of a variety of materials (glass, aluminum, etc). Fun details like toothpicks, metal straws, ice molds, etc. Plus fancy bar tools and accessories and glassware for beer and wine as well. Need help getting started? They're more than happy to help. And they have tons of books with cocktail recipes and more to give guidance as well.\n\nPrices are a little on the high side so I wouldn't stock my entire bar here but for beautiful pieces and additions it's absolutely worth visiting and acquiring items from them over time. \n\nIt's a bit tight so be careful as you move around. Lost of delicate and expensive things in there that are easy to knock over.
