A Dave's is a good standby for a sandwich in Cleveland. Located off the main drag of Chagrin Falls, this Dave's is nestled in a small little shop that's like Platform 9 3\/4. You might miss it if you weren't looking for it. Its nice to have a fast casual stop amongst all the shopping and higher-end restaurants.\n\nAfter a day of shopping with a friend, I popped in to get a sandwich to-go. Immediately, I noticed that while this location has the usual Dave's classic rock decor but takes it a bit further. They have hand-painted deceased rock icons on the ceiling and a well-done portrait of John Lennon on the side of a cooler. This location is also a lot smaller than others around Cleveland, so just be prepared if you were planning to dine-in. \n\nThe Dave's Famous Italian Sausage is always delicious from any Dave's - it comes with Italian sausage, Dave's sauce, tomato, provolone, herbs and crushed peppers. Its served hot - I totally recommend it if you can wait the 8-10 minutes for them to make it. Good old Dave's - always a good choice when you're on the move.
