Yum! This has been on my bucket list for a while. Me and the hubs decided to come early on a sunday morning. We were happy because we beat the early sunday crowd! \n\nThe lady taking orders at the front was very friendly and sweet! Ordering was a breeze. We got our drinks and sat by the window. We got our bagels within a few minutes. I got the Tonya Harding with a everything bagel. It was warm and tasty! The bagel was delicious! Not too chewy which I like! There was plenty of meat! My hubs got the nice piece of ash on a wheat bagel. I liked his better because it had the onions and banana peppers. But both were good! \n\nI can't wait to come back again.
