Me: I would like the beef...\nServer: Stir fried noodles\nMe: How did you know?\nServer: That's what people get from that (Malaysian) menu.\nAnd with that answer I felt very confident in my pick and it did not disappoint.  The beef was tender and flavorful, the veggies were warm but still had their crunch, and the noodles still had a chew to them...delish.   I ended up over-eating to the point that I got full and sleepy but not enough to stop me from having leftovers.  I also got a milk tea with bubbles.  I would have liked a bit more boba but was not willing to pay the $.50 charge to get more.  Overall, very tasty.
