it is 5pm. 30 minutes past closing. I have been waiting an hour for my 4pm appt. i did my early check-in online, but, apparently \"the system shouldn't be offering that option, you have to do your paperwork here\". so that was a total waste of time. reception staff is windexing the windows\/doors and still allowing walk-in patients to come in after closing time, touching the same doors she just cleaned for the end of the day. another waste of time. staff is sweeping *around everyone's feet* in the waiting room. oh. theres a kid eating cheez its making more crumbs as she finishes sweeping. another complete waste of time. office staff says nonchalantly \"45 mins or longer wait times are totally normal in our office\". this whole office seems like a total WASTE OF TIME. i havent even gotten my first appointment and im ready to find another office this is just ridiculous. i have watched numerous employees clock out and leave while there are still at least 10 people in the waiting room, oh not to mention the walk ins after they should have been closed. this office is obviously very disorganized. i'm beyond frustrated\n\nnot to mention the issues getting thru on the phones just to get this first appt, they never answer the phone... all her Yelp reviews say 'shes worth the wait, etc etc' this office is just terrible i cant imagine how 'great' this doctor can be with all this crap i'm going thru for an appt
