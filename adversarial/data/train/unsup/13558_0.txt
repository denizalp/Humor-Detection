In lieu of the recent events that provide a haunting admonition to the fate of Larry and Carol's, I'd like to add my review.\n\nHere's to the late nights on Semple street, having too good of a time to stumble the fifteen feet across the street to our door; here's to the muscle outside Larry and Carol's until 4 AM, the muscle that came back a few hours later, the muscle that kept a pretty dirty watch on the block. Here's to the always-tired staff, the cooks that wouldn't hesitate to ask you what the hell you wanted in their store, the cooks that gave up dough for the locals. Here's to the pizza, that horrible pizza; and here's to the rest of the food that we were too wasted to ever want to try, because it was always about the pizza. Here's to the King Kong, and here's to the parties, and here's to the memories of Larry and Carol's.\n\nThey weren't the best place, they weren't the nicest place, but they were quite the place.\n\nL&C, L&C, L&C forever.
