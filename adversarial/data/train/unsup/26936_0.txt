I was expecting SideBar to be all hype after the reviews that I had seen and even from my judgment of this book's cover as I have driven past it many times. A nice, chill bar in the same building as a Pei Wei and Starbucks? Well, I'm currently chewing a fat slice of humble pie. This is hands down one of the best lounges that I've been to in Phoenix.\n\nThe second I walked up those narrow stairs I was surprised to find this shoe box of a lounge. Don't let the space discourage you at all though, you'd be a fool to let that happen. The interior and decor are very stylish while at the same time they set a vibe that sets you at ease and allows you to enjoy your drink. I came here on a weeknight so I don't really have a clue as to how it is on the weekends or how crowded it then. Based off my experience however, I found this to be a great spot to bring friends for conversation and drinks. \n\nI ordered a Manhattan, and while it was a bit heavily mixed, everything else about this place really made it a great experience. SideBar doesn't really offer any to eat besides some smaller finger type foods like hummus. A complaint I had about the hummus was that it came with pita chips rather than regular pitas, but that's a small complaint given that I had an overall enjoyable experience.\n\nSideBar, you've found a new patron and a new spot on my favorites list.
