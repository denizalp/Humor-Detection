If only the food were as good as the atmosphere.  This place has tons of character. It's small but lively. The staff is really friendly as well and that's always a plus. Problem is that the subs are nothing special. They taste like anything I could make at home in 5 minutes or less.  When I end up going I feel like there is way too much bread like one of those pre made grocery store subs. Also the prices are high. It's really close to work but honestly the DES building down the street has a cafeteria that does subs on Thursdays. Quality is the same, DES portions are about 50% bigger and with chips and drink it's still about half the price.
