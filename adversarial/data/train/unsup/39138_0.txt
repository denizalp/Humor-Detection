Thank you Darren for bringing me here for our anniversary (3 years!). I wanted a romantic, intimate dinner, and the staff pulled out all the stops, even putting us in a posh booth in the back of the dining room and giving us a free shareable dessert with a candle in it. \n\nA serving of the Pan Seared Scallops was our starter, and they were delicious, especially with the bacon marmalade. My entree was the Maple Leaf Farm's Duck Breast which was tender beyond compare. It was complimented by a blueberry port reduction, parmesan risotto, and green beans, all of which was fantastic. \n\nOur dessert that we shared was the scrumptious Banana Foster Napoleon. \n\nOur server Cheryl was really nice as was the decor. \n\nBistro 19 rocks.
