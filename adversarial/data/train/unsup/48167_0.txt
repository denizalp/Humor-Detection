I went here on a Saturday and they had a 20 minute wait, which is understandable because of the popularity and weekend. For $15 for one person, I was expecting to be blown away. Instead was just left frustrated and still hungry. The chopped brisket looked amazing from the first glance, but after a couple bites I was waiting for the mmmmm moment. It never came. Sandwich was dry and had very little BBQ taste to it. Even after slathering it in sauce it wasn't anything special. The fries were actually good, but got soggy fast. I want to love this place since it's such a cool concept and seems to be run by very genuine people, but it was a huge disappointment. Unless I caught them on an off day I'm not really sure what the hype is all about.
