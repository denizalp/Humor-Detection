Went here on A wednesday night with my friend. Very easy to get a table for 2. This is a smaller restaurant than the one at Sheppard location .\nWe were served corn on the sizzling plate as a complimentary dish. It was really sweet and delicious. We were also given some salad\/ radish side dish. \nWe ordered Crispy wings and spicy sauce on the side. I was hoping the wings would be super crispy since it was not going to be drenched with sauce like the last time I ordered. \nI liked the fact that I got to dip the spicy sauce to keep the wings crispy. If we just order crispy wings on its own, it has no flavor. \n\nThe spicy sauce was more sweet with a sudden burst of spice. It came with fries in the same basket. \n\nWe also ordered a small plate of green onion with boneless chicken. It was a huge plate for 2 people! it was lacking on the sauce but I think the boneless chicken was fried really nicely. I like the sauce for this dish at Home of hot taste more because they had more sweet and onion flavor with their chicken. But The Fry does the chicken batter nicely and big pieces for this dish .\n\nI would come again to order this boneless chicken dish... but my friend didn't feel well because it was much too greasy for her preference.
