This location has been reno'd so it's now the McCafe concept. Other than that it's still the hub of drunken post-bar debauchery that it always has been.\n\nOne night as I was stumbling home I stopped in to get a Big Mac combo. When I received my order I found that they had decided for that I wanted it upsized and had charged me for it with out asking. Because I was a good deal into the bottle I decided to keep my mouth shut instead of making a scene and ending up in the drunk tank.\n\nMy trip here last week revealed that the staff don't have patience. They call out your order when they bring it up to the counter. Before you even have a chance to make eye contact with the person holding the bag (pun intended), they're calling a second time.\n\n\nOh and to answer your question Vivek, a McDouble is a bun filled with regret and remorse.\n\nNov. 30-day challenge 18\/30.
