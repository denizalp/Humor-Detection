I just called today to inquire about an oil change for my car. A man answered the phone and was very condescending and rude to me. I wanted to confirm that the oil change I scheduled for tomorrow would be my free one and he kept saying that he did not know, that it was my responsibility to know that, and he was all around very unprofessional and unfriendly about my simple inquiry. I stated that yes I did have my Midas oil change paper tracking all of my changes but I did not have it in front of me hence why I was asking him to verify things. I tried to make light of his negative behavior by jokingly saying I wasn't sure why he was being so feisty about this. He just continued to give me a very hard time about this very simple request. He said he could verify it in person, I asked again if they tracked this information in the computer and if he could look it up and tell me over the phone or not. He signed loudly, told me yes it was my free one, then hung up on me as I was saying great thanks.\n\nClearly this Midas location does not need customers and prefers instead to lose business as I will never be returning back to such horrible customer service. I am not sure why it was such a hassle for the employee to look at my oil change history since they were in my account already to set me up for my appointment. It took him 2 seconds to verify things, but because he was such a jerk and would not be helpful from the start the call took much longer. If this employee is not able to be personable and professional towards customers then they should not be answering the phone. Very disappointed in Midas and would not refer anyone here.
