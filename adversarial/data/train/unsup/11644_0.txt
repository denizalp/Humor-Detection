Agent was a douche. \nI won't name him.\nYou're welcome.\n\nSo much so it led me to see if they had been reviewed here. \nThank god I looked this company up!\n450 reviews and a 2.5 stars rating!!!\n(Most of them the mandatory 1 star!)\nYa I can see why.\nNow I know to be more careful when looking for a rental.
