Stopped in here this morning to check it out and try some baked goods - after reading other reviews, I thought it was a good choice.  I really wanted to try a couple of cupcakes to get a feel for cake quality and frosting before possibly ordering a birthday cake for an upcoming event.  There were no cupcakes on display, but they were quick to offer to frost a couple that were ready in the back.  This how they earned the one star I am giving  - nice to offer to go in back and make me a couple of cupcakes.  All they had ready were the 2 basics - chocolate and vanilla - so I opted for one of each frosted with their buttercream (I was offered buttercream or whipped icing).  They came out decorated with a very basic swirl, but that was fine with me - I care more about the taste anyway!  Tried both when I got home - the chocolate cake was so dry it just completely crumbled all over the plate, and it had no chocolate flavor - just a dry, brown cupcake.  The white was a little better texture-wise, at least it held together when I cut into it!  The flavor of the white one was fine, but nothing to dream about.  The thing that really made me sad, though, was the frosting!  It was called \"buttercream\" but I am pretty positive it should have been called \"Crisco cream\" because it tasted like crisco and sugar - no vanilla, no butter.  It was terrible!  I am sad to say I will not be returning to Baker Wee.  I know others have had better luck here, and maybe I just went on the wrong day, but I will just have to continue my search for a good local baker.
