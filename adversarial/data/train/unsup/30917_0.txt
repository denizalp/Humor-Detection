One of the worst escape rooms out of the 160+ I've played across the country. Save your money and skip The Collector and Paradox Escape Room. No response from owners after feedback was provided. \n\nThis was my 165th escape room. I played with my Fiance and friend and together we have over 300 rooms of experience.  We all left the room extremely unsatisfied agreeing it was one of the worst escape room experiences we've had.\n\nThe room and experience were both extremely sloppy. There appeared to multiple broken puzzles which were replaced with random things thrown together.  The entire game walk through\/reset manual was also left in the room which we thought was a clue and began to read before the game master came in and removed it.  One of the boxes was even left unlocked. The puzzles were not very enjoyable to solve as they did not link back to the story or follow a logic based flow, but were rather random puzzles in random orders.  We frequently asked ourselves, \"what are we doing again, what is the end goal?\".  After using all 3 clues we made it to the last step but ran out of time before exiting. The game master came into the room and explained a few areas we got hung up on frequently stating \"I've only seen a few people actually solve this puzzle on their own\". This is a red flag for bad puzzle design. It should be tough but achievable, not random and farfetched. \n\nWe were originally looking forward to playing this room on a recommendation from a friend that had a good experience playing about a year ago, but it appears that many puzzles\/flow\/logic of the game have changed since then, or have broken and not been repaired.  We left unsatisfied and extremely disappointed.  Especially after not receiving a response after expressing our concerns.
