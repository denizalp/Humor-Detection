Nom nom nom nom! That's what my tummy was saying after lunch today. I'm pretty sure it'll say the same thing when I did into the leftovers of my lunch combo later this evening.\n\nDragon Pearl's been in Inglewood for ages. Seriously! Word is Ian's pushing 30 years in the neighbours. If you've walked passed it in the past, stop in for a bite next time your in the 'hood instead of going on by.\n\nThe interior is modestly decorated, dark red-ish walls and paintings to match, two large circular tables, and then perhaps a dozen more smaller settings. The tables are each set with a bowl, plate and chopsticks. No cutlery here right off the bat, although my server asked me if chopsticks were fine or if I'd prefer to have a fork.\n\nI came in for a late lunch and was greeted and immediately seated (as tends to happen with late lunches). My server was as friendly as genuine as they come. Dragon Pearl's got a variety of lunch combinations, all are served with rice and your choice of won ton soup or a spring roll for $9.50. I ordered the chicken cashew dish with a spring roll and a pot of jasmine tea. I love that my whole pot of tea was only $1!\n\nMy rice came in its own rice thermos, and the chicken cashew dish was big enough that two people could've easily shared it. The spring roll was fresh with a nice crunch to it when I bit in.\n\nYummy food, more than decent prices... you might just make a regular out of me Dragon Pearl.
