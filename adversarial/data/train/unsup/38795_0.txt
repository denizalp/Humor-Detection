What can I say? We fell for the hype... ‚Äç We wanted to grab a quick bite to eat before hopping on the plane and while I was in favor of Earl of Sandwich in our hotel, hubby wanted to try out Eggslut as it had been on his list for a while. When we arrived, I ran to secure seats and hubby hopped in the semi-long line which was growing by the minute. I honestly thought the menu was more exhaustive judging by the thousands of pics on Yelp but it was pretty straightforward with about 15 items total (including drinks).  I went for the sausage\/egg\/cheese, hubby got the cheeseburger, and our friend ordered the Gaucho. Our friend and I agreed that our food was pretty average, especially for the price (pricing is on par with other popular Vegas spots) but hubby was loving his burger... he was committed and was going to hold on to hope. I will say that the medium fried egg and aioli was pretty different for your typical SEC sandwich and the bread was pretty quality. I can't say that I would rush back to this place though. By the way, the beverages are highly upcharged in my opinion - $5 for a can of soda or 12 oz of orange juice is kinda ridiculous.
