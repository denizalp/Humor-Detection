Probably one of, if not the best spot for Dim Sum in NW Calgary \n\nTonight we ate at the Hong Kong Cafe side for a change - As soon as I got the menu I had to order the \"Curry Diced Beef Flank with Pizza\" ..........who wouldn't want Curry Diced Beef Flank with Pizza? lol \n\nEverything we ordered was quite good, especially the egg noodle soup with pork chop - highly recommend it if you are a soup or a pork fan.\n\nI'd give T.Pot a 5 star rating if I was just rating the Dim Sum as it is amazing, the H.K. cafe is good but not up to the same quality you'd expect after having the Dim Sum
