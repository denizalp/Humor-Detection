They were extremely helpful and friendly! It was my first time at their store and was looking to try a new food for my cats. I've been looking everywhere for this limited diet food for and they were the only ones that had it. They went ahead and gave me a trial bag of the food along with the bag of food just in case they wouldn't eat it (good news, they love it!)\n\nI will be back again! :)
