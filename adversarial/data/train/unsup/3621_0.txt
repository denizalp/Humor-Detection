This restaurant is a long-standing, family-run restaurant for sushi, teppanyaki and other traditional Japanese foods. \n\nI got the pork katsu curry and it wasn't bad. The katsu was crispy and the curry sauce was kinda tasty. The complimentary miso soup was bland, but it had noodle and a slice of kamaboko. \n\nTatami rooms and teppan room are available. \n\nWe had a birthday at our party and the restaurant gave her a complimentary birthday ice cream. She got two scoops of ice cream (green tea and mango) with whip cream and candle on top.\n\n3 stars!!\n\nOsaka Japanese Bistro is almost yummylicious!!
