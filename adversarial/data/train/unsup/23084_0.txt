Reduce, reuse and recycle... I'm trying to embrace this way of life more as I get older.  I used to run out to the local bookstore to buy a book that I'd heard about... now I always make sure to check my local library first (call or go online to do so).\n\nThat being said, Chandler's Sunset Branch is a great little library that is free free free!  In addition to books, they also have fun activities for kids, such as story time and baby sign language.  These activities run on a schedule though and often take breaks when the kids are on break so make sure to check the library calendar!   \n\nMight see ya there!
