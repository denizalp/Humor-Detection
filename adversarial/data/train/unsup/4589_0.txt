Vegas in your 30s just isn't the same. Nothing makes you feel more stodgy, tired and old when you're just trying to get to the lobby gift shop for toothpaste at 10am in stretchy pants and glasses and end up stuck in an elevator with a pack of fresh, svelte 20 year olds on their way to the pool. Sigh.\n\nAnyway.\n\nThe Venetian is really great for groups, particularly since adjoining rooms can be requested to create one big giant slumber party. The suites come with a pull-out sofa so 2 beds easily convert to 3! Only extra pillows and blankets from housekeeping are needed to turn the sofabed into a nice, comfy lazy-place. We packed 8 people in 2 rooms rather easily considering we're a bunch of high maintenance, space mongering bitches lugging around a ton of crap in giant suitcases. And there's so much going on in here that its not really necessary to leave the hotel.\n\nProtip : You can actually opt out of the resort fee to save $20\/night and bet it on black instead!
