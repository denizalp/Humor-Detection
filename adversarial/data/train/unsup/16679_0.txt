Eh, that's all. We ordered the German cheese and sausage plate as it was the special. Unfortunately there was nothing special about it, the bread sucked, the meats were whatever\/nothing I couldn't get myself in the low-cost pre-packaged deli isle of Safeway. The cheese sauce did not taste like anything it was described to be and the mustard was super generic. My Bloody Mary was decent and BF's beer was seasonal and good....will not venture to anothe GBB for a very long time with so many other excellent options out there. Very dissapointed in the meet\/cheese board and the price. Service was whatever...we sat at the bar.
