Hidden in the Luxor. You can see this spectacular exhibit of articles, artifacts, potteries and stuff from the Titanjc... Omg, they set the mood just right, and the Bodies exhibit back to back.\n\nThe hull of the ship is a MUST SEE. Such great stuff. They have coals from the ship that they made into jewelry and keychains in the gift shop. Ahh!! So cool.\n\nWhat the hell is with all these fucking hotel employees asking if you're married or living together? For Discounts? Fuck the fuck off.
