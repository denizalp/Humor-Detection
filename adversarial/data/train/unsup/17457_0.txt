How this hospital stays in business is beyond my comprehension!  \n\nHaving grown up in the area I've had the misfortune of ending up in the ER a few times here, and for a low volume hospital it can still take FOREVER for a physician to see you.  Now, none of my injuries were ever life threatening, but the last time I was in there was for a head injury and it still took them close to 45 minutes to see me.  I was literally strapped to a backboard - head immobilized and all - on a gurney in the hallway.  It was a nurse coming back from her dinner break that realized I had \"fallen through the cracks.\"  Their words, not mine.\n\nFor any medical needs I would highly recommend that a person do their best to make it to Fairview Hospital when injured on the Westside of CLE, if possible.
