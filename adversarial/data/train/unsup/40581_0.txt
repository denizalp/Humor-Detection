Went there for lunch with coworkers. They have a special lunch menu where you can create your own pasta dish for only 10$. I went for spaghetti with the sauce ros√©e. The portion was really generous, and I was barely able to finish. It was also quite good.\nService was courteous and efficient, would definitely return, but this time, I won't forget to bring a bottle of wine!
