I normally wouldn't find myself reviewing a chain coffee shop but I needed a little pick me up before heading to the opening night screening of \"Rogue One\" and this Starbucks was in the general area. I have to preface this by saying that I hate Starbucks coffee. I probably set foot in a Starbucks once every 5 years. I was desperate so I made a quick stop here. \n\nThe store is tucked away in the corner of a strip mall and it's hard to find. Parking is virtually nonexistent -- you won't be able to find a spot right out front so be prepared to walk a little bit. I think due to its slightly hidden location, this store isn't too crowded. \n\nI walked in around 5 pm on a weeknight and there were a few quiet hipsters sitting with their Macs but no line at all to order. The baristas were friendly, helpful and efficient. I ordered a Tall cappuccino with almond milk and an extra shot of espresso. My coffee was made quickly and fresh right before my eyes and it was hot and tasted good enough by Starbucks standards. \n\nThis was a very pleasant experience. Will it make me long to return to Starbucks? Nope. But if you are looking for their coffee, this is a great one!
