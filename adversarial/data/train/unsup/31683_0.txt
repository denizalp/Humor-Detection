These fast build-your-own pizza places are great in a hurry and surprisingly very tasty. I usually order something off the menu like Marguerita or hawaiian pizza, but always add jalapenos. On my last visit I ordered a side of caesar salad and boy that thing was huge. you can order a pizza and salad to share with one or two people, but I'm pretty sure you'll be alright alone. The veggies are always fresh and service is great! \n\nIt never occurred to me to write a review, but the service this last time was *super* great.
