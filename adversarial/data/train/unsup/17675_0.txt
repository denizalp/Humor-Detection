I apologize for my lack of creativity here but I have to echo some of my fellow yelpers and say \"I LOVE the Apple Factory!\n\nLocated at the north west corner of Bovaird and Mississauga Road with plenty of parking, this place is a gem. Amazing fresh pies with so many varieties. They are listed on their website. Over the holidays my \"go to\" pies were the apple streusel, caramel apple, and lemon meringue. \n\nI love just wandering the store. Great produce (I love their apples and all the different kinds!). Great breads (from ace bakery I believe), delicious pastries, butter tarts, cookies, loafs, and a lovely selection of savoury pastries. I recommend the sausage rolls, the chicken and vegetable pies, spinach cheddar rolls, samosas and Cornish pasties. Just throw them in your oven for 20-30 min at 350 degrees and your guests will be thrilled!\n\nGreat other mentions include their British chocolate section, Kawartha ice creams and other fun treats near the check out that are tough to pass up.\n\nYou must make the trip! You won't be sorry :)
