Update: Went back to try it again and the service was honestly horrible. The server did not bring the drinks we had ordered to the table, and finally after repeatedly reminding them they finally brought them. Also, we had asked for the bills since we were in a hurry and had mentioned that to the server in a respectful manner, and they took a good 15 mins if not longer to bring the bills. Then they left and neglected to cash us out since majority of us were paying by card. Disappointing service equals a N O in my books. I eat out at a restaurant for the experience and to be served, not to constantly remind someone what is expected of them....
