In the end they couldn't help Johnny 5 out here, but they have just about any battery you might ever need...or they can get it.\n\nI have come here several times for both weird and common battery needs.  They have competitive prices and all the hard-to-find batteries I have needed.\n\nOn my most recent visit the associate was quite helpful.  He changed out a key-less remote for a vehicle and also went out to the car with me to re-sync the fob...this saved me several minutes of looking up how to do it in the owners manual.  This is the usual level of service I have experienced here over the years.\n\nThey are a handy business to use, especially when you find yourself in a battery bind.
