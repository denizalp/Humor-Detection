I love this IKEA location in Robinson Town Centre because one can do things here that can't be done at a big city IKEA store.  Read on.\n\nDuring a marathon day of shopping last month my mom and I stopped at IKEA and took a shortcut to the downstairs area to quickly pick up a few no-hassle items.  And then we returned to the store a few hours later after shopping nearby and realizing that we'd forgotten something during our earlier IKEA trip.  Unreal.  Such a decision--heading to IKEA a second time on a given day to pick up a small and relatively unimportant forgotten item--would be unheard of at a more congested store.  Philadelphia and San Diego IKEA locations come to mind.  \n\nA few more notes:\n* Parking here is no sweat.\n* The post-holiday sale selections\/prices on 27DEC2011 were really weak.\n* The $1 frozen yogurt cone I purchased near the main exit\/checkout area was delicious.\n* I'm never a fan of self checkout.  Employ more cashiers, IKEA!\n\nDue to a few recent terrible San Diego IKEA experiences I have to say I've lost a bit of faith in the company.  Good to know that a decent IKEA store--and the first one I ever visited years ago, actually--still exists in Robinson Town Centre.
