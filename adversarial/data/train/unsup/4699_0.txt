Now this is by far amongst the best Hakka Chinese in GTA and anyone who likes desi chineses would agree with me!!This definitely reminds me of Dubai's Chinese food!\n\nThis place is where you order American chopsuey, Hakka chowmein, crispy beef, manchurian chicken\/beef, chilly fish!!NNNOOOTTTT a place where you order tom yum soup or tandoori chicken!!\n\nAs far as the taste goes I would give them an 8 and portioning would be a 10.I never do specials here always get full portioned entrees which later become my next days lunch!They even do entrees without spice which works out great with kids.\n\nI have been here several times and enjoy it since I like their flavoring and food and I do tend to overlook all their FLAWS which are as follow:\n\n-The place has no ambience because it's always packed when I have been here and tables are set neck to neck leaving barely much privacy for dinners.\n\n-They might bring your order in intervals and you can request them otherwise-I always do.\n\n-Long waits can be an issue too and somehow I have always managed to avoid  that by either going a little earlier than dinner time or a bit later!This has always worked for me.\n\nEddies is not someplace I make a plan and go to, to enjoy a meal-it's just one of those places which I crave for once in a blue moon and end up going!
