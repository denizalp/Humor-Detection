Came here the other day for dinner with a friend and completely understood why you need reservations for dinner. The restaurant could support about maybe 15 diners at a time. It's that tiny. \n\nThat said, I will definitely return here should the occasion arise. The sushi chefs do a bang-up job with attention to detail and presentation, and the ambiance is just right for a relaxing, intimate dinner conversation. \n\nI ordered the Spicy Tuna roll, Caterpillar roll and tried the avocado and salmon seaweed salad. Everything was delicious, and felt very authentic.\nEven if you do have reservations, don't expect to be completely comfortable. Tables were moved around, dishes were rearranged on the table to make more space, and service seemed a little disconnected. \n\nI will definitely put Japango in my top ten for sushi, but I will be more likely to return for lunch.\n\n3.5 Stars.
