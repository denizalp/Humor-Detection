Truly delicious vegan food in an upscale setting, I'm impressed!  (We ordered off of the separate vegan menu, this is not a vegan restaurant)\n\nWe started with drinks at the bar; the cocktail menu was on some type of iPad.  Pretty cool!\n\nWe ordered the cucumber sunomono salad to start, then followed with spicy tofu sushi, fried rice, and maitake mushrooms with Kite Hill cheese- I was very impressed with the cheese!\n\nFor dessert, we had cookie dough pops, which were soft, perfect, cookie dough balls with firm chocolate exteriors, dusted with GLITTER!  Edible glitter, what?!\n\nNote that it is very expensive here- the maitake mushroom and cheese dish was $29!\n\nEverything across the board is delicious here, I would definitely come back!
