We had a delightful al fresco lunch at Grazie this past week. As frequent travelers to Italy, my husband and I look for a thin crust pizza, crisp insalata and a cold Italian wine. We were not disappointed and we are particular. The house salad dressing is a gorgonzola vinaigrette, a perfect dressing for the salad greens. The pizza Margarita was especially to our liking, thin crust and not too cheesy, but not dry. The owners were attentive and we were not rushed. A perfect Italian lunch, in Scottsdale!
