I don't know everything about this place.... but what I do know is that they have the most killer burrito and it's only 4 bucks. Did I mention it's the size of an infant!\n\nSeriously, I have lived in the Southwest for 4 years and this is by far the best breakfast burrito I have ever had. Heck if you come here you might even want to try out lunch or dinner. \n\nInside is a little retro\/old school with minimal furnishings, tables and chairs but sit down and eat it. Or if you don't like the inside just take to go and eat it at home.
