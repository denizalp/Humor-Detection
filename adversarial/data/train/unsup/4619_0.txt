Good BBQ? Please......\nChicago style? Well, maybe.... \nOnly if you are from Chicago and you prepared it.\nIt should be called SAM's style. As in SAM's Club. \nOk, heres the layout. I ordered a Rack of ribs, Mac & cheese, Greens, Cole slaw, and potato salad.\n\nRack of ribs: I received a full rack( i give them that). But it was a mixed rack..... baby backs and a spare ribs. What is that called? \n\nMac & cheese: So, so.\nGreens: Unseasoned, strait from the can. ( at least they could have sprinkled a lil' salt & pepper on 'em) Ya know?!?!?\nCole slaw: Strait from a plastic container. \nPotato salad: Need I say more.....?!?!?\n\nBuilding: Dirty inside and out...\nSanitation Grade: 90.1\n\nTwo words...... Keep Driving!
