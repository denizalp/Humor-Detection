This is a great place for families or groups of people.  My kids loved this place and could have hit balls all night long.  We ordered apps and they were average.  The service was decent.  Golf is run on a timer and there were a couple of times we wanted to extend our time and found it difficult to track down waitstaff to help us.  I am giving it four stars because this is a very cool concept.  I wish we had these in MN.
