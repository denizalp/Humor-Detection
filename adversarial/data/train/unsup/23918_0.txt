In 1915, Bill O'Neil started a tire company, then built a huge house in west Akron. Twenty years ago a developer wanted to tear it down and make money. Retired schhol teacher Gayle Johnson outbid the moneymen and opened a B & B. Her friends told her she was crazy and I imagine she outlived them all.\n     The 1923 manor house is bigger than your house and mine put together. Three of four available bedrooms are suites decked in Roarin Twenties, Art Deco, English Tudor, and a twenty foot leaded glass bay window. \n    Check-in involves being led to your suite by inkeeper Johnson. Don't forget to introduce yourself. Pay your bill in the morning. After breakfast served in the, well, Breakfast Room.,  \n   If you want to get married here, you may do that too.\n    And, the rates! This place is all good news.
