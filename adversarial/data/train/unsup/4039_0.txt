Love Your Dog Love This Park - What can I say? The Houndz love this place! Ruff ruff! Easy accessibility, ample street parking, long and wide expanses of grass, shady trees and bushes to get lost in, fence posts and tall grass just waiting to have a leg raised on them, even little bridges, and lots of other four legged friends to frolic with! Thank goodness humans haven't adopted the canine convention of greeting one another with the quotidian butt sniff upon seeing each other; awkward! You can easily spend in excess of an hour of quality time with man's best friend. If you find your pooch requires more ground to sniff or just a change of scenery, make your way down one of the trail paths to Sandy Beach below. Your dog shows you such unconditional love and loyalty, show them your love by showing them River Park!\n\nMost importantly, to all of you derelict dog owners, PICK UP YOUR POOP! Pick up after your dog, stop pretending to be: distracted in your group walk convoys, too enthralled by the text or phone call you've received, so ensconced in conversation with your walk mate(s), you've fallen too far behind to see the poop (pick up the pace, then!), you're on your bike and too far ahead (slow down, it's the park not Whistler's Crankworx!), or just some stupefied daze. Pick up your mounds of brown, be deferential to other owners, dogs, users of the park (especially children who don't always watch where they step), and the park itself. By being responsible, you're making a statement and setting an example. PICK UP AFTER YOUR DOG(S)!
