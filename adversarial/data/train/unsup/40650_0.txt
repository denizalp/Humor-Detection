This is lovely little housewares shop. So many times I have stopped to peer in the windows when the shop was closed. I have yet to purchase anything, but my couple of visits have been promising. One of these days I will find the perfect little nick naks and home it will go with me! I have to say the store has a rather eclectic yet modern country vibe going on (does that make sense? No? Means you should drop on by and check it out yourself!). Old time looking wooden boxes mingle with pretty plates and coat hooks adorned with birds. A little bit of something for everyone.
