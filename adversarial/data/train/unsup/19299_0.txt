I don't really care for Famous Dave's but I found myself here a couple of weeks ago for a quick dinner. \n\nI ordered a bowl of baked potato soup and shared a few bites off of my a brisket plate. The food was nothing special but the service is the reason for the lackluster review. Refills were hard to come by and our server disappeared for minutes at a time. \n\nI don't see myself returning to this location, in particular.
