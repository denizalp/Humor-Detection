This place....good as fuck. \n\nWell hell, the shit is open 24 Hours and late night like past 2am there aren't any Vegas weirdos being weird. The bar tender is cooooooool and make drinks all tasty n shit. He also doesn't try to talk your goddamn head off like some places. The man does his job and does it with awesomeness and that's it. Seafood be good as fuck man, like shit where else can you have oysters, catfish, gumbo and shit at that hour? No where. Plus it's on a good side of town so get that ass up in there and get me a drink, I'll be on the way.
