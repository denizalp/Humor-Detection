17 Jan 16 - Since the original review, my wife & I ate at this restaurant several times.  Each time, we tried one different dish on the menu.  We enjoyed each meal.  The food was always good, flavorful & fresh.\n\nToday, we invited two of our dear friends.  They too were impressed by the flavor and freshness of all dishes we ordered.  Sorry, no picture today; we were too busy enjoying our meal.\n\nThis restaurant continues to earn our recommendations.
