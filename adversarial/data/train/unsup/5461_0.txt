I'm a fan of Value Village in general. This one looks pretty small from the street, but goes really far back when you're inside. Everything is organized well too. \nMy recent visit was purely unplanned and i ended up buying some awesome french onion soup bowls for $3. The really cool old brown kind from the 70's\/80's. \nCashing out isn't the quickest, but who can complain when you're spending so little money for wicked stuff.
