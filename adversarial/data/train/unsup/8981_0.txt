Barrel of Pickles is a place I am brought to frequently for birthdays. People know that large groups can do well here without much of a wait at all. And so, Facebook messages and events are made all pointing towards the Pickle Barrel. \n\nSo really, it's not my fault that I have tried so many things on the menu! I've probably sampled at least one dish for each  chapter of their book-like menu. That is about 8 things. That is HUGE menu. From that, the odds are already stacked against them. How is possible that one kitchen can make 500 dishes, all amazingly? \n\nMy favourite of the dishes has been the steak fajita which I found to be delectable. So delectable that in fact I decided to try their chicken counterpart last night for a friend's birthday dinner. They were decent and very filling, yet missing some loving. The chicken was a bit dried out and had hard fat. The grated cheese seemed left out, oily and clumped together. All edible enough, just not that great. And that's how I've found most of the food. It always seems to have missed the mark somehow. \n\nService has also been meh. They don't do the free birthday slice of cake thang either! Mostly they just kind of mutter, \"Happy Birthday\" when the special day is mentioned. I've also encountered some painfully long waits for food with the waiter never checking in, no refills and bill paying problems. \n\nI would like to say I wouldn't be gracing this establishment again but I really can't promise it. It's not really worth it.
