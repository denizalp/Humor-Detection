Mocha Bianca - I must thank you for the concoction called depth charge - shots of espresso in a cup filled with coffee which got me all wired up for work ! I must say the interiors are nice, the staff I dealt with was friendly and the food selection was reasonable. I did like the atmosphere the place had, esp given how its environs are not the nicest. I know I will be visiting again and maybe this time I will sit and take some pictures to put up !
