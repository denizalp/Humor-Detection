I love this barber shop! A truly professional experience. The environment is modern and trendy and the services are exemplary. The staff, especially Roxy's Mom are very courteous and professional and make you feel at home. Roxy is one of the most creative and talented licensed barbers in Las Vegas. I'm a lifelong fan!
