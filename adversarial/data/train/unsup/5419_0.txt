OK, now I've had breakfast here too. Thank God I rode my bike up here! I feel like a whale. I ate the strawberry pancakes and bacon. I know, I am a real health nut. I had to try the pancakes though after all I've heard, and they were pretty delicious. But the best thing by far was the freshy fresh squeezed orange juice. Oh my God, I am in love. Seriously I just paid $3.25 for 12 ounces of orange juice, and I would do it again in a minute. I only wish this orange juice cost the same as a gallon of gas so I could afford more of it! If you come here for nothing else come for the free WIFI & OJ.
