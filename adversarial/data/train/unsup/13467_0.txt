Ewww..\n\nHow did I get bamboozled into this???\n\nA guest of the Monte Carlo and tired on my first night in town, I had met about 45 family members at the hotel.  A few of us decided to have a late and easy dinner at the Cafe.\n\nBig mistake.\n\nService just sucked overall.\nDelayed drinks.\nServer took forever to take our order.\nMessed up our order.\nDid little to correct it.\n\nThe food itself was mediocre.\n\nIn a city with so many great food options, I should have gone for that footlong hotdog at Slots-o-fun.
