A nice casual breakfast spot. Food was tasty and even though there was a line out the door, it moved fast. We did have to sit outside because the tables inside were full. Only disadvantages to note: it's serve yourself\/cafeteria style. You have to get your own silverware, condiments and drinks. 2nd is they do not have any alcohol so you can't get your Sunday mimosa or Bloody Mary here.
