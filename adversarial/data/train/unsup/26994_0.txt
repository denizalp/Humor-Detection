I am a relatively new patient to Absolute Dental, and have been here several times in the past 2 months. I have had wonderful experiences! I have never had to wait for an appointment to begin which is rare in my experience. Dr. Tam is very friendly and professional. He takes his time ensuring each patient is satisfied with their results and that they are comfortable with the process. I have full confidence in him and would recommend him to anyone. All of the dental assistants were very kind and pleasant as well, especially Freddy! I had some doubts about coming here initially but I have absolutely no regrets, everyone here is wonderful and they do a great job. I used to go to providence dental but will be coming here exclusively now, Absolute Dental is less expensive and I strongly believe you receive way better service and personalized care!
