I will be having Dr. Athari do my 7th dental implant.  I have had 6 implants done at various locations ... family dentist, oral surgeon, and local dental school over the past 7 years.   I was impressed with the clean modern office, friendly professional staff, and the price.  Dr. Athari and his assistant made me feel relaxed and comfortable.  They presented and explained to me a couple of treatment plans along with the pros and cons of each ... I chose to have another implant.  I am confident that Dr. Athari and his staff will make my tooth beautiful and functional again.
