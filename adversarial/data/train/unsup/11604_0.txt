Divey for sure, poor ventilation downstairs, but super budget.\nDo not get this room for the free Denny's breakfast, it is not worth your time. Free breaky is only 3 measly options, none of which would cost you more than $4 on their menu, you do not get a normal Dennys breakfast. (not like that would cause me to celebrate, I don't do Dennys unless absolutely necessary ;) \nBut it is listed as a perk and a big selling point, and it's really not so much. End of rant.\n\nThat said, what a deal! When we were there this place was the cheapest in Vegas, like $22 a night, and the rooms were totally passable, and the pool and jacuzzi worked fine. Wifi free and worked but seriously throttled.\n\nThe casino is dingy and tiny and I didn't spend much time there, tho the staff was friendly enough.\n\nThe neighborhood is sketch but show me a neighborhood in Vegas that is not sketch, it is all sketch near as I can tell! I walked around at all hours with no issue. I do suggest having a rental car as this place is a little out of the way.
