Had a great experience! Amy is amazing. This is the 2nd time I have had my hair done with her and will continue from now on. I has highlights, hair cut, style and brows waxed. She listened to my needs and gave me suggestions for my color.  Which turned out great! The best part of the day was the eye brow consultation. She showed me where brows should start and end as well as where the arch begins. I have been getting brows done for years and never been taught how to shape them. I found this very rare. Amy not only does a great job she also wants to educate her clients!
