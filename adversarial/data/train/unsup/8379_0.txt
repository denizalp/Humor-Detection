I love the wings and ziparitas! But we got the timing wrong visiting this location ...there's happy hour prices, and after 8pm drink deals. But we came in at 7:30 so we paid full pop. Next time we'll be more organized time wise to take advantage of the deals. We've been to Zipps many times and had wings, burgers and plenty of drinks over the years. I like that you can seat yourself and that they keep the tables clear. Service is usually quick and friendly.
