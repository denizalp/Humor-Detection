HEAVEN ON EARTH IS RIGHT HERE.\n\nFirst of all, any business that consistently, over years and years, gives out this many scrumptious serve-yourself samples is worthy of 5 stars in my book.  Add to that characteristic the fact that this place offers an abundance of Greek, Italian, and Mediterranean specialty food in the Pittsburgh Strip District...and I've found my Heaven!\n\nThe selection of olives, cheeses, vinegars, olive oils, and baked goods are impressive, and mere thoughts of the fresh dips (kalamata olive and feta cheese, sweet pepper, pepperoni and cheddar cheese, tabouleh, etc.) are enough to make my mouth water.  Actually, I could eat just those dips for the rest of my life and be totally OK with that!\n\nMy family and I always seem to purchase the most random things--aged cheddar cheese with cranberries, currants, sesame seeds, and spinach pies on Tuesday's trip to The Strip.\n\nThe humble, friendly, food-loving atmosphere at Stamoolis Brothers makes me happy; it's just SO Pittsburgh.\n\nIf you love food and\/or Mediterranean cooking, then Stamoolis Brothers, with its reasonable prices to boot, is the type of place you hope and pray opens up on your street.
