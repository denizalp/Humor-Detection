Wish I could give zero stars!\n\nWe were staying at a resort in Henderson and arranged a limo to drop off and pick up at the show, as they did the week before for the first show they dropped us off in the designated limo area and told us to call when the show ended and they would pick us up in the same location.. Well that is where the fun begins.. The center decided not to let any limos in that are  not part of MGM in, all others limos were told they could not enter.. That left the 6 of us including someone that has an issue walking with no where to go..  Had to walk to the front of another hotel which was not close and wait 45 minutes in order for our ride to get back to us..  According to the valet at the hotel we went to they said that the TMobile center is disorganized and rude and make up their rules as they go...
