BEWARE!! Horrible service!! Food is mediocre!! Unprofessional and rude, liars and SCAMMERS!! Walked in for a take out, paid for my food and asked them how long it will take. they said about 15mins. I was in a rush so I decided to get gas which is in the same shopping complex. Told the lady\/owner I will be back to pick up my food. So when we came back 15 mins later, I sent my husband to get the food and I stayed in the car with my baby. He was in there a few mins and comes out saying we never ordered. So at this point I was heated for now I am running late for work. I go in there and the lady again denies I was in there 25 mins earlier and that she doesn't remember. Are you frickin' kidding me?? Now at this point I was irate and fuming. I noticed there was a camera and told the lady to run it. This is just 25 minutes later. She was blabbering and says ok we'll cook the order!! No apologies instead she tells me its been a long day... RETARDS!! I know I should've asked for a receipt but I figured I was only gone 15 mins. Camera was just probably for display and when I mentioned that, she kinda backed off. I wonder how many other people they scam!! They need to be shut down!! AND AGAIN FOOD IS NOT GOOD... we we're rushing and hungry that I didn't even think they might have put something in my food... Well KARMA will get them if ever!!
