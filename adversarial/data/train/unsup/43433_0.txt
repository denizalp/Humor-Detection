Definitely would NOT recommend Dr. Kaplan. Always felt very rushed and it seemed like the Doctor felt almost \"put out\" by me asking questions about my personal health.\n\nEvery time I would get rushed through an appointment at his office (after waiting for more than an hour most times for just a rushed 5 - 10 min consultation with the Dr), they would almost always find an excuse as to why they needed to reschedule to have me come back in 2 - 3 wks later (even though I explained repeatedly that I'm on a high-deductible insurance plan and can not afford such frequent visits to a \"specialist\" unless absolutely necessary). Dr. Kaplan refused to ever release or even discuss any of my blood test results over the phone (in cases where my work travel schedule made it impossible for me to discuss during a follow-up visit).\n\nAll in all, this left me with a very bad experience. Extremely unprofessional and makes me regret actually referring my own Father to see them for his kidney stone issues (I have since apologized to my father and suggested he go elsewhere since he has a similar story of a very poor experience and repeated office visits required before they could finally \"get it right\". He is retired and on a fixed income, so this was also hurting him financially.
