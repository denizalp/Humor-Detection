I took my Camry in to Scott Clark Toyota for a state inspection. North Carolina never received notice of the passed inspection even after two weeks so I could pay the car tax and registration fee online. I called Scott Clark and was told the error was not their fault and was told to bring my car back to them for another inspection. I was sent to voice mail mid-sentence when I asked to speak to a manager. Two hours later I again asked for a manager to call me. Four hours and no response. I took my car to a different inspection station today and minutes later was able to pay NC online. I was told there that either Scott Clark sent the wrong VIN number to NC or failed to send the number at all. Scott Clark charged me for an unsubmitted (to NC) inspection that most likely was their mistake and never called back so a manager could hear my complaint.
