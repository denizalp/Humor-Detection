Spent the 2013 holidays in sunny Phoenix with my family, and was very happy to take Yelpers up on their recommendation to stop by Lux for lunch. I love the layout and aesthetic of the place (imagine boho chic: reclaimed wood tables, fresh flowers, original framed art, vintage porcelain plate and dishware, and surprisingly comfy modern artsy chairs & sofas).\n\nOn the flip side, I also saw Lux through the eyes of my family (including two immigrant Chinese parents and two self-described 'yuppies') which gave me quotable perspective on what it's like to lunch here when you're *not* at all affiliated with the Pabst-drinking, Godard-quoting population. Some notable quotes from the familia, for whom eating at Lux was basically a sociological adventure: \n\n\"Why does everyone here have beards??\"\n\"How can so many dirty people with long hair and tattoos afford to eat here?\"\n\"How come everyone has a Mac? Aren't those expensive??\"\n\"Why are we drinking out of mason jars?\"\n\nTruth.\n\nThat being said, I personally loved the atmosphere. As a traveler, Lux immediately colors my impression of Phoenix as very liveable and lovable. Because it's popular, it's quite crowded, and the hip hop is a few decibels too loud for my taste, but the space is well-divided into quiet study areas, dining areas, and hangout areas. There are also tons of great children's books to keep your young ones happy. Lux is not kid-friendly in the sense that there are tons of baristas speed-walking around, and it could be a danger zone for coffee spills... but my nieces had a great time occupying a couch, scarfing down mac 'n cheese, playing with their toys and reading books.\n\nThe lunch items and pastries were delicious- freshly baked and\/or cooked from high quality, well-selected ingredients. We had a godly pecan bar, a mixed berry corn muffin, bread pudding with fresh whipped cream, NY strip steak and baby arugula on grilled levain, the aforementioned mac 'n cheese, and a chai spice cookie, courtesy of the sweet barista who threw it in gratis, alongside my order for a dirty chai latte.\n\nIn short, how can you not love a place whose baristas will slip you free cookies? I miss Lux already.
