Amazing. My wedding cake was not only absolutely beautiful it was also delicious! So unique with the mango filling. My guests couldnt get enough. Then we had the yummy cupcakes in assorted flavors with the las vegas decor as well as the mini dice cakes. It was an excessive amount of desserts but well worth it. The only reason im not giving 5 stars is because i asked that the cupcakes be individually packaged in clear boxes to be taken as favors. Im not sure if the error occurred with the cake shop or the hotel but the cupcakes were not packaged and so most were left behind.
