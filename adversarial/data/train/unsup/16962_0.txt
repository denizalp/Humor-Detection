Their $1 pizza slices are a great lunch deal- unfortunately, after 4:30PM they stop selling by the slices, which is a personal pet peeve of mine. I am frequently a solo diner and ordering an entire pizza is a bit ridiculous, and if you offer slices as an option at all I see no reason to limit it to lunch (even if there is a price difference after a certain time).\n\nRegardless, I came back to take advantage. The crust is light, thin, and crispy, and the sauce flavor is nicely balanced. I did feel it was a bit lighter on the cheese than I would have preferred. Shakers of pepper and parm are available on each table and helped perk up the pie. \n\nAtmosphere\/decor is all red brick and red-checkered table cloths with photos of NY everywhere, which I dig. Outdoor seating is available, as are beer and wine. Good neighborhood spot, quick service.
