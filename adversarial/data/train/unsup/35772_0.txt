Had an excellent meal here this past weekend. We ordered chana masala and another curried type dish, they may have even had the same sauce, which was fine because it was delicious. i'm not one that knows the true authenticity of foreign cuisine, i just know i liked it and i want to eat it again. \n\nIt was pretty empty on a Saturday early dinner time, so the service might have been extra attentive. Almost creepy attentive, but not. The one dude would like slowly back away from the table just to be sure he didn't miss us if we decided we needed something, and i could always sense he was standing not too far off watching our table. Still great service. \n\nToo bad it's way on the other side of town for me or we'd probably visit pretty often.
