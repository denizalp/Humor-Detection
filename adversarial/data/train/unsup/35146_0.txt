Everyone has some critical reviews, but I lived it here! It was a massive place and most tables indoors were filled. I cant wait for warmer weather, the patios\/decks look awesome! Service was good both times (went twice in a week, oops!) and had calamari, sconnie burger, the chicken blt\/avocado wrap. All very good! The burger was juicy, cant wait to try the buttery Belgian burger. The wrap was surprisingly tasty, and for $11.95 I will surely be back. Good atmosphere, prices, food, service. It is a win for me, one of my new favorite spots! Go check it out.
