Found this service on Thumbtack and were dubious right away because he wanted us to give him a review even before we had started using him! We wouldn't recommend this pool service, especially if you want to ask a few questions. Bedside manner sadly lacking. Used for just a month. Very first scheduled service, nobody had showed up by 3 pm (we were not given any idea when someone would be coming), so my husband texted and we were told the guy was \"two stops away.\" Finally someone showed at 6 pm, stayed 16 minutes. Didn't backwash the pool as we had requested on any visit. We were told he had many other customers to deal with and we had to be patient. Subsequent visits, there was no way of knowing whether they had been by or not, other than checking to see if skimmer basket was emptied. This week, the morning after service we woke up to find the lid on the skimmer hadn't been replaced (a potential hazard to someone walking out by the pool), and the hose to the vacuum had apparently not been connected properly, and had fallen apart, leaving the pump running dry. When we texted and asked about it, no apology, no concern. His response? \"No clue how that happened.\" Was the last straw and we told him we wouldn't need his service any more. His response then: \"You have no clue what you're talking about. Good luck to you...you will need it that's for sure.\" And proceeded to text a tirade more, chastising us for texting and not calling. Unbelievable for a service-oriented business.\n\nEDIT: Owner Danny had told us to \"go ahead and write a review.\" After posting this review and one on Thumbtack, I received a text from the owner, who I never met in person (my husband did). The text said \"Nice review. Barbara you're a damn joke and a fat c***.\" Also texted my husband and said \"You and your wife are two little fake ass c***s. See you in court.\" And more. Posted on Thumbtack that my review was \"fake\" and that he'd never done business with me (when credit card and Thumbtack records show otherwise). Do NOT do business with this company!
