I love this studio.  It's on the second floor of office plaza and as soon as you step into the studio i felt calm.  The class was a little bit of a challenge because the last time I took a reformer class was 6 yrs ago at Kinosphere in Phoenix. Including myself, there was only 3 in the class.  The instructor was really helpful.  I purchased a group of 4 classes through Living Social but unfortunately only made it to one class.  The only challenge was the class schedule.  My usual work schedule is 10am-7pm and usually there are no classes beyond 6pm and the morning classes I wish they had shower facilities so I could go in the morning and then get ready for work there and go straight to work.  But if their class schedule works for you i recommend this studio.  I had a great experience here.
