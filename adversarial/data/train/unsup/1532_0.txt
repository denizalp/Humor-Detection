Nightmare! Terrible store! I want to buy a phone for myself and wifi service at home. They told me that 4G device for wifi is the best choice for me because of its cheap price and good signal . They told me that I only need to pay 30-50 bucks per month if I only use wifi to check email and browse website without long time video watching. Then I was required to sign two years contract . For first month, i only use 4G wifi to check my email on my computer at home for about 30 minutes per day, then I was charged with $1800 for first month  . I called customer service, they told me that I signed the contract, they can't help me. For second month, I close the 4G device without usage of wifi at home. Then I was charged with $1700. By the way, I only use my iPhone for the local call in USA which is unlimited  in my package plan. Additionally I am afraid of using iPhone 3G data, so I tried to use wifi in company  . I call the customer service again, I request quit Verizon contract because I didn't  use their wifi but I was still charged with unbelievable price. Finally I paid another $300 for the penalty of quit contract. And, I still got another $600 bill for third month even I use nothing during the process of quit. I don't know how can they calculate my data usage even I didn't use it. I called customer service many many  times, they did not show me the details of data usage. They did not do any help to find why the bill is so high or find a way to resolve it.  This store like a trap for me with full of cheat . As a customer,  I swear that I never involve any business with Verizon in my life.
