Eat at mariscos and be merryachi\nThere's nothing that goes together better for me like peanut butter and jelly than seafood and mariachi, so I had to really try this place.\nWe started with a dozen of raw oysters, fresh, juicy and intensively delicious, we also ordered the mariscada, a platter with a generous amount of seafood items to share and also the botana mixta equally served generously and they where both out of this land! \nBuckets of beer are half price from Monday through Thursday  and shrimp cocktails 2 for one during those same days. All I had to say was \" thank God Is Monday!\" \nMariachi was a no show but that didn't stop us from listening to some corridos from the never tiring juke box, I believe mariachi is only on weekends as most places are but 12.00 corona buckets and a music machine was enough merryachi for me.\nService Is great  place is clean and prices are awesome.\nOk there's something else that goes better together......gin and tonic, but for the morning after hangover I got you on my list Mariscos el mariachi.
