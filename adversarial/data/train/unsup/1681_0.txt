What the Inn lacks in amenities, it more than makes up with it's ambiance. This is no Joe's, Legends, or Brothers. While Ed is correct that lately, it seems like there's more patrons wearing vertical striped oxford shirts and square toed shoes on their way to Brother's, they don't tend to stick around too long. If you get there early, you can grab a table, toss some darts, and get your songs played on the internet jukebox. \n\nMost of the bartenders are polite, patient, and fun. However, there's one beast of a woman who enjoys berating people who aren't the fastest Mug Club pledges... but hey, you asked for it anyway. \n\nIf you come to visit Champaign, you simply MUST join the 60,000 member mug club, and take in some of the history at the Inn... It's a Champaign institution.
