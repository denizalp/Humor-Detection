It's just that a Rent-a-Car Center for almost every agency in Vegas. Fast shuttle service from the terminals ,very clean, well lit and easy to navigate. Problem is that this place and all of the brands can be quite crowded, since the shuttle drops off masses of people at one time. This is caused me to switch companies based on line length before. As long as some one is aware of this, then overall this massive complex is helpful to travelers.
