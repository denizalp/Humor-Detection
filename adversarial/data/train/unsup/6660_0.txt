We needed a dog sitter for a week before and after Christmas while my husband and I visited family.  Angel Paws was professional and very kind.\n\nI was a little nervous at first because even though our 50+ lb lab is calm most of the time, she can get possessive of food or toys.  But Debbie truly understands how to feed and care for dogs so the week passed without incident.\n\nIn fact, because Angel Paws groomed our dog during our vacation, she came home smelling better and feeling softer than ever!  Angel Paws is wonderful--I highly recommend them for all your pet grooming and pet sitting needs!
