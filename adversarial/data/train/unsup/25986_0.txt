We came here for dinner: ~$40 \/ person.\n\nGOOD:\n+ Service: The waitress that I assume was in charge of the area I was in was super fast with drinks! She never had to be reminded\/asked for refills. I just turned around and my cup was full.  It was magical.\n+ Food: TONS of variety! Each section was pretty huge (i.e. meats, Asian foods, desserts, etc.). Satisfactory taste. \n+ Atmosphere: Bright, plenty of seating areas.\n\nBAD:\n- Service: I stepped on and tripped over food that had fallen on the ground about 3 times. Yuck. Clean up on aisle-everywhere, please. Also, for a crazy amount of workers here, the time waiting in line was too long. Not worth it.\n- Price: Pretty pricey for a just-ok experience. \n- Food: For the price we paid, my experience here was ok. There was a lot to choose from, but most of the things I ate were only ok. For the price we paid, I was hoping to be wowed!\n- Atmosphere: Decor had a 90's feel. They need to update. Also, everything feels so crammed together--I was literally dodging people everywhere I went. Women's bathroom only had 3 stalls too, I believe.  Too small for a buffet, in my opinion.\n\nOVERALL: I wouldn't recommend this place unless you're lazy to go elsewhere, or you're more of a \"quantity over quality\" type of person.
