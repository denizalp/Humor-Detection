Purchased a groupon for a 60 minute deep tissue massage and a spa manicure\/pedicure.\n\nThe pros: \n- The spa itself was bright and clean. It's a pretty big space with lots of massage rooms. \n- Good customer service - was greeted promptly when I arrived and all staff were friendly and polite.\n\nThe cons: \n- Probably one of the worst massages I've ever gotten. Felt like they were just rubbing oil all over me with no pressure at all! Seriously, I use more pressure myself when putting on my body lotion! I asked for more pressure, and the masseuse's response was that she's not a RMT and that these massages are meant to be relaxing. Why advertise it as a \"deep tissue\" massage then??\n- My pedicure was okay...until she cut me. There was blood. Really hoping they sanitized their equipment properly and I don't get an infection.\n- I quite like my french manicure, no complaints here except I was supposed to receive a SPA manicure and pedicure, but I never ended up getting the paraffin treatment for my hands nor my feet. \n\nI thought the point of these groupon deals was to attract new customers. Why they would not provide the service as advertised is beyond me.\n\nWill not be returning to this place.
