Great spot for after the orchestra, event, or romantic date in University circle. I love the European cafe charm of the whole place. Classy but laid back. Love that. Potentially great people watching for coffee\/studying during the day. Staff are very friendly. However, the food case in which the items to order on display were nearly empty! They were out of oysters, and apparently many other items. Disappointing and strange since they should have expected the \"after-theater\" crowd. And speaking of, the space is very small with limited seating. I wanted to order just a cup of tea with my food but they only sell it by the pot! ($5.50?!) I ended up ordering a small individual quiche. It was very good! I love that they stay open until midnight. I will be back maybe earlier in the day when the have more of a selection. I recommend it as a great meeting place for a quick dessert, coffee or wine.
