Chianti is amazing hands down. With a stunning venue, lovely service and even just a good vibe, I come back at least twice a month. The fettuccini alfredo is the perfect dish for kids or even the inner kids in all of us! Because it's light, delicious and simple. For a more sophisticated meal, I would definitely choose the Caribbean alfredo, the normal alfredo with added curry, shrimp and mango, or the Chicken Parmesan with a side of fettuccini alfredo rather than spaghetti. Anyways, this restaurant is amazing! My only criticism is the bathrooms are quite crusty :(
