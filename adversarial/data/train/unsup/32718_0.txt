I had the unfortunate experience of having my timing belt break on me.  I called around for quotes and found Sun Devils to be reasonable and a great deal.  I ended up having other \"issues\"  with my car but Chris and his staff went out of their way to get my car fixed and even offered a rental car!  I am truly pleased with their services and will continue to use their services
