Yet again, S&V does not disappoint. Daniel is still hands down the best Bartender I've experienced. Maggie and Sheena just make coming here an enjoyable outing. Between the linguini alla checa, Milano flatbread, margarita pizza, and the salmon salad - choice choice choice. Plus I'm loving the new Happy Hour menu!!! Meatball Sliders!!!!  Highly recommend
