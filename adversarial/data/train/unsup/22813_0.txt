We booked this restaurant way in advance to make sure that we got our reservation. Party of 6 fountain view. One couple celebrating their Honeymoon and the other two couples were celebrating birthdays. We got the perfect seats. However, when it came to the food, it was not what it's hyped up to be and exceedingly expensive for the taste. I had the 10oz filet Oscar. My hubby had the dry bone in rib eye Oscar. Now, we have had both of the dishes in many other restaurants. We consider ourselves foodies. Oscar is always crab with hollandaise and usually asparagus. Therefore, it's nice and saucy. This however was crab and breading. They said it has hollandaise but it was dry. The fact that you pay $30 something for it was not worth it. The steak was not as tender as I normally get it butterflied and very well done. Many will say like a hockey puck but that's how I eat it. I ALWAYS order it this way and it still comes out tender at Council Oaks, Ruth Chris's, Bern's. Morton's and Fleming's. However, not here. It was an experience but a very expensive experience.  Not nearly worth the quality of the food. The best thing we're the mushrooms. These were DELICIOUS. When we normally get mushrooms, it's just cooked in a sauce. These were in a buttery sauce and they were different kinds of mushrooms. They were quite tasty. At the end, it really wasn't worth the $250 plus that we paid.\n\nPS- I got the Almond Brûlée to go because I was sooo stuffed since I've have bariatric surgery (the sleeve). I did not feel well at all after eating it. I had to throw half of it away and felt nauseous the rest of the night. It has nothing to do with the surgery because I can eat sugar with the sleeve.
