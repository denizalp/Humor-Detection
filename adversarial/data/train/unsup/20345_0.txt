Dear Vegas, don't ever change...I mean, you can change, grow, build, expand, add, demolish, build again...but don't ever change who you are. Be that crazy, strange, over-the-top, fun, and carefree place we all know and love. \n\nThe Signature Towers at MGM...it was a fun time, had a lovely 2 bedroom, kitchen, 3 bath suite with an amazing corner multi-directional view.  Was there for 4 nights for a good friends' extended bachelor party. We hit all the big pool parties, multiple clubs a night, some nice eats, and since we were staying at the Signature...WALKING WALKING WALKING...LOTS OF WALKING.\n\nNotes:\n- So Towers 1, 2, and 3...are a LONG walk to the MGM Casino floor (Tower 1 is the closest).\n- Most of these 'condos' and suites are owned by individuals or time sharers, and they lease rentership or usage back to MGM Grand for a portion of the profits. Just so you know. But they're run much like the hotels so don't despair.\n- Rooms\/Suites are pretty big, pretty nice, and contain all the standard amenities.\n- Signature Towers has a separate entrance (off Harmon Ave) for cab drop offs and airport pickups, etc.\n- There's a few eateries and small pools, and a fitness center dedicated to the Signature, but not like the Wet Republic (crazy party pool at MGM proper), and certainly not the food options as if you walked the mile to MGM's casino and shopping areas.\n\nGreat place to stay, we got our luxury accommodations at a pretty good rate, got our exercise in, had a sweet place to crash and recharge...ZERO COMPLAINTS.\n\nENJOY VEGAS PARTY PEOPLE...!
