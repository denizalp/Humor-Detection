This place is awesome!! It's even better when you don't have to pay for the food!! Ordered the Royale steak burger with chili n cheese fries and my mom had the guacamole steak burger with chili n cheese fries. For dessert mint Oreo cookies n cream shake. Service was bad, but I think it's because a lot of people came in at the same time, but that is no excuse for taking 20 minutes to serve us our drinks. In fact, the burgers came out before our drinks!!! \n\nOn to my Royale. When I took the lid off, it looked like a crippled piece of midget bacon gave birth to another crippled piece of midget bacon. I don't mean to offend crippled or little people, but it's just looked like someone broke off 2 pieces of bacon from a normal strip of bacon n put it in my burger. \n\nNaturally I complained (I love bacon) and the server brought me a heaping helping of bacon on the side. That more than made up for it. My moms guacamole steak burger miraculously turned into a guacamole double bacon steak burger. Hahaha. My mom said her burger was good. I thought my burger was good, but I could tell it was sitting there for a while. The egg n patties in my burger was cold. But it still tasted delicious. Probably because it's the first meal I had all day and I just got done working out. \n\nThe chili cheese fries were ok. The chili isn't that great but I love the melted cheese sauce. \n\nOn to dessert. As I am writing this review, I am consuming my delicious mint Oreo shake. Good ending to my meal. If the meal was not comped and I had to pay for it, I'd probably give 3 stars. \n\nAll in all, filling n tasty. Yay my first review is done!!!!
