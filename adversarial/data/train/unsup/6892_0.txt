Wow has this place gone downhill since the last time I was here! Okay, it has been about 2-3 years ago but you would think that they would only get better!! We came here on Sunday afternoon for their brunch. It wasn't our first choice but the wait was shorter here compared to the buffet at Bellagio. I paid $40 and it was definitely not worth it!\n\nHighlights of my meal: french toast, tuna ceviche with jicama (but small chunks of tuna), cocktail shrimp, madeline (pretty moist)\n\nLOWlights of my meal: tuna hand roll (gross!), bloody prime rib, service sucked, waiting in line for mediocre food\n\nThe last time I was here, I did love the butternut squash ravioli. Too bad they didn't have it this time. \n\nCheck out my friend Pauline L.'s more detailed review http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/the-buffet-at-the-wynn-las-vegas-2#hrid:ctLBdXECV42Gqi7c4jjKpQ
