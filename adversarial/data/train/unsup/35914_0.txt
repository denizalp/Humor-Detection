Have you ever wanted to eat on a cruise ship on dry land? In the middle of the desert at that? If you even answered maybe this is the place for you. \n\nThe food is decent and was hearty as well. The dishes and silverware lacked the sanitary expectations and we were able to ask for replacements. \n\nPrices are good for food on the strip.
