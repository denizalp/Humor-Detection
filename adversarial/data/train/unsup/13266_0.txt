I came here for lunch with the kids ages 11,10 and 15 months since I bought the groupon- 30 dollars worth of food for 16.50. It was a great deal so I couldn't pass it up. The kids shared a meal of tepan teriyaki chicken and I had the steak. We also got a app of calamari and Jacob got a soda. Even after all of that food, we still had a few bucks left. \nThe only reason why I didn't get 5 stars is because there was basically only one server there with 8 tables to attend to. Which meant slow service, however, I still tipped him 5 bucks.
