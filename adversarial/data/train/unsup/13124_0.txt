I have been to grateful head a few times ( I am under a pseudo name here). I will not be returning. the first time I was very happy with my haircut. the second time I wasn't thrilled . I thought I wouldn't go back but then I thought well , we all have bad days.; So I returned. I HATED my cut. I will not return. I will not recommend the place. I wonder if maybe my stylist only knows one type of cut and basically gives you the same. If you do decide to go there , then I suggest you tell them up front you want to finish with a straight blow dry. I have been meek about insisting on that and i paid for it. Perhaps if they know they cant hide the cut behind curls they will give it a good cut. My hair is still not long enough to fix so I will have to wait a few more weeks. I can tell you , it wont be back to Grateful Head. .. my head was anything but Grateful.
