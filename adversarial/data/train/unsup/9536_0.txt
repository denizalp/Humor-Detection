Extremely friendly staff, excellent customer service. The hotel is right next to the mall so close to lots of great shopping and amazing restaurants. Great location! Clean, upscale rooms, 32in flat screen TVs, granite countertops in bathrooms. And I don't mean to be girly, but in the bathrooms there is a 7x magnifying mirror with an LED light...perfect for plucking your eyebrows! YAY!
