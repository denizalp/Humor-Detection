Allen's is an upscale pub with an extensive beer list, a nice patio, and good service. On the other hand, the food isn't the greatest; it's got an extensive menu of pub favorites that have a fancier twist, but I definitely wouldn't call this a gastropub. \n\nThe burger was egregiously bad. Bone dry, and on the bill there were separate charges for lettuce and tomato. Who does that? That's so bizarre! The Guinness-braised lamb shank was better -- fall off the bone tender, though I wish it ha been even more so.  I also liked the accompanying champ (mashed potatoes and scallions). \n\nI was very happy with their riesling and pinot grigio choices, which were perfect for the end of a steamy summer day. However, when the sky threatened rain, our server was very nice and accommodating about our request to move inside.\n\nAll in all, Allen's offers a nice atmosphere but the price of the food is rather high considering you're still just getting your standard pub fare. I'd go to Allen's again, but I'll stick to the drinks next time.
