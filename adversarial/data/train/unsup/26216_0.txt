Steer clear of this company. We had a limo bus with 18 of us in it. They were 30 minutes late to pick us up then couldn't find us. Then took us to a liquor store upon request- and he insisted this was the \"best place with the best prices\", then runs ahead of us into the store and tells the cashier something... and clearly this is a rip off place where the prices are double- yes double- liquor store prices and the drivers who bring their tourists there clearly get a cut of the money that they try to rip off of you. Disgusting tourist trap. Then when a bag was left in the car they refused to help us get it back. I would never use this company again.
