This Walmart is in my \"hood\" and I will seriously only shop here if I'm desperate and can not wait until Frys or Target opens.  \n\nDirty store - Check\nWait 30 minutes in line to check out - Check\nNeed to \"hire\" someone to do some work for you - Check ( a quick scan of the parking lot, and you'll find your workers )\nSome woman smoking \"something\" in a bathroom stall - Check  \n( \"security\" proceeded to kick her out of the store within minutes of someone narcing on her.  I was standing in the customer service line waiting to get a refund when everything went down.  You could her her yelling from outside the bathroom. )\n\nI will drive my happy azz 8 miles to Mesa Riverview's Walmart than drive the 1.5 miles to this location.
