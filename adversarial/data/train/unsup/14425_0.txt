This is the Mack Daddy of all Buffets\/AYCE in Vegas!!!\nBut... But... But.. It's very spendy.. To the tune of $90 a person (80 with a TR card) however is well worth it if you like to eat posh. What I mean is if you don't eat caviar, lobster, king crab or drink the bubbly for breakfast then you will be wasting your money and shouldn't bother coming here. However, you get what you pay for here; the champagne served alone was worth the entry fee. \n\nUnlike the feed lines at the other casino buffets, this place does require reservations. I suggest that you do it at least week in advance as this place is always busy.\n\nThe Food:\nThe buffet line was superb! Lobster tail, filet mignon, prime rib, lamb and king crab: a feast fit for a king!\nThe table menu boded items like lobster benedict, french toast, tuna tartare and caviar. We were unsure what to get from the kitchen so the server grabbed a sample of offerings for our first round of the aforementioned delicacies. \n\nEverything that I ate was top notch with excellent service to match! We were tended to with excellent service, never had a champagne glass empty or a dirty dish in sight. \n\nThis was definitely a memorable dining experience that should be near the top of everyone's to-eat list in Vegas. \n\nEat with Confidence (pinkies up)
