How do you go to JJ's Red Hots without getting a hot dog?! That's me. I did that. I got the Smoked Salmon Sliders and they were \"okay.\" I was not mind-blown like I was looking forward to being, but they were good sliders. They also had good customer service. Next time (because I will be coming back) I will get a hot dog and update my review.
