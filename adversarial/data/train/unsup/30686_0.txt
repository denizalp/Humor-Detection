Came here to try the Peking duck and other dishes with my family. Left with one of the worst experiences at a restaurant. Peking duck came out fine after 30 min, not truly that great just slightly above average. Then 45 minute wait later after politely signalling we were still waiting for our food. The waiter tells us our food is on the way yet the tables around us who ordered almost the same meal yet after us received all their food. We finally got fed up, paid for our Peking duck and left. The waiters were very obvious in avoiding us, and walking away hurriedly when we asked for our meal. \n\nI will not be returning, they honestly do well simply being the only Asian restaurant in the area.\n\nHorrible service.
