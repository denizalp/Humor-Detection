4 1\/2 stars. Arrived for dinner In the early evening during the week. I definitely  prefer this place over the local Sam Woo due to far better quality and service. I came in earlier for lunch but it was so crowded I departed.\n\nWe started off with a won ton soup noodles to share and followed with a entr√©e of double meat delicacy - pork belly roast pork and soy sauce chicken. Both meats were cooked perfectly - pork belly crispy on the exterior with just the right amount of fat for flavor and the chicken was fresh and you could taste the freshness. Chow fun was just as solid as the other entrees and was a generous serving. \n\nService by the older waitresses was solid and one of them spoke Vietnamese and Cantonese. Impressive food and service so I'm upping my average rating here.
