Can't speak to the rooms, but a friendly bartender goes a long way! I had almost forgotten that little tidbit amongst all the cocky craftology. Don't get me wrong. I love a craft cocktail, but sometimes a friendly bartender and a whiskey and ginger is all you need to make you happy. If it's one of those nights. then I definitely recommend the bar at the Gold Spike. Kallie was super sweet not only to me but with a host of regulars that she greeted at the bar.\n\nGold Spike has some of the old schoolers mixed with a recently updated interior. I think this is a good combination for entertainment. The gaming area is small, but with tall ceilings, and the bathroom has some modern touches. It is worth a little jaunt off the main drag downtown to add it to your downtown gaming and drinking crawl.
