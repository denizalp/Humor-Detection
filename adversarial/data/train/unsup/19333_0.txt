This place was really nice inside. It was very classy and the waiter was attentive. The food was just whatever. Nothing too great. The sushi was made to order but came in very small portions. Since all I wanted to eat was sushi this made it very difficult and awkward for me. I don't really like buffets ;{\n\nThat's why I'm trying to be nice about it. It's really unfair for a person who doesn't like buffets to review a buffet. My boyfriend said the food was just okay. Everything was cold. Decent...but cold.\n\nThey had Mr Pibb though and in my book that earns an automatic star. I don't care what you say. That's a very important thing!
