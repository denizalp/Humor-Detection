Great happy hour and atmosphere. Even \nwelcomed my service dog in the patio, which had to be entered by walking through the restaurant. \n\nEverything we ate was great. Only disappointment was the avocado margarita-- expected the taste or texture of an avocado. It tasted just like the regular margarita which was half the price at happy hour. Great service. Have been five times and will return for sure.
