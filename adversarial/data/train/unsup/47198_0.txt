Probably the best Mediterranean food spot I've been to in Vegas. Having previously lived in the Middle East, I'm quite familiar with Mediterranean\/Arabic food. This place definitely took me back home. Their hummus with lamb is delicious. Another one I really enjoyed were the grape leaves, and the mint lemonade! Everything is made fresh, including the drinks. Definitely give this place a try. The owners are very accommodating and friendly. Enjoyed my visit here!
