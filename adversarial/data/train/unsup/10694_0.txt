I wouldn't consider myself the most religious person, but the Billy Graham Museum is a MUST SEE in Charlotte. Don't know if I can guarantee an emotional experience as mine, but it is quite interesting and profound to be here! Initially, seeing this as the #1 sight to visit in Charlotte on Trip Advisor, I was really confused and (insert WTF face here) as to why a library about Christian Pastor Billy Graham was any bit interesting.... but oh my god, literally oh my god, I was amazed and kind of blown to tears being here this week. \n\nFirst of all, admission is free (not one of those we need money now institutions) and the semi guided tour is a tour about Billy Graham's life and his ministry around the world. This tour is about an hour and a half and also there are other great sights such as the burial site and the intricate architecture. Towards the end of the tour you go through this illuminated cross -- which seriously brought me to tears thinking about how many lives were lost this past weekend in Orlando and the pain and suffering in this world. \n\nRight after the tour, my \"I need tissues for my crying and weak self\" brought the attention of one of the counselors--who seemed like the type to shove his faith down my throat like the other counselors I was seeing--told me, \"You sir are human to feel pain for others\". Even though I don't share the same faith and might not fully see eye to eye, I loved seeing this act of passion and how he emphasized that faith is about loving people for who they are and who they can become, love and care is universal despite your religion..... Especially during such an emotional week for so many people, it was so life giving to be here. This was seriously a spiritually awakening experience and would easily call it one of the best sights in Charlotte.
