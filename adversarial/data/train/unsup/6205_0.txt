wow. i cant blieve i forgot to post on here. this has been a long time coming (went april\/may 2011). place is fkn rediculously DURTY and DURTY FILTHY. we stayed here cuz we love marquee. little did we know...\n\nit was friday @ about 9 pm when we arrived. 2 people in line front of us waiting in line to check in and 2 at the counter being helped.  There were literally 7 employees @ the check in counter walking around or on the computer. only 2 were checking ppl in.  10 min passed.  15 min passed.  20 min passed.  now there was 4 more ppl behind us in line. no employee says to the line \"we'll be right with you, or thank you for waiting.\" no one bothers to look up at us, or even open at least antother check-in lane.  a ghetto lady in a wheelchair already at the counter, wants to get a room in the front for free and she does this pity party screaming and yelling and kicking and pretending to fall off her chair and is crying (i just COULDNT blieve she was handicapped, the moves she was doin), THE front desk girl (young and immature) ROLLS HER EYES at the lady and walks away to the back. then ladies and gentleman, wheelchair lady's so pissed, she walks up off her wheelchair and realizing what she did, she walks back to her wheelchair and then pretends to fall down.  The lady at the counter never comes back and we are waiting.  ok, they are dealing w\/ a crappy customer, but give me a break, customer service was FUCKED UP making us wait half hour to get checked in.  everyone waiting in line was DISGUSTED.\n\nour room wasnt ready (wth. 9pm). we had to wait 45 min.  UNREAL on the chandaliers and whole casino floor. feel like im in mariahcarey's nitemare. BLING bling... BLING.  \n\nfine. gave them benefit of the doubt as theyd just opened and probably still figuring out their shit.  \n\ncheck in. first thing i wanted to do was take a shower. 2 steps into the bathroom, i see black medium length hairs (i counted 10) on the bahtorom tile floors. SICK. Then I see one in the sink.  I got a tissue and wiped them all up and threw it away.  I step into the shower and i see a couple more hairs on the seat section in the back of the shower!!! UGHHHHHHHHH. nassssttty. i throw those out.  whatever. didnt think anything of it, probably forgot to swweep the bathroom. or the maid was shedding.\n\nWe go out, do our thing that nite, and i come back to sleep. Throw back the covers, and I SEE 3 black medium length hairs again (one under the pillow). OMG KILL ME.  but i was so tired i couldnt even call to complain. i picked up that shit w\/ tissues.\n\ni could barely sleep, so at 8am, my man still sleepin, i go to the front desk and i nicely (i swear, i was nice - the girl looked nice) tell this girl about these medium length hairs everywhere in the bathroom from under the covers.  but of course, this bitch had the nerve to look up at my head and say \"ARE YOU SURE IT WASNT YOURS?\"  oh mother -  i had to restrain myself from crawling across the counter and beat her face in.  I say \" look at my HAIR its down to my waist, I hAVE THE HAIRS FROM MY ROOM SAVED, ILL GO DIG IN THE TRASH AND GIVE IT TO YOU, WOULD YOU LIKE THAT?\"  she says \"no i dont need it\" and gives a dirty face.  i say \"YOUR HOTEL IS SO UNSANITARY AND YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE AT CHECK-IN YESTERDAY WAS SO UNBLIEVABLY UNPROFESSIONAL, AND WE ARE PAYIN FOR YOU SUITE AND YOU'RE ACCUSING ME OF LYING\" she says \"well, do you want me to send a maid up to clean your place then?\"  i say \"is that what ur offering me? to clean up? after we paid all this money to stay at your DIRTY HOTEL, I want LAST NIGHT comped \" she goes \"we cant do that. we can give you 50$ food credit\"  i said \"get me your manager\" she comes back and says \"he says we cant comp your room\" omg i had to leave before i was about to rip her eyes out. \"give me $300 food credit.\" i can do 150$. \"get ur manager\". She dissappears n says, $275. I took it n left. What the... Mgr can't address guests face to face? Too trivial for u?  F-u Cosmo.\n\nwe spent it all on their tacos. @ their restaurant called china poblano? The tacos were Amazing DELICIOUS (the hi-light of the hotel... as well as marquee.. and cosmo doesnt own marquee :) - both i give 5 stars, not reflected in this rating)\n\ni love allsaints. they have one in there. sad. ppl r gonna be wearing that stuff who shouldnt be. Majority of cosmos clientele  trading in their affliction\/ed hardy's for allsaints. yuck.\n\nwicked spoon was what id been waiting and dying for.  sooooooo disssapointeddddd. bone marrow was steamed looking instead of roasted (gag). mac n cheez was good. thier ribs were nasty tasting and altho presentation was really nice on everything, they lacked TASTY FOOD.  i mean... i really dont know how to put it. they had good quality foods, but the chefs really missed the mark on flavor.\n\nCOSMO = failure of all failures\n\nwill only go into cosmo 4 marquee.\n\nwynn\/encore, please.
