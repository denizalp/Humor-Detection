Now I know where to get inspiration if I ever needed Moroccan theme Decor.  The Furniture, Tea Pots and Tagines are part of the environment(for sale too).  It's a good thing there's no Moroccan Dessert Heat for sale here as we were already overcooked from the Toronto weather.\n\nIt's almost like a Turnkey operation as the semi-Kitchen is pretty much right behind the counter similar in scale and equipment as a Starbucks.  The Gentleman(+0.5 *star*) working there was absolutely great with HOSPITALITY as if you're a guest at his home rather than a customer.\n\nChicken Lemon Tajine with Frittata ($12.95)\n\nNow understand, I don't have too much Tagine experience under my belt however I have had one that exceeded my imagination of the cuisine.  That's probably why I felt underwhelmed by the non-Tagine'd Chicken Lemon Tajine.  I was expecting sauciness and bread to soak.  I believe the price is slightly high for what this dish offers.\n\nChicken Pastilla with Couscous Salad ($8.99)\n\nPastilla, Bastilla.  Toemato, Tomaato.  It's another one of those dishes I fell was unique and happy to discover somewhere else.  This version was slightly smaller and would be nice if it was warmed slightly more.    The Coucous Salad seemed overly sour from vinegar which depends on individual taste I guess, since Amy Pataki found it stand-out worthy.
