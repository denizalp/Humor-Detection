Like Donald W. I ordered my stools in Feb. I have no issues with the troubles they are having with their supplier. I do have issues with poor communication and  not getting my money back timely. They say there is nothing they can do because Ken needs to approve them in order.  This is the fourth week since I canceled the order ( that I placed in Feb , 10 week lead time ) and they still can't tell me when I will get my money back. Ken continues to hide behind his employees. Ken won't return or take calls and for sure not taking responsibility for this or he would have called every customer personally. Really unfair to his employees.  Just filed complaint with the BBB.\n\nUpdate: I received my credit and Pam was really nice.
