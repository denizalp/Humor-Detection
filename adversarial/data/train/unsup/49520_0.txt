We had the most incredible experience dealing with all the staff at Edwards & Davies.  I now live in Ottawa and still would never change my jewellery store and dealing with this team of professionals.  We were recently married and ordered everything through email with a few phone calls and I couldn't imagine this going any better.  They knew exactly what I wanted, how to create the perfect engagement ring followed by my wedding band and I also purchased my wedding party gifts.  I love the attention to detail I received, the professionalism throughout the entire process and of most importantly the quality and price.  I get compliments  daily on my rings .  Thank you again for making this an incredible experience for us. Kim and Bruno
