Took friend here the other night, as I haven't stopped by in quite a long time.  \n\nI was surprised at the following:\n\n1- I can still park Bessie out front, instead of in the parking lot.\n2- Heritage Square has been totally pimped out to perfection.\n3- Most of the original crew is still in place, providing warm, friendly and VERY competent service.\n4- The meal was absolutely impeccable, as it has always been.\n\nWe shared a bottle of Prosecco and crostini while we waited.  Then we shared an order of spiedini and a Biancoverde pizza.\n\nBUONISSIMA!!
