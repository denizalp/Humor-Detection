Growing up back East I thought that I had given up on being able to find Rita's once I headed west. Lucky for me, Rita's franchise has reached the valley. Stop in for an awesome taste of the East Coast. They specialize in something called a gelati, a combination of frozen ice and custard, that is the perfect Summer treat. They have multiple flavors, and will gladly let you sample any of them. My favorite is just simply their Italian ice, but my kids love the gelati.
