We love this place!  Our dogs stayed there for a few days while we were on vacation. They got to play with other dogs without extra charge, and we were able to check the online cameras whenever we wanted to see how they were doing. We are excited to finally have a place we can take them whenever we go out of town and know that they'll be having fun.
