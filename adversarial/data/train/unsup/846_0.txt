I've been shopping at this GE for at least 15yrs.  It's convenient to work and home for me.  I think this location would be great for a makeover with all the urban redevelopment going on around it. I believe this store is corporate owned, so not sure if redevelopment is in the plans or not.  Evening check out lines can get pretty long.  Outside you can usually find people offering jitney services, selling food stamps or selling bootleg dvds lol!  A fresh seafood department would make this store much better.  I think this location is open from 6a-11p.
