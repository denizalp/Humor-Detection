Came here with the family to celebrate a milestone birthday.  It's always good to celebrate a birthday.  As long as it's not your own :)\n\nThe location was clean, well kept, medium in size, and moderately decorated.  Plenty of parking space.  Had to do my business and wash my hands after, the loo was quite dated, and a little dirty.  The toilet was about equal to a common house toilet.\n\nThe food was good, but some items were bland.  We order the roast duck which was average, and needed more flavour, and they forgot my golden duck sauce.  You can't eat duck without it.  We ordered the Yu Shan Eggplant Hot Pot, which was good, definitely one of my favourites of the night.  We also order some classics like pigs intestines with ginger, it lacked a little flavour, I'm guessing the pig didn't squealed enough before it was put down. Jk XD we also had a tofu bowl and a fish fillet pot, which both were quite good.  \n\nOverall a good place for the more traditional Chinese food, so if you are looking for sweet and sour pork and teriyaki chicken... better look else well.
