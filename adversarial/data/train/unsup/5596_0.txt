I have a couple of rifles I want to purchase & after doing some investigating, I found the best pricing on them online.  When you buy online, you need to have it shipped to an FFL (Federal Firearms License ) dealer which Lock N Load is. L N L have a genius policy in place where they refuse to do an FFL transfer if they happen to have the same gun you want transferred in stock. If they had better prices, or matched prices I wouldn't be shopping online as I prefer to buy local.\n\nFor instance, an S&W M&P 15-22 MOE goes for $650 (add tax to that) at L N L versus $531 (no tax) shipped anywhere nationwide from a well known online gun store. Looking at accessories & extra magazines, their prices were high as well. $35 for magazines I have found for $21 online. I guess they figure they make enough money off of people with their higher prices, that they don't need to do FFL transfers to bring in any extra cash. I won't be dealing with this store & plan on telling my shooting buddies to avoid them as well.\n\nAlso, when I was at Lock N Load, the only other customer in the store walked out upset. I don't know all the details but overheard something about someone giving him information over the phone only to be told whatever was told to him on the phone wasn't true in person. His last words were \"Hey, I'm just trying to build a relationship with somebody.\" He followed my lead to exit seconds afterwards. Looks like they managed to lose 2 customers in a matter of less than a minute.\n\nNo worries, I have actually found a place up the road that will transfer up to 3 firearms for only $20 regardless if they have it in stock or not. I highly recommend dealing with Mike at Davidson's Firearms in Anthem.\n\nHe was very helpful over the phone as well as when I went in to the store for my first time. I asked him if he could order a Sig Sauer 516 Patrol Gen 2 AR. He said he could but was honest about not having any idea on how long it would take to get & actually recommended I go ahead & order it through Buds since they currently had it in stock.\n\nLock N Load seems to be the place where the inexperience shooter with too much money & not enough time to do some research can go to be taken advantage of. I'd rather save my hard earned money for hard hitting ammo.
