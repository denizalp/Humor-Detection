I was excited after purchasing and scheduling an experience for my husband's birthday.  The day before, I called to make sure I knew the right location, and there was a message that the location is closed for an indefinite amount of time and everyone should request refunds.  Despite having all of my contact information, nobody from the business called me to let me know, and I'm glad we weren't standing outside our hotel the next morning, waiting for the pickup!
