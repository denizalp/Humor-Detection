I LOVE this place. We've only had the chance to go a few times, but I always leave feeling so satisfied. The prices are right, and the food is the ultimate comfort. I had the beef and tendon soup last time I was there, and it was so rich and luxurious. The handmade noodles can't be beat. All of that chewy, umami goodness...After half of that bowl of soup, I just wanted to curl up under a warm blanket and take a nap! And you absolutely have to try the pork soup dumplings and the vegetable dumplings!  I go back to Everyday Noodles every chance that I get! I wish I was up that way more often.
