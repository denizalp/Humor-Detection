Wow! This is place is great! I thought there would not be any KTV in Arizona. All songs there are pretty up-to-date, which include Cantonese songs, Mandarin songs, English songs and Korean Songs. The staff is very nice and talkable. He would help you with the system and show you how to use the touch-screen. \nPrice is very reasonable as well. I went to a medium room at night on Wed, which was only charged $35 per hour. The place is very clean and well-maintained, including the restroom!!! It also turns out that the hall is open. AWESOME!\nDefinitely a good place to hang out or spend time with your friends. I JUST LOVE IT!
