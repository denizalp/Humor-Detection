Excellent Chips and Salsa.Very good Cheese Dip not spicy as stated. Ordered the Cadillac  Fajitas.\nExcellent high quality meat and vegetables. Outstand ing service. If it was not for the anti-carry policy we would return but adding this plasce to several avoid for Anti-Right to protect yourself aand faamily and they have Zero security. Gun free Zones are the places bbeing attacked watch t he news so the reason for a 1 Star review instead of a 4 is....\nThis place is Anti-American, Anti-constitution, Anti-2nd Amendment, Anti-Gun, Anti - Personal Protection, and Provide NO SECURITY. It can happen and it has happened. Without the rights granted by God and Country to protect my family NO one in any part of my family will ever return here.
