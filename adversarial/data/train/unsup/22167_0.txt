Picture this, the warmest, glaziest (yes glaziest) yet not too overly sweet and softest nut of dough you've ever placed in yo mouf! The flakes of glazed icing just breaks off ever so slightly leaving bits and pieces on your lips for the extra lick you want to take at the end of every bite. I am delighted and thankful for this super sleek mom in pop doughnut shop to come into this side of town. Highly recommended for your morning stop. We needed one on this side of town. Cant' wait to try their coffee!
