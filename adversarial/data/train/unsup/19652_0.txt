Probably one of the most disappointing dine-in experiences I have ever had. We have heard so much from friends and have seen the \"You Gotta Eat Here\" episode about Big Ts that we thought we had to give it a try.\n\n The place was quite busy, but the service was very quick and our servers weren't all too bad.\n\nWe ordered the Big Ts platter so we can try a bit of everything from their bbq menu. The platter definitely can feed at least 5 people in my opinion which is a plus, but most of the meats except the ribs were just mediocre(most were very dry) at best. The ribs were good, but they only gave you 4 pieces. The plate is filled with tons of fries that were just meh. And the coleslaw was bland. The buns and cornbread that come with the order were dry.\n\nFor $74 for the platter I really didn't think it was worth it. Good thing we didn't order the Elvis platter as that would be more disappointment for more money.
