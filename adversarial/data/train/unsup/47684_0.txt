All of the girls working the front and store are attentive and professional. They communicate with you your wait time. Dr. Jean Sugimoto the optometrist scheduled for that day handled my consultation with ease and professionalism. She went through the examination with complete explanation that you feel at ease that you are in good hands. \nThis is not where I had my consultation a year ago but I will be coming back to this location for the excellent service the whole staff and optometrist provided.
