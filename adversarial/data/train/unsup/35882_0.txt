I love cake and it's hard to pass on this place when someone brings it up. I always get the red velvet and it has never disappointed. I should note, however, that I ask for one with no frosting because I don't usually like it (not only from here but in general). We've have bought their cakes as well which are nothing more than big (and delicious) versions of the mini cakes. It would be nice if they had seating, served coffee and stayed open later.
