Up until my visit today, this was a store that I would go to quite often to check out movies, Funko pop figures, and music. When I walked in today, the store suddenly looked half the size it used to be and there was a far smaller selection of products for sale. This store now feels very cramped and the worst part was the behavior of the employees. There was a group of a few teenage boys in the movie area (blocking anyone from being able to go into the aisle) and they were being extremely loud. To my displeasure, the employee, who I believe is the manager, was yelling across the store to join in their conversation about horror movies. Between the loud employees and loud customers, I saw no reason stick around and try to navigate the terrible new layout of the store. I was just there a few weeks ago and everything was fine, I'm never going back now!
