I had only one night in Montreal, and the concierge at the W suggested this restaurant for dinner. Great choice.\n\nThe menu is more Eurasian fusion than European.  When there are kimchi and bao on the menu, you have Asian ingredients. The \"fusing\" was tastefully done, with the ingredients acting in subtle harmony. I much prefer this thoughtful approach over the wanna-be fusion restaurants that take the in-your-face approach and boldly mix western and eastern components together, without regard. \n\nOur server was very nice. \n\nThe most memorable part of the meal was the red wine from Armenia.  I have never tasted wine from this part of the world before. Surprisingly, the wine was pretty good.  I went to Canada to drink Armenian wine. Yeah.
