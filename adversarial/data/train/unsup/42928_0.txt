Alright pho resto in Brampton. I went to Forks of the Credit and we were hungry so we looked up Pho. Decided to go here because it was on the way home. \n\nSituated in a large plaza, lots of parking spot but traffic isn't the greatest here. When we got in, it was not busy at all. Maybe 8 people including my group as well. \n\nThe pho was decent. Good for one time only for us.
