Heartily recommend this neighborhood family orthodontist office. Dr. Popat handled braces for both our girls and is top notch. He and his practice manager wife Bansi are warm, professional, and fully committed to their patients as well as very active in the North Central community, supporting area schools. The office and practices are very modern and offer a concierge-level of service to include convenient evening and weekend hours, texting for appointments or problems, plus an on-site pediatric dentist with coordinated orthodontic and dental appointments. Dr. Popat grew up in the area, attending Madison schools, and his love of the community really shows. Bravo to this local family-run practice. Check it out!
