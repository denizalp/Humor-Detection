Can't give enough praise to the team at Mercie J! I've had some significant repair work as well as regular maintenance, done to my truck at this facility. On EVERY occasion, they have been the most respectful and professional folks to deal with. They have raised the bar and really set themselves apart in the automotive service industry. As much as this review is for congratulating them for a continuous, \"Job well done\", it's just as much an important review for all future customers who are in need of help with their vehicle. Clearly today's world is about checking reviews for the best value and customer service. So from one consumer to another, I'm here to put my neck on the line so to say, and publicly tell you that trusting your vehicle to them would be the best decision you could make. It's their hearts desire to genuinely serve others. To the core they have ALWAYS done the right thing from the start, and have our best interests at heart. Thank you,\n-C. Hansen
