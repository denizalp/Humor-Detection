Best meal we had from a food truck till now. The prices are very reasonable yet no compromise in food quality or quantity.. cash only which is not uncommon for many food trucks I guess. They have veggie options and many meat choices. I had a falafel over rice and my friend had chicken and we both liked our food a lot. Would definitely recommend..!!!
