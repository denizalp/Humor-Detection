The food here is absolutely delicious but the service is far off from good. After we were seated we orders a few appetizers and waters. We got our sweet potato fries but the rest or our appetizer orders never came. Finally, our main courses came along with our waters. Our waters were never refilled and the rest of our appetizers never showed up...even though we asked for them 3 different times! It was very upsetting :\/ We even had to ask for the shell fish crackers because they weren't even offered to us and without them we couldn't even crack into our crab legs.Finally, we asked them to cancel our appetizers and just asked for our check. Food is great but the service is bad enough that no matter how good it is...we would not go back any time soon.
