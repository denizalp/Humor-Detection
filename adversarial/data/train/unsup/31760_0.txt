Loved the Double Double Animal Style; need to remember to add grilled\/raw onions next time. Disappointed in the animal style fries. Cheese was near plastic, and the spread was dumped on only one side of the basket, as opposed to an even slathering on top. Even with the blah fries, it's an almost certain Vegas dining visit when we fly into town.
