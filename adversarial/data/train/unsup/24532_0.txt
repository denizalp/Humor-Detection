Of all the clubs we visited on this Club hopping tour, this was my favorite. It was early in the night so it wasn't too full. We only stayed here about 45 minutes though. It was the ONLY club we were able to get a drink. \nIt was pretty cool. Asian vibe and decor. Music was happening. I had a nice time here. We had room to move.
