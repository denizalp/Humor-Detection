I ordered a whole wheat cheese quesedilla. I also ordered a side of chips for 2.99 and sub it with guac for 0.99.\n\nI got my quesedilla but not my chips. I only found out as I was walking back to work. I didn't want to go back since I'm running out of time for lunch plus it's a 30 min. Walk in total going back and forth. \n\nMy quesedilla tastes good, but a little soggy. Well they had a super lunch rush and it was packed so I guess that's okay. \n\nI also like the dip that came with it. \n\nI'll be coming back because the price is reasonable and food is decent. However, my first order of quesedilla was pretty expensive ($10+) just cause I didn't get my chips and guac :(
