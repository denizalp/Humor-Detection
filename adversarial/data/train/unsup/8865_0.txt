Everything we had here was very good except for the shrimp dish.  I know shrimp are bottom feeders...but exactly what bottom were these shrimp on??  Easily the worst tasting shrimp I've ever had in my life.\n\nThat being said..all of the other dishes we had were very good.  I also like how they have a picture of almost every dish available on the menu. So eat anything else but the shrimp!
