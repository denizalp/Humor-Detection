What a great way to start the new year! What diet?! I love mom and pop donut shops because I like simplicity. I have been disappointed with more popular joints that serve \"gourmet\" donuts, which usually have too much going on.  Real donuts was recommended to me by Ramil B., so of course I had to check them out! For my first time here, I chose the 1\/2 dozen for $5. With Yelp check-in, I got a free donut! Seven donuts total, not bad! \n\nBlueberry fritter\nInverted chocolate donut\nButtermilk glazed donut\nMaple donut\nCinnamon crunch\nGlazed donut\n\nOverall, the donuts were fresh! After sampling a couple of them, I had to stop. Guilt set in, but the sugary-ness got to me. Definitely, enjoy donuts in moderation! My favorites from the bunch were: blueberry fritter, inverted chocolate donut, and cinnamon crunch. \n\nThey are have huge \"Texas\" donuts, teas, and coffees. Service was good! The lady at the counter was helpful in suggesting flavors.\n\n\n*****Yelp 2016 100 review challenge*****\n2\/100
