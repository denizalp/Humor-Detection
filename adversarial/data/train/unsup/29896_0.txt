Just had lunch here and I can tell you the whole family was extremely impressed, even our picky 9 yr old. I had the large Ninja bowl and it was delicious (and huge. Next time I'll get the small). Rice was perfect and chicken was tender. Sauce was what a was hoping for...savory with a little sweet. My husband got the LocoMoco with a side of macaroni salad. The sauce wasn't what we were expecting but was even better. Loved the Mac salad also. My son had the Katsu chicken and he described the sauce as A1 plus pineapple. Doesn't sound appealing but it was yummy. Lastly we had the Pineapple Chicken Nuggets. Believe me when I say this dish is eloquent enough for adults. \nCan't wait to go again.
