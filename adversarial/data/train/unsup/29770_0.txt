I wish I'd had visited sooner! I've lived about 5 min north of here for over a year and never stopped by. Went this morning and purchase \"the thumb\" wash. Waiting about 20-30 minutes with the level of care and attention the spent was just fine with me. The only complaint I can think of is that it isn't touch less. Other than that, awesome store, good service. A true one stop shop!
