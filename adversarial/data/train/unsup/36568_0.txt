My husband and I recently moved to AZ from CA and have been talking with many service providers across varied lines of business; pool-guys, landscape, etc., and all I can say is that Dave is a standard bearer.  Truthfully, I'm having a difficult time reconciling the difference between my experience and that of the other (poor) reviews.  Our story is similar to a few others, we were referred by another company that doesn't service our area - Dave responded to my phone call promptly, was VERY polite, and was upon meeting, VERY personable.  He stayed at my house until my husband arrived home to ensure all of our questions and concerns were eliminated.  It was an easy decision to choose AZ Landscaping Co. over the other service providers we talked to.  Dave (his wife Heather) and their respective crews have thus far performed fantastically - we couldn't be more pleased.\n\nOh, and by the way - this isn't just some mow-and-blow operation... We asked every imaginable question about the plants, trees, cactus, grass, etc. in our yard and Dave answered them all with a level of knowledge that says, \"this guy's a professional\".
