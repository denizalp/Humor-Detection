Shawn is a DISHONEST salesman. went in to upgrade my phone to the iPhone 6 and he told me there was a $80 one time activation fee due that day which I paid for up front. The next month, the bill came and they charged me for a $35 activation fee; I called and told them about my in store payment and the associates advised me it shouldn't ever be more than $35. After hours on the phone trying to figure out what the $80 charge wAs, no one could figure it out. I went back to the sprint store and thankfully Russ was able to refund me; I received a receipt for the refund, and it stated that it was a charge for an accessory bundle package, which I did not purchase. All I can say is I am NEVER going back to this location. It's just a really sad situation bc Shawn is a Sales Manager for them. Don't say I didn't warn you!
