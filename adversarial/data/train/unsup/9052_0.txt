Courtyards are some of my fave places to stay on work or out of town trips.  They have remodeled this Courtyard and everything was done right, and comfortable.  \n\nI loved the cleaning staff here.  They take the time to \"neaten\" your desk, bathroom toiletries and all requests such as high floor, away from the elevator, extra towels and pillows in my Marriott profile are honored.\n\nWhat's new?  A place to hole up downstairs where you can watch a big screen, and order food, drink, cocktail while working.  Lots of plugs everywhere next to sofas and desks.  \n\nOne less star for the gym area--it's  in a room, no windows. Sigh.   Wireless is free but  I didn't try it as  my phone and MIFI are my nomad tools and serve me just as well.  \n\nVisits:  1\n\nTip:  Right off the Freeway, about .5 mile.  Food places abound.  First Watch,  next door,  is the best breakfast\/brunch resto in the area for organic\/locally sourced products.   Must have a car to be functional in this neighborhood.   Very Central with CVS, all kinds of fast food and national restaurant chains abound.
