So, if you look at their website on the menu tab...the sandwich looks nothing like the one that you will receive. Okay, I get that. Pretty photo on the website, slapped together sandwich when you pay for it.\n\nThe Jimmy John's by my house is at the most 2 miles away.. We share the same zip code. However, when I type in my zip code for their delivery, a message pops up that they do not currently deliver there...\n\nUh kay.\n\nWalking in, it's three boys that look like they still belong in high school. I've interrupted their joking session, because the restaurant was empty. And I know I'm not some smoking hot 16 year old....so my presence isn't very welcomed.\n\n I place my order. My sandwich, I get a #5 vito. I ask them to put mayo on it, because the first few times I got it, it's dry. Add hot peppers and take off the tomatoes. I then order two more subs, that ends up around $18.\n\nI put $2 in their tip jar. Waiting for my food didn't take long. One of the boys asked me if I wanted a bag....... \n\nFor three sandwiches, yes, I want a bag.\n\nHe plops the three sandwiches on the counter, along with my receipt, and a bag, he says, \"here ya go\". and goes about his business. \n\nOKAY, really?\nCapriotti's puts sandwiches in a bag.\nHell, EVEN Subway puts sandwiches in a bag.\n\nBut I guess that's my responsibility.\nCool, I'll remember that next time before I leave you all a tip.
