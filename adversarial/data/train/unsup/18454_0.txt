Color me not impressed. What's the big deal about this place again? Perhaps it didn't help we went on a mid-week night. But then, shouldn't that have been a good opp to experience this spot sans crowd? Anyways, I dug the decor and appreciated what they were going for. The cocktails were so-so. The beer offerings are better than usual. There were more staff than patrons and our service was less than attentive or friendly. It seems like it could be nice place to hang out and grab a drink. It just failed to deliver the night we went.
