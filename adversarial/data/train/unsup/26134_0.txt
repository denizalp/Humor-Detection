So, I come home from running my errands in the evening and realize that, \"oh man!!!  I have a nail in my tire!\"  I decide to call Big O Tires the next morning to see if they can patch it.  The customer servicer rep on the phone was very friendly and told me to come right in to have it looked at.  Of course, they warned that they couldn't do it if it wasn't \"safe\".  I have no idea what that means, but hey, it's worth a shot to fix the tire than buy a new one.\n\nThe next morning, I pump the tire back up, drove it in, and they got started right away.  The technician took it off, patched it and put the whole thing back on 10 minutes tops.  To make the whole experience even better, it was free!  Fanastic!  Turns out that it's a complimentary service that tires centers do in general, but it wasn't even a tire that I purchased from them!  \n\nConclusion:  They were quick, efficient and makes it better that the service came with a friendly smile.
