Just had an awful first impression with this company!! \n\nI received a text (on my company's business number) about residential service so I called the number. Sarah immediately started pitching me about leads in the area that need to be picked up. I was in the middle of politely letting her know that we aren't interested at this time, but couldn't finish because she hung up. \n\nI sent a follow up text with feedback. She said she didn't feel like listening to my \"negative attitude\" and then called me a snowflake. SO UNPROFESSIONAL! If that's what the first encounter is like, I cannot imagine working with this company for real! Terrible experience.\n\nBEWARE!
