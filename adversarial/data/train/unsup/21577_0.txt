Please do not see this vet.  I had an older cat who I knew was on his deathbed.  This office was close, so I chose to take him there.  After waiting for hours with my poor sick cat, they mistreated him (picked him up off of the floor by grabbing him by his back legs and front legs), misdiagnosed him (tried to say he had cancer when he was dealing with diabetes complications), and then charged me an ungodly amount.  I was so upset with his treatment that I went to a different vet the very same day.  I wasn't allowing anyone else in that office to touch my cat, much less put him to sleep.  If you don't care how your animals are treated, I guess this is the place for you, but if you LOVE your animals, I wouldn't go near these guys with a ten foot pole.
