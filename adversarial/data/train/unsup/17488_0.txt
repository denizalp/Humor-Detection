This was the first Dollar General Market we had been to.\nI admit I am hooked! It is clean and in a great location.\nYou can always find something on sale. We have bought produce pretty cheap as well as some other items bigger chains carry for more money.\nWe really like this store and always stop at this one or whatever one we maybe close to.
