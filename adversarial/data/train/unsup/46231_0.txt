I've been coming to this place on and off for 6 years, I know I'm not a \"regular\" but I've been there often enough for them to know who I am. Last time I went, the girl that did my gel mani was on the phone The whole time! not paying attention and my nails end up all bubbly and looking awful. The girl seemed upset and she knew she did wrong but the extremely arrogant manager said I needed to stay to redo the whole thing! and I said I had no time because I had to get to work and she said to the girl - not me! that I'm standing right there!! \"Tell her if she doesn't change it today when se comes Back she has to pay! She blame the brand of the gel then she asked me to pay 15 dollars for the manicure!! I was like \"what manicure\"??? \nThey are rude, extremely arrogant! Zero friendly they need to get they stuff together because they are losing a lot of clients!! they lost my business and all my family and friends! We are not putting a foot in that place ever again.
