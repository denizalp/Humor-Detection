0200: The first night\/morning I was there back in late June hammered, and just wanted to sleep face down on the big bed \n bed while celebrating a birthday; as she read 50 Shades to those who had been going hard since 1800 celebrating with us. I believe fried food was involved and Justin Bieber dropped by. Some of this may or may not be true after: Park, Commonwealth, Laundry Room, Commonwealth...and shots here. Not used to that many drinks, especially mostly outside, in late June annnnd it showed! \n\nThe second time was wayyyy more coherent. After a fab sushi dinner @ Yummy, we (Beet, Lindsey, Rod & brief Betty Draper appearance at TLR) stopped in. No more photo booth, oh well. Still a cool space and I'd trust Norm K on breakfast all day long. (It was after Ju's greatness @ TLR and only 1-ish) Lots more people outside enjoying the \"backyard\" vibe. \n\nDidn't stay second time too long before we were off to \"Talk Like a Pirate Day\" at Frankie's Tiki Lounge. Definitely want to check out the Airstream and \"yard\" for games and think it works as a place to hang casual DTLV. Service was super friendly, even the nice security guard who tried to listen to my mushed by being face down on the couch undoubtedly brilliant argument for staying there first time (instead I slept in my car @ El Cortez for a few hours till I was truly ready to go.)..seemingly good times no matter how you choose to\/end up rolling. Same guard, nice guy! \n\nYelp 100 Challenge
