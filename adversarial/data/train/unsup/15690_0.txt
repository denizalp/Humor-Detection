While on the hunt for something for the family to quickly eat at a nearby Basketball Tournament , we decide to give ole Bill a try.  \nLove the  kitschy vibe of this place.Tons of  funny- to obnoxious stickers and signs plaster the place.   For a minute I thought it was Two Hippies Sub shoppe.  But this little hole in the wall does a soild business slinging out the standard american sub.  While nothing to flavorful was ordered by my Troupe, I am willing to go back and find the hidden gems that must be in  this dive.   \n\nWord to the Wise bring cash or be prepared to pay a dollar fee for a debit \/credit card... really?
