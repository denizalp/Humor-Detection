This was my first visit to this shop. I had 2 little girls to buy for. I had heard good things about this shop and I was not disappointed. They had bobby-pins, bows, all types of dance shoes, and leotards along with many other items. I enjoyed looking around with the girls. Everywhere you looked you saw something new. One of the girls asked me what a certain item was. I was guessing because I don't know much about dance and all of the attire and accessories that go with it. The woman working explained what the item was for. She was wonderful and her customer service was on point. I will continue to bring my business here. I believe in supporting local businesses. The girls I buy for are seven which means we have lots of years ahead to shop. (Maybe at some point I will know more about of of these dance items.) ‚Äç
