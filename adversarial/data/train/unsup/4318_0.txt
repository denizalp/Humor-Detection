I had about a half hour to spend between two things I had to do so I stopped here for some dessert--an Oreo McFlurry.  I am not addicted to the McFlurry but there's a fine line.\n\nI was surprised with this McDonald's.  It's laid out much different than others I've been to.  There are separate eating areas instead of one large room.  Near the bathrooms, there were two small private areas almost where you could eat rather quietly.\n\nService was quick and polite at the counter and McDonald's wifi has become quite dependable and fast.\n\nA good stop.  I may stop at this outlet again.  Getting in and out is the only negative.
