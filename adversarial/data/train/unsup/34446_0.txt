I spend at least 5 nights a month on business in Vegas.  This is the hotel I choose to stay.   1) I can park outside and it is a short walk from the parking lot to the front desk and to my rooms.  2) I love the down comforter on the beds.  I hate those light cheap bed spreads on most hotel beds.   The staff is nice and friendly.   The rooms are clean, I like the bottled water they provide, not for free but $4 for a big bottle.  Rooms have refrigerator so that is nice.  The rooms have older TV's, not flat screens but I don't watch much TV.   I am there for business so I don't use the casino or eat the food.  I have had room service for breakfast and that is good I have also had oatmeal for breakfast at the Starbucks that is there too.   I pay normally around $35-$45 a night.  Great place for the money.
