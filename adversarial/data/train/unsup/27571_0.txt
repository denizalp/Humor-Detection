I went for lunch here with a few colleagues for my birthday and it was delicious!  We shared a spectrum of  oysters to start.  They came with all the fixings. I particularly liked the cilantro glaze. We had a great bottle of Grayson Cellars Chardonnay, and there is something just delightful about oysters and white wine that can't be topped. I ordered the Tuna BLT for my main.  It is a seared yellow fin, maple-miso glazed pancetta, panko fried tomato, with wasabi creme fresh.  My friends had the scallops in the butternut squash risotto, and they thought it was fantastic.  The waitress brought me a chocolate brownie and ice-cream, which was on the house, to celebrate my birthday.  I was overjoyed and stuffed by the time the meal was over. Overall a great experience.  It is a bit loud in there, so it would be tough to have a business lunch with more than two people there.
