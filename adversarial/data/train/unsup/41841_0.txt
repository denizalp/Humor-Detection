Great establishment!!! Went for the first time for first Friday in Jan! Great music but need more hip hop.... but drinks were high. I paid 17 for a small cup of henny . More of the college crowd atmosphere... Alot of cute guys and ladies.  Didn't taste the food but im going again tonight and will be trying out their little restaurant... Fiddlestix.
