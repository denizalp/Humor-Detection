This is my second visit to the restaurant.\nFirst time, we dined-in and also did a take out of lamb soup. When we reheated the soup, I found about 8-10 creatures that looked like a mosquito (smaller) floating around lifelessly.  I wasnt sure if it flew in from outside when I was reheating it or if it traveled with us from the resto, so I just threw it out.\n\nSecond time, my dad ordered the same soup to dine - in, and guess what I find? Those same  creatures. I hate to admit, but the soup and other food items are pretty tasty, but I would question their kitchen hygiene. \n\nThis resto itself is not the cleanest either and service is almost non-existent.\nThey have bbq cooking but the vent never seems to be on, so I would not recommend wearing your favourite wardrobe here, if you still plan to go.\n\nFor me, I definitely would not return.
