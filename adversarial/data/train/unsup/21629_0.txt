Let me preface this review by admitting I have eaten some great tacos in my life. I've eaten great tacos in Texas and in New York City and in Mexico.\n\nThis is a shame but I feel Calgary gets really excited about mediocre food sometimes. Perhaps this place had some great times last year or maybe the year before and hence the glowing reviews? Maybe I went at the wrong time. I don't know. All I can do is document my own experience here. \n\nI had heard good things from other people so when the question of where to go for something good to eat came up I thought my girlfriend and I should try this place Friday night. I tried ordering tamales but they were all out. I tried ordering Horchata but none left. I love Chile Riano but I didn't see it on the menu.\n\nI'm not a fan of beef tongue so I would never order that.\n\nI ate three tacos. The doubled corn tortilla is always a treat. I asked for spicy. There was some spice to it. Nothing exciting. Very unnecessarily soggy for some reason? I take small bites and I finished one taco in three bites, it was tiny. It wasn't bad but this is nothing to get excited about. In fact, for what I ordered in addition to the ambience and service I would say it wasn't worth it.
