Trader Joe's ok to shop if your not buying tons of grocery this ust other one of my our market for buying food - they have great produce, meat\/poultry\/fish, cheese, dairy, flowers, dry goods and their prepared products are usually very good and interesting\/flavorful.  Wine\/beer\/liquor\/cider selection is also very good.\n\nTheir retailing approach also generally keeps prices reasonable, although some things can be a bit pricey (but the quality is commesurate).\n\nService is very friendly as well, and they always have a treat for try to buy if it's good.  Return policy is very good as well if you get something that isn't quite right.\n\nI particularly give 5 stars.
