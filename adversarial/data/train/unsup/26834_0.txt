Holy amazing. It's that how they said it in the Bible? Who know but wow what a great time I had at Sugar Factory in Town Square. \n\nI was worth my brother and two friends and wanted to take my brother off the Strip for a little bit to celebrate his birthday. I was at Sugar Factory two years ago, but the one on the Strip. \n\nSo the cab takes us there and the four of us sat at the bar. This place is like Candyland the adult version. \n\nThe menu is full of burgers, pizza, dessert, and a list of alcoholic concoctions such as FlufferNutter martini, Root Beer Float, and Jolly Rancher martini. Dry ice Mai Tais that snow like a volcano. And the drinks are good. Not too strong or too weak, but taste so good that if you're not careful, you will be drunk lol. \n\nThe bartender we had was Lizzy... She made the experience even better. Totally amazing, ask for her by name of you want. \n\nIf it's your birthday, they will dim the lights and play cool music, and bring our an ice cream dessert with a rocket on top! \n\nSo fun, this will be a permanent stop on my annual Las Vegas adventures!
