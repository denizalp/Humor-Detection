This has become one of my favorite lunch places - the food is cheap, doesn't take too long, and is delicious!! I'm a big fan of their sesame chicken (when it's good), as it has a bit of a kick to it. Lunch and dinner combos are a great deal, and I love the crab rangoon. The restaurant is kept clean, and I love the guys behind the counter - so friendly! The only con is that the quality seems to vary at times. Last week, the sesame chicken was the best I'd ever tasted. Got it again last night, and this time, it was good - not even mediocre, a solid 'good,' - but I wanted what I had last week. :( Still, I recommend it for a quick lunch or dinner.
