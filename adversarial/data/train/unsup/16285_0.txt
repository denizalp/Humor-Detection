If I could live anywhere in Vegas this would be the spot. It has everything needed to have a good time and than some. \n\nEvery inch of the building is beautiful, swanky and funky all at the same time. With pink chandeliers, modern decor and cool furniture. \n\nOur room was one of the best rooms I have stayed in. I slept better here than I do at home. I melted in the huge comfy feather soft bedding. The shower and tub were incredible. I love the CO Bigelow products that are supplied. I hate trying to use soap that feels like a cheap bar of wax.\n\nThe TV was command central for the lights, music, checking out the amenities and even making restaurant reservations for the places in the hotel. Anything your heart desires can be done through a remote, it is crazy! \n\nThe employees overall were nice and accommodating. The female that checked us in was professional and friendly.  The bell desk fellas were fast and asked about our stay. They also said to let them know if our shuttle didn't arrive that they would help us get to the airport. They gave me the \"warm and fuzzy\" feelings = great customer service. \n\nMany different types of restaurants, shops, oh and don't forget Wicked Spoon (it is a must) to stuff your belly. \n\nYeah it's a cool spot. Thanks Cosmo for showing me the good life for a few days. Now, I'm back home a little fatter and poorer dreaming of my return.
