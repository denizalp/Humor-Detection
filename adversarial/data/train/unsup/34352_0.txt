There have been over 100 reviews made for Sugar Factory, so let me just get down to it. \n\nIt is overpriced average (almost sub-par) food, but it is right on the strip, and you can see the Bellagio fountain across the street, and just the idea of being in a \"Sugar Factory\" makes one giddy from within, well, at least me... \n\nMy girl-friend and I tried the mussels, split a bleu cheese cheeseburger with bacon and shared a classic sundae.  She also had a chocolate milkshake and I had a spiked grape soda (I forgot the name).  Mussels were just ok; cheeseburger was ok; the french fries were pretty good though.  Sundaes are never bad, so can't really say much there.  My spiked grape soda tastes exactly like a grape-flavored soda with alcohol in it. The bill was $75 after tax.   Like I said, the food was ok.   I wouldn't go there again for the food, but I would definitely go for the ambiance! \n\nOne thing to note is that our server, Janay, mistakenly gave us vanilla in our sundae, when we asked for strawberry.  She made it up by giving us a big bowl of strawberry ice cream, so we ended up having four scoop of ice cream.  Needless to say, we didn't finish. \n\nI really enjoy the idea of being at the Sugar Factory, but there really wasn't anything tangible that will attract me to visit again.  Maybe I will go on a rainy day with nothing better to do and pretend I am a tourist. Or maybe go with my honey after romantic evening consist of dinner and a show... Just maybe.
