This place should be called \"Bonchon-Katrina\" because it is a DISASTER! From the moment I walked in, the hostess appeared completely frazzled and confused. There were 2 tables ahead of us and they said it's a 45 minute wait (Sat Aug 6th around 12:30). How is that possible? Walking to our table, the floor is greasy and very slippery! Gross!!! There are many items not available on the menu. The service is horrendous. Once we placed our order, the food expo guy was sending food to all the wrong tables (including my order). I see the server explaining to him how the tables are numbered. \n\nMeanwhile, we've been sitting their for 20 minutes, food being delivered to all the tables but ours. I know that the expo guy sent my order to the wrong table and when we saw chicken order after order coming out but not to us, we walked out and left. :( We were so hungry but was not going to deal with this any longer. \n\nThis place has a lot to work on. Staff all walking around like zombies and \"chickens\" with their heads cut off. The hostess needs to learn guest recovery and the staff just needs to give a shit. The manager appears to avoid conflict and eye contact.\n\nOn a positive note, the water we received was on point! :)
