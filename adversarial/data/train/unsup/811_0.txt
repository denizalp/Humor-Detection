I wish I had a Pita Jungle in my town. It's healthy, fresh, Mediterranean inspired food. The prices are on point as well. This location is smaller than others I've been to. The menu and service are consistent and don't disappoint. They have some outdoor seating too. My coworker really enjoyed his Gyro sandwich here. I love the chicken too. I also love the gelato...and in Arizona in the spring\/summer gelato is always a good idea!\n\nPlease have more California locations Pita Jungle!
