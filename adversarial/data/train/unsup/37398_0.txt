Holy Delicious!!!!!!!!\nMy omelette and my husband's pancakes were DELICIOUS.  My mom said the same thing about her egg sandwich.  I didn't even see what my stepdad ordered, it disappeared so quickly, so I'm guessing he liked that, too.  \nOur server was sweet and quick.  She overheard my husband say it was my birthday and she told me I get a dessert for free!  I got this frickin AMAZING tin roof pie to take home, which I inhaled later that evening.  IT WAS SO GOOD WITH THE LITTLE MARSHMALLOWS OMG.  \nOnly complaint, and I'm really trying to find something to gripe about here, is that the high chair for my baby could have been cleaner, and some of the other diners...... the senior citizen crowd....... seemed very crabby which was slightly annoying.  \nStaff here is great!  Food is the BEST!!!!!!
