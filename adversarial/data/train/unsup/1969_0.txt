Tried a BUNCH of different items here, ranging from the Pizza Margherita (quite good and literally the only thing on the menu that wasn't child sized) to the desserts.\n\nUnanimously, across the board, value was among the worst I've ever seen.\n\nFlavors incredibly average, and pretty much every menu item should be at least $6 less since everything is tapas sized.\n\nHonestly the portion of $18 spaghetti carbonara they served was laughable, me and the wife split it in two and it was honestly 2 forkfuls..\n\nJust awful
