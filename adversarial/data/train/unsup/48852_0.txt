The boneless wings are really good. We got the moosey platter which is 30 wings (we picked the boneless) and one side. We chose garlic parm, hot garlic, buffalo ranch, medium, and six pepper dry rub. I don't have anything bad to say about any of the flavors. The fries were also really good. For the price, it is definitely worth a try. This was a good meal for my boyfriend and I and for 24.99 we will definitely be back.
