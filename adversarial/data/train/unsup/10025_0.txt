I felt like a Lil kid in a candy store who had taken a really excited bite into a rotten piece of candy. It was like drinking wine that had gone rancid and tasted like vinegar. \n\nThe girls are beat. I mean ugly. I will give the benefit of the doubt that it could've been a bad night for staffing. \n\nBut whatever, really wanted a lap dance from a hot chick on my bday with the BF. I literally couldn't pick one, they all sucked. \n\nI got desperate before we left, watched her do her thing on stage and was ready, I walked up to her and threw up in my mouth a lil. She was hideous and nothing what she looked in the darker lighting OMG. \n\nSo disappointed. Really disgusted. \n\nLesson learned: HUGE reasons why strip clubs are dark, and ...\"why go out for hamburger when you have steak at home\" -Paul Newman\n\nOh and P.S. Guy's there are more than a few male to female \"chicks\" in there.  A girl knows when a girl isn't a girl...\nDont let that lighting get ya...
