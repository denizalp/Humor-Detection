WoW! Hash House A Go Go huh? I hadn't even heard of this place until a friend of mine mentioned he had seen it on Man vs Food and really wanted to check it out. Well at first I drove down to the other location to find out that there was another location at the Imperial Palace. Who knew?\n\nEveryone finally made it to the correct location and we were seated. I guess the food takes a while since the portions are GIGANTIC and there were like 16 of us but everything went pretty well. \n\nMan. I had no idea HOW HUGE the portions were going to be here but they weren't kidding. I think I could've shared my meal with like 4 people. Seriously. I ended up getting small plates and having bites of stuff on each plate to have for my meal.\n\nYou must get the biscuits and gravy side! UGH. It's SO good. I do love biscuits and gravy and man I loved theirs. They had pieces of chunky sausage in it and it was just yummy.\n\nWe ordered the Man vs Food meal with the fried chicken and stuff. It was good but definitely overwhelming. I didn't get through much of the meal but it wasn't bad. There's just too much going on!\n\nOur waiter was pretty good and did pretty well getting everything out. One of my friend's meals took forever and he ended up just taking his burger for the car ride because it came after everyone was pretty much done eating. \n\nIt's something to try but I don't think I'll be coming back. It was just too much.\n\nAlso, at the end of the meal you think to yourself how much we waste. Eek.
