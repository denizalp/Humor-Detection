So this is my third time here and I must say I WAS NOT IMPRESSED! I'm not sure if the bartender was legit or not because my raspberry martini was wrong the two times he made them. My wife's patron margarita was so sweet she couldn't drink it. Over all the service was subpar and I won't be back! Also the manager came to the table with a loud voice to ask us about the drinks!!! Maybe I should've sat on the other side instead of going to happy hour!!!
