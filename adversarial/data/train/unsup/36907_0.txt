Jameson's on 17th? What can I say? Well, I've been meaning to try this place for quite some time as I pass by it frequently. It's conveniently located close to the street with a nice patio out front. Inside the decor is that of your typical Irish pub, charming & quaint with a large wooden bar and ample seating. \n\nMy friend and I were excited to stop in for a drink and to soak up some sunny 17th ave ambience on the patio. The place was pretty packed for a sunny saturday afternoon and the bar was very busy. Perhaps that explains why service was so painfully slow and disorganized.. We waited 15 minutes before someone even came over to check on us and the adjacent table. A visibly annoyed couple seated next to us got tired of waiting and simply walked out completely unnoticed.\n\nOur drinks were fine and we enjoyed our brief time there but the service was really, really bad. Our server didn't even bother to return to get our food order, so we opted to go somewhere else along 17th ave.\n\nI really wanted to like this place because it is a pretty cool spot for people watching, good drinks and a friendly atmosphere BUT management needs to be made aware of the crap service as it's clear that they are losing business as a direct result.
