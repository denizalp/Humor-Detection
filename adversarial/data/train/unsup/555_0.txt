As close to Paris as you can get while still on US soil. Simply delightful, all the way around - from the lovely view of the strip to the damn delicious food.\n\nIt became a trend for me to order multiple items off the menu when we had breakfast, so I could sample each one (probably should have stuck to buffets, since I'm so indecisive). \n\nI had the croissant sandwich and blueberry french toasts, and ate bits of both. I was in breakfast heaven. Seriously, I couldn't have asked for a better meal! I'll definitely be back on future trips.
