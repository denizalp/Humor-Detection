My oldest daughter went to Gymboree about 4 years ago when she was an infant all the way until she was 3 yrs old.  Now we have my youngest 2.5 year old in classes and as a parent you're always searching for cool things to do with your kids, that don't cost an arm and a leg.\n\nGymboree fits the bill.  My kids learn something and they have fun climbing around on all of the cool things they have setup.  Every week there's a different theme, this week it was \"farm\" and they got to pretend they were animals.  The greatest thing IMO is the fact that they learn to interact with other children their age and start the process of socialization.  I must admit, that parachute time is awesome and both of my daughters thoroughly enjoy that part of the class.\n\nJust recently they updated the entire place and they have an entire new look.  New climbing things, and all new things for the kids to play with.  Along with a fresh coat of paint it makes the entire experience well worth it.\n\nThe teachers that lead the class are all wonderful and are very focused on making sure the kids are having fun and everyone participates.  Ms. Kia is my kids favorite and she is really good with the children.
