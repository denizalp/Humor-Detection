Is there a star option for \"not my favourite\"? Because this is not my favourite LCBO. In fact, on a scale of \"1 to Summerhill LCBO\" it's a 1. \n\nWith the exception of cashiers, staff is nowhere to be found. I knew what I was looking for, but being new to the concept of wine in bottles (as opposed to boxes - KIDDING) I didn't know where to find it. I spent a good thirty minutes dodging reeking hobos and fauxmless people trying to find a very specific bottle of wine. There seemed to be more vagrants than typically present in an LCBO.\n\nI bought four bottles of wine and wasn't offered a bag even though I had my nickel ready. They only had individual paper bags - no plastic. Pardon me if I don't want to carry three litres of wine in separate paper bags on the TTC. \n\nThe entrance is difficult to find. It's in the basement of the Atrium On Bay near the subway. There are signs on the map showing it in a different spot but don't be deceived...it's way in the corner.
