Miranda was recommended by our realtor along with 2 others. Theirs was the least expensive estimate so we went with them. The move took much longer than estimated (primarily because the movers could not figure out how to reassemble the furniture they had taken apart) so it cost us almost 50% more than the estimate, We were not happy about it but there really wasn't much that we could do about it so we reluctantly paid. In addition, 2 weeks after the move we have continued to find MANY chips, scratches, etc.in our furniture that did not exist prior to the move. All in all, they were nice enough but I would not consider using them again.
