Where do I even start? From the extremely slow service, the inflated prices, or the below par frozen hot chocolate?!\n\nIt was about 11pm at night and I just came from Mon Ami Gabi over at Paris hotel. I thought I would try serendipity for dessert since it is quite popular and the idea of a frozen hot chocolate is interesting. So me and my cousin arrived at Serendipity and we see a long line outside as well as an empty seating area. I was informed that inside sitting is for people eating in, and the line outside is for take out or basically drink orders. I got in line thinking \"this should be fast\", \"I'm sure they have plenty of staff considering it is summer and the weather is 105 degrees\". Boy was I wrong! It took forever due to shortage of staff!! It was finally our turn to order and I got the Amaretto Almond Frrrozen Hot Chocolate because a friend of mine recommended it. It was quite convenient of them not to have the prices on the menu. Not that I am cheap with food, but I would like to know what it is I am forking over for this drink. hahaha. So the total comes out to be $11.82 for the smaller size. Holy Moly!! I was shocked! but too late to back out now, after waiting for at least half an hour to order. Then I had to wait another 10-15 minutes for them to make the drink. I am thinking to myself \"this better be the best drink ever!\" Again I was greatly disappointed. It tasted like iced down flavored Almond slush. I've had much better almond slushes in OC. Needless to say, I am never coming back here! It was such a waste of time and money! Don't buy into the hype like I did!
