It makes my heart super happy to see so many people (and so many different people from all different walks of life) come together this weekend in uptown for the festival and parade. You can't help but have a giant smile on your face. \n\nI still can't get over how many people lined the streets for the parade. I can't wait to watch Pride continue grow each year. \n\nShout out to RAIN & Cupcrazed and also Snug Harbor on their killer floats. The group who handed out the freezie pops were complete life savers. Shewww, it was a warm one. \n\nI love living in this city. Thank you Charlotte for a weekend full of love.
