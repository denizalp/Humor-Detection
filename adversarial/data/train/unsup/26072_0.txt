Recently bought a used car from this dealership. Great car, but deceptive finance Dept. Be careful with Giuseppe, this guy is not up-front with what he is doing. I was duped and can't believe it....my bad. Team and dealership is Polished on the outside, shady and dirty on the inside! They have definitely lost a future customer....
