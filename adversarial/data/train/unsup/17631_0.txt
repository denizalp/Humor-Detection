These guys do not want to detail your car after selling you the detail package. After being told 3 previous times they couldn't do the job that day I'm finally getting it done... And am currently waiting well into my 3rd hour for them to finish. No one started on it for the first hour. It should be the most immaculate detail job ever performed, but I highly doubt that will be the case as I'm watching the employee smoke while he performs his duty.
