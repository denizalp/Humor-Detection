I have been coming to Lesco for several years for all of my optical needs. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable and blessedly not pushy! The prices are awesome and they have many designer frames available. Their service is fast...I just picked up my most recent order which was ready in only five business days! They are simply wonderful in all aspects of quality and service!
