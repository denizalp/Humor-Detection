Another great review for the Scottsdale Cat Clinic.  Everything everyone else has said is true.  This place and the people will immediately put you and your kitty at ease.  They are very relaxed and professional at all times.  After the stress of shoving your kitty in that cat carrier, and all those other stressful vet visits you've had elsewhere, it's a welcome relief.\n\nOur cat is a rescue, and her past is a little sketchy down to even knowing exactly when she was born.  Making it worse? Her first vet who misdocumented a spay for her (he 'missed' her out of a group of kittens somehow but certified she was spayed), so when we did get her spayed a year later after figuring out what all that nightly yowling was about we weren't sure about other documentation (shots etc).  Well, those spotty terrible records have been transferred to the up-to-date lovely people at Scottsdale Cat Clinic.  They checked her out, complimented her strong haunches (she loves to jump and climb), weighed her clipped her nails, gave her some shots - and all with the very most minimal kitty or owner stress.\n\nI could only wish they took people.  Anyone have a doctor or dentist this great? :)
