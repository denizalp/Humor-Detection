Every Vegas trip, every year, XS IS A MUST.\n\nGorgeously decorated inside, the setup outside by the pool is nice too. There are bars in just about every corner of that club and there's two outside. The dance floor itself is pretty large but people tend to just dance everywhere. The crowd is always different and always cracking! \n\nLet me tell you though, the cover charge always varies. On a non holiday weekend I paid $20, on guest-list. Last President's day weekend, it was doubled, no guest lists and dudes paid $100. \n\nThe drinks aren't that overly charged (it is Vegas) and the bartenders are always so accommodating. I've never been a served a weak drink or given a shotty attitude. \n\nAlso you probably want to get there early. XS line is no joke. I think last time it went all the way into the Wynn. Thankfully my promoter friends have promoter friends, connections that get us past the line. I don't know how people wait that long.
