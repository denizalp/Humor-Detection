It was my birthday weekend and I was having a get together with friends and family, and I had originally planned on having the dinner at another local restaurant but few days before the dinner the manger called and said they could not host us unless we sat outside, and well its Phoenix & August so that's not going to work.\n\nSo I asked some friends and did some research and called Pizza People Pub on a Wednesday to see if they could host a party of 26 on Saturday at 6pm and without any hesitation they said yes, the hostess asked what's the occasion told her it was to celebrate my birthday, was given 2 rules, no glitter no confetti, damn it was like she knew me already haha.\n\n26 people, plenty of tables and one great server! I wish I remembered his name, he was able to handle the entire party with ease, and everyone had nothing but positive things to say about the service! He didn't even blink an eye when asked if separate checks were ok, he said no problem! Just excellent.\n\nI started off with the drink of the day, which was the huckleberry punch, not sure of what all was in it, but it was a great drink for 4 bucks.\n\nFor food, I went with the BBQ Pig N Chick, BBQ sauce, mozzarella, chicken, BACON, onions and fresh cilantro, this was a delish pizza! The crust was perfect, it had an even amount of sauce and plenty of toppings. And even with being a big party, everyone received their meals in a timely matter.\n\nI was happy with everything Pizza People Pub provided, I now know a cool spot to have for small or large dinner parties!
