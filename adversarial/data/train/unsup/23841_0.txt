I will let you in on a little secret. Of all the higher end hotel casinos on the strip, Encore\/Wynn has the highest slot payouts. I am offered rooms and other comps at nearly all of the Vegas hotels including the MGM resorts (Bellagio\/Aria\/MGM, etc.), the Harrah resorts (Caesars\/Paris\/Planet Hollywood, etc.), Venetian\/Palazzo, and countless others. None of them rival the frequency of larger payouts than at Wynn\/Encore. \nHere is a telling statistic. I have hit individual slot wins of $1,000 or more at Wynn\/Encore 6 times in the past 3 years. It has never happened at any other property on the strip. In fact, I have never had a slot pull that resulted in a winning of even $500 at a Mlife casino. The Encore\/Wynn also attract a more educated and well-mannered crowd that creates a more comfortable casino floor atmosphere. Either the affluent, but diverse, patrons smoke less or the casino has the most technologically advanced air circulation system in the world. Once you enter the hotel, this will become immediately obvious as your first sensory experience. The courtesy and professionalism of the entire staff is also second to none - including the front desk, the bellmen, the cocktail waitresses, and the housekeeping staff. \nThe rooms\/suites at the Encore are also the most elegant, the cleanest, and have the most comfortable beds anywhere in Vegas. The hotel also hosts some of the hottest clubs as evident by some of the hottest, albeit scandalously dressed, ladies on the night scene. I do not recall ever seeing an abundance of over-aged or over-weight herds that frequent some of the other nightclubs in Vegas.\nLastly, no other casino could boast a world-class golf course located literally on the resort property. The spa is also phenomenal for the ladies while you are playing a round of golf or laboring at the casino tables. You may not want to leave her at the pool though unless she prefers to be incessantly propositioned by desperate men (or even uninhibited women for that matter). \nWhy am I sharing these observations with everyone on Yelp and risking the possibility that everyone will flock to Wynn\/Encore and it will be over-crowded? Because I am tired of reading reviews that complain about the resort fee, internet charges, or other nominal costs. Staying at a Motel 6 that is conveniently located next to a McDonald's or Starbucks with free Wi-Fi would be a better option then? The resort fee is never charged when it is part of your room comp and if you cannot afford wireless hot-spot service on your smartphone, perhaps wireless internet is above your means anyway? Most of all, I am disgusted with the low standards at the other resorts on the Vegas strip, including the lackluster hotel amenities, disgruntled service staff, incompetent dealers, and the absurd slot payouts. \nThus, I am hoping that you all frequent Wynn\/Encore more often so that they will be more profitable and could continue to offer me the best comps. On the other hand, if you are too frugal to pay for the resort\/internet fees, or too unattractive to either participate or too insecure to appreciate the nightclub scene, then Wynn\/Encore is definitely not the place for you. Consider my post a favor to help you avoid bitterness or awkwardness.
