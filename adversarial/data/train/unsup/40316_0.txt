Good Chinese food, they give huge portions and they do not lack flavor. Customer service is on par, I live in the area and plan on making this a frequent place of mine. The egg drop soup was very delicious and the sweet and sour pork was some of the best I've had. Would definitely recommend everyone in the area to give this place a chance. Very nice people.
