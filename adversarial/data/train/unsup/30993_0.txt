Every time I go to Matt's, I always have an amazing experience and a superb breakfast. Sunday has to be one of my favorite days there, they have their \"Stake and Eggs\" special. The meat is tender,juicy and full of flavor. Their potatoes are delicious and well seasoned. The thick cut bacon is delicious. The hog and chick is always a great choice, the fruit preserves that comes with is also great. The griddlecakes are also a good choice, fluffy and sweet. Their milk, coffee, and orange juice are delicious. Its a small place so I recommend you go in early so you can avoid waiting to be seated!
