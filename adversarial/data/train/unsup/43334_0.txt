I really like this place. While it's certainly nothing fancy, the owners and the workers are very friendly. I think in some ways they're still learning the ropes of the restaurant business - sometimes service can be a bit uneven. But it doesn't detract from your meal. \n\nAs far as the food, everything I've had has been excellent. I've always stuck to the Korean menu items, along with the Ramen. The Ramen is the best I've had anywhere ,with fresh tasting flavorful broth and vegetables. Try it with the Gyoza - potstickers.
