If you're ever feeling a burning desire to tear out the follicles of hair from your skin (or if you get dared to) I definitely recommend this place.  Everybody here is sociable and comfortable to be around and the facilities are clean and new.  The last place I went to get my legs done cost too much and didn't give me any instructions on what to do post ripping so my legs felt like the human torch was giving them a massage... not this place.  Everybody made sure I was educated about the self-care situation I would be in when I got home.  \n\nThe procedures (I'm a dude and had pretty much all the hair from my neck down eradicated) weren't painless... I'm not gonna lie... but they were much less painful than my previous experience and much less painful than what I was expecting for such, um, delicate areas.\n\nLast but not least, all the waxperts (love the term) are super cool, easy to talk to, not shy or bashful about having to rip the winter coat off the naughty extremities, and very professional.  I feel like I could totally just stroll in and hang out for a while with these chill peeps, however, that might not really be preferable for their business sake to have some strange guy loitering in the waiting area all day.\n\nGreat experience, awesome people, I'll definitely be coming back!
