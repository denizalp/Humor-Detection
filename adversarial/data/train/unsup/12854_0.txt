Vegas is all about being loud, being stupid, being carefree and not worrying about being an adult. but having adult privileges. We were drinking @ 1am and the security guard came by to warn us to tone it down or else the manager would return. We went downstairs and people were giving us evil stares just being we were tipsy, but it's VEGAS! The pool was tiny, but props to the pool boy who carried our towels for us and found seats for us.\n\nThe only thing I like about this place, was the amazing night view from our hotel room, and that everything was automated (curtains, the do not disturb, the lights), and that the elevator was extremely easy to find. SOME of the service was extremely attentive and friendly, and really down to earth...others (like the housekeeper and the hotel clerk) showed that they hated their jobs.\n\nWould never book a room here ever again.
