I was recently at Spa Jema to receive a manicure and pedicure.  The pedicure was fabulous and relaxing however a different girl did my manicure, I believe her name was DeeDee.  Let me just tell you how awful this manicure was.  My cuticles weren't even pushed back, the polished chipped 5 minutes after I left the place, and they were hardly filed or buffed.  The price of the manicure is insane for the horrendous job that was done on my nails. I paid extra to get the paraffin wax treatment which was nice.  My friends who didn't pay extra never got lotion or any sort of hand massage.  The manicure itself was probably a 5 minute treatment.  DeeDee was not concerned with doing a good job, she just wanted to get out of there and go home.
