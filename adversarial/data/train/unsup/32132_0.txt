I met a friend of mine here. It was in the snowy Sunday afternoon before closing. There were not so many customers, but I felt relaxed. There were TVs and there were many seats and tables. They have lots of desserts and pastries. They have varieties of coffee and espresso and combination of espresso and Ice cream. They have tea and juice, too. It is nice. The prices are pretty reasonable. I really liked this place. Desserts and pastries are very delicious. The service was good. The young lady with a pair of glasses was very kind and gentle. I would love to come back there again.
