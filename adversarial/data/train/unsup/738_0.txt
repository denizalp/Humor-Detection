I went to an event where this guy was catering.  Food was standard food-truck cheap tacos on stale, store-bought tortillas.  Of course I got sick the next day really bad as did my wife and kids.  I didn't see any sort of Health Department card at his stand.  Not sure if he's licensed or not.  Never again, Taco Man.  Never again.
