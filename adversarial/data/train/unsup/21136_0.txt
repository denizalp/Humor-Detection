I love their sandwiches and sides! AND they deliver to Kit's Trackside across the street!\n\nI've had a few of their sandwiches while I was having drinks at Kit's and the only one that I was disappointed in was the lobster roll - because it's lobster salad with various other ingredients, and not the traditional kind of lobster roll. The meatball sandwich was very good, and the loaded potato salad is DELICIOUS. Seriously, I know that you want to be healthy, especially to balance your beers across the street, but order that potato salad. \n\nThe inside of Corner Grind is cute, warm and a little smokey. But still super enjoyable. I can see how it would get too crowded and become slow to get food. \n\nYou can thank me for the potato salad, and say hi to Kit and his team for me!
