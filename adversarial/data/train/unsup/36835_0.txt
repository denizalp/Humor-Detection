The BF was REALLY wanting breakfast so I remembered this place has been on my list for the longest time. Even though we were fairly close to their closing, they sat us and we ordered quickly. \n\nI wanted crab cake benedict but they didn't have so I settled for the classic. This was a exceptionally good one. The ham was smokey and good so it seems to be better quality that some places. Now the hollandaise is what it is all about and not only was it good, but finally a place that gives a plentiful topping of it. I feel there is never enough, but this was a nice pour of it. \n\nCorned beef hash was homemade style so more shredded than canned crushed up meat. This is the only kind I would order and I appreciated that it was well cooked with a bit of crisp to it. \n\nThe seasoned potatoes that come with the breakfasts were really good. I love me some breakfast taters and these I definitely could eat a heap of. One of our plates came with a choice of bread so of course we grabbed a bagel since it's their namesake. The sundried was rather nice flavoring throughout the bagel and the chewiness was just right with the crisp outside. A quality bagel for sure. \n\nThe service was speedy and fairly friendly. \n\nDon't know why we haven't come in before, but definitely will come again and try the delicious looking sandwiches and the baked goods. First impression though was very positive!
