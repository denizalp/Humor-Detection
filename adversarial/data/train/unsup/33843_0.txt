I never thought I needed to go to a scalp spa until I came to this scalp spa. Came across this business while looking for a salon and thought this was a cool concept so I dropped by one afternoon. I gotta say, cool experience! \nImmediately upon entering the \"spa\" I took off my shoes and put on a disposable bootie. Then I got seated for a consultation where my scalp was analyzed and a \"before\" picture was taken. After explaining to me the condition of my scalp (learned lots!), I went to have my hair washed, scalp massaged, infused with \"potions\", and a quick blow dry. After the treatments, I went back to the front of the spa for a post treatment analysis and picture. They also introduced me to the treatment shampoo, conditioner and serum they used which are for sale. I decided to buy them and give it a try. It's not cheap - 90 for 3 pc treatment but I thought it's worth a try. I have a lot of hair loss and part of the problem is because of my scalp so I wanted to treat it better. The session itself was also $90 so total I spent $180. Steep. \nOverall it was a great experience and the service was great. The experience isn't relaxing or anything (not like those neck massages at hair salons), the foot massage is by a machine and it wasn't very comfortable for me, but the experience focused on my scalp and I have to say, my scalp felt refreshed and wonderful. It's very different from just washing your hair... I would recommend everyone give it a try. As for me, they recommend bi weekly treatments for the first couple of months for better results but I'm not ready yet. I'll give the products a try for awhile and go from there.
