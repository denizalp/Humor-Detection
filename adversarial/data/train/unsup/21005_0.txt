This place is boring.  They use below par ingredients, and serve up flavorless fare.  This is yet another one of your suburban pizza and sandwich shops.  White Oak has about 5 too many of these, and Veltre's is one of the worst.  \n\nWorst antipasti I've ever seen, the whole menu lacks healthy choices & is defiantly geared toward the blue collar crowd.  \n\nMy meatball sub was bland, overlooked and had about a tablespoonful of sauce on the whole thing. \n\nThe staff is unfriendly and weird, and the food quality is hit or miss on any given night.\n\nOn the up side, you won't be wasting much money, because they keep the prices pretty low.
