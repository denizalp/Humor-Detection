I spoke to Chandra the manager who basically was like a robot repeating the same thing over and over and over about their warranty. They never gave me a refund on my sofa she basically said that they would charge me a 30% restocking fee plus they wouldn't have to charge me for every single day that I had these couches so at this point she was making it impossible for me to be able to return the sofas. \n\nShe said they fixed my couch with stronger wood \"interesting they didn't do that in the first place when they build furniture\". \n\nagain I strongly strongly recommend, suggest, advise,  alert do not buy furniture here you will be in deep regret if you do. \n\n\nAmerican - AMISS\nFurniture -FEEBLE\nWarehouse - WASTE of your time!!
