The best thing about the Opera House is the sight lines. I'm 5'1\" and can still see the stage from also anywhere in the venue. Drink prices are reasonable compared to other venues in the city. Despite the appearance of the kitchen, the food is great and affordable. It is convenient if you are heading to a show after work and don't have time to eat (or if you want some late night munchies).  \n\nFor those complaining about limited seating... this is a general admission concert venue.
