Portions are wayyy to much, and the taste is meh. I got sesame chicken with fried rice and egg roll. Coming from NYC I wasn't expecting much but this place was depressing compared to back home. The rice was bland. The egg roll had too much cabbage inside, and the chicken was cripsy on the outside but inside seemed under cooked. The sauce wasn't the best either. Overly not a great experience. Kinda pricey too for Chinese food. Which I only ate about 10% of.
