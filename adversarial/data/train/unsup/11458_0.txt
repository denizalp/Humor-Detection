My son & his friends LOVE chicken shack so I decided to give it a try. It is a very busy place so they must be doing something right. My biggest complaint is how small the place is. I was placing an order to go, the counter to order is in the back, there is a 4 top on the left & the soda dispenser on the right. I have an 18 month old & had her with me. So trying to not have her grabbing or hitting the people at the table & not play with the soda machine left VERY LITTLE room. I was in the way of staff coming from the back to hand out orders & for people trying to get refills. We finally get to the counter & I asked a few questions making it obvious it was my 1st visit. I place an order for 24 lemon pepper wings & a garlic Parmesan fingers meal. I pay & turn around to go wait & there's nowhere to go. They was 3 people in line behind me 2 other people waiting for their to go orders & 2 people trying to get refills. SO CROWDED. I finally get out of the way & go to wait at a 2 top, the only open table. My order didn't take to long. I get home w it & unpack it & there was no sauce for anything, wings, fingers or fries. I'm assuming now it's something you order as well. That would've been nice to know. \n\n\nNow the food itself, it was very good. The chicken was cooked to perfection & the fries were great. We will go back but try different flavored, the lemon pepper was good, garlic Parmesan needs more garlic & Parmesan. We'll also be sure to ask for sauces!
