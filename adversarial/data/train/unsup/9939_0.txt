My boyfriend and I went to ABC Nissan to look at some used cars, we got two sales men to show us some cars. We test drove 2 different cars, and the main sales person kept asking if we are going to buy a car today. I REPEATEDLY told him no, we are just test driving and we are still looking at other cars. I wanted to get the numbers on both cars to compare and he would only look up 1 car. He said what one to you like better, and I kept telling him I want to see the numbers on both (still only showed me the numbers for one car). Oh also they kept asking do you want WATER and POP CORN, every freaking second, LIKE no I don't want your ghetto ass food. \n\nSo then they show us the numbers and they were trying to sell us a used car for $24,000! I don't know cars a whole lot but I can get a brand new car for that much! And the sales men would draw a X and a line saying sign here so I know you are interested in buying, and I kept telling him I am not signing anything cause I am not interested! \n\nWe were there for about 4 hours! I was so exhausted and pissed off! I understand sales people are pushy that is their job BUT there is a line! I will NEVER go back to that location, and I will make sure no one in my family goes there.
