We went to the KISS mini-golf nearby and since I meant to go here the last time I was in Vegas, I kind of dragged my group here, although it was still light out and we still intended to go to the all-you-can-drink thing at the High Roller ferris wheel. Bad idea. \n\nI mean, I'm glad we came, but it was just a little too cheap and easy to get my night (afternoon) started with an alcoholic bang. The Ass Juice was just as gross as it sounds (ours tasted like watermelon but not the kind Beyonce was drankin',more like watermelon and garbage.) While I don't know if it was the legendary Ass Juice that set me on a path of destruction but I went on to get very, very drunk. I ordered a bacon martini but the kind barkeep suggested I get a bacon bloody mary instead (he showed me the \"bacon infused\" booze in the bottle, it really did just have some bacon floating around in there) and that shit was on the money.  Garnished with a Slim Jim, it was excellent. Take a bite of Slim Jim, take a sip of Bloody Mary, heavenly.  I played video poker (no big win but made $5 last for a long time) and then my friend and I decided to get a $2 budget box shot- but we cheated and asked the lady next to us what it was since she had just taken one, something root beer flavored which was quite tasty.  I should know because she gave me another one, which I did not need but much appreciated.  Everyone was very friendly, which was cool. A guy my friend talked to had TURDUCKEN tattooed on his knuckles.  There was some kind of dirty cartoon on the TV, the music was good, and I was good and drunk when we left so I'd say it was an overall success! My husband is kind of \"over\" drive bars which I get, but somewhere like Vegas where there's so much overpriced shit, it's nice to get cheap, strong drinks in a decidedly non-glitzy place (same reason I like Dino's.)
