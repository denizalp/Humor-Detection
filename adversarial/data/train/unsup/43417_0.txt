LifeCafe is a great perk to being a lifetime member.  The food is fresh, healthy and prepared relatively quick.  Life Café offers a nice variety of menu options from smoothies, breakfast, snacks, lunch\/dinner to small kid's plates and vegetarian options. All the nutrition facts are listed for each item on the menu.   Another bonus is they have specials everyday: \n$2 - Snack\n$3 - Breakfast (Huevos wrap is my favorite)\n$4- smoothie \n$5 - Meal (Mostly sandwiches and wraps)\nIn addition to food, they sell all the gym supplies you may have forgotten to put in your bag...socks, swim caps, weight gloves, tennis balls, etc... and free wireless access.  \nI'm not sure if you can get into the café if you're not a gym member, as it is passed the check-in point.
