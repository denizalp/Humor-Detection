The other day someone posted a question about eating near the airport and Miguel's popped in my mind and ever since I posted my response,  I could not get it out of my mind so today was Miguel day.\nWhen you drive up it looks condemned, it's on 85 Interstate Service Rd, (exit 32 Little Rock Rd) that right there, sounds sketchy.  It's beside a closed motel, (Bates Motel reference).  This alone makes me LOVE this restaurant.  It is everything you want it to be in that off the beaten path kind of way.  They don't serve the best food, the margarita is average, service is functional, but all of it wrapped up it's like heaven.
