Came here with my husband on a Monday evening around 7pm. When we arrived another couple were finishing up, so by the time we received our order we were the only ones inside. \n\nThe restaurant was very very dated and grimey. The floors and tables were quite dirty. It was also a hot 30 degree July day, and there was no air conditioning on so it was fairly hot and uncomfortable inside. But I've had some good meals at other hole in the wall joints so I didn't really let this affect me. \n\nWe shared a 3 piece fried chicken combo with fries. Admittedly, the food was tasty. However, there were some huge red flags I noticed as I was eating. \n\nFrom where we were sitting, I could see the sink that was adjacent to the take out counter. The man who served us was back there with a big tray of raw chicken ripping the skin and fat off the chicken and breaking it into pieces with his bare hands. I could see him very clearly and he knew I saw him because we made brief eye contact as I was watching. When another customer came in, he went to the front counter without washing his hands then grabbed and touched the tongs, various condiments, the paper plates he served food on and the cash register. \n\nI was disgusted and appalled. Raw chicken is probably the most dangerous food contaminant. I would not be surprised if this establishment is unable to pass any sort of safe dining or food handling test. Will never ever go back, no matter how tasty their food was.
