I felt like it was a nice ride. They have it set up exactly like an amusement park\/fair ride, but they have a bar you can get drinks from while you wait to get on or to take with you on the ride. It's just mainly an observation ride,it goes something like 500 feet up to get a good luck at Vegas from up high, really nice view. The ride is about 30 minutes long (slow moving for observing)once you actually board so plan around that if you have something else to do. The ticket prices are $26.95 if you ride during the day, $36.95 at night and there's up to $7.00 off if you buy them online; on Tuesday's there's a 50% discount for locals with Nevada ID.\n\nThere are 28 cabins and each one holds up to 40 people. You can also rent a whole cabin out and have your own bartender on board. They will wheel on this mobile bartender cart for your party. Also they have other party packages that you'll just have to call for.\n\nBefore you get on they take pictures of you, and you can purchase them in the gift shop when the ride is done. When you're on board you can either stand or sit down (they have 2 half circle benches on each side of the cabin). During the whole ride they have tv's playing; and it plays music(nothing you know or would sing to, something closer to elevator music), shows trivia, facts about the High Roller observation wheel, and let's you know how far up in the air you are as you go up doing a countdown to the highest point.\n\nIt was a nice view, something you should at least do once while in Vegas. I would suggest that if you try it, to make it a much better experience you should definitely go with a group of 3 or more people,  and with alcohol of course  :-).
