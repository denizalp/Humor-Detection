Great food, great service however they have an odor problem at the males bathroom, there is an open drainage where all the unpleasant aromas flows thru. Stinky smell.\n\nTomas was our sever he was very helpful and kind, made good recommendations. Had the pork ribs as a starter and my wife had the wayguy gyosas, gyosas were ok but the ribs were outstanding, one of the best ribs ever. Then I had the scallops with pork belly and it was a superb dish! My wife had the prim fix menu that had a macadamia crusted Mahi Mahi And short ribs, the ribs were so tender and flavorful no doubts the best short ribs ever, fish was average.
