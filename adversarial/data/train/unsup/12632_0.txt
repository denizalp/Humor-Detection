First time here and I LOVE this place!!!!\n\nWe sat in a street fence side table.\n\nHubby ordered a Stella on tap and I ordered a Lost Coast raspberry brown in a bottle.\nSever was nice. Nothing special but we were not here to chit chat. Brought beer, brought food, brought check. We saw her three times. \n\nThe people watching aspect has me hooked :)))) if it was not sooo chilly and windy tonight we would have stayed for another drink! \n\nHubby ordered the veggie sliders and sweet potato tots. Yum! The pickles on them...ugh I could eat a million. Nothing dry about these burgers. Moist and tasteful. They came with a side of some kind of homemade honey mustard. Tots were too sweet for me but they were yum.\n\nI ordered the veggie pita wrap. Nothing wrap about it. It's a soft, warm stuffed pita. Inside it had eggplant, yellow squash, a tiny bit of smooth spread feta, lettuce and tomato. It comes with crispy hand it fries. Crispy! Ugh I love crispy fries! I don't like catsup but I decided to try it anyway...HELLO?!? It has siracha in it!!!!! Yum I'm sold and will never be the same! \n\nSee my pics for the beauty!\n\nI want to go back to visit the inside, lol we did not even walk in the place!\n\nGreat job Park! Put my name on that table! I want to people watch there everyday! \n\nPerfection!
