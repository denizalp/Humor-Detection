The tally was $13.35 before my son said he would like to add a soda, now the total would be $15.14 said Perla, the sandwich maker\/cashier, presumably she was reading off the register as she said that.  As I was paying, I asked her if the receipt was in the bag, she said yes.  Seeing I was ACTUALLY looking for the receipt, she said: \"Oh, it's here\". The receipt was on the register all along and it seems like she didn't want to give it to me at first, but she grabbed the receipt from the register finally.  As she was handing that receipt to me, she asked how old my son is, (she wasn't friendly at all prior to that moment), so I answered her question meanwhile forgetting to look at the receipt.  Back to the hotel, I happened to see the receipt, it was ACTUALLY $12.65 as shown on the pic.  I also realized she didn't give me a receipt for the sandwiches I bought the night before and she overcharged me more than $2 as well.  I know it's only a few dollars, most ppl don't even bother checking or asking for a receipt.  I see a lot of taxi\/limo drivers here, and I wonder how many ppl have left without a receipt.  Speaking of receipt,  Subway has a slogan, \"If we don't give you a receipt, you get your sandwich free\".  The register automatically printed their current sale code which I wasn't aware of, each Subway has it's own price and various codes from time to time.  Either way, discount or no discount, we pay the receipt amount, plus whatever the tip amount, isn't that the whole point of receipt?  We had been here before, the service was good generally.  Hopefully this is NOT their common practice.  Two stars for them opening 24 hrs.
