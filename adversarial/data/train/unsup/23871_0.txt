Absolutely delicious!\n\nWe were searching for a tapas style restaurant for dinner on Yelp and came across this spot. Located on Restaurant Row in the Venetian Hotel, we were able to walk in around 730pm on a Sunday night. We had just missed HH which was from 4-7pm. \n\nWe decided to order the servers recommendations:\n- Passionfruit Mojito (Sugarcane in the drink was a nice touch)\n- Bacon Wrapped Dates\n- Ahi Blue Fin Tuna Tartare\n- Goat Cheese Croquettes \n- Korean Style Short Ribs (I would skip this next time. Nothing too special about it) \n- And for dessert: Torrejas - Dulce de Leche soaked french toast with maple carmelized apples and cinnamon ice cream\n\nEverything was delicious, staff was friendly, and the price is decent considering the location. This spot totally surprised us. I'll definitely be back for more!
