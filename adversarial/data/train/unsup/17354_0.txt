Do yourself a favor and skip this place. We got a table, but it was not enough for having excess to the vip area! Come on! Are you kidding me? This is ridiculous! I thought having a table was all you had to do to get some respect. In this place?!? Apparently not. \nThe crowd is very old, which, was not my thing either. \nAll in all, this place hit rock bottom.
