You need a serving of vegan comfort food, come here.\nAlways busy, you can dine inside or patio, takeout and even grubhub for delivery.\n\nIf you are anti-fauxs don't come here. Most of the menu contains fauxs but they are done well. A few raw choices are also available.\n\nBeet veggie burger on whole wheat is really good. The sliders are also great. \n\nPho is great and so are the tacos! \n\nI love the sushi here it reminds me a little of Beyond Sushi in NYC. \n\nAs far as drinks they have everything from juice infused cocktails to just straight up juice and smoothie blends.\n\nI have always been a fan of Chef Don and very happy to see this place always full of smiling faces and compassionate meals!!!!!
