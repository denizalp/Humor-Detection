My first visit to a Safeway since leaving New England.  A pretty good experience overall.  They were celebrating a remodel and having quite a busy Saturday.\n\nI asked a very tall woman (we're talking WNBA stature) with an overlong and sparkly rhinestone belt which way to the bakery.  She decided the best thing was to escort us to the bakery.\n\nI have been escorted off the premises, I have been escorted to the restroom, I have even been \"...warned and sent, copy, over.\"  But I have never been escorted to the bakery.\n\nWe opted to pass on the croissant we came in for since they only sell them in bunches.  Instead we picked up some doughnuts and stopped at Starbucks on the way out.  The doughnuts were discounted but only if you have a Safeway card.  The clerk refused to scan a generic card or give the discount unless I could provide my info to be in the system.  Oh yea, I remember why I quit going to Safeway.  The woman behind us offered her number so that we could get the discount.\n\nSafeway remains one of the bottom dwelling grocery chains in my esteem.
