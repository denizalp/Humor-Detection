TMAR was a decent time-killer for us this past Friday morning while waiting for the shuttle bus to the First Niagara Pavilion for the Mayhem Festival. It's a nice, clean, well-kept two-floor mall with all the usual *yawn* businesses and restaurants; Eyetique, GameStop, FYE, Footlocker, American Eagle Outfitters, Dick's Sporting Goods, Spencer's, Victoria's Secret, Subway, Chik-Fil-A, and unfortunately...Auntie Anne's. She...lives!!! \n\nMalls still fail to capture my imagination, but I found no real fault with The Mall At Robinson. \n\nAnd isn't that name rather pretentious? \n\nAnd speaking of pretentiousness, who thought to name a children's clothing boutique Justice? Or to have a live DJ in another, more adult boutique? \n\nThe Buttermaid Bakery looked interesting though. It's too bad that I wasn't hungry.
