For The Love of Cake is a  little hard to find, but worth the trip.  They are becoming well known for their cupcakes, particularly their \"Man-Cakes\" (Maple Bacon, Guiness, Stout and soon Tequila, Pretzel, and Rum and Coke).  \n\nThey change their cupcake flavours everyday, and post the flavours for each day on their website and on twitter.  We had a Maple Bacon (A maple and bacon flavoured cupcake filled with blueberries and topped with a maple frosting and bacon bits) and a Salted Caramel (Chocolate cupcake filled with homemade caramel and topped with chocolate butter cream, a pinch of sea salt and a caramel chew.)   I'd been wanting to try the maple bacon for a long time, out of curiosity.  It was good but the bacon flavour is strong.  I'm glad I tried it but won't rush out for another.  The Salted Caramel was awesome though - very moist chocolate cake and a great caramel flavour.\n\nI want to go back and try all the flavours, which I'm thinking would be quite the task.   $3 per cupcake by the way though, just to warn you.
