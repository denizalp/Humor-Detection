I love, love, love Thai food. I could eat it every day and never grow tired of it. I was really excited to check this place out, although I pledge allegiance to Kung Fu Thai haha. The food was delicious but it just didn't measure up. I have yet to find somewhere that surpasses the flavor of Kung Fu Thai. The pad thai noodles were a bit on the soggy side - it felt more like spaghetti - and the chicken was a bit dry That was a disappointment because pad thai chicken is my go-to dish), but the rest of the dishes were amazing. The rice was cooked perfectly. My girlfriend loved it though and so I'm sure we will be back!
