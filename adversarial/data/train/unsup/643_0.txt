I was researching around for a cheap oil change place and my roommate recommended this place. The reviews looked great and they had discounts on yelp ($20 just by saying that you saw the deal) or facebook. They are open until 5:30 so I went there at 4:45 to get service. Since they were already booked, I said \"no problem\" and agreed to come in the morning. \n\nI drove home and when I turned my car off I discovered that my key was stuck (ignition lock switch valves were funky again). Damnit. I called Jasen (who I talked at the shop) and asked if they did that kind of repairs and if i could run back there and drop off my car. He said yes, so off I went.\n\nThey open at 7am, and by 7:30, Jasen had already called me letting me know that the issue was indeed the ignition lock switch. But here's the best part: instead of replacing the part, he told me that he could just bypass the switch in the system, thus only charging me for labor vs a new part, labor, etc. By 8:30 my car was ready: ignition issue fixed, oil change, tire rotation, etc. Total? $130.\n\nWhen I came back Jasen recognized me and was super nice. He even recommended me to someone that can do my keyless entry for me (something i've been meaning to get done for a whiiiileee now but have procrastinated). The quote his friend gave me was lower than the 10 places i researched on Yelp. Baller.\n\nI really loved the team at Ron's tire center. Super honest, incredibly nice and fast. It makes the ridiculously nuisance of getting car fixes a whole lot easier, and considerably cheaper.
