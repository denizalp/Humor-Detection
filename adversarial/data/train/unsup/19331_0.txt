This place has a new owner and new chef compared to the chef and owner of 2 years ago.  \n\nThe food is a lot better.  Less oil and softer and fresher\n\nThe service seems to have upgraded also.\n\nPlease dont let this place close down.  Or else well have to end up with shitty places like ping pang pong and orchid garden.\n\nPs they have cute waitress chics and nice little old ladies that cater to your every need. (^_^)\n\nA good dimsum place i would judge by the hakao soft outside and not too chewy.\n\nShumai is soft and does not have a lot of oil or grease but yet it is soft.\n\nGood food is when youre full, but you still want to eat; and this place cannoffer you that feeling.
