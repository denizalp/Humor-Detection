I wish I could give 10 stars. By far one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. \nThe aesthetics of the restaurant we're absolutely breathtaking. From the bar to the wood walls everything was down right stunning. \nWe sat at the sushi bar and was immediately approached by our upbeat and super happy server Joseph. \nAs first time diners we had no clue what to expect. Joseph went through the entire menu with us and gave us some of his favorites. We started with some sake and I got the Wasabi Mule. I could have used a Lil more Wasabi but it was pretty delicious! \nWe started with the \nshishito peppers with lime and sea salt and the sweet and spicy Edamame.\nWe then ordered the wagu beef and truffle sushi roll. It comes with two pieces and is slightly expensive but worth every penny. It honestly was the best item from a restaurant I've ever had. We ended up ordering the same thing numerous times because it was so good!\nWe had a few other rolls as well. the pirikara hamachi roll,\nspicy yellowtail roll with serrano pepper, avocado and wasabi mayo. Spicy tuna roll and the yellowtail sashimi with green chili relish, ponzu and pickled garlic. We ended our meal with Joseph's favorite, the spicy tenderloin. Absolute perfection!\nWe will definitely be back, I've been craving the wagu and truffle rolls since dining here! This is a must if you visit the Cosmo.
