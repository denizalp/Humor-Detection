DO NOT GIVE THESE CROOKS MONEY UNTIL YOU INSPECT YOUR VEHICLE.\n\nMy moped got stolen. Police found it, had it towed because i vouldnt pick it up in 30 minutes. Over the phone, a crabby lady (who hung up on twice) told me when i asked that the condition was \"driveable.\" I get there, stupidly trusting them, and pay. They bring me to the moped, and its literally in pieces. Wires hanging everywhere, chunks missing.\n\nCLEARLY not driveable. Dont believe the 5 star reviews. This place is operated by thieves, avoid like the plague.
