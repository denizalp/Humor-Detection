No substitutions and no reservations. How do I know this is their policy? It was written on the bus boy's shirt. Yes, I assure you it was. Now anyone who thinks they are this good better be really good, so read this review with that in mind. While I don't think I'm unfair in my review, Terroni opened the door to this level of criticism with their smug policies so all is fair. \n\nLet me say it's a brave step for a restauranteur to suggest their menu is so perfectly put together that they refuse to substitute any ingredient, so you'd better get it right. Unfortunately, Terroni doesn't, so the novelty is lost and just seems pretentious. I almost think they are trying to make customers think they are that good by saying they are that good. Almost like a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nThe wine list, where do I start... You know that one person who just tries so hard to be different it's obvious they are trying hard to be different? That person that has the phrase, \"You laugh because I'm different, I laugh because you're all the same\", hanging on their tongue so they can say it the exact moment they are criticized? Well that is Terroni's wine list. What a complete mess. I often find it difficult to order wine inthose Italian restaurants that are too Italian for their own good (thus refusing to stock French or Californian wine) but this was just awful, and when I did happen to pick one, it was nothing special at all.\n\nTo top it all off, the wait staff was less than accommodating for our large group.
