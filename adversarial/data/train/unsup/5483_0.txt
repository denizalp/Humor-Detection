We tried this place a couple weeks ago to celebrate my dad's birthday. Old crankypants didn't feel like goin' anywhere, so we brought the dinner to him.\n\nTo be honest, I have Italian food a lot, even though I'm not at all Italian, so I don't get too excited about it. \n\nHowever, I have to say that as a chain Italian restaurant, this bests The Olive Garden, and gives any other indy a run for its lire.\n\nEverything is served family style. Your choices are \"small\" and \"large.\" We ordered \"small\" for everyone which fed four people and provided leftovers for close to a week.\n\nThe Mixed Green Salad started things off and was excellently dressed in their own Italian Vinaigrette. Fresh lettuce, pepperoncinis, red onions, and olives did a circle pit in my mouth.\n\nSalads are so much better in restaurants.  I was reminded of why this is.\n\nWe also ordered...Spaghetti With Meatballs. \n\nI know, Dad's not adventurous. \n\nBut I'm thankful for that because the noodles were thick and al dente. The sauce was as good as any I've ever had. And those meatballs...\n\nBoulders of ground chuck that they are, as you cut into them, you can see...the garlic, sliced paper thin like Mario Batali does. Exquisite, moist, sticks-to-the-ribs; this is why I crave ground meat. \n\nThe Garlic Mashed Potatoes were fluffy, and lumpy, with the red skins left on. They were not the best I've ever had, but hey garlic makes everything  better, and this take on a standard was just fine. \n\nThe Chicken Marsala was sweet  and tender with fat little mushrooms and went well with the mashed potatoes, killing the canard that Italian food isn't worth a toss sans pasta.\n\nFinally we ended with the Linguine Frutti Di Mare, which Dad wouldn't touch because of the baby octopi to be found. Hey I ate 'em and relished 'em. Shrimp, mussels, baby clams, and calamari (!) make up the rest of this seafood beast feast and is topped with a red clam sauce. If you're like me and have a taste (addiction?) for underwater creatures that have armor and tenacles, this is for you. Demons of the deep dig in. \n\nI can't say Buca Di Beppo crushes what you'd have at a family-run Italian eatery, but my stomach was pretty pleased. Leave the inner snob at home and give them a try.
