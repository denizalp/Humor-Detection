I used to go to the one in North Scottsdale all the time. Have been to this one a number of times still has the same Vibe feel and fun friendly atmosphere. Great place for day drinking as well as food and evening time hanging out. Staff is always friendly attentive and there to help. If you're looking for a fun time with a Mexican Vibe check this spot out.
