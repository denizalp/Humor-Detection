HOLY SHIZNIT STOP WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING AND GO HERE IMMEDIATELY. \nMy mom, sister, and I went here on our girl's day yesterday, and I am so glad we did. The set up of the restaurant flows really nicely, with one line for entree orders and one for custard\/drinks. We decided to share an order of fries (one order is about a half pound) and I got a plain cheeseburger. The prices were average, if not a little below, which was nice. For the three of us it was about $24. \nGetting our food took a little while, but then again, we went around 1pm, and they were super busy. Beyond that, the experience was awesome. The burger was perfectly cooked and seasoned (and freaking *amazing*) and the fries were to die for.  \nOnce we were done with our food, we got frozen custard (hint: Get the junior... they are ginormous) and even that was delectable.\nAll in all, great food, great atmosphere, friendly workers, clean environment... I'll definitely be back.
