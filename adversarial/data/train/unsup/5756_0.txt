Group of us sat down to enjoy a meal at this place.  I've heard nothing but splendid reviews from close friends. \r\n\r\nImmediately after we were seated, a WT-waiter barked, \"What do you want?\"\r\n\r\n...Later in the evening, same waiter snarled, \"NO\" after being asked for a refill.  \r\n\r\nHaving to correct the narcissistic waiter's etiquette, twice... I ask for a manager... but still got inferior service, even from the meek supervisor.  Food was so-so, at best....  Libations are overpriced...   \r\n\r\nNever going back.
