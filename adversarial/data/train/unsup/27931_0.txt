I hate to write poor reviews, but wanted to share our experience.  First of all the service was way above average...which made our visit okay.  My wife and I were hungry for a burger after many thanksgiving leftovers...we chose Stack'd.  We stared with an order of wings, $10 for 10 very small wings...okay I guess you don't get wings at a burger joint.  Our burgers came...both looked good and presented well, but the meat was way over cooked (no choice of doneness) and dry.  It was like the meat was pre-cooked and held in a warmer, definitely not cooked to order.  French Fries were good, fairly fresh, but a small portion.  I had two beers, my wife had water...$46+ before tip (yes we left 20%) is a lot for what we got.  I know, we should have said something while we were there, thus not a one or two star review.  Also, something small, but the entrance steps are poorly lite and one of the steps is a little tricky.  Overall not horrible, we may try a different location.
