Now THIS is what I call being proactive. Mad props to our city for building Millennium Park for all the local skaters! \n\nSo everyone knows that skating off railings and stairs downtown can cause injury for not only the skater, but for the people in the area as well. So what did Calgary do? They built an entire park solely for skaters! You wanna skate? Skate here! \n\nThey've built the park in such a way that skaters of all skill levels can enjoy themselves. I've actually NEVER seen this park not busy. People LOVE it because it gives them the freedom to practice, and it offers them the tools they need to get better, all the while passersby wont get hurt! INGENIOUS I tell ya! \n\nI'm so proud to live in a city that caters to all different types of people, and all different types of hobbies. Yay Calgary!
