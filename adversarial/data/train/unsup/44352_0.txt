I love chipotle, and I cannot say anything negative about the food. Delicious Mexican food with delicious combinations of salsa and veggies. Food, A+.\n\nThis location: absolute utter chaos. The line servers were extremely disorganized, and they communicated everything by yelling. While in line, I heard \"WE ARE OUT OF BROWN RICE,\" \"WE ARE OUT OF SOFRITAS,\" \"WE ARE OUT OF ALL RICE.\" Now, I understand how busy a Chipotle in a college area can get. I'm used to the yelling and the hungry students who need a break from studying. But I don't think I've ever seen a chipotle location run out of food so quickly. I also didn't realize that chipotle was running a promotion (buy a sofritas burrito, get a burrito free) so I'm willing to come back on a regular weekday.\n\nConvenient location right on State, and the interior is nicely maintained and very spacious. Even with how busy it was, all the tables were pretty clean. Always a plus!\n\nI love chipotle. I love the food. I wasn't the biggest fan of this location, but I know I'll be back. Even with the disorganization and limited ingredients, my food was still delicious.
