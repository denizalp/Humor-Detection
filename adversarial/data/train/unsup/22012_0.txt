When I am too lazy to cook, this is my go to place. I have also been here for happy hour with a coworker many times. \nI like the option of sitting in the bar which is loud and smoky or in the dining room which is much more quiet and non smoking. The wait staff seems to be overwhelmed most of my visits, but they handle it with ease and the orders are taken and brought to the table within a reasonable amount of time. There are plenty of TVs to keep you entertained. The menu has a variety of comfort foods such as soups, salads, hamburgers, sandwiches, sides, alcohol, and desserts. \nI see plenty of single folks, couples, and big groups of people enjoying a meal at the Lodge- I say give this location a try if you are in the area.
