Like the Deli \n\nThis may not be my favorite Fry's Food store to shop at however,  I'm a creature of habit and this Fry's is the closest to my house.  So when I'm short on time this is the Fry's I usually find myself at.\n\nI usually can find everything that I need with no problems. The sales associates are very polite, friendly, and helpful.  The prices at Fry's are competitive in comparison with other grocery stores in the area. \n\nI like the deli section at the Fry's supermarket they serve Boars Head sandwich meats which happens to be one of my favorites.  The Deli  service can be slow at times but is worth the wait. If you ever need a six foot sub Fry's has a really nice selection to choose from and they all are delicious and reasonably priced.
