The service was fantastic, the wait staff friendly and attentive, the food (I ordered the Fettucini di Mare) was excellent. \n\nSo everything was fantastic except for one thing.\n\nWe had a party of five. We did not make a reservation for 6, six was never mentioned.\n\nDespite this, and the clear \"parties of six or more\" writing on the bottom of all menus, auto-grat was still added and there was NO indication given besides on the final receipt, not the signing copy.\n\nIt was a bush-league move from a restaurant trying to present itself as a classy, modern-Italian restaurant. \n\nThe food is good enough to almost make me reconsider coming back with another group of 5, which I believe is still less than 6.
