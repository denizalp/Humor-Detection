This is my favorite restaurant. \n\nThe staff is kind and friendly. \n\nThe lunch buffet is fresh and delicious. The best selection in Madison for Indian buffet. \n\nThe dinner menu is extensive and the owner is not afraid to make it spicy for you if you ask. I typically ask for it xxx spicy, and the server brought out deep fried Serrano peppers as an appetizer on the house. How awesome is that!\n\nEnjoy my friends, the dopest dope you've ever smoked.
