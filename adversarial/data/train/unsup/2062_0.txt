This restaurant's  little subtle southwest nuances make me love love living in the desert. I ordered a few tacos, a carne asada with just the right amout of kick, and the shrimp - which just might be one of the best little shrimp tacos I have ever had.\n\nMy friend Amanda suggested the side of local veggies - and they were simply delicious. \n\nThe mixture of people dining here was very interesting - a nice mix of professionals, hipsters who like to wear their over-sized sunglasses at all times, and families. \n\nI noticed a bit of brown duct tape was used on the ceiling to blend a pipe end to the burnt sienna surroundings. I loved that. This place is real, they serve delicious food with a simplistic style that will make this one of my favorites from now on.
