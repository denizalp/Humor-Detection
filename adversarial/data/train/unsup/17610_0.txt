I have many sick addictions I need to go into rehab for.. one is Yelp, and the other is HELLO KITTY!  Yes, I've got a huge sick addiction to the British cat born without a mouth.  \n\nI just visited this Sanrio during my most recent trip to sin city, and boy, this Sanrio even carries sin city merchandises!  Love it :)  It's got Las Vegas Hello Kitty shirts, and even Vegas themed Hello Kitty bracelets that I am now regretting the fact that I didn't shell out money to buy one :(. \n\nEven before entering the store, I immediately gravitated toward the jewelry display... and although I didn't shell out money to purchase the bracelet.. I did end up buying a Hello Kitty ring that I absolutely positively adore.\n\nAll I gotta say is, superb excellente selection of HK jewelry for all you fellow hard core Sanrio fans who would love to declare your love for HK by wearing it to show the rest of the world! (Like me).
