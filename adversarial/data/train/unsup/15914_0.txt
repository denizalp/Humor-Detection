Think Vegas Vacation. Clark Griswold is playing in the casino off the strip. Low end, small. Games like \"Pick a Number\", \"Coin Toss\", \"War\", \"Heads or Tails\", \"Guess Which Hand\" and \"Rock, Paper, Scissors\". That's the feeling at Hooter's Casino. Other casinos make you feel like you are in New York, or Paris. This one makes you feel like you are no longer on the Las Vegas strip. On the plus side, the rooms are cheap. They have a pool. Bud Lights are $2.50. Vegas on the cheap. \n\n\"Woo hoo... Big bet for a BIG man... Sure you don't want to save a few bucks for the buffet?\"
