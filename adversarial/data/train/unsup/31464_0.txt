I've never ordered a pizza from here that I haven't been happy with. That's probably in part because I only order pizza on Tuesday nights when the pizza's are $6.95 if you pickup and pay cash (extra $1 to use a credit card). \n\nThe pizzas have always been exactly what I ordered, and I appreciate that they always ask me to check my pizza while I'm at the counter to make sure that it's right. Normally I don't remember to do that until I get home and, really, at that point, I'm just going to eat it how it is. \n\nAny night other than Tuesday, and Pizza Bogo is a little too expensive for my budget. But if you're looking for gourmet pizza, this place delivers. (And has pickup!)
