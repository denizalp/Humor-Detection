Everyone is very nice here in the beginning  process of trying to get your mortgage done, but after you're done with your loan, you won't even get an answer from anyone there after they've already gotten their money. I worked with Susan Sowers when i did my loan. Last month I received a statement from Maricopa County stating that owe $600 in property taxes on my house from last year. How is this even possible when I didn't even live in the house yet. After calling a dozen people, including my original lender, Security Title, my new lending company, Maricopa county and being told a dozen different things by everyone, and not getting an answer on where the money went for this, my realtor had to get involved because no one would answer my question. After I closed on my house originally, I received a refund check and no one explained to me what the refund check was for. Apparently Security Title never took out the property taxes that the seller credited to me at closing and included it in my refund check 6 months ago. They never even had the courtesy to tell me that they made a mistake and that I still owed taxes on my house. It wasn't until i received a past due notice that I found out that they made a mistake and never took it out at closing. I will never recommend them or ever use them again. Now I have to pay $600 out of pocket because they messed up and didn't deduct it at closing and didn't even inform me of that. If anything, they should be paying for this since they're the ones that made the mistake. I wish that I could give them zero stars.
