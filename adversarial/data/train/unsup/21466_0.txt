I was thinking of selling an antique diamond ring but after going here decided to eBay it. The man told me at first it wasn't a real diamond, than he changed his mind , yes it a real diamond but told me, after checking the metal, he didn't understand why it was set in silver plated copper!!  He then offers me  $300 for it! I just had it appraised by a GIA certified appraiser who gave a retail value of $3680!!!!! The \"silver plated copper\" turned out to be platinum! I understand making a profit but not raping the client
