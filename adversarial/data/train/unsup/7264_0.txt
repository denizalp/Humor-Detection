Been coming here for over 15 years( before it was trendy) Cafe latte is 3$ tip included (it was 2$ when I first came here). \nTerasse is directly in the sun which will definitely give you cancer!\n Too many beautiful people chillin in the sun. \nI definitely don't recommend this place. \nPlease stay away! \nThis place is too crowded as it is! \nEveryone is artsy fartsy type !!!\n Don't believe the hype. \nNew poeple are not welcomed here. \nThe staff is aggresive and will probably spill salt in ur coffee....while ur distracted looking at all the hotties around. \nMy verdict is this place cant be beat but you won't like it. It's too cheap. Too chill.  Too sunny. Too friendly!!!\n\nDon't ever come here, you might like it so  much you'll be back all the time and the lineup will become even worse!
