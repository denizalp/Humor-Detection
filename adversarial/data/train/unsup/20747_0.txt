A friend was staying at Mandalay so we thought it would be the perfect opportunity to try it.  It's located in the second level Shoppes at Mandalay towards the Luxor.  \n\nTo start we all shared the Jalape単o Onion Petals.  Very tasty! At first I couldn't taste any of the jalape単o kick but after a few bites it showed up.  It's served with BBQ sauce and ranch.  There was a large amount so it was easily split with three people.  \n\nFor my meal I chose the Burger Bar Sliders.   Three cute little burgers just calling my name.  They are topped with plain bacon, cheese and grilled onions.  I used some of the leftover sauce from our appetizer as well.  Really good! Of course I had to get the sweet potato fries on the side.  They give you plenty with your meal.  I almost didn't finish them... Almost.  I enjoyed every bite.  \n\nI also had a taste of my husbands burger.  He built his own with angus, grilled onions, pepper jack cheese and jalape単o bacon.  They cooked this perfectly.  Plus the jalape単o bacon is fricken awesome! Definitely better than the plain bacon on the sliders.  \n\nService here could have been a bit better and more attentive.  Our drinks sat empty for a while until a different waitress came by.  But I did appreciate the others taking our finished plates promptly.  \n\nEven though it is pricey for burgers and drinks, i wouldn't hesitate to dine here again.  I think everything nowadays is pricey so I'll just roll with it.
