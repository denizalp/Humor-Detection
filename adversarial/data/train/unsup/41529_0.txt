Woah!  Awesome!  Fatty brisket is to die for. Nice smoke rings, great bark...about as good as it comes. You'll probably have to spend a while waiting outside, but they have water, shade, misters and samples to take care of you. Potato salad was my favorite side. Also had fantastic pork ribs and sausage. Loved it!
