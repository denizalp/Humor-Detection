Have been frequenting this location for a couple of years. And as of late, it has become my 'go to' place when meeting up with a friend who lives in Thorncliffe. \n\nThe coffee here is consistently good; I'm boring so I order a large brewed coffee to stay each time. It's not too light, but not too strong as well; I like their really big bowls that they use as well. I can't comment on the food, but it's your usual Aroma Espresso Bar items. My sister tells me that their sandwiches are pretty tasty and a friend swears by their salads. \n\nAnyway, there are a couple of perks to this location as opposed to their other shops. It's always clean here, including the washrooms and seating area. Service here is excellent; staff are really pleasant and ask me each time how my regular brewed coffee was. They're also super quick at clearing tables for the next customers or even clearing your mugs\/plates at your table. There's a lot of seating here and it's never so crowded that you have to stand around and wait until a table opens. Another point is the parking (albeit not directly related to Aroma). There's a lot of parking and you're close to Longo's and the Beer Store so you can easily kill 2, 3 birds with one stone.\n\nGood for: coffee, dates, hanging out with friend(s)
