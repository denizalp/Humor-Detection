This is one of my favorite bars in Montreal.  It's hidden away in the Place d'Armes hotel at the start of the old port, across from the Notre Dame Basilica in Montreal.  It's a fun atmosphere with a live DJ and a couple attentive bartenders.  It's a great place to start your evening, continue drinking, finish your evening or even a place to just stay at all night.\n\nThey are known for Martini's, my favorite!  They start at $10, depending on what kind of Martini you are looking for.  Their food is pretty good too.  The Kobe beef sliders are great for sharing with the table.\n\nNo need to dress up, but please, no sportswear.  Jeans are ok.\n\nAdditionally they have 5-7 specials, at least on Thursday's.  \n\nIt's a bit small, but fun nonetheless!  Highly recommended!
