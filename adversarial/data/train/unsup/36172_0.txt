After my husband heard about the great yum-yums and $$ at Great Buns, he perused their website and texted me about 7 different things he wanted to try.  Ha! Ha!\n\nWe narrowed it down to two:  pineapple upside down cake and the cherry crumb cake and I picked them up on Friday, December 7th.\n\nThe pineapple upside down cake was, I hear, a HIT at my sister's house last night (my super sweet man brought me home a piece which I'm preparing to taste after my tea is ready).  What I can tell you right now, is that it is dense, looks amazing, and unbelievably priced at $11.00 (I rounded up a few cents).\n\nThe cherry crumb cake was wonderful!  It's amazing the difference you can taste in fresh pastries.  What I love about Great Buns is their pastries aren't too sweet, and they were very generous with the cherries in this crumb cake.\n\nI also picked up some rolls for hamburgers.  Again, I love the difference you taste when you're easting fresh bread.  The rolls were fresh, large, soft but not mushy, and a good deal at $2.49 for a dozen especially considering the quality.\n\nIsn't it great we have so many scrumptious bakeries to enjoy?
