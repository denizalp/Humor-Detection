I want to give this a great review.  But I cant.  The chicken provolone melt i had tasted very off.  It could have been the provolone but I dont know.  I kept eating it though because i never complain and if you pay for something already its kinda pointless, which is I guess the main reason places make you pay for something before eating.  I asked the owners why it tasted off and they made me feel at ease.\n\nI just feel that if you are going to make a sandwitch that tastes like feet you should warn people 'oh , btw, it tastes like 3 day old feet, and for the next day you are going to be burping an old mans foot'.  I now have little red spots on my tounge, which might blister as I cant handle extreme foods, I have a mild pallette.  I did like the jalepino's, but still the taste of 'BAD FEET' is not going away.  I can eat candied jalepino's and its excellent.  So something was definitly off about the sandwitch.  I think because probobly no one comes in and buys sandwiches.  I duno.  I dont like stinky feet smelling cheese, and i dont like extremely gamey flavour in Lamb or Goat meat.\n\nMaybe they should list their panini's as \"old mans foot chicken panini\" ...\n\nI tried the elk salami and it was pretty good, nothing to complain about.\n\nThey seem like a great place and if I didnt have this bad experience, i would probobly come back again.  But All i can say is maybe if you dont like stuff smelling rotten or stinky then ask if it has a pungent odour.
