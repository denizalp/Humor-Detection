Came here for a yelp event with a friend and we loved it. \n\nI would probably come here if I had some money to throw away, but the food was appetizing, the drinks were average, and the atmosphere was great! On a scale of one to ten the food was probably around a 6, where the bites were creative but the execution was a little off. Nonetheless it was a good experience and I may try the other dishes at some point. Maybe.
