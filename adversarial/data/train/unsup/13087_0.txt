The folks at Zippy's love the Steelers like Big Mama loves The Lord. This is not just a bar and grill but a shrine of sorts. Life-sized cut-outs of various players adorn the walls and pillars.\n\nBeing that it was around 11am, the place was virtually empty, like a church on a Friday night. Now if all bars were like this all of the time, I might go to them more often. \n\nYesterday, I finally gave them a try on yet another hazardous-to-my-perfect-for-6-years-punctuality trip to work. \n\nHaving no menu to go on, I deduced that they must sell burgers. I ordered one with lettuce, tomato, onion, cheese, mayo, and a side of fries; the usual.\n\nI got there, and i wasn't ready yet! *Cue the suspenseful music*\n\nSo I went to Kribel's for a sweet treat, or two, or 6, come back, and they were still waiting on the fries. \n\nIt was back to Kribel's, since they were still boxin' up my stuff!\n\nAn old man sitting outside on a plastic chair chuckled as I ran back and forth between each business. \n\nFinally, my lunch was ready, and I devoured everything in the styrofoam container, all of which was still piping hot while curious and jealous co-workers looked on. \n\n\"Man, that ain't no Wendy's burger.\"\n\nF'n right it ain't. Great fresh bread, lots of cheese, and one  fat, fatty, patty with slovenly Primanti's style fries usually takes anything from a fast food chain into a back alley and smacks it around. Zippy's is yet another instance of this. A good, stout beef cookie Zippy's makes. \n\nNote: I didn't get a menu to take with me, but while I waited for my food, I found out that they also sell pizza, fish sandwiches, and homier fare such as pigs-in-a-blanket and stuffed banana peppers.
