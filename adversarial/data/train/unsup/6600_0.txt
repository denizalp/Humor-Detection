Best advice I can give you about Great Wall is to BYOA. \n\nYep.\n\nI said it. Bring your own Asian. \n\nThankfully our group of 10 had two. It was critical in navigating the ENORMOUS amounts of food and certainly critical in deciding which things the gringos could handle.\n\nThumbs up to postickers, egg rolls, chow mein noodles, shui mai and other various dumplings. \n\nAnd a big phew for a tutorial on how to eat fresh shrimp. \"Peel off the shell, suck out the brains and then eat the rest.\"\n\nYep. \n\nThis is where I swig down a cold Tsing Tao\n\nAnd the chickens feet. Oh for the love. The freakin' chicken feet. \"Just suck off the skin and throw the foot back on the plate.\"\n\nYep.\n\nBYOA! I'm telling ya.\n\nI had a BLAST. Carts were everywhere. Service was friendly and swift. Ten of us ate and ate and ate for $200 including tip. Oh. Also one of my Asian American diners informed me that the one man pushing the \"porridge\" cart only stops at the white people tables because the \"porridge\" is absolutely frightening to see. Sure enough. He stopped by our tables and scooted quickly by those tables full of Asians. \n\nI love a place with a sense of humor. \n\nGreat food. Great fun. Great Wall.
