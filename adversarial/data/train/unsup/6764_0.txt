When i asked for the manager with a problem a tall dark haired person came out and I'm sure i interrupted his lunch or something. He wS rude and unaccomodating and treats Blue-chip member like any other person.  This guy is in the right business cuz he sits in an office where he cant see the long lines nor can he help you with your problem. \nI have found two other agencies who can rent to me locally and monthly... Too bad cuz i LOVED thrifty!    What a loss for then
