I travel in and out of this airport routinely for business. You would think I know my way around after a handful of business trips. That's not the case- and not because I'm directionally challenged. This airport is the absolute worst airport to easily navigate. The signage is so vague and unclear. Even driving in and out to pick up or drop off is nothing short of a marathon. The layout and signage is horrible. By the time you can read the sign you are unable to change lanes to make your turn.
