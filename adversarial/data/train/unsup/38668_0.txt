What a great massage! I was really nervous by some of the reviews but screw those people. Great massage, nice people, took us in even though we were pretty late and didn't skimp on the massage at all! Thank you guys. Couple massage, my boyfriend had Lisa and Said it was the best massage he's ever had. Mine was amazing as well although I forgot my gals name:\/ thanks Sams for going above and beyond our expectations!
