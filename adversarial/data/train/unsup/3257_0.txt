If you are a knitter and live in, or are swinging through Montreal, you must check out Effiloch√©. Their selection is superb - a wide range, from the high end beautiful treats (sea silk!) to the every-day workhorse yarns of the world, but with a definite trend toward the luscious. The space is cozy and warm, with a parlor-style knitting area complete with comfy couches. When we visited, the place was filled with mothers and babies...aww.\n\nIn the back, you'll find a formidable selection of quilting fabrics and buttons (in mason jars...I love it!) and a decent choice of books (many francophone). They also have a small selection of spinning supplies toward the front. And they have a bathroom...which is very important when wandering the streets of a big city.\n\nYes, they speak English, and the staff are very friendly. When the bridal-gown stores of Rue St.-Hubert make you dizzy, come here to unwind and oogle fine yarn. It's good for you.
