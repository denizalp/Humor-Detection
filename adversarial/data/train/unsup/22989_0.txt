If you've been to one overpriced food court pizzeria you've been to them all. \n\nTony's is a newly opened pizza spot in the GVR food court and it definitely does not seek to impress. Selection is pretty standard, cheese, pepperoni, veggie and a few specialties pies. Portions are pretty big but at around $6 for a slice its pretty pricey. Add on a $3 drink and by the time you are done eating you realize you should have gone to Pizza Hut. \n\nPizza while not bad is not overly impressive. Thin crust with some tomato sauce slopped on and some generic toppings. Meh. Service was pretty friendly but certainly didn't make up for the mediocre pizza served. Nothing really to see here guys move along.
