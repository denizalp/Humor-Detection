I called to verify information about my rental car and the Gerber representative was going on and on about how the 6-day estimate they provided me is only an estimate, etc.  I stopped her and asked for an answer to my question about the rental car, which she eventually provided.  I hung up the phone call and the Gerber representative called me back mad that I hadn't said thank you at the end of the phone call and told me if I was going to act that way I should take my service elsewhere.  So if you don't mind being treated with disrespect, and even getting a phone call to tell you how rude of a person you are, then this is the shop for you.
