After 30+ years as the insurance provider for CCSD (AKA all K-12 public education employees), the 5th-largest school district in the country... we're slowly having everything good about our health insurance taken away from us. I could go on about how area teachers are being shafted, or you could just turn on the local news or crack open a newspaper.\n\nIn any case, in the 1.5 years since I've moved here, my coverage and available providers have steadily decreased while my rates have skyrocketed. For example, routine bloodwork that used to run me $20 is now billed at almost $70. Right now, the district is in negotiations and co-pays have been increased 20%.\n\nOn the topic of money, you can never reach a live representative for anything. Billing is inconsistent- you can expect to get billed for services you didn't receive, or to get multiple bills on the same day for the same procedure. Staff frequently misplace payments and documents: a coworker has sent in her $35-per-copy out of state marriage license three times now, and they just asked for a second copy of my birth certificate (without any rational explanation for why they need it in the first place). Representatives frequently threaten to drop coverage over any trivial issue, which is both illegal and unethical, and their PR team is flat-out lying when interviewed about the changes by the local media.\n\nFor a district that includes insurance coverage as part of the salary package (an appreciated perk) to help assuage the fact that the salary is frozen and hasn't seen a raise since man walked on the moon, you'd think they'd at least manage to keep ONE employment benefit functional. Apparently not. If you can't take care of your teachers, they won't be able to take care of their students.
