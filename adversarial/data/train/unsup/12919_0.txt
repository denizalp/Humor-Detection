Not bad!!!\n\nI had tried this place years ago when we had a Vegan Eatz\/V Animal Sanctuary dinner and.......I was not impressed.\n\nHubs and I were craving refried beans, some table side guac...the works.\n\nThe table side guac was yummy, I kinda wish I would have asked for more cilantro and some jalapeños (we were afraid it would be too spicy. But know we know. \nJust speak up and ask for it exactly the way you want it.\n\nHubs got the vegan burritos they had grilled and sautéed veggies, beans with optional red sauce on top. It came with a side of refried beans. I tried it and it was very yum.\n\nI wanted to FINALLY try a tamale. I'm not sure if I have really ever eaten a tamale? I'm not a fan of ground mushy maize. (It tastes like a wet dog smells to me for some reason.) \nWell, this didn't. And it was vegan. It was full of mushrooms and garlic. You can choose either red or green sauce to go on top. It was yum. And big! One was filling to me. I got a side \"salad\" of tomatoes lettuce and onion with cilantro vinaigrette and it was too much food for me.\n\nI really like their bean dip, salsa and chips! I can really put a hurtin' on them.\n\nKeep in mind this is NOT health food and probably contains more oil than one should eat in a year total, but it's good Americanize Mex!!!!!
