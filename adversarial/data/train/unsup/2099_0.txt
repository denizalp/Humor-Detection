Want a drink that has more caffeine than coffee while also improving mental clarity, boosting your metabolism, and lowering your blood pressure? Reach for matcha! \n\nI don't eat ice cream much. I'm lactose-intolerant and even with Lactaid, I ain't trying to mess with the Dairy-Gods. You will lose 8 out of 10 time if you try to tango with the Dairy-Gods and at the end, the toilet will be the only thing getting any ass afterwards. So if I'm gonna test my luck, it better be with something special. Since I'm a matcha-manic and I can't stop thinking about matcha, which is an inconvenience to me since there are no matcha specialty places in Arizona yet, this place fit the bill. So after a less-than-satisfying lunch, my friends indulged me and we went to Chamon Matcha Salon for some dessert! \n\nI ordered the Chamon Sundae with matcha soft serve, a Mini Matcha Jewels, and a Royal Caramel Milk Hojicha. The matcha soft serve was delicious. I also loved the matcha jelly. The mochi in the Matcha Jewels was very neutral in flavor and provided a nice chewy texture. I really enjoyed the Royal Caramel Milk Hojicha as well. It had a nice rich flavor from the caramel without it being overly sweet. You can still taste the roasted tea flavor in the hojicha.\n\nAll in all, it was a pretty good place for a matcha-holic like me! Then again, I do come from a city with no matcha specialty places so what do I know?  :P
