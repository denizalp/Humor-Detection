What a superb experience. We are staying at the Hermosa Inn and after a long day of travel decided to stay on property and have dinner at Lon's. From the moment we walked in we were provided with superb hospitality. From the host at the front door, to the server, all the way to the bussers.... Nothing but smiles and exceptional courteousness. \nOnto the food..... Our server Kenny, had wonderful recommendations. We had a wood oven smoked pork chop and I had Halibut. So delicious! \nOh and most everything is locally sourced... Super fresh and delicious!\nI would definitely recommend this restaurant, and the next time we are in Phoenix, we will be back!\nThank you to everyone at Hermosa Inn and Lon's!\nChristina Pumo & Daniel Kenny
