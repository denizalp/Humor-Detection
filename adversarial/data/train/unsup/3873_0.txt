Of all the Grand Cafes on Stations properties, this is my favorite.  My favorite seat in the house happens to be outside, the round table nearest the pool area.  Last time we went here, they allowed us to sit outside even though no one was out there and still gave us decent service.\n\nYou can't expect some top notch menu but the food is still decent.
