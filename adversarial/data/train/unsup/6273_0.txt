2.5 -3 Have had dinner here a few times and it's ok. I can honestly say... this place only makes an effort if ur a regular. Especially if they know u will bring in ppl... \n\nBefore they renovated i was disgusted w\/ the washroom as there were literally streak marks on the bathroom floor. Yes how the hell did it get there? How can you miss? I have absolutely no clue. Anyhow...\n\nreally enjoyed the fried rice last night, soup was tasty (water fish), lobster was good and abalone was tender. No complaints. Service was prompt & they were polite.\n\nThere are def. way better Chinese restaurants out there. This place is supposedly very frugal if you want dim sum but my mom refuses to go here...hmmm
