My wife and I are \"Taco Enthusiasts\" and this place has delicious food. I always go for the \"cabeza\" (head), and \"tripas\" (tripes) tacos everywhere we've visited and didn't disappoint At all. If you're looking for a top notch customer service, I think you should simply stay away since I strongly believe these kind of restaurants are still in business because of the delicious food they serve not the service itself. Although, the ladies I interacted with were rather nice, actually!
