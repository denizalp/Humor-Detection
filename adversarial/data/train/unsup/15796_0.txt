I have discovered the secret of time travel, and it is as simple as stepping into Champagne's Cafe in Las Vegas.  If the twenty-first century is too much for you, and you want to go back to the questionable decor and low prices of the late '60s, then boy, is this the place for you.\n\nOnce your eyes adjust to the almost-complete darkness inside, you'll notice a handful of red vinyl booths that nicely offset the red flocked-velvet wallpaper, which must be caressed to be believed.  The owners aren't much on decorating, but they will occasionally put up, say, a string of Xmas lights or some ornaments (then neglect to take them down for a few months into the new year).\n\nPlace your orders with the taciturn bartender, but be prepared to go, \"Did you get *all* of these?\" when he tells you how low the total is.  Yes, the drinks really are that cheap - and they're pretty good, too.  But be warned, something about the tawdry dive-boudoir feel of the place will make you want to order things like Manhattans or gin slings.\n\nWith all the money you've saved on drinks, you can plug a couple of bucks into the nothing-after-1980 jukebox, or you can feed quarters to the pistachio-nut vending machine and earn dirty looks from the bartender as you fill your table's ashtray with pistachio shells.  Sometimes there's karaoke, which is fairly terrifying in its awfulness, but much more tolerable after a few Bloody Marys.\n\nWhen you stumble back out onto the pavement (parking is in the back), you may be surprised to find that your hair isn't in a beehive, and you're not wearing a sport jacket or carrying a cigarette holder.  But whenever you need to stage another escape from the present day, Champagne's kicky retro martini sign will be lit up and waiting for you.
