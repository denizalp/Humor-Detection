I have been going to this salon for 3 or 4 years. Not only is it super convenient for me because it is down the street from my house the service here is impeccable. Cathy Messer is a great hair dresse! She gives the best hair cuts and is a perfectionist.  Nicole Artino does my nails and does an amazing job and is great to talk to. I receive compliments on my hair and nails often. Everyone here takes pride in what they do and the atmosphere is extremely inviting.
