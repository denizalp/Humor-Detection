open 24\/7... come here on the off hours... so you don't wait in a que.\nI come here after work in the wee early mornings and there's no line.\nOn my last visit last week... I had to wait almost an hr for my pan roast! How crazy is that?!  It wasn't bus either... I'm not to sure what the deal was... but I was hungry and tired... not a good time to wait that long for food! That's my reason for the minus one star... always kinda pricey... but you're eating seafood!\nOtherwise... this is a hidden gem inside of the PS. \nPAN ROAST... I LOVE YOU!!! mmm... comfort food at its best!
