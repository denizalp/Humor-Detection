Mmmmmm Octagon has GREAT steak!! If you want a steak house that has food on par with Ruth's Chris, Keg, Morton's, etc. but you don't want to drive downtown, Octagon is a great choice.  The decor is dark wood old-world Italian and maybe even a little gaudy for my taste, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with it. The service is excellent and attentive, and most importantly, the steak is always done perfectly. Plus how cool is it that the building is octagon shaped?!\n\nI was there last friday on a whim and it wasn't full so my group of six was seated immediately, but during summer I've also tried to get in without a reservation on a friday night and been turned away because there was a two hour wait.  Last time I was there, I had the filet mignon, and it was cooked perfectly, and was so tender the meat literally melted in my mouth.\n\nFor dessert, try the strawberries with Grand Marnier sauce - the sauce is delicious!!\n\nThere is a sign outside the door that states their dress code, which is something like business casual, but some of my group was wearing sneakers and t-shirts (not me!! hehe) and they still let us in without even blinking an eye, but I did feel a little underdressed.
