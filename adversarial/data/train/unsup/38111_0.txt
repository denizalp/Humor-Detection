First off, food was decent.  So if I were around the area and was craving some Indian cuisine, I may consider going again.\n\nBut, our server totally ruined our experience.\n\nI went with two of my friends.  We were asking our server some questions about different dishes.  When we asked our server how big a dish was (we were trying to decide whether to order three or four different dishes), he made it sound like it was so little that it would be small for even one person.  He thought that we were going to order just one dish to share.  Once he realized that we were ordering multiple dishes, then and only then he gestured that the dish was bigger than what he had initially told us.\n\nWhen the food started coming out, we looked at each other incredulous because that particular dish we asked our server about was so big that two people could have eaten it and left the restaurant full.  It wasn't that we didn't want to order more dishes, we were just amazed how the server tried to manipulate his answer so that he would get us to order more.  Moreover, once the food came, the server never even bothered to come to our table again.  We left the restaurant shaking our heads.
