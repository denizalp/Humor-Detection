Wow, the crew working at this location are running like a well tuned machine cranking out those orders continously to serve GO train commuters. It seems like this location gets a rush of customers each time a GO trains pulls into Union Station during the morning rush hour. Service has to be super fast in order to keep up with the line up of customers. It took less than 5 minutes to get my coffee and BLT bagel after ordering from the self serve kiosk. Everything was up to McDonald's usual high standards for food and service.\n\nRemember that this is a McCafe location not a full service McDonalds location so you won't be able to order everything like you normally can.
