The event itself and the instructor were awesome and it ended up being a great night. However, there were 6 of us that bought the groupon and none of ours worked. We had to all email and have them fixed through paint nite. One person didn't get to register in time before it sold out. Luckily they still let her paint when we showed up and they gave us coupons to get the same rate by booking directly through them next time.
