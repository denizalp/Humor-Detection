This place is ass... \n\nSome friends of mine were coming into town to see a specific DJ so I decided to meet them. If I had known what Axis Radius was like I would have stayed home. \n\nThis place must have rocked 15 years ago but now it just seems kind of sad. I'd describe the atmosphere but to be honest there wasn't any. If despair is a theme then Axis Radius nails it. \n\nThe crowd was an awkward hodgepodge of drunks, out to pasture party boys and desperate women. \n\nThe drinks were pricey but strong and the go-go dancers were definitely easy on the eyes, hence the two star rating. \n\nMaybe it's my fault for going. It could be that I'm not the right sort of person to go to Axis Radius. If so, I'm totally ok with that.
