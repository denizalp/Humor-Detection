I have tried two technicians at the Dupont clinic (Ava & Marilou) and both technicians gave excuses why they couldn't complete the procedures I paid for, even though I have had no problems at other spas\/ doctors offices. Marilou was very rude about my skin (told me my skin was dull) and tried to make me feel bad that I didn't want to buy chemical peels. Bad experience, not at all worth the money.
