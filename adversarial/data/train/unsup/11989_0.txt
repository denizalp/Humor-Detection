Accepted here as freshman but didn't attend because got offers to UCSD and UCD. Applied and accepted here as a transfer again because I like the pace of the semester system better. The campus is perfect: perfect location, awesome campus, great science program. Everything here is way way better than my home institution expect for one thing: it is effing cold in the winter! Being from Cali I cannot bear the Arctic climate so I withdrew the transfer housing deposit and stayed in UCD for the remainder of my undergraduate career. Too bad I won't have a story to tell my grandkids on how I made it through the Polar Vortex alive. True story!
