Never felt so discriminated in my 25 years in Arizona. The security guard did not allow me and my friend in because we were wearing Jordan shoes and because according to him \"we were too fresh\" but people in line next to us were wearing flip-flops and they were allowed in. Choose your wardrobe carefully when considering this establishment.
