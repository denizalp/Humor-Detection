Not a bad buffet but not a great one either. The food mostly seemed mediocre.\n\nRoast beef carving station had no horseradish at all. The Chinese food was limited to beef broccoli and pepper steak. Their wonton soup was also fairly tasteless.\n\nThe buffet does offer free beer (Bud Light and Goose Island, at the time of the visit) and wine.\n\nThe soda machines are the new 100+ variety types.\n\nThe fish station had your garden variety of crab legs and one type of fish, which tasted like it'd been left out for a good while.\n\nWhich, in the end, left me with that meh feeling, in terms of satisfaction.\n\nSmall end note... For those in AAA, we were given a 20% AAA discount. Every little bit helps.
