Well-oiled machine my foot. I asked for a referral and the referral department has yet to call me. It has now been three weeks. Also, the billing department attempted to double charge me for my copay amount. Who can afford to take off work for 3 hours for an annual physical, then have to take off another hour two weeks later for the results? Ridiculous. Most importantly, Dr. Irene Delorenzi has some serious likeability issues. Rather cold bedside manner and a condescending nature. Ridiculous. Time to switch PCPs...again. Thanks for the runaround, WFP.
