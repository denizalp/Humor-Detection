Let me start my review by saying that I'm a rather picky person when it comes to hair stylists.  I'm particular when it comes to attention to detail.  A good trim is pretty hard to find, but not anymore.  \n\nJESSICA is the real deal.  She is sweet, professional, and is all about attention to detail.  She gave me the best shampoo job that I think I've ever had.  It was more of a head massage really.  It was a struggle not to fall into a deep hypnotic slumber as she massaged my temples.  I couldn've sworn I was going to have to pay extra for that kind of attention, but turns out, that's just how she works.  What a star!\n\nThe other great thing I loved about this salon were the store hours.  They are open later than most (till 8pm, during the week), which is perfect for me.  \n\nLooking forward to trying out more of what they offer in the future.
