I found Shannon on yelp several months ago and I've been seeing her ever since! It had been a long time since I'd attempted a Brazilian wax (which did not go over so well at another place). I was nervous but Shannon was so cool and easy to talk that the nervousness soon went away and before I knew it I was on the table without my pants haha! She explained the whole process and we got to talking as if we were old friends..she made the whole process much more comfortable. She uses hard wax which I love because I'm normally red forever with the other stuff in those nail salons. I see her for all my waxing needs now and her prices are great! I always enjoy my appointments with her and in fact she got me to wax a new spot that I'm obsessed with now..the inside of my nose! It might sound odd but as a Hispanic and Italian girl I have an obnoxious amount of hair in places I don't want. If you like good conversation and need some waxing done..go see Shannon!
