Got home from work yesterday and found the A\/C had stopped working.  New home- 2 years old - Chas Roberts units from the builder.  Called Chas Roberts before 5PM and was told someone from scheduling would call me back within an hour.  No call.  I called 3 more times last night and got the same line of BS each time.  Called again at 5:30 AM and was told someone would be in the office by 6:30 and they would call me back as soon as they got in.  Yeah right.  At 7:30 still no call so I called again.  Spoke to Olivia and she was able to get me on the schedule today between 9-12.  But, she started laughing while on the phone with me as she was reading the notes from my previous 5 calls - is something funny about not having A\/C in AZ in August???  I typically have a good sense of humor, but I guess just not today.  For someone that answers phones to provide customer service she lacked empathy.  Most likely because she has to deal with the brunt of these issues everyday that have not been addressed by the management team. \n\nI would not have called these people but the unit is under warranty.  I did find it strange that they asked if it was under warranty when I called - like that should make a difference, but I guess it does when prioritizing who gets service based on how much money they can make on you.  \n\nTerrible business practices.  This may not be the last they hear from me depending on how my service appointment goes later this morning.  The Better Business Bureau might be hearing from me too.
