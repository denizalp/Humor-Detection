This restaurant is all about having fun and enjoying the food! \n\nOnce in a while you have a business that truly takes pride in building their business clientele and therefore values honest feedback. I had a terrible visit in July when the chef of this Eastern Cheeburger Cheeburger couldn't get my hamburger temperature correct and my family didn't get shakes made to their specifications. The owner read my comments, apologized about my experience, made some changes, then invited me back. \n\nMy teenage boys had the 1-pounder burger loaded with their choice toppings. I had the 3\/4 pounder Delirious Burger with my choice toppings. The hamburgers were really good, and the temperatures were perfect. One of my boys finished the 1-pounder and had his picture taken for the \"Repeat Offenders\" board that highlights the few who have eaten the entire burger more than once.\n\nWe shared the loaded fries with cheese, chili, and jalape√±os. They were delicious. The boys had the Shake-a-Soda with their meal. It is a syrup that is put into carbonated water to make a carbonated beverage drink. You can mix and match flavors and they are unlimited. I think my boys had 5 of them each! I wasn't crazy about it when I tasted them, but I can see why kids like them.\n\nWhen we were done, we each had a shake. I had the blueberry cheesecake. This was super good. All the shakes were great! The food was great! The restaurant was clean and the staff was pleasant. Thank you Monica and Alex for demonstrating excellent customer service skills.
