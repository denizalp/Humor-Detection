All-suite my bootie!  These are NOT suites, cover your ears and run quickly with your wallets in tow!  I thought this would be a hip alternative to Hard Rock and the Palms, but it's definitely NOT happening, I'd rather stay at MGM or even NY NY.  It was not even close enough to WALK to the Palms when my feet were throbbing.  Stay elsewhere...
