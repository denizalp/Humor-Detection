Hands down the best Steakhouse i've ever eaten at.  Oysters Rockefeller is to die for.  24oz Ribeye is the way to go.  From top to bottom the staff and service is second to none.   One time I dined there and my wife's steak was under cooked, the levels the manager went to, to compensate was far above what we could've ever expected.  Every time I am in Vegas you can be sure i'll be dining at N9NE!
