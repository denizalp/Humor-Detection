Food is okay, nothing special, around $7 for a pita is too expensive when they give you little to no meat at all. They give you very little at the veggie bar too. \n\nI picked chicken with spinach, cucumber and a Tzatziki sauce. The girl gave me a small little handful of spinach and a tablespoon of diced cucumber, doesn't even fill up half of the pita. I left still feeling hungry. \n\nA similar place that serve pita as well, cost me $8, comes with a skewer of grilled chicken breast, side salad and pita with Txatziki sauce. With an additional $2.50 for a combo, it comes with fried or rice and a drink. Food was super yummy at this other place. \n\nPita pit cost $9+ for a meal that comes with a pita and a drink. The food is so so and not good quality.
