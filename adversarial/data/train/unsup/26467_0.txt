Stay away from this place. First we found Mosquitos in a drink but we figured its an open air restaurant so fine we decided to stay. Big mistake. More bugs in food and then a finger nail in our daughters burrito. When we complained the manager had the nerve to say 'I'm not entirely sure that nail is from us'. My daughter had blue nail polish. If it was hers we would have known. Horrible way to treat customers. I can deal with things and people making mistakes but hate lack of accountability and the nerve to blame the customer. Never going here again!
