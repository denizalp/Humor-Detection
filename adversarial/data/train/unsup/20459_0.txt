Good place to have a decent afternoon meal.  I'd like to take a stab at their breakfast the next time I drop by.  Service here rocks!\n\nAs for the food, can't really complain about their...\n~Complimentary bread (especially the carrot kind)\n~Zucchini parmesan\n~Grilled garlic sourdough baguette\n~Crispy chicken salad \n~Spinach and artichoke dip\n~Banana chocolate muffin\n~Buttermilk spice muffin\n~Clam chowder (maybe I should've ordered the cup, because the bowl was pretty big)\n\nBut what's up with that rotten egg smell in some parts of the dining room?
