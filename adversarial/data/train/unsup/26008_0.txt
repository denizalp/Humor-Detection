Southpark mall is a great place to shop. The place is massive with two floors to shop. Their are some some rare shops like Earthbound trading company, BAM, and it also has a movie theater along with your more common mall shops like Abercrombie and American Eagle. They even have a Brookstore selling their 4,000 dollar chairs. The place is clean.\n\n The restaurants are your typical stir fry spots and i question the logic of putting a Panera beard in the mall when their is already another Panera beard across the street of the mall. But Houlihans looks like a niffy place to check out. At times you will be annoyed by people wanting you to do a survey or try a stupid product but the genius of a two story mall means you can easily escape their haggling.
