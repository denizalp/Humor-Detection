What a train wreck!!!\n\nWe received a comped table and comped bottle for Thursday night. When the she came with the bottle she said it was an \"automatic $40 service charge\". I didn't mind paying for it, just wanted a bill for everything I was paying for. She told me that they don't ever give bills for comped tables. I refused to pay. She said she would get me a bill. She comes back almost an hour later with a REPRINTED receipt from a different group. Scammed for a tip once. \n\nLeft our table and went to get a hookah at the outside hookah area and the scams just continued. Our coal burnt out after 15 minutes and I asked for another coal or if she could adjust it. She said that it would be 1 coal per hookah all night. I looked at her and said we both know that's ridiculous. She then said \"if you tip me, I'll fix it\". Ended up tipping her $10 and had to continually ask her for refills and for her to fix the coal. Scammed for a tip twice. \n\nMy sister went to the car to go her sweater because it was cold. Didn't want to stay inside and partake in the Latin Night so we were outside. Not once did the bouncer tell us that he wasn't allowing re-entry as we waited for her by the door. Not once did he tell her that he wasn't allowing re-entry as he flirted with her when she was leaving to the car. But right as she came back he said \"no re-entry. You can tip me and I'll let you back in but $5 isn't gonna cut it!\" Wow. This was definitely a sign for us to leave. \n\nBlue Martini must be doing really poorly for every single employee to have to scam people for tips all night long.
