I was concerned about working in Ohio for 3 weeks....mainly because I assumed there wasn't any good asian food here.  Haha.  My friend that lives out here told me about Siam Cafe and how great it is.  \n\nI had to make the venture out to the GHETTO of eastside cleveland and check this place out.  Holy crap, every asian person in Ohio was eating at Siam when I arrived.  The place was packed on a Sunday night.  That's always a good sign.\n\nThe food was delicious!  The menu is extensive and a bit confusing at first because they have a lot of Chinese dishes and then you see Pad Thai and Tom Yum Soup.  I've never been to a restaurant with a mix of Chinese, Vietnamese and Thai food.  But, let me tell you what I ordered:\n\n* Seafood, Tofu and Vegetable Soup.  So comforting & delicious!\n* Chef's special, Live Flounder Fish Fried.   Comes out with a sweet black sauce that you pour over it.  It was perfectly cooked and had the right amount of seasoning.\n* Pad Thai was pretty stinking good and I've had a lot of pad thai!\n* Honey Walnut Shrimp.  These shrimps were a good size.  Juicy.  \n* Mango Bubble Tea.  Wish I got an extra order of this to go as a roadie.\n\nI would definitely recommend Siam Cafe if you're in the Cleveland area.  You won't be disappointed!
