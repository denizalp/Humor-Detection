After a good work out why not go down the street and grab a bite. It was a Saturday around 11 and it was packed. Can't be upset about that tho, it's a breakfast place, it should be that way. We were seated in a tiny table in the corner waited for 10-15 before they came over and took our order. The waitress we had wasn't very knowledgeable about the menu. I knew that egg and I had booze just didn't know how much, after asking I was only shown half the menu and didn't find out til after my meal they had butterscotch schnapps. I order the huevos rancheros and didn't get any salsa. It usually comes with it so I just used the kind that was on the table.. Also was never asked if I wanted a refill on my milk or if I wanted anything else to drink. My friend order the cheese omelet and was pretty satisfied, just should have all the reviews first. She wanted to get the corn need hash but only likes canned, which they have but the waitress told us they didn't.. Maybe the gal was new but why not ask the chef or something. Just wasn't the best experience.
