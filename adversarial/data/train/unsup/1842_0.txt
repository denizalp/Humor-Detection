Mon Ami gabi has been on my bucket list for a really long time, being one of the most yelp reviewed restaurant in Vegas. I finally had the opportunity to visit this place a short while ago, and suffice to say, I believe that this place serves good food at decent prices, keeping in mind that it is the strip. \n\nI think the reason why this restaurant gets reviewed so much is because of the view. It's the perfect spot to watch the Bellagio water fountain show. And I think that compared to a lot of restaurants on the strip, the prices aren't too unreasonable. They also seem to have a pretty organized and consistent system in place.\n\nFirst, I needed a little drink to quench my thirst. They have a pretty extensive cocktail, beer, and wine list. Since I was in a French bistro, I wanted a French beer. I ordered something called Castellane, it was pretty good. It looked like there was fresh orange in the beer.\n\nOnto my entr√©e. I've been dying to try the steak frites here at Mon Ami Gabi. I've heard so many reviews about it, so I had to try it. I ordered the one with the bordelaise sauce. I thought the meat was good, and I really like the sauce, it had a nice kick from the black pepper. I liked the frites. They weren't ordinary frites, they were like super thin french fries, and they tasted pretty fresh. I thought it was good.\n\nEven though this is a very busy restaurant, the service was pretty good. If my server was busy with other tables, I could ask another server or busser for anything, and they would help. Plus, if you're sitting outdoors, the view is very hard to beat.\n\nOverall, it's a pretty decent place. I would take some out-of-towners here. It's also a nice place to watch the Bellagio fountains if you're sitting outside. I would also recommend getting a reservation, because this place is really busy.
