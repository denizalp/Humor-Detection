Well, I really wanted to give this place a try after seeing him the last few weeks at the ASU food truck party. I asked for a pineapple mango smoothie with strawberries instead of bananas. The guy told me he couldn't do that because everything was prebagged. I asked if he had any other smoothies without bananas and he told me no because he really loves bananas. I understand having everything premade for efficiency but sorry dude, not everyone shares the same passion for bananas as you do. Maybe if you had a little flexibility on your menu you wouldn't have lost a customer.
