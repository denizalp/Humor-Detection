This is the best place in the valley for pet supplies! Ryan's actually has a catalog and ships all over and this is their warehouse where they actually let the public come in and shop. \n\nThey have everything from chew toys to shampoo. They are crazy inexpensive and the quality of their products is great. I needed a 700 Series (aka massive!) crate for my Doberman and I was amazed at what a great deal I got. Petsmart and the usual places charge 3-4 times what things cost at Ryan's! \n\nI always leave there with more than I expected to buy and it always costs less than I expected to spend. They're not open weekends so check their hours and plan accordingly.  It's definitely worth it.
