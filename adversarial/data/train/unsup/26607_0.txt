Used EZ rental car even after reading all the reviews.  Every rental car place at McCarran had bad reviews so I figured why not grit my teeth and go with the cheapest.  Booked a full size for 4 nights unlimited mileage arriving Tuesday leaving Saturday.  Very short line at facility, came with proof of insurance from my insurance, declined all additional coverage.  They confirmed my rate of $135 for those four nights.  Car was not brand new but not terrible.  Both pick up and return went very smooth.  Would rent again, just come to the place informed and prepared.
