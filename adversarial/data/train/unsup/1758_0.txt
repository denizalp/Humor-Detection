Found a pair of jeans in the sale rack marked $3. I go to purchase and am told that they made a mistake, \"oh this is a return from another store. We can't sell them at that price. The sale price is only at that store. If you would like to purchase them it will be $59\" So I ask, \"Is this a mistake by your employee?\" \n\"Yes. The sale is at the other store.\"\n\"Well what can you do for me since this is your mistake?\"\n\"I can sell it to you for the regular price.\"\n\nNeedless to say, I didn't buy the jeans. The funny thing is that they are currently running a $20 off all jeans sale, but the signs must have been for another store!
