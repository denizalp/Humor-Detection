I went for the all-you-can-eat lunch sushi last week after much deliberation on which sushi lunch buffet I should try.  We were the first ones seated for lunch on a Friday and quickly chose our rolls.  Unfortunately, that was the last quickly that I can write.  We ended up ordering two times and we barely got out of there in an hour.  Not sure what happened with that..\n\nSo the sushi, it started out decent.  Spicy Tuna, Tuna Avocado, California, Crunch California... but the second time around, it started to be more evident that this was AYCE sushi lunch & not quality sushi.\n\nI really liked the ambiance of Umai and maybe I'll come back and try something for dinner - or a lunch bento box, but I think that may be my last all you can eat sushi lunch.
