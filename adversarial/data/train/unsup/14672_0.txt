Like many others, I was apprehensive on entering this place. Upon entering, we were pleasantly surprised. The d√©cor has a cozy feel, and there are TVs galore!\n\nWe visited the place around 1am, and when 230am hit, the crowd picked up (we were told by the bartender that 230am becomes one of their busier times). \n\nWe visited the place with a 'regular' patron, and we sat for a few hours, watching him try his luck on one of the machines at the bar. The bartender (I want to say his name is Cory) was friendly and quick to fill our needs. \n\nWhile there, the regular patron we were with told us his experiences of the supernatural kind. Apparently, shady things have gone down in the place, and there may or may not be permanent residents not of this world, who haunt the spot and are apt to take down photos hanging on the walls. I also may or may not have had my husband stand at the door when I went to the ladies room, because I am a big chicken. Good news-I survived without a supernatural scare. \n\nThis place has been around a long time, which makes for fun conversation. \n\nDrink prices were standard, and my mixed drinks were made just how I like it. The other people I were with are beer guys, no surprises there.\n\nNow that we know the vibe, we will definitely be visiting this spot again.
