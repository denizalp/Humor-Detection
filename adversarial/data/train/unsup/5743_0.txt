came here for breakfast on sunday. we both ordered from the section of the the menu called fitness bootcamp. i ordered the the healthy choice omelet: an egg white omelet with fat free turkey pastrami, diced tomato, peppers, onions, and lite swiss and mr h ordered the fitness omelet: egg white omelet with diced turkey, spinach, mushrooms, green chiles, and tomato, topped with fresh parmesan cheese. we agreed both were good omelette's. i selected fruit for my side and it did not taste fresh.  i will skip the fruit and go with the home potatoes or cottage cheese next time.  the home potatoes looked so delish. for now i will give them 3 stars because they are kinda pricey for solid average breakfast entree's.  I'll bump them up after i have other items on the menu.
