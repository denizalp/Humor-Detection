I came here for dessert only on a weekday night. When you walk in, the style of Moji is very interesting - a mix of wood and plastic chairs and tables with walls of different styles on each wall. There's not exactly one set design, but multiple combined. There are cut napkins on the side, and when you get the bill, they come in metal buckets! Pretty interesting! For your order, you are given a sheet of paper to write the Letter and Number of your order.\n\nDrinks are $2 with a meal, but on it's own, they are $3.80 to $4 each. I came in to try the ice cream. Make sure you ask what the Special is - it looks like Taro, but my friend who came here before said the Special was blueberry. I ordered D4 (twist), which was taro and Matcha ice cream with tapioca and popping pearls located underneath. My friend ordered D1, which was the ice cream float and it came with the marble sodas!\n\nThe ice cream itself was average, though I prefer this over a menchies or yogurtys as the price of my order will be double the cost!
