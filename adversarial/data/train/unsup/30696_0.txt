I was underwhelmed with Milos prix fixed lunch menu. I nearly walked out when I saw they were trying to pawn off farmed Atlantic salmon as organic salmon. It's not USDA certified organic so this is false advertising. When I asked the waiter what made it organic, he said it's grown in the wild (duh, all farmed salmon are kept in enclosures in the wild - which is one of the reasons why it's so bad). I was also skeptical of their grain fed chicken - um, most chickens are fed grain so how is this chicken different? The waiter said it was because they aren't fed corn. Um, corn is a grain, too, buddy. I was offended by the chef's attempt to make their menu sound more environmentally friendly and are actually trying to make Atlantic farmed salmon seem like a delicacy. \n\nMenu labels and the waiter who obviously wasn't well versed in their offerings, the actual food we ordered was underwhelming. I had the lamb chop and fries, which were too salty and soggy. The lamb chop was really tough. Friends ordered the bass and it as caked in oil and didn't take to the grill well. \n\nOverall: overhyped and pretentious.
