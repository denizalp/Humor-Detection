It be-HOOVES you to try the 2nd floor mezzanine at Dark Horse. There is various seatings up there to accomodate the myriad moods of hip Torontonians. Kitchen style chairs, leather seats at coffee tables, easy chairs, and tables in both circle and square.\n\nI didn't mention last this time: there is free wi-fi. You just need to get a password sent to your phone via SMS every hour or so. No biggie.
