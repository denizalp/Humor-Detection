UPDATE- ITS \"LOBSTER\" NOT LOBSTER!!!!!!\n\nRemember in my review I said I found a long leg? Yeah, it wasn't a deformed one and it bothered me. Yeah I know this was a review months ago but I HAD TO figure it out as little shit bothers me. I'm very sad to know they did the switcharoo on us and giving us the cheaper stuff. \n\nYeah looked at lobster fishing laws and yeah, I was right about them not being able to harvest lobsters of a certain size so it got me delving further......and so did more research and the lobsters they serve here are NOT the usual \"true\"(american or spiny) lobster that we all are thinking of (they used to but not anymore). Look at the pale color and the fact that the flat shaped heads or legs are no where to be found which gives it away as a faux lobster or another suspicion is that it is flown in already \"prepped\" and possibly fresh frozen since the tails all had different consistencies- one okay one, one dry, on mushy, one chewy...wtf and then I stopped after that.\n\n  Its a SQUAT LOBSTER.....a Squat is also called a \"langostino\". It normally is used in very heavy \"yum yum\" sauced sushi rolls and as a base to make soups and minced meat seafood products and are rarely used in pure tail form as its flavor and consistency is not as great as it's cousins. I also asked a fisherman who said I was correct in my research. \n\nJust thought to put that FYI out there incase people were psyched about All you can eat American\/Spiny Lobsters. It's kinda a lobster still, but miles different. \n\nIt's like the difference between getting KRAB and real Crab.
