Believe the hype.\n\nInitially I couldn't believe it either. Then I walked in, sat down, bit into a fatty smoked meat sandwich, experienced extreme happiness (not as ostentatious as Meg Ryan in When Harry Met Sally) and sheepishly grinned. I bit my fingers and demanded another. The pickle and cole slaw were perfect complements. Sadly the black cherry soda didn't enhance the meal. The fries were overkill but were good for sharing.\n\nThe smoked meat sandwiches are superior to the sandwiches at infamous NY delis, such as Katz's, 2nd Ave and Carnegie. Yes I said it.\n\nWhen I return, please have a medium and fatty sandwich ready for me. If the line is too long, I'll just order a pound to go.\n\nIFHTP 2
