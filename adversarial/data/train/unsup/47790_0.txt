Food was.... o.k.   Server was AMAZING. But the other servers were REALLY loud and running around like teenagers... Then some kid in a wife-beater came in, he kinda looked like a gang banger, he was talking to the staff and making it really obvious he worked there. I'm not an idiot and I know the people that cook that work at restaraunts aren't exatly the creme of the crop (hence why they are in food service) but to be so \"in your face\" that some thug with ghetto tattoos and penguin pants on is making your food... not cool. Not professional. Staffing behavior here needs to be re-evaluated.
