Ok, first off, I'm sure Michael S is a perfectly reasonable and accurate Yelper but the one star review he wrote below\/above is from a different owner before it closed down and reopened with new ownership\/management. So please don't judge them by that review. \n\nFirst: the location. It's located near my home where no other pizza shops dare open shop. Yes!\n\nIt's just across the street from the Bikini. Can you hear the angels singing? \n\nSecond: been there twice now. First time had pizza crust (for vegan\n-ness) and fries and a bite of the veggie sub. All superb. \n\nToday my boy Richard Z had the Monsoon, which they're soon to be famous for (it looked amazing) and I had the vegan version of their veggie sub, which was outstanding. Really, really good.  \n\nThey're super nice people. Charming little place. Place to sit outside and watch the culture. \n\nThey'll walk your food over to the bikini. \n\nOpen til 9 on weeknights and 11 on weekends. \n\nLOVE THIS PLACE! So happy it's in my hood.
