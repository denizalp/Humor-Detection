High prices for average food.   I ordered \"hash browns\" with my meal but received potato fries.   Considering this restaurant originated in North Carolina, this was unexpected and disappointing.  This would not have been an issue if it was clarified on the menu.\n\nOverall, it was not worth the long wait, and you would be better off going to Waffle House or iHop.  If you are wanting something special, go to the Original Pancake House in Charlotte for 10X the experience and much better food.
