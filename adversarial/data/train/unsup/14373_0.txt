My favorite place to eat breakfast has ALWAYS been BLUEBERRY HILL. I don't like anyone else's french toast. I ordered a omelet here and was really surprised by the size of the omelet, the amount of vegetables, and best of all the perfect amount of cheese. The omelet was fluffy and didn't have a overcooked patch of burnt on it at all. It was very beautiful. I was there at 8:30 am on Monday and I was so happy that there weren't loud mulitple crowds. It was consistently busy but not overwhelming and annoying. My friend and I sat there for quite a while catching up and best of all the server didn't harrass constantly. They let us talk for quite awhile without interrupting. \nThe only bad thing I had to say was the hashbrowns were TOO crispy for me. They were overcooked and crunchy and had that burnt potato flavor. Other than that---this is one of my new favorite spots for breakfast.
