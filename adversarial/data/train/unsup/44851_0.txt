I have used this pool service for a couple of years.  They didn't show up last week and when we called she assured us that the pool man would call us.  Never did, called again and she said he came by.  The chlorine is completely out.  When we called again, she said well do you just want to end service?  Well yes I guess that's how you handle your business. Please end our business with you.  I see now why they are rated so low.  Will be sure to use a pool service with 5 stars, there are many to choose from.  Don't choose this one!!!!
