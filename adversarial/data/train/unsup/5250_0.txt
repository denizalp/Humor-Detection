(Lyrics - Cutting Crew - Just Died in Your Arms Tonight)\nOh I, I just ate at Searsuckers tonight\nIt must have been something I read\nI just ate at Searsuckers tonight\n\nI keep ordering for something I can't get\nArtichoke hearts lie all around me\nAnd I don't see an easy way to get out of this\nMy cocktail sits on the bar side table\nThe curtains are closed; the place is like an adult cradle\nWho would've thought that a boy like me could come to this?\n\nOh I, I just ate at Searsuckers tonight\nIt must have been something I read\nI just ate at Searsuckers tonight\n\nOh I, I just ate at Searsuckers tonight\nIt must've been some kind of dish\nI should've walked away, I should've walked away\n\nSearsucker is a hot new restaurant in S. Scottsdale.  I went to the original one in San Diego and thought it was okay.  The one in Scottsdale?  Well Okay at best again.  \n\nI think this place was over-hyped.  Granted they won a lot of awards, voted best new restaurant, etc.  I brought some friends from out of town here thinking I would treat them to a good meal and experience.  Needless to say, they weren't all about it either.  We ordered a bunch of small bites since we had a long night ahead of us eating and drinking; Kobe Carpaccio, Scallop Bacon, Egg Bacon Pork Belly, Meatballs, Squid sweet heat.  The Carpaccio was good, but nothing special.  Scallops with bacon....well everything tastes good with bacon right.  My favorite was the egg bacon and pork belly -- yummy, but belongs at breakfast.  The squid was sweet and spicy and that's about it.  \n\nThe place itself is pretty swanky.  The ambience is hip and romantic.  Overall, I think it's a great place to hang with friends or bring a date.  However, gonna have to pass on the food part.  Maybe it was an off night.  Every dog has its day.  I really want to give this place a chance so me coming back is definitely.  Hopefully, this won't discourage you to go cause I would say try it on your own and let me know - wink! - Enjoy!
