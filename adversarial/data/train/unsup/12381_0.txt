Hippy hippy joy joy!\n\nThe two hippies made me happy. How?  In the midst of moving my wife from Phoenix to San Francisco and packing up boxes and boxes of stuff, she took me here for lunch.  I had a chili dog that was hot, messy, and awesomely tasty.  The toasted bun was an added plus.  Along with that was a bag of the greasiest, yummiest fries in the world.  Were they soggy?  Well, yeah, but that's one of the things that made them so good.  This is one of those rare places where you wish your stomach was twice as big so you could just keep eating.\n\nThere was no soda machine or fountain, but these guys had the class to offer RC and Shasta sodas from their refrigerator, and that taste just topped off an already fantastic meal with something more.\n\nOh, and by the way, the whole shebang was $5!\n\nThere ain't much to this place, there are padded stools, a bar to eat on, lots and lots of hippy decor, and a kitchen that's always sending out smoke and delicious smells.  This place is ultra yum.  Forget about the fast food places--Two Hippies pwns them all.  Better food, more of it, and cheaper too.  Stop thinking about it--turn off your mind, relax, and float downstream.  It is believing.
