We have been coming here for ages now.  We are here everytime we're at the food court.  \nThe drinks are nice and for $2.50 inc tax, they are fantastic value.  We usually get the fruit flavoured green teas with tapioca.  The tapioca is usually soft and cooked through.  I prefer that to undercooked and hard tapioca.  The staff are all lovely at this place.  I came here first and have never tried another bubble tea place because it's great here and we've had no issues with drinks.  We've had their dessert crepes a few times too.  They are ok for a quick dessert.  They have a loyalty stamp card too.  Buy 7 same priced drinks and get the 8th for free.
