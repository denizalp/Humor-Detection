Excellent biscuits...they have jalapenos in them. Had gravy on mine and it was loaded with sausage. Very good black coffee and the service was very friendly. Nice local place to grab a nice little brekfast as long as you don't mind a limited menu. Oh yeah and we grabbed a small key lime pie for later. Can't wait to try it.
