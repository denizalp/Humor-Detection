I've experience their food both at the pool and also dinning in. I do prefer to dine in. \n\nBy the pool I had the lascala salad no Turkey Or salami instead salmon. I really enjoyed it, the fish was a bit fishy but over all it was great. My friend got the chicken fingers and loved it.\n\nWhen dinning in, we started with the Caesar salad scrumptious! And I made the mistake of ordering the veggie burger. Yuk! It was so unappetizing! When presented to me I felt like I was being served airplane food. The burger bun was a dis colored white\/yellow and it looked like a McDonald's burger. It also came with fried and a chocolate shake which were good.\n\nMy friend got the tablou breakfast and substitutes the sausage for vegan sausage. Which was so good we ended up sharing it.\n\nService is great just don't get the veggie burger it's disgusting!
