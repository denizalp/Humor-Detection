My favorite Vegas hotel I've stayed at, probably because it was the nicest. Love the suites, could probably fit 6 easily with the 2 queen beds, and the couches in the separate living area. There were only 3 of us, so it was more than enough space for us. 2 large flat screens, table to eat in the living area, and a large bathroom. Only con with that is the see through shower (if you're shy in front of your friends, you can close the doors), bathtub, sinks, and a separate toilet area. Also, everytime you walk down to the lobby, you are greeted by the Bouchon bakery, which caused me to spend a ton of $ on the $3.50 macarons each day. Their Grazie player cards are also the most giving I feel as well. We had 3 days comped, so stayed for free, except for the resort fee. Bliss!
