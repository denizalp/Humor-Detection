I have always been a fan of this local gem. James the owner along with Terry on the bar are just fantastic folks. \nGreat pub food, pool tables and juke box to keep things from getting boring.\nGreat beer selection and the wine choices are also pretty decent.\nA must for chicken wing fans. My choice for best wings in the area
