The only thing I enjoyed was the atmosphere. I ordered a Bloody Mary which was okay. I've had better in a whole in the wall bar. Tasted a bit water downed. For brunch I ordered the Hawaiian French toast and was able to chose bananas or strawberry for an extra 1.99. I was told that they didn't have bananas so forced to go with what they had. When I received my plate there was literally 8 chopped up pieces of strawberry for 1.99 the price doesn't seem reasonable. I also ordered the spinach omelet and there was nothing spectacular about it. I won't be coming back it want worth the money...
