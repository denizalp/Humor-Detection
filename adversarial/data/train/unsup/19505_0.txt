If I could rate them on the video arcade part alone - 5 stars, it's a blast, and that's where the good times end.  The food, which came highly recommended, is TERRIBLE, and this is coming from a guy who can eat pizza every day of the week, frozen, fresh, homemade, you name it.  \n\nGreasy, greasy, greasy (my 11 year old AND her friends, all pizza lovers, wouldn't finish it, literally soaked the paper plates they give you for the pizza).  Paper thin, but not crispy unfortunately, crust, so the \"toppings\" slide off.  The \"toppings\" (and reason behind the \" \" marks) mean you'll get about 8 slices of pepperoni on a whole pie apparently.  I've actually never seen pizza as thin as this in my life.  The place is also a dump inside, with only a few tables, smells like movie theater carpeting.  They do most of their business on delivery.  The guy who runs it (Rossi I assume) is a little odd, but nice enough.  It's clearly an institution, I begrudge no one their kitschy place to hang out.  But if someone tells you the food is good, you might want to breathalyze them.
