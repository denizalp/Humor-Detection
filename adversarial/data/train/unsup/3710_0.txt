Truc might be as authentic as you can get...starting with it's prime location. It's located in Asian Corner N. Tryon and Sugar Creek. The location is authentic because the strip mall is just so reminiscent of the asian plazas and strip malls back home in Ca. Nice touch.\n\nTruc is so authentic that some of the menu items really aren't for the faint at heart. None of it has really been toned down for the American palate. If you're a regular Andrew Zimmer though, have at it! \n\nIf you want to avoid the crowds, do not go during early morning, lunch hours. Most asians traditionally eat pho in the mornings, so weekends here are crowded. Dinner is completely empty. There was only one other customer here at dinner. \n\nNormally I have pho here, but this time I opted for the combination chao ga - rice porridge. The one thing I could have done without was the diced raw ginger. Just way too strong for me and it ruined my meal. Other than that, it wasn't too bad. Since it was a combination, it came with everything. I mean everything. I don't want to get into detail for those landlubbers who get seasick; but if you're a novice, it might make your stomach drop like a roller coaster. \n\nOverall usually very consistent and one of my regular pho restaurants.
