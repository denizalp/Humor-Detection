Vistana is located next to Rhodes Ranch. It seems to be one of the Las Vegas' best kept secrets.  Conveniently located near lots of shopping and dining.  Near 215, making it quick to get to the strip or to the 15 fwy. This property is filled with lots of mature palm trees, so you almost forget you're in a desert when you're there.
