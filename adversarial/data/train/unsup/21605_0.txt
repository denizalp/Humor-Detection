Ok so I finally stopped by to check it out as I have many friends in las vegas that seem to go to the beauty bar often. I had heard in advance that they have a stage for performers and music acts. I knew they had a bar inside obviously considering there is \"Bar\" in the name. lol\n\nAnyhow, stopped by on a Sunday night to join pals to support a mutual friend of ours who host a monthly dub step dj night. It is called Church, hosted by the Awesome Johnny McNasty.\n\nThis joint is VERY small with a bar and a tiny stage area for equipment and performers. In my opinion it is just a small meeting space with a hairdresser theme. You can dance however you will be rubbing shoulders and hips with people.\n\nIt is dark,dingy and just does not have a clean or sanitary feel to it. They have bouncers at the door which seems really lame considering is a small and plain bar. It is a simple space that is rather boring so I was dissapointed. I am just happy that I had my pals and we showed up to support our mutual friend. \n\nThe beauty bar is overrated in my opinion and I won't be back. Been there done that.
