We really wanted to love Japaneiro... we tried. Let me first state that the service at this restaurant is outstanding. We came in right when this place opened on a weekday and were ready to dine!\n\nThe house chardonnay and Asahi were the best parts of the meal unfortunately.\n\nOur first item, the beef skewers: inedible. They were so gummy and chewy I spit them into a napkin.\n\nSo we weren't off to a good start, but some spicy mayo rock shrimp... how in the heck could that go wrong? No. The rock shrimp were covered in a ginger-ish \/ citrus-ey flavored spicy mayo. The flavor was complex and thoughtful, but to us it just didn't taste good.\n\nThe black cod butter lettuce wraps were just meh, not really any flavor to speak of. There's no special glaze on the cod, so it's just a crunchy-cod and lettuce wrap.\n\nThe yakisoba noodles... again, the flavor was interesting and complex... tasted kind of like barbecue or smoky-ish flavor, but it just didn't taste good.\n\nSalmon Lotus chips, just OK. Probably the 2nd best thing besides the alcohol.\n\nMaybe this place just isn't right for us; the food all had interesting and unique flavors that we've never tasted before and although we didn't like the food, clearly other people do, so yeah. Great service though!\n\nOh-- I forgot-- the edamame!!! Ok, so their garlic edamame (which we got for free for checking in on Yelp!) is seriously legit. Possibly the best edamame I've ever had. So Japaneiro wasn't a complete bust.
