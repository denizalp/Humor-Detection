I love Cafe Zupas, but the quality at this location is lacking. I find the Eastern location to be more consistent. I've had good food and service here, but I've had disappointing food as well. Seems to be about a 50\/50 shot from my experience. I was so excited when this location opened, but it did not deliver. I'll be traveling the extra distance to Eastern from now on.
