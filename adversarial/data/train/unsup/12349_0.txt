Probably the worst Vietnamese place, I have experienced! When it comes to costumer service this hits a all time low. After being seating at a booth for 15 minutes, I had to flag down a waiter for the menu (Minus a star)! It seems the like the waitress and waiter are all gathered around the cash register talking amongst themselves to care! We have to inform the waiter that we never got any cold water (Minus another star). The waiter decides to gives us an attitude when we was placing our order (Minus another star)!\n\nWARNING: The establishment itself is a OVEN!!!\n\nLacking AC in this weather is not a welcoming place to dine. When I ask about the AC the waiter claim it is working (on) and the heat is cause by the weather outside! Sorry that was a load of crap! I posted a picture of the thermostat of the restaurant and it reads 90 Fahrenheit. I am not a high maintenance person but temperature that high ruins the dinning experience. \n\nThe food is nothing to rave about! The chicken dish was dry! The grill pork and egg roll with vermicelli was decent! You could have gotten this in another Vietnamese restaurant. I could not imagine eating Pho here because of the heat! Personally with the lack of AC (Las Vegas being so hot) with bad costumer service, I would NOT RECOMMEND this place based on today experience!
