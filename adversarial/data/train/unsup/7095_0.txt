I absolutely adore Jenn at Escape Salon and Spa! My hair was in need of some love and Jenn hooked it up! \n\nI was referred to Jenn by my sister who has received services from her in the past. I've also seen a lot of Jenn's work on Instagram as well and she is amazing! Different style cuts to the latest trends in hair color, Jenn can do it all. \n\nMy hair has been long and extremely thick my whole life and I wanted to do something a little different. I needed some change and Jenn was more than willing to help a sista out. I explained to her that I didn't want to do anything TOO drastic, but I just wanted my hair to be more manageable and easier to style. Basically, I told her that I didn't want to spend two hours curling my hair for the curls to just fall out in 30 minutes.\n\nI was in her chair for about an hour at most, but I felt like I was sitting there for 20 minutes because we kept the conversation going! She is so fun to talk to and her personality is just like mine. We clicked right away!\n\nAs she was working her magic, she would always pause and make sure that I liked how it was looking or she would ask me what needed to be fixed. I love how she consulted with me first before doing anything. Before I knew it, she was done cutting and I already felt brand new. My hair feels so much lighter and looks healthier! She also curled it and I loved the way it turned out. Jenn did exactly what I asked of her and I couldn't be happier with the results of my haircut!\n\nI will definitely be booking another appointment with Jenn in the near future for some color! I highly recommend Jenn to anybody who is in need of an awesome hairstylist!\n\nCheck out her work on Instagram- @jenndones_color & #hairbyjenndones
