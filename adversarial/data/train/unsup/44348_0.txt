Hannah is by far the best lash artist in las vegas!!! She is always polite and light with her hands. She does everything from A-Z unlike other lash artist that i have been to where they would just do the fill without cleaning your lashes first and putting primer on your lashes before the fill. Her price is very reasonable and if you want longer or more curlier lashes than she will do it for you. Thanks Hannah :)
