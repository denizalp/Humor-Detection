I may be a bit biased about this business because I was an employee here once upon a time.  But, let me mention that I was a patient before I was ever an employee.\n\nDr. Pfondevida is the most personable and professional optometrist you will ever meet.  He knows what he is doing and always goes out of his way to make sure that his patients are happy.  The wide selection of frames, that are always rotating and in style, makes me a want a hundred pairs of glasses!  Pricing is reasonable, both with or without insurance.  Sometimes people forget that this is a small local business and not a chain... quality is what is delivered here!\n\nI will always return to Dr. P for my eye exams, contact lenses and glasses for as long as he is around!
