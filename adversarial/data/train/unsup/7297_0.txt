My Friend recently had her wedding reception at this venue  (March 29, 2014).  The venue is beautiful, but that is about it.  The professionalism of the employees was just sad and pathetic.  When a event starts at 6pm, it would be great if the room was set-up.  It was very unprofessional to have guest arrive and still have staff in the room putting napkins, glasses and cutlery on the table.  Not only that.  The venue sales people thought when someone is hosting their wedding, it is the perfect time to schedule site visits and food tastings.  We had random people walking in and out of the venue and going into and out of the bridal suite.  This is the most unprofessional staff and venue personnel ever.  I've hosted and organized a lot of events for work and this is something anyone who is a real professional would NOT do!  All they care about is your money.  They do not care about standards or about putting on a great event.  The table cloths were wrinkled and so were the chair covers.  With all the money that they get paid....it is just an outrage and sad.  If you are looking for a venue, DO NOT choose this one.  Regardless of the beauty of the place, all the sparkle does erase the bad impression or the unprofessional conduct of the owners, and workers.
