This is one of the best Chinese places in the city. It is the only place to get ribs made the right way New York style The pork fried rice is also the best I am including the so called authentic places in town I travel to Hong Kong so I know what I am talking about. Ellie our server was wonderful for special service Every dish here is above the mark for excellence Prices higher than most others but food atmosphere and area is worth it. They should not be charging for tea. Their dim sum need work but the sticky rice is on the money!
