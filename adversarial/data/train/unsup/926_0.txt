Wandered into the Centre De Commerce Mondial De Montreal while we were walking back to our hotel from Old Montreal.  In English, it means World Trade Centre Montreal (if I translated correctly).  \n\nThis building seems to be part office complex, part hotel, and part shopping complex.  It is beautiful inside.  \n\nWish we had the time to explore the complex and discover what hidden treasures they have here.  Will have to save a future visit here for the next trip to the beautiful city of Montreal.
