A pretentious little place, catering to the upmarket crowd. Worth a visit on a quiet day if you have cash to spare.\n\nPleasant patio with small tables, the inside is tiny and very cramped, but it all happens in the right part of town. It will do great on such occasions as TIFF.\n\nGood wine list, overpriced - $65 for a lovely Cote du Rh√¥ne white.\n\nPlenty of unctuous waiters (who rather pretend they know the wines), who manage to be condescending and obsequious at the same time.\n\nThe portions are small and yet carefully prepared.\nFois Gras, cold, yet well presented. (The black current overwhelms it). The celeriac dish is lovely.\nThe Greek mushroom dish is cold, which is an aberration.\nTheTtoro is sparse, with the sauce made separately from the main ingredients, it is a pity that they never met.\nThe Tartine of rabbit is exactly as posted, but small.
