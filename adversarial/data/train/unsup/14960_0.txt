Does Panini's have great pizza?  No.\n\nDoes Panini's have exceptional and friendly service? No.\n\nDoes Panini's have fun and interesting decor? No.\n\nDo I love Panini's?  Absolutely YES!\n\nPanini's serves as a \"support\" location for your night on the town.  A break between bars, a place to wait for your taxi, somewhere to put some food in your stomach to soak up the alcohol from Velvet Dog or Barley House or Liquid.  Panini's is a required part of your night out on West 6th.  :)
