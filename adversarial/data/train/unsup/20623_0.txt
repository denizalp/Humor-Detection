Love at first bite?... As places for a quick falafel wrap go, Parsley has to be my favorite in town. The falafel is made to order...so it does take a few minutes, but it is worth the wait. I am a fan of a little heat and Parsley Modern Mediterranean has a great spicy sauce. They actually have two of them, a green mild sauce and red hot sauce...and it's this red one that I'm talking about here. It is quite spicy, and works so perfectly to bring up the heat on a falafel wrap.\n\nI was talking to my love about a post from lasvegasfill, yes THE lasvegasfill, about Parsley, and then a day or two later she picked up some for us to try for the first time. I can still feel the lovely tingling sensation of heat with that first bite...the red hot sauce!..mixed in with hummus and tzatziki, combine as the perfect accompaniment to fresh falafel. The falafel themselves are on point as well. Parsley is no sit-down restaurant, but their falafel is moist, flavorful, and cooked well, easily making it better than most sit-down restaurants in town. They have a couple of vertical spits for their shawarma and gyro meat, a flame grill for cooking all their and kebabs, and a dedicated falafel station--making it readily apparent they are aren't trying to cut corners in their food preparations. They also have all their cold salad\/bowl\/wrap options on display for you to select as they complete your order, think the Chipotle of Mediterranean food...only slower. I haven't ventured on to other items on the menu, but as for their falafel, I'm a big fan, and have been in a couple times since my first introduction to enjoy it again.
