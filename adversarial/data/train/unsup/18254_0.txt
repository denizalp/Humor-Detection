My wife just ate there for lunch and she was blown away by the price and the food.  I haven't even eaten there and I am giving it 5 stars because my wife is so happy.  We will go for dinner tonight and I will update my rating if it is not 5 stars.  However, I know if will be and because my gorgeous wife is so happy, I am sure it will be a fantastic evening worthy of 6 stars and 2 thumbs up.  For this place to be able to offer so much delicious food at such a low price, it must be a magical place.  How can you give anything less than 5 stars to a magical place like this.  Unless you are a troll from Goodyear who thinks that big chunks of chicken is a bad thing.  Then you just stay under your bridge handing out two star reviews, hoping people will kiss your butt because you are a world renowned food critic that lives in friggen Goodyear Az.  So get your butt out to #1 fried rice and see why it lives up to its name.
