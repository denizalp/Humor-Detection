Absolutely the best place I done my nails in so long! I had to drive 30 minutes first thing I liked was that the atmosphere was great!\n\nWas greeted at the door!! Friendly staff!\n\nThe nail tech I got was great!\n\nMost of all I was not disappointed like I usually am with every other salon! \n\nTook there time on my nails! \n\nMy gel finish looks great!\n\nI love it all around!!
