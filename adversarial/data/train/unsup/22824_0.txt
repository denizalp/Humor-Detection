Was in the area and decided to give the Italian Villagr a try.\nThe service was very fast and friendly.\nI ordered two slices of sicilian too go.\nThey were ok nothing special to speak of.\nIf I was in the area and was in the mood for pizza I would give them another chance but would try a different kind of pizza.
