Great local butcher. My only real complaint is that they do not carry Canadian bacon. They do have pretty decent homemade sausages in different flavours, and different cuts of meat. Prices are definitely higher than the grocery store but it's higher quality meat and some cuts that are not even carried at the grocery store.
