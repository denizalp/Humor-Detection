To me a good butcher is a place where you walk in, ask for a cut of meat, and he goes into the cold storage brings out a chunk and cuts off a piece of the cut you want.  This place doesn't seem to work this way.  \n\nI wanted beef short ribs cut flanken style.  Well he had cut up all the ribs English style and packaged them and put them in a cooler for self serve.  I would need to give him 2 days notice to get the cut I wanted.  To me that is chain store mentality, not a butcher.  The meat seems to be all cut and out.  That's a supermarket.\n\nNow people seem to like it because all the meat is antibiotic free.  But he no longer carries grass finished beef, he said. I have never tried the meat so I cannot comment on it.  He says it is aged 30 days on site but he can't cut me my ribs without 2 days notice. Why? He doesn't want to give me 29 day aged meat?\n\nI've been there 3 times and each time failed to get the meat I wanted.  No this is not a Better Butcher, it is a supermarket and I'm sorry we don't have the cut of meat you want today.
