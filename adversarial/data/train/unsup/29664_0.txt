Meh I was under impressed. The quinoa dish was the only vegetarian entree aside from the veggie burger. I think it's overpriced for what you get. The food was somewhat bland. The truffle fries weren't bad and the sticky buns before the meal were a nice touch although I would've preferred bread and butter. The waiter was nice but a bit too much so Everytime we made eye contact the waiter would come over, it was a bit well overbearing.
