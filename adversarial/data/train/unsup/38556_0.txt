This was my first time here at Diego Pops. I came here on a Monday so wasn't a busy at all. The food was good. Overall the service really was horrible. I can't remember her name but she wasn't friendly at all to me and my friends. We felt like she didn't want to take care of us. When she brought those sauces she didn't explain them at all. I had to ask her. She didn't ask is this your first time here either. My friend ordered something and she didn't even know what it was she was eating. The waitress looked at her and said how do you not know what that is?? It was just rude!! So check your service staff because they are not very helpful with the menu and kind of snobby!
