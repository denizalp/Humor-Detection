We went there on our anniversary this year on December 6 th .I was concerned after reading the reviews from different sights .wow! We're we happy we ignored them . excellent service and the food was perfect Miriam( I think was our servers name ) and she was fantastic .I did feel the prices were high or should I say  higher than I want to pay .but the lady has put up with me for 48 yrs.so I think she deserved it .the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is for the prices .
