Make no mistake, this isn't fine dining, nor is it authentic Chinese food. Beijing Express excels in your typical Americanized Chinese fast food, with old stand bys such as General Tso's chicken and chop suey. We stopped by for an eat-in experience, and browsed through the menu before deciding on kung pao chicken, eggplant in garlic sauce, and tofu with broccoli. Service was friendly, fast, and efficient as our order was prepared and served in near record time. \n\nI appreciated that we were served a little bag of crispy wonton strips with sweet and sour sauce, with some egg drop soup. The soup was piping hot and a generous portion. When our meals came out, they were a heaping portion on the styrofoam plate, with plenty of rice to go with it. The kung pao chicken had a nice heat to it, from the added mixture of whole dried red chilis, while the eggplant and tofu had more of a sweet brown sauce. While our food tasted fresh and flavorful, make no mistake this isn't in any way healthy, as the sauces were an unctuous mixture, glistening with oil. \n\nThere were plenty of leftovers to take back from ordering 3 dishes for just the two of us. Each dish was under $10, most of them hovering around the $7 range. They do not have a soda fountain, and all drinks are by the bottle.\n\nGenerally, if you are craving some fast food Chinese, this is definitely a good option for price, freshness, and quantity.
