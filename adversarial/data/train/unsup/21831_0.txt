I decided to try this restaurant and I called in BLT in over the phone, so that way my order would be ready when I got there. I was excited about the energy of the staff when I walked through the door. But I was not happy since the cashier whom happened to be the manager did not have my order in the system. His name was Chris and he informed me that he probably took my order and has been so busy forgot to input in the machine. \n\nSo I was so psyched about trying a BLT with egg and avocado, but it took the cook forever to make the sandwich. I was the only order that they did have at this particular time. The manager was busy doing paperwork at the register so could not light any kind of fire for the ladies making my sandwich. The food when I did receive it was fantastic but something is rotten in their ordering routine.
