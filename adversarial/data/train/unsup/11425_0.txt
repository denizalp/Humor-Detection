Headed on down to Eggstacy on Saturday morning to have breakfast with my daughter & grandson, it had been awhile since I last had been and I was ready to try them again.\n\nThe menu still can be overwhelming, so many choices to choose from, before I got there I was thinking nope not doing an omelet, those things are huge, but after checking out the menu I went ahead and ordered me one haha.\n\nI ordered the Dali's Omelet, it had chorizo, jalapenos, onion and queso, this omelet was the best omelet I have had in a very long time, and it was flavorful, spicy and cooked perfectly!  So dang good! \n\nI also ordered a side of one raspberry white chocolate pancake that is what I originally was headed there to try. It was a fluffy pancake drizzled with white chocolate and topped with raspberries, but it had a brûlée sugar coating on top of the pancake, oh my this was pure sweet bliss!   \n\nAnother great breakfast down at Eggstacy!
