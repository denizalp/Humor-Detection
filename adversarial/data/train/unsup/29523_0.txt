I decided to try this spot and became a fan.  The food is excellent.  The Chicken Shwarma, out of this world good, but the other items are great too.   My only complaint is that the Hummus appetizer should come with more than 1 pita.  Need it to scoop up all that good Hummus!  \n\nGreat place, I keep going back.  If the Groupon is still available, snag it, you will be glad you did.
