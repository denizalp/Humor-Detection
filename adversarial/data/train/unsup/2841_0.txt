I stumbled upon this place by accident. I've been gifting my husband fountain pens for several years now but had typically ordered them online from another shop out of province, as the only nearby brick and mortar store I was aware of (in Yorkville) wasn't my favourite shopping experience. \n\nThis year I was seeking a particular pen in a somewhat limited release finish and the manufacturer's website led me to Wonder Pens. \n\nVery happy with the selection, pricing, ease of ordering (I ended up ordering online and picking up in person) and the lovely down-to-earth service I received in store. \n\nI let my husband in on this hidden gem and he has already visited the shop twice in the past two weeks!
