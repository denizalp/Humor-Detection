I am actually astounded right now because I have been to Amsterdam's at least twenty times before, but I have neglected to review.\n\nFirst, let me start by saying that I have not been here for a few years and am completely delighted to report that this place is still as amazing as the last time I was here.\n\nI used to come for happy hour once or twice a week and made my way here on a Saturday a time or two. I always have a great time, the drinks are always amazing, the crowd is always fun. What more can you ask for?
