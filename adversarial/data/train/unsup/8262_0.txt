Car'ls Jr has the best burger commercials! They have been playing one with the 'California Classic Burger' and its been driving me crazy..so on my way home today I thought I would stop by and try it out. Boy, am I glad I did. Its not a very big burger, but its perfect for my appetite. It was so juicy and delicious. I believe its the 'special' sauce that makes it so good.\n\nSo, yea..I would get one while they are here! I believe the burger is a limited time frame? Damn its juicy!
