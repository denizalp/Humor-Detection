Right by my house ... And there's a drive thru!!!\n\nI'm probably going to be frequently stopping in here before classes, work, or meetings. \n\n\nI LOVE Jamba Juice. I've been going to the Tropical smoothie on Jones because there's not one on this side of town til now. Wooo\nI should probably make my own smoothies at home but seriously...\nAin't nobody got time for that!!\nBuying the fruit, washing the fruit, cutting the fruit, coming up with a combination...I'm on the go most of the time...which makes me appreciate the convenience of this drive-thru even more.\n\nSo real quick ...\nFood: The greatest\nService: Quick\nPrices: Get the 16oz ^*^ Better value.\n\nThis JJ seems to have a nice staff, very friendly and helpful. There wasn't a long line when I came since they just opened. I am so happy that this has opened. I will cut it short here, go get yourself a smoothie...they are just Fan-frickin-tastic!
