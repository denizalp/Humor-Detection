This place is average. The sushi and tempura is pretty good. Miso soup? Gross. Calamari? Less than average....I've definitely had better calamari that's for sure. I've only gotten delivery which was pretty pricey so I'm not sure how the prices are while dining in. \n\nI'd eat here again if I couldn't get anything better.
