Here's a Hot-N-Ready fact for you:  Little Caesars is the third-largest pizza chain in the United States, behind Domino's and Pizza Hut.\n\nOkay, this review is mainly for me because I keep buying the same disappointing chicken wings over and over again.  STOP BUYING THE WINGS! They're tiny, not-breaded, and soggy from being drowned in the sauce \n\nAnyways, while this isn't my favorite pizza joint, not even for fast food pizza [that title goes to the place across the street with the initials of P.H.], they're cheap, they open late, and you can buy a decent 'za for $6-$9.  I've been gravitating towards their Extra Most Bestest and their Deep! Deep! Dish!  They get the job done.  I also like their \"Crazy Combo\" for their breadsticks.  Although half the time, they forget to give me the marinara sauce even though I pay for it.\n\nThis Little Caesars is recently remodeled with fast and efficient workers.  I wish they would just remember to give me my dang marinara sauce!
