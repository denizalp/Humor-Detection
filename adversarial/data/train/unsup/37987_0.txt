BE LEARY!!!! PROTECT YOURSELF!!!\n\nTim Van Houten WILL NOT offer any financial services advice to any person who holds a life insurance license! THIS SHOULD BE A RED FLAG TO YOU! \n\nAs you may or may not know, the state of Arizona issues licenses for a variety of professions. In the area of Health and Life licensing, there are many cross over products. A financial advisor firstly must have a 'Life Producer' license. This is the same license that is needed for all sorts of products like pre-arranged funerals and life insurance. \n\nIf Tim, as a professional, were secure in his knowledge and could truly stand behind the products, services, and advice he offers to his clients; it shouldn't matter to him that a client has some vague understanding, or even an indepth understanding of his products. \n\nBecause Tim Van Houten and his associates are not willing to offer their services to anyone with a life insurance license, they must be hiding something. If a 'professional' is counting on his clients not to have any insight...BE LEARY!!
