We won't be back anytime soon.  We were the only guests in the dining room.  The pasta is overpriced, as is the wine.  \nThe service was o.k. ...server not real familiar with menu, other than telling us everyting is made from scratch....maybe it is but this restaurant, just like others before will not make it!    Sorry
