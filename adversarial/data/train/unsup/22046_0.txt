Hmmm. I was a little disappointed when I went to this dealership to pick up a t-shirt. There were plenty of people working there in the retail section of the store, and not one person asked if we needed assistance. Maybe I don't look like a motorcycle mama.\n\nI did find a cool t-shirt for the man, and I'm sure that if I was needing parts for a hog they'd be great, but a mightier than though attitude from a sales clerk is a huge let down. I would go back to the dealer in Phoenix to look for anything else I needed.\n\nOh, they had cool faucets in the restroom.
