I have been to noodle ranch once so far, food was great, fast, cheap and fresh. Place was a bit dead for Sat at lunch but since it is right down from LoLo's chicken and waffles I can understand it. People go for the 'hip' not necessarily the best food.\nNo question about it, I will be back again and again.
