I rated them a 1 because I wouldn't order from them again.  My experience was more \"not good\" than \"bad.\"\n\nMy order:  Hot and Sour Soup, Chicken Fried Rice, Kung Pao Chicken, and WonTon Chips; it came with 2 free egg rolls.\n\nEgg Rolls:  I think they used the thickest, toughest leaves of the cabbage for these egg rolls; every bite was like biting into the part of the cabbage leaves that nobody wants.\n\nChicken Fried Rice:  I tend to measure Chinese restaurants by the quality of this dish and each time I try a new place, it's one of the things I always order.  King Wong had what was probably the worst I have ever eaten.  The chicken was dry and tough and had no flavor....and I don't know how else to say it but it was like it was old.\n\nKung Pao Chicken:  I think they used the same chicken as in the fried rice, dry, tough, and old.   Aside from that, it was fine.  That's the best thing I can say about it.  \n\nWonTon Chips:  I was actually quite tickled to see these on the menu because they're like Chinese crack to me and I rarely see them offered.  And even though I chowed on them like the had crack inside them, I was not oblivious to the fact that about half of them were considerably darker than the rest, suggesting that they had been fried, left out for a long time, and then fried again.\n\nHot and Sour Soup:  The broth had that \"kick\" that I enjoy when eating this dish.  Not much else to say about it.\n\nI don't want to discourage people from going here; the lady on the phone who took my order was very nice and conscientious and made absolutely certain that she had my order right, and they did deliver the food faster than the 45 minutes they had suggested would be required.  For me, however, the bottom line with a restaurant is the food, and while i really wanted to be happy with it, every bite was a mouthful of disappointment.
