Worst buffet ever for anyone with any kind of allergies.  I realize I am in the minority here, and my kids and husband did eat a good amount of food.  But it wasn't great.  \n\nThey have NOTHING that is gluten free for dessert.  Almost everything has dairy in it.  Cute little pastries, cupcakes, pies, etc.  I just couldn't eat any of them.  \n\nI would not eat here again.  It's robbery for the food you get.
