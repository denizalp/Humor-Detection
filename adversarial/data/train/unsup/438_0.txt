Delicious, interesting brats\/hotdogs. Good beer. Nice style. I head here every so often for lunch and have really enjoyed the variety of different signature brats, from the Meditteranean kebob-style to the Thai, to the Chicago style. All totally unique and mouth-watering. Curds are great-- especially the green and gold special! And good beer selection as well. Outdoor patio in the summer is boss, and if you like board games, theyve got a ton!
