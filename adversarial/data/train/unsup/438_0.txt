I could get drunk off the book smell here... what an awesome place! Everything is super old and if you're super old like me, the history & art sections alone are worth taking a couple hours to pick through. Which I did. \n\nI really liked this place, but I do get the overwhelming feeling that the books are all talking about me... or something. You know what I mean. That, I'm not sure I want this shiz up in my house feeling... Or that the books themselves have a sordid history... never mind.
