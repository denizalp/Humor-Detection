We were at the pool all day and decided to we needed some serious greasy food to balance out all the alcohol in our stomachs.  I've eaten at the I Love Burgers at Town Square before and just thought it was okay so I didn't really want to eat here but I HAD to have a burger stat and did not want to go wandering the Strip looking for another burger place.\n\nI was actually pleasantly surprised.  It wasn't that busy so we got seated right away. I just got my normal Standard with cheddar and bacon, and my friend got the inferno burger with extra cheese.  We also got nom-noms and fried pickles and a triple chocolate shake.  Our food came out fast and it was hot and delicious.  I'm not sure what they do differently here than at Town Square, but my burger was BOMB!  It was juicy and flavorful and seemed a little bigger.  My friend loved his inferno burger!\n\nThe service was really great!  Our server Jenny was really friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  I had never had the noms noms before and she highly recommended them and I was in LOVE with these.  She made sure our drinks were always filled and checked on us regularly.  \n\nI'm really glad that circumstances made us come here because we had such a great experience with the food and service.  I'll definitely stop by here again and recommend it to any friends looking for a good burger place on the Strip.
