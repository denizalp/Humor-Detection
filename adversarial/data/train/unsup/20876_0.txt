I love Plaza Midwood. And now, there's one more reason to love this 'hood even more.\n\nI've been a big fan of the original Peel in Cotswold for years. Confession: I use to order $40 worth of food so Foodie Call would deliver to me. So, yeah I've been pumped and counting the days for this new location to open.\n\nMy hands down favorite pizza here: Thai's Tong. Chicken, Thai sweet chili sauce, basil, onions, red pepper. The sauce just makes this pizza pop. Yum. In 92 pt font. First runner up: the buffalo chicken. Nachos are great. Bruschetta is addicting. Once I start eating it... I can't seem to stop.\n\nThe inside looks amazing. Walls are wood. They brought in an old piano from The Common Market in South End. Peel plans to bring in someone who can play it. What else can you expect? Music trivia nights, a ton of great beer. All of the beer. The GM knows more about beer than any other person I know. \n\nOne thing though bums me out: the location does not have my favorite menu item. Sad face. I love the curry rolls at the Cotswold location. I dream about them sometimes. They take awhile to make, so currently they can't handle both locations. My fingers are crossed that this somehow changes in the future.\n\nCongratulations on Peel #2. This city is a better place with not one, but two of you.
