As a martial arts school owner myself, I have had many students transfer to our facility from many different schools and locations.  The students we've acquired from Newberry's Leaders for Life (due to a family re-location to Indiana) were some of the happiest I've ever seen.  Their technique was also impeccable, leading them to two World Champion titles in the following years.  Jeff and Tina Newberry are two of the most dedicated individuals you will ever meet in this industry.  I would highly recommend this facility to any parent looking to teach their child skills that will take them far in both taekwondo and their daily lives.
