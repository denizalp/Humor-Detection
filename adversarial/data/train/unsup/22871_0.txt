***This would be zero if zero existed***\nKeep reading to the end. \nSince Shauna wants to accuse me of lying, I posted proof in the photos.\n\nPros: Shauna was able to get me in same day due to a cancellation. Beautiful office, comfy chairs. \n\nCons: I was quoted by text the set I was interested in would be $130. Mixed set - the 2nd tier of their menu of 3 prices. Yes 3 prices listed on the web with the claim that they do not charge extra for added fullness. (None over $200). \n\nI showed Maria a photo of myself in the past where I had eyelashes the way I liked. She sounded pretty confident that she could do it. She showed me one set of lashes she was going to use that could be put on as an individual lash. \"Would make it appear more natural\". Not once did she mention there was a cost difference, or that this was any different from the mixed style I was quoted. (This will be important later). \n\nSo before seeing a mirror, eyelashes felt like nothing was on there. But ohhhhhh..... wow..... these were much too dramatic for my conservative job. I was a little in shock, I mentioned to her this wasn't what I was asking for and was too much. I went to the bathroom, composed myself and asked her if we could trim a little towards the inner eye and why it didn't look long and short as I had asked for. She told me it had to do with the way my eye curved, that it would be less noticeable with eyeliner, that when we did a fill the next time she could add shorter lashes. \n***at this point I am disappointed but resolve that I will pay the $130 and make due for 2 weeks until I could fill***\n\nI go to pay, I asked Maria what the PayPal email address was so I could send money. She has to wait for her boss to text me to provide it. \n*****this is where it goes really bad. Text messages will show....****\n\nThe manager sends me the email address for paypal, and then immediately texts that it will be $210!!!!!!!!!\nThis is where my blood just starts to boil, I am Already pretty upset I was gonna pay $130 for leaving looking like **** but now she is telling me it's $210 because I used boxed lashes??!!! And also that Maria's next appt was waiting (making me feel that any resolution of this situation was not going to be resolved with Maria, nor would the lashes be fixed). \n\nThat's not the pricing quoted and at no time did anyone mention a significant price increase. I wanted to talk to her face to face, yet she wasn't in the building. As her texts feel more like bullying and as it was my fault that she didn't relay to her employee what I asked for, or that her employee did not disclose a difference, I felt scammed. I was livid. I was sitting in her waiting room and just getting madder by the second, that I left. \nYes, I walked out. I just needed to cool off and figure out the best way to approach the situation with the owner. \nI didn't answer her calls because at that point I wanted the text proof because obviously she was going to be confrontational. She blew up my phone. I responded by text. \n\nThis is where the final straw was. I have crazy eyelashes, owner is crazy, she threatens to \"call it in\" like she is gonna call the authorities, and I think fine! All because I needed a few minutes to compose myself over this disaster! I wasn't responding anymore. \nYou call in in and I will yelp it in. \n\nMaybe if you actually sent a text message asking me about what happened because it's apparent that Maria never disclosed differences, and I sustained an eye injury.  \n\nYelp brought me to you, but I hope anyone who reads this will be cautious about working with you and not made to feel bad about standing up for a bad service. Customer service is obviously not your priority with the way you messaged me. \n\nIt is the next morning and eye lashes are already falling off. (No I don't wear mascara, I didn't wash with anything inappropriate, and no my natural lash wasn't shedding because it was pure cluster). \n\nNot only that... the individual lash she told me she was giving, that you (Shauna) said was more pricey is not individual lashes Maria showed me. These are straight up synthetic cluster lashes. \n\nSo you lure people into your place with 3 levels of pricing none of these are over $200 nor is there anything on there that mentions a more expensive set. \n\nI felt like this was only to bait and switch but not actually switch. Omg this is the biggest con. \n\n***\nAdditional note, I did sustain a scratch to the eye during the lashes in which I had to go to my optometrist for treatment less than 48 hours after having my lashes done. \n\nBe cautious to this lash factory and even more cautious at how much experience the esthetician has in applying them. \n\nIt's been 4 full days and half my lashes have fallen out, others are sideways.\n\nMoney wasn't the issue. The service and the lies were.
