The William Ashley Sale is an insane circus of consumerism. People turn into demons inside the warehouse. The aisles are tricky to traverse with huge carts and people going in every direction loading up their carts with just about every kind of house-ware imaginable. In spite of all this, I like to go to the sale. They have great deals on kitchenwares, knives, pots, pans, garden things and stuff you never knew you needed. A very good place to go for gifts, but it is very easy to forget what you were looking for, so bring a list - a very detailed list. \n\nMake sure to show up before opening time because even then you will be corralled under a tent. My advice is to bring a large coffee to keep warm while you wait, but coffee is my solution to just about everything.
