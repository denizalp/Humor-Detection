It's more like a 3 1\/2 star joint, but I give it 4 rather than 3. We had to wait a little while to get a seat outside on the patio, but the view from our table was nice. Our waiter was really nice and attentive. It took a while to get our food, but he warned us that the kitchen was really busy and it was going to take a while. He made sure we got our coffee and juice right away, so we were ok with that. The food was good, but definitely Wynn-priced. \n\n*Careful if you are there for breakfast during the summer months. Get there early. It was pretty comfortable when we got seated, but by the time we left, we were really ready to be in an air conditioned room!
