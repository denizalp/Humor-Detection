One word...awesome! I loved their system of texting you when your table was ready. Our server was phenomenal. It did take a while to get our cocktail drinks. But our food came out fast, I'm glad we didn't order any appetizers! I had the mac & cheese bacon burger. It was everything I thought it could be and more. It was just delicious and I highly recommend it. It's cooked medium well but was still really juicy and loved the mix of fries you receive with it. It's a big burger and will get messy, but you will enjoy it!  My friend had the turkey burger and she liked hers as well. It was a great time, and the staff was very friendly. Thanks Guy! :)
