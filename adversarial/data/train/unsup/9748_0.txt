Just want to start this out saying 1 star is being very generous!! We ordered the combo lunch (sandwich, salad, drink). When asking what our drink choices were to go with the combo we were told soda, beer, coffee, etc. and no up charge (total scam). We also asked for water for the whole table. The waiter returned with a pitcher of water (no ice) and 4 paper coffee cups that were previously used. There was lipstick on some of the cups, a lemon slice in the bottom of one of the glasses from the previous persons drink. When we called out our 12 year old waiter (owners son) he took the cups and returned with more paper cups that were previously used!! Really?? Who washes out paper cups and tries to reuse them? This was all before the food!! Cold soggy fries & salad with no dressing left us disgusted to say the least...... We went to pay inside to discuss our billing and other issues to the 14 year old at the register (owners other son) and he was very unprofessional and started arguing with us in front of others that were waiting to pay also!! They charged us for our drinks that were supposed to be included on the combo meal that we ordered. Don't waste your time and money coming here!!! There are so many great restaurants in Montr√©al but this is NOT one if them.
