A couple of days ago we were wandering around the Vieux Port and went into this store.  The first objects to attract my eye were a couple of stunning art glass pieces, curved rectangular forms on stands.  They were different from one another and both were beautiful.  The store has a range of merchandise, from colorful and functional ceramic pieces to art glass to interesting clocks to junky jewelry to assorted candies in large glass jars.  Truly a general store.  We saw a clock that interested us and yesterday, when we moved to the ship Alan walked over to the store and bought it.  When we reach the US we'll find a UPS store and ship it home.  The clock was sent in a great fabric handle bag and a piece of chocolate was thrown in for good mean.  Tr√©s cool.
