Smaller than Jones market with just as much variety, if not more! Max Market is likely to be my new ethnic shop of choice for Russian goodies. Their prices on most items are also lower, which is awesome.\n\nStore contains a deli towards the back with meats, cheeses, and premade items (they also brew fresh coffee), a small produce section, lots of breads and sweets that are both imported and locally-made, bulk-purchase nuts section, canned and jarred goodies from eastern Europe, and tons of beverages- liquor and alcohol is behind the register and on display.\n\nYou can get a ton of goodies here for $20- but my favorite purchase are the cheese burekas, packed 2\/$2, and stuffed with feta cheese. They're phenomenal, and the best I've found in this city- I believe they're made in-house, too.
