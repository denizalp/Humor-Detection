Primo Vino is a very interesting place. It reminded me of my dead great uncle's basement. Very old school Italian. \n\nWent with a group of other Yelpers. We came to drink. I think we accomplished what we set out to do. \n\nThe bartender was also pretty old school. He had the attitude that every older Italian man has. It's a \"don't be a smartass\" kind of attitude. And don't try to make jokes and don't look at me that way or I'll knock your teeth out. But once you get past that, you're good. \n\nThe owner was a nice guy. He made sure everyone was taken care of. Even though we only came to drink. I think they may have thought we were strange... well, whatever. They were right about that. \n\nHey, Billy!  Next time keep your tongue in your mouth and don't slobber all over my friend (I told him I'd mention him in my review).
