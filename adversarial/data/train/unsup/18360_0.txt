Came here for gas and had to go inside because I typed in the wrong zip code.  Dude working the overnight saw I was driving an Acura and started having a car conversation... with himself.  I don't know shit about cars, just my car.  But he told me all about his car.  Call me crazy, but I appreciate just meeting interesting people rather than get a \"thank you\" when I pay.  Thanks for the free entertainment, dude!
