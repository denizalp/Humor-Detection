I have been hearing great things about Bluebird Kitchen, so I was very pleased to find out it could live up to the hype.  All the food was freshly and creatively prepared.  I tried the Cuban plus a Hazelnut Oatmeal cookie, and both were really tasty.  \n\nI don't get Downtown much during the day, however it's good to know there is a really good option for lunch and breakfast.  \n\nI was also surprised to find out there are 2 locations, the second location is on Smithfield.
