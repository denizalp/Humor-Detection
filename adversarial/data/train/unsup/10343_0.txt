This building along Desert Inn has been owned\/leased a number of times.  Most will remember it for being Jaguars many years ago.  There are new people involved with the nightclub now and it's not a gentlemen's club anywhere but a nightclub with a Latin theme.\n\nI came here to see a weekday evening show called \"Bonita Banana,\" a Latin themed show with live music.  The club was set up for a smaller number of people--perhaps 100--at small cocktail tables and some booths along two of the walls.\n\nThere was live music from a band on the second floor overlooking the stage.  The band was great and the lead singer's vocals were really sung nicely.\n\nParking is easy in front.  The staff was very welcoming.  My one complaint would be the pioce of drinks--$6 for a plastic cup of Coke?\n\nOne tip--if you plan to head west on DI after the show, head to Spring Mountain when leaving the parking lot and go to Valley View and then to DI.  If you go out to DI instead, you can only make a right and it takes you on the super arterial.
