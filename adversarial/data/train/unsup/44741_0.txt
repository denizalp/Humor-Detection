Really good Korean food! Definitely one of the best in Mississauga. Their selection is limited, but the quality is very high due to that. Side dishes, like the beansprouts, were very fresh and tasty, and the main dish itself is great and very flavourful. I love the purple rice they have. I came with two other people and our bill was around $30 including tax and tip. Will definitely come back.
