So Sarah G, our own professional food snob, met me for lunch and brought me a sprinkles cupcake.  It was in a cute little box.  This is where I get a little perturbed.  It has its OWN BOX.  What a waste!  I understand they want it to be cutesy and all, but I'm one of those people who wants to save the environment.\nthe cupcake was good, but not great.  I was expecting to make a mess in my \"Make me Yelp\" boyshorts, but didn't.  It was the vanilla milk chocolate.  Chocolate frosting was really sweet and it was covered in sprinkles (duh!).  The cake was fluffy and moist, but not as moist and I like.  I guess I was expecting to be blown away, but it was like the cupcakes my sister made for my sobrina's 5th birthday party.  With it's own freaking box.
