After taking a quick look around when I entered this establishment, I was fairly certain they garnished their pizzas with \"magic\" mushrooms. The decor was definitely awesome with so much to look at. Straight out of the Beatles \"Magical Mystery Tour\" album cover. Not very ironically enough, there was a pizza named magical mystery....which we ordered. I'm pretty sure there was a metal sculpture of Captain Jack Sparrow in an arch in the wall as well. Nothing quite says pizza like Bob Dylan album covers and pirates. \n\nMy friend and I came here on a weeknight around 7 pm, so I didn't experience the long wait like some of the other Yelpers. Though I could tell that it had the potential for super crowds. It was indeed on the pricey side, however, the pizza itself was pretty damn delicious.\n\nWe ordered half The Magical Mystery and half  The Red Skin Potato Pie. I tried the MM first and thought it was too good to top...then I tried the potato pie...Potatoes on a pizza is the best carb\/starch overload I have ever had the experience of consuming. It had some of the best combinations of flavors. I'm wiping the saliva off my keyboard even now as I write about it. \n\nI really feel like a pizza place can only be judged by its regular pizza. Pepperoni, cheese, sausage, etc. Seeing as this is a specialty pizza place, I think I am confident in the 4 star rating. As far as specialty pizzas go, this is one of the better places I've tried. It's different and fun. One day I'll come back for a plain cheese pizza and put it through some real tests...
