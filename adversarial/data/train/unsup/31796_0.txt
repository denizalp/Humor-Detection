Great and quick service. Very friendly!  And has discounts on occasion. $2.25 any garment* to dry clean!  Plus, it has a US Post Office counter there too, so you can ship and mail out envelopes, boxes, etc without the long wait at the Post Office! (You can't beat that! Especially during the holiday season!)
