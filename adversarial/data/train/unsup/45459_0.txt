My husband and I enjoy the food and liked to support this family operated restaurant in our neighborhood...but we will not be going back.  We went for lunch a few days ago and ordered a smothered gollo and a chimi gollo (comes with sour cream and guacamole...asked if they would put these on the side of the chimi). No drinks, no sides. When I went up to pay, our total was over $24. I expressed surprise at the amount and was told we ordered the chimi wrong and so the sour cream and guac was $5.50! I am not sure how we ordered it wrong...or why cashier was not willing to include the price in with the chimi since the menu states that they come with it.  The food tasted good (though surprisingly the chimi was as soft as my burro...did not appear or taste like it had been fried long enough)...but we still left with a bad taste in our mouth.  So sad. I could not help thinking of all the groceries I should have bought instead.
