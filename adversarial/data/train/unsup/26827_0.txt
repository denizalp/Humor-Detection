I'm a big fan of Saddle Ranch but not this location. I got charged $25 for 2 drinks and I had to sit next to a dirty dish rag and a beer tower that had been tapped for at least an hour. Drinks were actually less expensive inside the stadium by $10. I think I'll stick to the one in Scottsdale and actually save money.
