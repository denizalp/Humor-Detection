If \"MONEY\" is another word for Chili's type food at a much higher price, then yes this place is \"MONEY\".\n\nWe got up a bit early and wanted breakfast\n\nWe had a choice of Hash House A Go Go  which is proven and awesome or this new place........\"You chose poorly sir\"\n\nAverage breakfast is between 15-20 and the menu is quite small - I think it was roughly 7 items from eggs to French Toast.  OK less choices are sometimes a good thing.\n\nI get that it is Vegas but having just gone to Mesa Grill the night before for a awesome celebrity chef restaurant dinner, I guess I expected a bit more.\n\nMy buddy ordered chicken fried bacon and eggs.  I'm going to say they were \"MONEY\" again to be smart ass.  It looked awful and I'm guessing by how much was left at the end that it wasn't good\n\nI'm sure he would love his money back for this \"MONEY\" dish.  Overcooked breaded bacon, rock hard biscuit, and average eggs.\n\nI ordered a burrito.  It was just OK.  Nothing special - eggs, potatoes, sausage....blah blah blah.  Nothing I've not had before.  I would rather it had been smaller and a bit more than just \"MONEY\" (sorry). Our bill with coffees was around 50 bucks.\n\nThere are so many choices that this could easily be passed up with no effort.
