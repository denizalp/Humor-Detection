My wife and i regularly come here for a late dinner. It's a really cozy place but after several visits I have to recommend everyone going late at night to call ahead and make sure Roy is serving. He's always great. The alternate server, I believe his name is chris(heavy set, receding hair and thin facial hair) is incredibly disrespectful and unprofessional. He locks the door at night and pretends the place is closed, and makes crass, dirty jokes when socializing with customers. Many occasions we've seen customers become irritated with his serving behavior and some have walked out because of it. Village Pub is a great place but call ahead and make sure Roy is your late night server.
