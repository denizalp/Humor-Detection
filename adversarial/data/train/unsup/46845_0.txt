After purchasing my Focus from Park Ford, I will probably never go to any other dealer ever again. I was at work and they allowed my husband to take the car off the lot, all the way to Barberton, so I could test drive it on my lunch break. Who does that?! Anyway, I fell in love with the car and decided to buy it. I went to the dealer as soon as I got out of work that day and went home with the car once all the paperwork was signed. Super easy! The staff are very laid back and do not try to play games with you. You either want to buy a car or you don't and they let YOU make that decision. I received a hand written thank you card from the salesman I dealt with that day and it was very sincere. Made me feel like he really did appreciate my business.
