I usually go to a different salon but the lady there I like left, so I thought I would give this place a try do to a co worker loving this place. \n\nIt was awful! I went in for a fill and gel polish. I was greeted with friendliness.  Sat down and was trying to go through gel polish color and I barley could look because she grabbed my hands to remove my previous gel color. So the color I have I'm very upset about. It's definitely not the color I was looking for. Lady was very unhelpful with helping me choose a good color for what I was wanting. She made excuses to why she couldn't help. Then she asked if I wanted shorter. I said yes and she made they way shorter than I wanted! She didn't even asked how much she just started cutting them now. My fill barley felt like a fill. It looks awful to me. I fear my nails will break soon. My nails look bubbly and non natural looking. I definitely won't be going back here!\n\nI called this morning to explain how much I really dislike my nails. The lady was VERY rude and said it's my fault! HORRIBLE SERVICE! Never again. \n\nSave your time and money and go else where!
