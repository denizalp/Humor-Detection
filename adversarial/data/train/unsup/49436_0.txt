After going to Apple twice and not getting results I decided to find a place to replace the battery in my IPhone.  The store was clean and customer service was great.  They replaced the battery in less than 30 minutes while I waited.  Not sure if it fixed the problem, but hopefully it did!  I would recommend them to anyone who needs IPhone repair.
