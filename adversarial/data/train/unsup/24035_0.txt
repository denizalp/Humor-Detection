If I had kids, I could definitely see myself spending a good chunk of my afternoon here.\n\nThe Downtown Container Park is a fenced-in sanctuary of unique dining and drinking, entertainment, and boutique shopping.  The \"fenced-in\" part (with a friendly, yet stern security guard at the entrance) is what keeps the riff raff of downtown Las Vegas out, and allows for an extremely safe vibe and super clean atmosphere inside.\n\nThe shipping containers which house the shops and restaurants surround the large outdoor quad area, and there's a substantial kids play area in the center of it all.  There's enough slides, toys, and things for them to climb to potentially keep busy for hours, or at least tire them out by 9pm (when the Container Park becomes 21+ only).\n\nIf you don't have kids, the Downtown Container Park is definitely still worth checking out.  If you do, it's an absolute must during your Las Vegas vacation!
