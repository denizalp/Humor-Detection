I would give GCU zero stars if I could.  Let me start by saying I have attended GCU's online for a year and have a 3.8 GPA, so I am not a disgruntled student.  I also am an adult who graduated from High School over 30 years ago.  I am providing this review because I didn't see anything in my research prior to signing up for the school that would have lead me to not enroll.  The online program requires you to do \"busy\" work, such as post twice to discussion questions, then you must have 3 days worth of posts where you respond to your fellow students.  Now in theory, this is great.  Since we are online students, we need to interact with our classmates, but when the responses are simply, \"Great Job\", or, \"I liked your post on....\", there is no educational benefit to this.  I also asked 4 different times to take more than one class and was brushed off each time.  I feel this For-Profit College is all about their profits and not about what is best for the student.\n\nI would never recommend this school to anyone.  At least the online program is horrible.  I even question if the professors were real teachers.   FYI, the math courses require you to sign up for another website and pay money to use that forum.  I have no problem doing this, but it would have been nice to know that my already expensive tuition didn't cover this.  I also don't understand why the homework on that math site had over 100 questions each.  I had assignments of over 200 questions due per week.  I get that we are in college, but I am also a full time employee and a husband and father.  I don't understand how answering 200 college level math problems in a class that is supposedly designed to help me teach math to elementary kids is helpful.  RUN AWAY from this school quickly.  There are plenty of other options that are better and less expensive.\n\nEx-Student majoring in Special Education and K-12
