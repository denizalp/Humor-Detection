I met with Tiffany today and had a very awkward and less than pampering experience. During my chemical peel she washed my face, slapped the peel on and sent me on my way. She also got solution in my left eye which stung very badly. To make things worse she kept cracking jokes, calling me a one eye momma multiple times. Tonight I'm experiencing some blurriness in the eye she got chemicals in and I have an appointment with my optometrist on Monday. If there is damage to my eye, it is not going to be very funny. She also didn't apply the chemical peel in some areas of my face and I had to return back and have her add the peel in that specific area. Upon my arrival she stated that she had just purchased a new bottle of this specific peel because a previous customer complained that the same peel applied didn't work. She mentioned she was unaware the chemical peel had a shelf life. I left feeling uneasy and disappointed at spending over $100. I've been starring at my face all day and the only thing changing is 3 red spots on my right cheek. The rest of my face is exactly how it is any other day. There is no tightness or redness or flaking. Absolutely nothing. Needless to say, I am contacting the owner of this establishment on Monday and will expect a full refund on my Amex because ripping people off and trying to blind them is against the law.\nI picked this place based off of the reviews I found on Yelp. Tiffany told me that she has persuaded people in leaving reviews by offering them discounts. That's not very authentic.
