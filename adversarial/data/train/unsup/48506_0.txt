Do not waste your money. This is probably the WORST golf course I've played. I feel like an idiot to have paid $100 to have played here. There are patches of dead grass on every fairway, the greens are in terrible shape, and one of our carts quit on us. Not to mention that you can't find a yardage marker to save your life. Use the $100 per round to Invest in GPS systems in the carts like every other course we have played. The Marshals were on our ass all day to keep moving, but and we were right up on the group in front of us. If they have so much free time in their hands, water the damn grass. They can't even refill the soap dispensers in the bathroom, but at least the TV screens on the faucet were working. Save your money. These guys should be ashamed of themselves.
