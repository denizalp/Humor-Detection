I absolutely LOVE everything this store has to offer. It's conveniently located in the Arrowhead area and has a huge selection of goodies. Unfortunately, I have to give three stars instead of five because of how rude their employees are. \n\nI've been in there on different times and days and it seems they are all bitter, miserable women who either hate their job or hate to be asked questions. I actually had to ask for a store manager on one occasion because of how unhelpful and rude the ladies were on that particular trip. \n\nAgain, the store is fabulous and it has everything you could ever want... and seeing the other reviews, it seems other customers have also noticed how unfriendly the staff is. Hopefully a manager will start reading these reviews and retrain the employees on customer service.
