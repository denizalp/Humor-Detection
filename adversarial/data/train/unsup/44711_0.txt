One of my favorite places to come whenever I'm back in Arizona! Been coming to Top Golf for a couple years now, it's always a blast whether you know how to play or not! Be sure to come with a group and you'll barely put a dent in your wallet. The food is not incredible but good nonetheless. The Mexican sushi is one of my favorites here, give that a try! The wait can be long so be ready to wait up to an hour before a bay is open!
