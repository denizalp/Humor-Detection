If brown people could blush, I'd be blushing right now. Oh, calm down: I'm brown, I'm allowed to say these things.\n\nI'll give you a second to get over the shock.\n\nTime's up. So WHY would I be blushing you should be asking. Well, it's because I'm IN a Second Cup writing this review about ANOTHER Second Cup (SC). I'm performing a Yelp infedelity.  I'm somewhere, reminiscing about somewhere else. If this OTHER Second Cup is *SO* great, then why aren't I there you ask? Well because taking a trip to the SE. when I live in the north just doesn't make sense when it's as cold as it is today. But trust me, if the weather was on my side, I'd be at the 'other' SC in a heart beat.\n\nI didn't think one Second Cup could really be that much better than another, but as you know, I'm a COMPLETE coffee joint snob. it's close to impossible to get 5 stars from Sapna G. when it comes to coffee joints because I spend so much time in them, and well, let's face it: I'm picky. If I'm going to be spending hours on end somewhere, then it's got to be close to perfect, and mark my words: this SC is PERFECT.\n\nFor starters, they've got plants all over the place. I LOVE plants and they make my lungs happy, which in turn makes me happy. Here's a slew of other things I LOVE about this place:\n- It's HUGE\n- It's never crowded\n- It's decorated in a contemporary way. I've never seen anything quite like it. They've got a statue of Buddha, beautiful accents throughout and urban furniture.\n- They have a fireplace and the mantelpiece is beautifully decorated\n- You can choose how to spoil your booty : sofa, standard chair or huge lounge chair?\n- Free and unlimited WIFI\n- Great service\n- Clean washrooms (again, decorated with floral arrangements - cacti to be precise)\n- Pussy willows throughout the place - yeah you're right, I just wanted to say it\n\nAs you can tell, this SC rocks. Totally and completely. It's the perfect urban and contemporary place for me to sip some java and watch the hours wither away.
