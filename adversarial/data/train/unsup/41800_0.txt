The Bellusso staff is very helpful and they know how to treat their customers right.  I was very impressed by their watch technician Ernesto Veles who has over 50 years of watch repair experience and training.  If you're anywhere on the Strip and in need of luxury watches or their service, don't waste your time anywhere else--go straight to Bellusso in the Palazzo hotel\/casino.  There's just no comparison!
