I _think_ I've located the right spot to review. Three bakeries in the same place and two on top of one another... who do you think you are, Starbucks?\n\nI visited and purchased food from the Bouchon Bakery on the first floor of the Grand Canal Shoppes area. It's just off the Strip near B&B Burger and the outdoor gondola ride. We happened upon another Bouchon Bakery when we went upstairs afterward, and the original location is somewhere inside The Venetian. We found this one to be the most convenient, and it had a slightly wider selection than its overhead neighbor.\n\nI took two items to go and ate them within a few hours. The Croissant ($3.75) is a go-to pastry, and the version here is golden brown outside and chewy outside, with enough buttery flavor for anyone but diehard butter fans. Aside from how easily some of the outer layer flakes off, it's comparable to any other versions in town both on-Strip and off-Strip.\n\nThe Kouign Amann ($4.50) is another classic, although it's tougher to find. It's both more difficult to make and less popular. This version does have a lot of the right crispy and chewy textures and the expected sugary flavors. I think this one cheats a little though; you can easily see a glassy sugar layer on the flat side of the kouign amann, and the dough just doesn't have enough layers. It's way too flat compared to other good versions that I've had. However, if I was blindfolded, I would likely have no issue.\n\nAs long as parking stays free at the Palazzo and the Venetian, I'd consider making regular stops to this Bouchon Bakery for some pastries. My first taste was good enough (let's say 3.75 stars averaged between the two bites), so I'm optimistic about similar results if I venture into the cookies, macarons, or other baked goods (cinnamon rolls, monkey bread, and so on).
