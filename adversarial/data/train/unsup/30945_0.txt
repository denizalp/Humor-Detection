Whoever Joe is, he's seems done everything right. Walked into Joe's and found a small line up with customer waiting for their orders, despite that, the place was rocking and there  was still a place to sit and eat so table turnover is quick. The menu is a simple 2 page card with all the favorite offerings of Shawarma, Steak, Burgers, Souvlaki and Falafel. I'd describe joe's as North America meets Greece type of menu. \n\nWalked up to the cash and ordered the Shawarma combo plate plate at a steep $15.50, based on previous menu pics, prices have gone up considerably over the past couple of years, some items have nearly doubled! (I've notice this trend from many popular places on here...because they can I suppose). \n\nThere is no meat shawarma, that is offred as a pork souvlaki type dinner. The combo meal was offered with rice and either fries or salad, I opted for the salad (makes me feel like I made a good choice. I was given a receipt with a number and waited to be called up to collect my order.\n\nSat down and took my first bite, the food was fantastic!  The chicken was tender and well seasoned, it came with a small hot pepper spread and tzatziki side which went very well together. The rice was cooked to perfection (it was a yellow in color and flavored type rice). The greek side salad was served with feta, tomatoes and iceberg lettuce.\n\nOverall, it was a splendid meal, good food, almost on par with a higher end place. I hope prices don't continue to go up as I'd like to return with the family more often but trading in my youngest for a meal just doesn't seem right no matter how good it is.
