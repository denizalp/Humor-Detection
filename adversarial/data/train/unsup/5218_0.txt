Expectations set...you know what you're going to get. Or do you?\n\nHostess - Unnecessary. Overly exuberant greeting, gushing about the weather, awkwardly talking us to the table. \n\nServer - Excellent. Inital greeting and throughout, impeccable. Thank you for your expertise. \n\nWater\/bus - Terrible. Awkward timing in clearing of plates, coming too soon and then poor water service.\n\nAppetizer - tartare, good but only memorable insofar as the onions overpowered the dish\n\nPorterhouse - perfectly seasoned\/aged, cooked to temp\n\nLobster & tenderloin - miss - poached correctly (not tough) but flavorless and \"tough tenderloin\" though \"cooked to\" temp was correct.\n\nOverall- my meal was lukewarm, scalloped potatoes were scorchingly hot, only porterhouse \"just right\"\n\nCocktails - Superb. Straightforward Grey Goose martini (garnish as requested) & Gentleman Jack, rocks. \n\nWine - Nice. Sample provided and adequate pour. \n\nTo go items - Wretched. Lasting impression\" \/ \"take-away\" marketing, if you will. We requested bone (still ample meat) only to find \"no bone.\"  Main breach: $200+ meal with heavy items such as scalloped potatoes & lobster mac requires better than flimsy boxes. Somehow too, leftovers literally adhered to outside sticker. Lose the cheap boxes! Absolutely unappetizing. If you're going to call \"green!\" (Re: packaging) then instruct staff not to find it unusual if a patron requests the leftover bread from initial basket \"to go.\"  Waste is waste. \n\nIt's not in my expectations that Cap Grille would be so inconsistent nor that my annoyance would persist each time I see the leftovers in the fridge. Second time that we're left dissatisfied so more than likely, the last.
