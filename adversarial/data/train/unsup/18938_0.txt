They may have a clean establishment but they're very stingy when it comes to making their sandwiches. When it comes to making a 6 inch Subway sandwich you need three tomatoes not two. When you deliver cookies to your customers you should give them the cookies and not make them reach for it. Maybe it's the fact we are in uptown Phoenix Arizona but I was very unhappy about their customer service so be careful about coming to this location. Fuck it, in fact the entire franchise has gone down in the last 15 years, and you really don't get what you pay for.
