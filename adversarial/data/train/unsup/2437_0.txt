I think this is where the ASU sorority b!tches go for employment when Christie's Cabaret isn't hiring. \n\nThe service isn't the worst I've had, but they aren't over-the-top friendly either.  The decor and atmosphere is very cool and I loved the vibe but the food tastes like taco bell.  Actually make that Filiberto's (Filisquirtos) because Taco Bell tastes pretty damn good after too many drinks. \n\nI liked the house margarita a lot and a friend talked me into a watermelon margarita which was pretty good too but it wasn't blended too well (we were a group of 14 on a saturday so maybe they got busy and couldn't blend the margaritas...I don't know).  \n\nI'd go back for the house margaritas and an appetizer (chips and guacamole) but I don't think I'll eat dinner here again. \n\nTry Barrio Cafe...that place freaking ROCKS!
