This place was very nice. It had a darker Irish bar feeling to it, but minus the bad smell :). The drinks were good, staff friendly. \n\nI had the shrimp and grits first , amazing dish if you're fond of goat cheese entrees. Then had the lamp pops.... Also great. Finished up with the Mac and cheese. It was also good! I would recommend this place. Nice work
