I'm starting to become a regular now that I'm within an easy walking distance of this charming coffee shop in Market Square.  I love the wall of coffee smell that hits you the moment you walk in the door.  Hell, I love the wall of coffee itself; they sell whole beans too, and there are just shelves and shelves of it on the left side of the entrance when you walk inside.  They also sell teas, candies, mugs, French presses, moka pots, and the like.  And that's all before you get to the counter in the back, where I've always had a friendly face to give me a hot cup of coffee.  They feature a new roast and a couple of flavors per day, and will be happy to talk to someone who needs guidance in picking which one.  The only thing that hasn't been on point  in all my visits is the scone situation.  Granted, I have only tried one, but it was not great.  It seems the batter was overmixed and not containing enough butterfat, and the product was dry and chewy instead of light and flaky.  Trust, I ate every bite with a sip of coffee regardless, but I probably won't order one again.  Instead, I'll stick to the great coffee and leave the pastry to one of the many other shops that specialize in those.
