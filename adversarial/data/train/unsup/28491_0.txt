I always read about their amazing cookies (which I have yet to try), but I'm a HUGE fan of their croissants...  \n\nI think that they have the BEST pain au chocolat that I have tasted in the city (yes, a big statement, but I really think it's true...), and their almond croissants are pretty awesome as well.  All of their croissants are beautifully made & flaky...and they really do remind me of Paris!\n\nI've always had good service experience, but I only go to the coffee\/croissant counter.  Small pet peeve is that they don't have any highchairs for my little one.  (She likes the croissants, too!)
