My boyfriend and I tried this theater for the first time tonight. Upon first impression, we really liked it! The girls at the bar were great, letting us sample the wine before we bought a bottle. We then proceeded to our theater, and reserved seats, which were amazing recliners!!! So comfy!!!! (Side note, my leg is broken, so it was so great to be able to keep it elevated, in addition to the comfort). \n\nSo far, so good, right? Well, 5 minutes into the previews, I changed my mind that I wanted some popcorn. So, I hobble out to the concession stand, stopping at the DISGUSTING bathroom on the way. Well, when I get there, the guys behind the counter won't even ask me what I want. Just say no, we are closed. Ok ok, we picked the last showing of Anchorman 2, at 10:40. I get it, it's late, but when I got out there, it wasn't even 11 pm yet!!! I looked at them, the full container of popcorn behind them, and asked \"are you sure? It's not even 11 yet?\" \nWell, they barely glanced up from their giggling and obnoxious music to look at me and SCREAM \"Closed!!!\" \nOk.... Sorry I bothered to try to give you money for something you already had made. And make you quit your socializing to help a patron. \nThe bar staff was great, the seats were comfy, everyone else was unhelpful and unfriendly. We bought our tickets online, so I can't say anything about the box office staff. \n\nSo in summary: if you go, get your snacks before the previews are over. Otherwise, you're out of luck.
