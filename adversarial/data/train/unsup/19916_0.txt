The first time I came to the park, I was by myself and just walked around, scoping things out.  It wasn't too busy that first time, as it was a December Friday morning before the holidays.  The second visit was today, January 2nd, 3:00pm, accompanied by my two little cousins, 4 and 6-year-old brothers, and my 17-year-old son.  Today the park was a beehive of activity with winter break still happening.  There were kids running helter skelter all over the tree house and adjacent playground; the little cousins were in heaven.  They immediately ran away from me once we entered the playground\/tree house area, which is nicely guarded by a security person at the gate.  This way, kids cannot escape the area without someone watching, resulting in the worst thing ever, a lost child.  Most parents\/guardians were either in the playground or right outside of it, keeping keen eyes on all the activity, which was plenty.  The teen spent the time exploring the shops of the park and making fun of the hipsters.  He tried to teach me how to detect said hipsters and I think it has to do with clothes and visible tattoos, but I'm still not sure.  For a breather, the boys and I went to ChillSpot by Sasapops, which is conveniently located right next to the playground.  Smoothies for the boys and halo-halo for me, then it was back to more running, jumping, and playing.  The grand finale was a group of drummers outside the entrance of the park.  They provided bongos, tambourines, cowbells, and other percussion instruments for kids to play in a circle, led by one energetic drummer in the middle.  The giant metal grasshopper sculpture out front spewed fire from its antennae and that added to the show.  All in all, we had a great time and I would highly recommend this place for kids of all ages, but especially children who will enjoy the playground.  My cousins can't stop talking about it so we'll be back soon.
