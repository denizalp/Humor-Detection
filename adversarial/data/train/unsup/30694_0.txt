I've been here a few times now and keep going back for the food but beware. The service is sub-par.  I've sat without anyone even coming to acknowledge me for 15 minutes at a time and just when I get up to leave they jump up to serve me.  There are a lot of servers standing around but they are not quick to wait on the customers.  The good news is the food arrives quickly and it's very good which is what keeps me going back. Just be prepared to be patient.
