On a Saturday, there is almost no one in this cafe. The perfect place to study. I don't know about the weekdays, but I liked this place. My espresso was good, my spinach pastry was good, the paintings on the wall were good, the colours were good, a beautiful little place. It's not very big. People come often to get a coffee and go. Everything was good! I suppose this place must be crowded during weekdays? Who knows! Good stuff here!
