Want a good place to people watch? Charlotte airport is one of the greatest places on earth to do so. If you sit here, at the bar, they come right up to you too. Last night I watched as a drunk redneck walked up to the bar and told his salary as he ordered. Then an attorney sat at the bar yelling on the phone about his day at work. The bartender, Neil puts up with a lot of crap. Last night he seemed in a worse mood than the first time I was there... he was still friendly though. \n\nI'm not exactly sure how, but this little airport bar is somehow affiliated with Dos Equis Mexican beer. But they also have several other beers on draft. The shots are a bit shabby. I watched as he poured them... he would tilt the measuring cup and then pour it, but they were about half of the size that they should've been.\n\nThe menu is actually Salsarita items. He types whatever you order in and then they bring it over from Salsaritas. I ordered and then got up, went to the bathroom and washed my hands and by the time that I got back, the food had arrived. So we didn't have the same issue that the other reviewers did. Unfortunately I forgot to ask for no sour cream and the nachos were covered in it, so I decided to walk over to Burger King and bring back my meal. Yep, I ate my BK right there. I figured what's the difference, they didn't make the Salsarita food there either.
