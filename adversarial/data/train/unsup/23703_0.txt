YES.  Must for Vegas.  The guys working there say a half yard is about 4 shots worth of alcohol ... add a test tube shot for one dolla!!!  Super delicious, amazing, wonderful, Vegas happiness...\n\nGet more than one flavor to mix it up!  I like pina colada and strawberry... The orange is good too.  For about $15 including tip, it is not bad - especially considering the cost of drinks at the club.\n\nBUT STAY AWAYYY FROM THE \"CHERRY BOMBS\" (maraschino cherries soaked in Everclear).  WTF was I thinking... don't do it unless you're crazy.  It tastes like downing a big glob of Purell hand sanitizer... except you have to let it sit in your mouth and chew it first.  UGHHH.
