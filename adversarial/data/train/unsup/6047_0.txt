Not bad spot for crêpes in Kensington Market. It's worth pointing out right off the bat that these aren't the French crêpes you're probably used to. They are a bit thicker and taste like they have been cooked a little longer than typical crêpes, but they're still pretty decent and you get a good portion.\n\nThey serve both sweet and savoury Hungarian crêpes (palacsinta) here. They are pretty specifically priced at $7.97, and they have a combo deal where you can get soup and crêpe or coffee and crêpe for ten bones. Not too shabby.\n\nThey serve espresso here also (49th Parallel) and have free Wi-Fi. Given that ALL the furniture is patio furniture, I'm not likely to spend too much time here to work, but I'll definitely stop by if I'm feeling in a crêpe-y mood.\n\nObligatory Title Pun: Don't shed this PALACSINTA.\n\nMenu Readability: Loosely wrapped in plastic. What up with that? Just laminate that beyotch.\n\nNeed to mention: They are licenced and have Mill Street and Flying Monkey on draught.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: I'm HUNGAR-ing for a better title pun.
