As everyone knows, Ich liebe deutsches essen (I love German food)!!!  So we decided to place an order via Amazon Restaurants.  We've ordered from Cafe Berlin twice.  First time was perfect, second time was not.  \n\nWe ordered exactly the same food both times.  3 orders of Pork Cordon Bleu with fried potatoes (not French fries, they will substitute), 2 sides of red garbage, 2 spaetzle's and 2 bread dumplings.  We asked for the gravy on the side.  The schnitzels were dry but still tasty, last time the cheese was oozing out.  \n\nThey didn't send any gravy.  Seems like a trivial issue, right? Well when you get containers of food that would typically have gravy and you've paid over $100 for delivery it's disappointing.  I get mistakes happen.  We called and \"reported\" it to the restaurant.  The woman on the phone was less than friendly and absolutely not empathetic at all.  Bread dumplings with no gravy and dry spatetzel is typical she said.  Well I disagree as the first time we ordered, gravy was sent.  It's like a staple.  Do you eat French fries without ketchup?? What's worse, she blamed the delivery driver!?  Not sure what I expected the woman to do as we lived far enough from the restaurant but a simple, \"I am so sorry\" would have been nice.  Needless to say, I chopped up an onion and some butter with some flour, water and German seasonings and made my own damn gravy.  Not sure if I'll be back as customer service here is lacking and she gave us the feeling that our business meant nothing.
