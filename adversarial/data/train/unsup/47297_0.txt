The location right by the shark tank pool is great. I had pizza and the fired mozzarella, both were excellent. I tried two other dishes from my group, spaghetti and a cream pasta dish... I'm glad I didn't order what they did but again mine was really good. I would absolutely recommend this place for a nice lunch!
