Full disclosure:  I'm UBER unvegan! While I do get really excited about fruits & veggies, I'm a total carnivore at heart.\n\nFOOD: What sorcery is this!!!???  No, but really, how is this vegan?  My friend & I devoured our nachos & 'unchicken' waffles in 3.2 seconds.  SO GOOD.  \n\nDRINKS: Their Dark & Stormy was pretty decent (extra gingery).  However, my friend was unimpressed with her Caesar.\n\nDESSERT: While we were completely stuffed by this point we 'forced' ourselves to try the Deep-Friend Banana Split - one of my better life choices.  I'm an official convert to coconut milk ice cream!\n\nVERDICT: Do not walk in expecting healthy vegan food.  This is really really really ridiculously good-tasting (and unhealthy) vegan bar food.  While the atmosphere doesn't exactly scream 'clean', the booths are cozy and the service impeccable.  My only constructive criticism would be to up the food presentation slightly.  I know it's only bar food, but I like the things going in my mouth to be instagram worthy.  Yes, you read that correctly.
