This place has four star quality food with one star quality customer service. We purchased a delivery order, and the lady on the phone was beyond rude. She interrupted me multiple times as I was placing my order. Treating me as though I was a hassle. What I was was a first time customer that got a very bad first impression. The delivery driver was very nice and the food was very good. This would've been a 5 star, but this lady made our first experience a lenient 3 star experience.
