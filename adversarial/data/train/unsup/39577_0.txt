I used to get my car washed here before the owner\/name change. I stopped by this past weekend and I was so happy to see Dana working here again. She is always so thorough and pays attention to details. I came back from a road trip and had a bunch of dead bugs all over the grill and windshield, she took the time to scrub them so that they would for sure be removed in the wash! Great employee! Do not get rid of her!!
