Not my first thought for chicken wings but my boyfriends seems to really like it and it is closer than my preferred spot. They aren't bad but definitely not the best. The first time I tried this place, the flavor was really good but the second time it was just mediocre. The service is always friendly and very polite. Prices are not bad and they have your typical flavors which makes it easy to order. I like that they have a drive thru because it makes it easier to order and get home to eat.
