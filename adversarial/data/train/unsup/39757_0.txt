A fabulous experience at Bareburger. We had top notch service and the food was fantastic and brought out relatively quickly. We never felt rushed. \n\nHigh quality, fresh ingredients all around. I had the Fire Quacker with beef instead of duck. The pickled jalapenos offered just the right amount of heat. None of the toppings overpowered the burger. \n\nMy partner had the standard and loved it. We shared the rings & fries side and enjoyed trying out all the sauces. \n\nThe Chocolate shake was excellent. Next time I will add peanut butter as per the waitress's suggestion. I had to try the standard one first!\n\nWe will definitely be going back.
