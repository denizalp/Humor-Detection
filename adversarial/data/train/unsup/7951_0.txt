What an experience and rush all at once.  Was a bit of a hike getting up to the first zip line.  Carrying the trolleys up a half mile hike can wear on you and burn your legs getting up if you're out of shape (hence yes I was out of shape).  However, the end result is worth the pain because you get to feel a rush of freedom and flying while zipping down the mountain and overlooking Boulder city.\n\nOn the third zip line I dropped my iPhone and it got damaged pretty bad.  One of the guides, Keegan went down and retrieved it for me.  Totally went above and beyond the call of duty.  Especially with how steep the hill was.  Keegan, Clinton and Andrew were all great guides with a nice sense of humor.  If you're a local and haven't done this please make some time to go and you won't regret this experience.  Would highly recommend for anyone's bucket list!
