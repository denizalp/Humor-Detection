Dined at Jim Gould's last night with a group of old friends.  The restaurant was not very busy and we were happy to be seated in the small private room.  Most of us ordered the dry aged steaks, which were very good.  Served with buttery mashed potatoes and haricot vert. Thought it was telling about CU diners when the server felt the need to tell us that they were \"little green beans\" or maybe we just didn't look very sophisticated!  Others had the scallop special and ahi tuna salad.  Wine was half price - still pretty expensive at that!\n\nSince I had met Chef Benjamin previously through his Parkland classes, he had invited our group for a kitchen tour after our meal.  We all enjoyed that.\n\nSeems like Jim Gould's is on its way back up as a fine dining restaurant.
