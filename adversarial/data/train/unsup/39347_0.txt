Once you know North and South (it will always be known as Joey's to me), you will never be able to go to a chain like Red Lobster again. Great food, friendly service, and a comfortable atmosphere. The BBQ sauce selection is a favorite for kids and adults and are complementary to smoked meats or French fries. I recommended the cornbread as an appetizer to share-it's a great deal at ~$2.
