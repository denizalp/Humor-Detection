It was not until early 2017 that La Bonita Supermarket became a known entity to someone who'd previously split time between Smith's and Albertson's for all their shopping needs, yet from the very first time 6-for-$1 Cucumbers and 33-cent-per-pound Tomatoes were discovered there was no turning back, a reliance on over 35lbs of Vegetables as part of a weekly eating plan not only generating great savings, but the store's music and clientele also making for a far more enjoyable experience than its competitors.\n\nNot sold on anti-GMO hype or the benefits of \"Organic\" outside of perhaps taste and color, a scientific background capable off interpreting cited 'studies' unswayed by little more than anecdote, it was not until a colleague brought a box of Pastries from the store that the left half of the Market roused interest, an early visit on Friday morning finding La Bonita's Panaderia humming with several products lining racks and cases not only fresh but still warm. \n\nAs much a full-service Cafeteria as it is a Grocer, everything from Tacos and Tortillas to Aguas Frescas and Ceviche made fresh daily, it was after a brief perusal of several counters surrounding a central seating area that selections were made from shelves and chillers, a woman of intermediate English fluency describing several unlabeled items ranging from forty to sixty cents that were added up and carefully placed in a box for less than the price of one Concha at Manhattan's ATLA.\n\nSpending less than fourteen dollars on fourteen items including two wedges of Cake plus a $1.99 cup full of creamy Rice Pudding topped in Cinnamon and Raisins, a portion most certainly advised for sharing, it was starting out with a soft Pastry horn filled with Vanilla Cream that La Bonita's base was found to be similar to that of other Mexican Bakeries in town though the 'dryness' that discourages many Caucasians is not quite as prominent thanks to what seems to be a bit more Butter or Evaporated Milk.\n\nProgressing in no particular order, halves off most items set aside for later or discarded, it was prior to enjoying a still-warm Concha that was as good or better than many found in Mexico City that a lengthy Pastry stick filled with Guava Jam was snapped in two, a brisk break seeing plenty of buttery flakes fall to the floor while flavors were expectedly sweet but far from cloying.\n\nOffering at least a dozen shapes and sizes of Sugar Cookies, the Tricolor a bit less granular and more enjoyable than that with Sprinkles, it was with a nippled item similar to a Concha known as \"Lima\" that La Bonita's best un-filled Roll was found, the Egg-washed top creating a fluffier core and taste less reliant on Sugar.\n\nAt this point turning to items tucked away in a separate case in front of the Bakery, assistance from staff required to gain access, pricing and descriptions, suffice it to say that any additional effort is justified by not only a soft Egg Bread topped in Cream Cheese but also a baked Roll of Cinnamon and Coconut, though neither are quite as exceptional as Corn Pudding that sets up like Flan studded with sweet Kernels and a top that is toasted soft and tan.\n\nNot particularly wowed by a \"Jelly Roll\" that sees most of the Artificial Strawberry filling absorbed by sugared Bread, the yeasted Donut split and filled with Vanilla Pudding a better choice for those seeking something super sweet, it is also unfortunate that La Bonita's Carrot Cake seems to be nothing but Cinnamon, Nutmeg and Cloves in a White Cake Base without much Fruit or Vegetables while the Tres Leches fares better in the form of sopping wet Angelfood, though it is still a far cry from the best in town.\n\nTHREE AND A HALF STARS:  Taken as a whole La Bonita is an unquestionable contender for Las Vegas' most enjoyable shopping experience while the Bakery is just hit n' miss, though low prices and excellent customer service make even large orders a fairly low risk\/high reward undertaking.
