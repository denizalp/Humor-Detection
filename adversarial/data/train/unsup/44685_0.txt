If I could leave 0 stars I would. So it took a week and 2 phone calls to get a call back. Then they set up an appointment for a Tuesday morning, then called that morning to say they would have to come another day. Then when they did come, they didn't realize we had dual flow toilets (no one asked when we made appt) so they didn't have the right parts with them. Also, after examining our toilets, he suggested that we have cheap toilets and might be best to replace all 3.  Couldn't understand how needing new valve\/or O-ring type thing turned in to needing to replace all 3 toilets. Stated he would see about finding the right parts and get back to us. And that it would prob be around $250-$300 to fix it if he could find parts. We would have gladly paid that, had they gotten back to us. But now it's been over 2 weeks and haven't heard a thing. But it all worked out for best because my father came to look at it and was able to fix it for $48 in parts. \nSO STAY AWAY!! They are not organized and nor timely and will try to gouge you for more $$$.
