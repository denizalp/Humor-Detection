I suggest driving the 13 mile scenic loop to get familiar with the area and also take in the scenery. The scenic loop is open every day of the year however the time of day it's open changes depending on the time of year. The hours for the Visitors Center are 8:00 AM to 4:30 PM everyday with times changing on certain holidays. Stop here and ask any questions you might have about the area and places you are interested on checking out to get any additional helpful info. While at the Visitors Center, don't forget to check out the turtle habitat! Plenty of locals and tourists come to Red Rock  for different experiences. Red Rock is dog friendly, which is great because my dog, Brownie, loves exploring out here and seeing other dogs along our journey. You can rock climb, hike, bike, picnic, camp, see historical sites and check out plenty of plants and wildlife. There are hiking trails for any age and level and there are several guided tours throughout year, even some late at night that offer great views of the sky and stars. I have loved coming here to Red Rock since I was a kid. Whether for school and summer camp field trips, events with family and friends or just to escape city life, I've never been bored with this beautiful place! One thing to keep in mind is while there are shaded areas you will encounter a lot of exposed sun, so sunscreen and water is crucial. It's always important to stay on designated trails and leave the plants, rocks and animals be. Pack out what you pack in please. There's nothing like a nice picnic out here, but there's no need for trashh to be left behind, so packing it all back out just means you have manners and respect for all of us who want to enjoy this fantastic outdoor heaven. Respect, protect and enjoy our desert! \n\n#SaveRedRock
