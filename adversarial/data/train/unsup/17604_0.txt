Very UNPROFESSIONAL and a HORRIBLE experience!!! I would never take my dogs back here again. Called them at 9:30 asking if we need an appointment and they said no just bring your 3 dogs in. \n\nI get there at 10:30 and the girl at the front inspects my dogs and says they should be done around 2:30-3:00. I call them at 2:45 and they said they should be done around 3:30-4:00. They did look busy so I gave them until 4:30 to come back. \n\nI walk in at 4:30 and I still see them working \non one of my dogs. I thought they were finishing up but then they tell me they didn't even start on the last one. They said it would be another hour before they would be done.\n\n Instead of apologizing they went on the defensive saying my dogs were matted up and that they were too busy and that I should have let them know that time was going to be an issue. 6 hours should have been more then enough time to get 3 dogs done and if it wasn't a simple courtesy call would have been nice. I ended up leaving with only 2 dogs done and they had the nerve to try to charge me an extra 20$ saying they had given my 3rd dog a shower.
