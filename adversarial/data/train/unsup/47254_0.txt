I'm staying at the hotel for the week and it's my first full day here.  Went down and grabbed some food with my dad.    Fish tacos were pretty good and server was nice.    Got my usual picture that I get at Hooters.    So that was good.   Can't complain really.  Went a second time.    Still just as good.
