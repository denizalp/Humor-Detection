This BAKERY has been here for as long as I can remember. \nPhoenix Proper fun place to visit at any time. Over the years we have gotten many cakes, breads and rolls here.\nAll good and a reasonable price as well.\nThey also bake a lot of things for other shops ,such as AJ's . Yes the grocery store.\nSo you know they are good just with that alone.\nIf you need a cake at a reasonable price, this is your place.
