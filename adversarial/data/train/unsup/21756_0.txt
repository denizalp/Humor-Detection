In light of the events that have happened in Florida I decided I should look into possibly getting a gun.  I had heard of tombstone tactical so I thought I would go there to educate myself on firearms.  I was not in the building longer then 2 mins and heard 3 inappropriate comments about gay people, by the staff so I didn't stay. I will never come here again I will take my business to a company with less bigotry.
