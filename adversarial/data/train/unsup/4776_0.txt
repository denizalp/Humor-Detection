2.5 stars \n\nComing to Club Cayo Coco with high expectation, I left disappointed at least I have excellent Tapas serving companion for the night. \n\nWe stopped by for an after dinner snack.. yes people can snack all the time.. afternoon, Prue dinner, midnight! \n\nThe interior is nice and cozy.. or you can say it is a little especially when I got stuck at the corner... \n\nSpicy Potatoes (5.95) \n- worst dish of the night, the sauce itself is not spicy tasted like something from the jar.. \n\nStuffed Mushrooms ($6.95) and Cod w\/ parsley Crust ($8.95) \n- not bad but forgettable \n\nCrab Cakes ($9.95) 2 orders and Cod w\/ parsley Crust ($8.95) \n- One of the better Tapas dish we ordered for the night.. \n\nFried Oysters ($12) 2 orders \n- though quite good but it is too pricey!! \n\nWe did not realize that there were a minimum of 2 items per person and desserts does not count!! It was not mentioned in the on line menu, but so be it... since it might be the first and the last time I will come here. \n\nCherri and Molten Chocolate Cake are both good choices.. I think I like the dessert much better than the Tapas they offer. \n\nI find most of the tapas dishes they have are deep fried and I felt I am eating pub's food and they just jacked up the price by putting fancy Spanish name on it! \n\nService here was a little spotty.. especially our waiter was as clumsy as me and kept knocking down everything... \n\nAlmost $30 with tax and tips per person with no drinks!
