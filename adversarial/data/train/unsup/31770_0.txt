This Nordstrom location is great simply because they have so much product.  They carry a lot of high end designer fashions, but also carry plenty of more affordable lines as well.  I got to use the personal styling service today and Edgar was great.  He picked out a bunch of dresses for me to try on for an upcoming wedding and I found one that I liked very much.  I emailed him beforehand about the shoes I was going to wear and he selected dresses to go with them.     Nordstrom really does strive to provide excellent customer service.  I find this to be true across the board whether I'm spending $1000 on a handbag or $50 on a pair of sneakers.  I have had this experience at multiple locations and find that the employees want to ensure that you have gotten the product\/experience that you need.
