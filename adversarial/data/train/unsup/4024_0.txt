Came to Container Bar by accident the first time.... and keep going back on purpose.\nWhat a fun idea!!!! I love the fact that it's such a small space, and the tiny lights at night, but mostly its a patio you can hear your table on!! Its not overcrowded, its just nice.\nI find it a little pricy for some things, but it is a fun place to stop. I love the infused waters and I especially love that we won a gift card for tweeting a photo! The staff are great although the last time we went the girl hadn't tried much of the food or drinks so her recommendations were a little lacking...
