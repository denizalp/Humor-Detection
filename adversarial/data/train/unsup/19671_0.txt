Hands down the best place in Vegas. It's comfort food with a western vibe. So many flavors in each dish. And the great thing is when you order the food and share it all its not only an experience for your taste buds but also such a great social experience as well. \nFavorite dishes: Stuffed Date wrapped in Bacon and stuffed with Chorizo. Charred Octopus. Mushroom flatbread. Steak Tar Tar. Honey Truffle. \n\nThis is only a very small list of the dishes that I love. \n\nMy favorite drink MY BOY BLEU this drink is so amazingly perfect. It has Rosemary infused vodka, egg white, citrus liquor and does not disappoint. This is def worth going to Hearthstone for. \n\nGive this place a try. I love it and I bring my family in every time they come here and they cannot get enough. Great job!
