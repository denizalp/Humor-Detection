I have seen LOVE four times now. I an't get enough. I am so in love with this show. I don't know how it could possibly be better. What amazes me is that the cast seems to as thrilled to be performing the show as I am to watching it. Fantastic performers, fantastic costumes, and absolutely unbelievable set design.
