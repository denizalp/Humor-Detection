Holy crap! \n\nMassive wine selection? Check. Bottles I've been craving but thought were only available in Italy? Check check. Organized by not only varietal and style but also a section for top-rated wines (for ease of quick shopping)? Checkmate. \n\nOh, and the prices? Totally reasonable. \n\nI wish we had something like this in Portland.
