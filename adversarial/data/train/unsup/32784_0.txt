If I could, I'd give 4.5 stars.  We celebrated our anniversary here this past weekend.  \n\nThe restaurant itself is extremely charming and in cooler temperatures, the patio is probably a wonderful place to enjoy a meal.  \n\nDo not miss the craft cocktails.  They are interesting, unique, and tasty.  \n\nWe shared the brisket on a biscuit and the crab fondue.  The brisket was phenomenal.  The fondue was tasty as well but it did tasty unfortunately fishy.  \n\nThe filet was perfectly prepared and the brie and basil fingerling potatoes were delicious.  My husband's lamb was enjoyable but he was disappointed to find that the kitchen had substituted peas for fava beans.  He let the waiter know and they were kind enough to buy us dessert.  \n\nOur waiter was charming, friendly and appropriately attentive.  \n\nI will definitely return.
