My wife had a date night and we chose to try something new. She has traditional sweet and sour chicken, which the portions was enough for two people, and it was delicious. I had the Pad thai noodles and it just didn't hit my palette well, I wasn't please with it at all, and didn't finish. The egg rolls were awesome, our waiter(Kyle) was awesome also. Affordable, fast service, and fresh food.
