Soooooo snobby. People go downtown to get away from scottsdale. Friday night 4.5 foot bouncer gave us a hard time trying to get into an 1\/2 empty bar. Dude definitely had a hard time in high school. Get over yourselves guys... Your not that cool! \n\nWas In the area Friday night and went back and had the same experience! That was the last time. I am done with that place I will tell everyone never to go.
