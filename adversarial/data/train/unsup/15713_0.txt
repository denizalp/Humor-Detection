Overrated.\n\nOkay so I've only heard about this place and the \"frozen hot chocolate\" so many times... so I thought for a really long time that this place was like a bakery or cafe that served drinks and dessert.\n\nSo when I finally came with a few coworkers and saw the menu of burgers and hot dogs, I was slightly disappointed. Other disappointments:\n\n- Insane wait. 45 minutes for a table of 5\n- Frozen hot chocolate. It was good, but not $15 good\n- The food. Though tasty, so greasy and made me feel sick for the rest of the night\n- The presentation of the food. I think they're trying to come off as boutique, but it's just inconvenient and inefficient to eat your food from one large dish when you have six other small dishes of individual condiments around you. It's fine if you're by yourself, but when you're at a table with 4 other people and they also have 4 other dishes besides their main dish, you fight for elbow space\n- The scary baby. This isn't S3's fault, but there was a baby who was staring straight at us with no expression. It was freaky, man\n\nI mean, come on now. $15 for a foot-long hot dog? I don't care how awesome that hot dog was (it wasn't that great) or that we're in Las Vegas or if you serve it on a foot-long dish that holds it perfectly. No hot dog is worth more than a $1 per inch. It's a hot dog, aka, blended leftover parts from animals. I'd rather buy two hot dogs from Costco AND get two drinks!
