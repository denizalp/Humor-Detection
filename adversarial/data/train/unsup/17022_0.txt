The only good thing that remains about Java Joe's is the sweet, sweet memories of what it once was. Now Java Joe's has fallen to the darkness of ill-prepared staff who seem to forget who they are amidst figuring out how to make a toasted bagel.\nSince the new management has taken over and desecrated the beauty of the old Java Joe's, they have never served me in a timely manor or given me the correct order. I ask for a cream cheese bagel with Lox and they literally just go blank and forget what Lox is and then burn my bagel.\nJava Joe's, we once had something special but now? It's over.\n\n*Update: A fly in my friends salad and a fruit fly in her vanilla loaf. Honestly can say I'm never going back.
