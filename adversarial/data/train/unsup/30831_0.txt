Came to squid ink last weekend with a group of 8. Made a reservation on yelp and when we arrived our table was waiting for us. The set up is indoor\/outdoor which makes for a nice atmosphere. Pretty decent menu with options for sushi lovers and non sushi lovers alike! The staff was very friendly. The hostesses always had a smile on their face. Minus one star for getting our sushi order wrong but it was corrected right away! The food and drinks were tasty. We will definitely be back.
