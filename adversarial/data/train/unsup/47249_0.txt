Adrian was the most helpful attendant ever!!! \nShe helped my sister, wife brother in law and i\nAll of our tickets were separated and she helped us at the last min. They had bought the tickets ahead of me and I purchased mine last minute and at the entrance she greeted-us because I had a hard copy and they had e-copies... we all had separate seats and 15 mins later she comes with tickets all in the same row. Any other attendant wouldn't have cared about us , it was my birthday weekend and she went over and above and exceeded my expectations. At the end of the night we had a blast watching Jennifer Lopez and it was all thanks to her cause I got to sit with my family and enjoy the experience that Zappos gave \nI SINCERELY THANK YOU ADRIAN I DISNT GET YOR LAST NAME BUT THE ZAPPOS THEATER WILL KNOW WHO YOU ARE BECAUSE YOUR PERSONALITY STANDS OUT IN ITS OWN
