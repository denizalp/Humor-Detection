Arthur is great! He's very professional and knowledgeable about foreign vehicles actually vehicles in general. He spent time talking with my boyfriend and I to gives us the best option when it came to the repairs needed. Arthur went above and beyond - I really appreciate an honest business owner who isn't trying to take advantage.
