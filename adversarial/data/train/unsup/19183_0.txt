Tasty burgers!  Milkshakes w\/ booze!  French fried... uh... pickles!  All good.  Great place to go to to forget that you're in a one of the weaker 'themed' hotels.  You'll never actually catch me at the Mirage unless my boys and I are playing 'Briar Patch, Barely There, or Bald'.  (And in that case, we're the degenerate Asians with cocktails just past the bridge laughing it up as we watch the hoochie patrol come marching in at 10PM to go to Jet.)  \n\nOtherwise there's very little reason to go to the Mirage***.  \n\nBut I will go to the Mirage to eat at BLT Burger usually every 2nd or 3rd trip or to Vegas.  It always ends up being very much worth the lunch visit - especially when you've just tanked a quarter of your bankroll across the street during an erratic, up & down losing session, and you need a friggin' breather.  I mean, dammit - you just need some \"consistency\" in your life & BLT provides that \"CONSISTENTLY good burger\" to fill that ridiculous void left in your soul after that bitch of a dealer pulled a gotforesaken '5' after showing the '6' of a Dealer 16.  And just your luck you doubled down a high bet to a '20' .  Man, he might as well have ripped your heart out & showed it to you in the palm of his hand... like that dude in the Temple of Doom.   I... I...just... gahhhhhhhhhhhSONNAFAWHORE!\n\n[BRB.  Kurt's stepped away to go punch a hole in the wall.]\n\nAnyway, whenever I get the crap kicked out of me by a dealer named \"Romeo\" and 6-deck shoe I've nicknamed \"Satan\", I like to sit down at a table and peruse the menu at BLT:  http:\/\/www.mirage.com\/files\/BLT_menu.pdf.  Not that it frickin' matters.  I know what I want.  I want the only combo that will help me forget the dearth of $100's in my right pocket:\n\n1) FRIED DILL PICKLES\nOkay, so this is the immediate gratification portion of my meal.  They're small.  They're tasty.  And they're salty but substantial and can get your stomach feeling adequate in very little time.  They look more like \"overly battered tempura pickles slices\" but who cares.  You didn't come here to judge how the food looks.  You came here to eat.  Stop objectifying your food.  You gotdamned pig.\n\n2) NIGHT RIDER MILKSHAKE\n\"Hey Kurt?  Do you want liquor in your milkshake?  HELL YEAH, I WANT LIQUOR IN MY MILKSHAKE, M@#$%F#$%$#R.\"  That's right.  Spiked with a noticeable amount of Kahlua & Chocolate Liqueur, this milkshake promises to slide the meal down and then make you forget you ate it.  It's a definite dessert, but who gives a damn.  Now man up and chug it down.  CHUGCHUGCHUGCHUGCHUG.\n\n3) SHAFT'S BLUE BURGER\nAll you dumbasses keep ordering plain, not so special, Kobe Beef based burgers instead of ordering something distinctive... the hallmark of the restaurant.  How about Shaft's Blue?  This delectable morsel of melted blue cheese over a cheeseburger will more than likely delight your mouth with the contrasting tastes of the pungent cheese and the soft juicy beef.\n\nFried Pickles 4\/5\nNight Rider Milkshake 4\/5\nShaft's Blue 4\/5\n\nJUST DOWN THE STREET\nNow remember:  BLT is central to a lot of hotels... being within walking distance to Caesar's, TI, Venetian, Palazzo, Wynn, and Encore.  So you can get thrown over a barrel at the casinos in any one of these places and still drown your sorrows @ BLT without hailing a cab.  Heck.  You may want to walk even if you AREN'T within walking distance of BLT.  Yeah.  Walk there from frickin' Mandalay Bay and you think long & hard about what you've done.  Maybe next time you won't gamble away your kid's college fund, you degenerate pig.\n\nCONCLUSION\nAs burgers & shakes go in Las Vegas, this is definitely one of the best.  Bradley Ogden's $29 burger's better but BLT can give 'em a run for his money and you can't get an alcoholic milkshake at Bradley Ogden's.\n\n4-stars.\n\n----------------------------\n*** DON'T MISS BRAD GARRETT... UNLESS YOU'RE A PRUDE\nThere's generally no reason to go to the Mirage except maybe for the occasional Brad Garrett show, who incidentally, if you ever get the chance to see him, his show is one of the filthiest & FUNNIEST around.  Worth every penny as long as you've got a good liberal sense of humor.  He's literally the \"equal opportunity offender\" and he takes pride in his ability to call out people in the audience and slander every single sex, race, religion, & sexual orientation in a single show.
