Decent eat and decent ambiance... think of it as your Granny's Cottage in Ohio (I wonder how many Wickliffe locals are thinking, \"What a FOB!\" right now)\n\nAnother quick note: I love that historic look of the homes out here.. don't get much of that in So Cali! (FOB)\n\nOkay, so back to the eats.  It's cute that Dino's has comforting lunch specials that are distinct for each day of the week, but what caught my eye was the steak burger... it was actually one of the few items that appealed to me.\n\nThe burger came out quick which is just what you need when you're on lunch hour. The burger wasn't the best I've had by any means, but the soft buns and provolone cheese made each bite very good.\n \nThe fries that accompanied the slab were crisp and salted well.\n\nI ordered a side Cesar but the sauce was more Italian\/Vinaigrette than anything close to cesar. \n\nThe iceberg was drenched... SWIMMING in dressing.  I didn't bother asking our server to take it back because she was so sweet and frankly, I'm a baller like that--I make it rain, I make it RAIN!\n\nAnyways, I brushed aside the excess and took a few bites... I finished about 15% of the salad before the ratio of 100:1 dressing:lettuce was unavoidable\n\nAll in all Dino's is a good dining experience ONCE in a while... Despite all the positives in ambiance and service I still wouldn't prioritize it on my list of must-eats when I'm in the area.
