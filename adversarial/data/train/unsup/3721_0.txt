Bodies are indeed revealed at this traveling exhibit at Odysea... It's very cool to see, especially if you haven't been to other Bodies exhibits before.  That being said, this is a smaller version of what I've seen previously and it's pricey for what you get at $15 per child and $20 per adult for a single exhibit visit.  \n\nThe website says that Bodies Revealed is geared towards visitors of all ages, but the three kids that joined my adult friend and I were ages 5, 6, and 7 and they whizzed through way faster than the typical \"60-90 minute average\" that most folks supposedly spend.  The kids did enjoy the one hands-on table where they were able to touch real bones... I wish there was more of that!  In hindsight, I think I'd hold off until kids are closer to 9 or 10 if given the chance or at least make sure they appreciate the learning opportunity before purchasing a ticket.  \n\nNote: you can get a complimentary audio tour with a Yelp check-in shown, which I did, but the person working there didn't tell me that there was a special children's audio tour option.  I just now saw that on the website.  Unfortunately I was chasing my kids through the exhibit so I didn't get to take advantage of the audio during my visit.\n\nAll of that said, I would recommend a visit to see Bodies Revealed for older children or adults that are intrigued and interested in learning... it is cool to explore what is inside the human body, and there is a gift shop with all kinds of fun stuff at the end, so be prepared to spend more $$ there and\/or at some of the other Odysea attractions.  There are also plenty of restaurant \/ snack options onsite.
