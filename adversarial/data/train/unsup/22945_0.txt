PROS \nFree parking\nRoom was large\nTV worked \nUnreal water pressure- I'm not kidding. +1 star for that\n\nCONS\nThe \"free breakfast\" was sesame bagels, white or wheat toast, bananas that were not ripe, and still frozen apple pockets. Horrible. We skipped it.\nRoom 200 had stains in the bathroom and a cigarette smell even though it was not-smoking\nYou are required to give a $100 deposit on the room and then it's given back to you when you check-out. However, a group of 3 Canadians who checked-out after us didn't have a room deposit. Hmm... I smell discrimination!\n\nOverall: very old motel far away from the attractions with a free breakfast that's not even worth putting down as an amenity. \n  \nHotel is about 25 mins from downtown ($30 CAD via Uber one way)- it's more worth it to stay at a real hotel and pay a bit more for a real breakfast and the convenience of having the attractions right outside of your hotel.
