Ah, the Sapell's Bi-Rite, or \"The Closest Place to My Apartment That Sells Liquor.\" Slightly skeezy neighborhood grocery store that also has aisles and aisles of sweet, sweet booze, the cure for all that ails you. Their array of choices of Mad Dog 20\/20 boggles the mind. They actually have good stuff, too.
