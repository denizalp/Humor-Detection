Marty's Market has always been a place of awe for me.  It's too expensive for me to take myself to, but in the past few months, I've been here quite a few times.  I like Marty's.\n\nFirst, the store portion has all sorts of cool things.  They range from cheeses and meats to healthy versions of lots of things.  It's fun to walk through the store.\n\nOver the summer, I got an iced coffee here and sat at the bar outside.  On a nice day, I love outdoor seating, and it's partially covered.  So you aren't being directly exposed to the sun.  The coffee was good.  Better than a Starbucks or other chain for sure.\n\nThe cafe is one of my favorite eating options in the Strip District.  My first trip here I ordered the pasture-raised-non-GMO burger ($10).  It was a delicious mixture of things on top of the burger.  I really don't know what was on it because they changed the toppings seasonly.  There was some kind of leafy product... possibly arugula.  And a fancy cheese.  Look.  If you are thinking about the burger, get it.  The second trip I ordered the macaroni and cheese ($11).    Per the menu, it had fromager d'affinois, asiago fresco, white cheddar, organic shallot, cream, bacon, and herb.  It was amazingly delicious, and that's what matters. The portion was a decent size.  I was full after both meals.\n\nThe service isn't always fast, but it's friendly.  This place can get crowded at lunch time so be prepared to wait or go elsewhere.  But it's worth it.  The prices might be higher than I can manage, but Marty's Market is a wonderful treat.
