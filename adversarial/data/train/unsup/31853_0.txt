AMAZING TOUR! This is a must do, we had scheduled a tour and due to rain and safety reasons it got canceled heading half way up to the canyons. However we were given the option to reschedule if our trip allowed it or to get a refund. We opted to reschedule for a tour the next day, the tour was amazing and gave us the time to hike some of the trails at our stops. Sadly our scooter broke down heading back, but the didn't ruin the fun, the tour guide was very helpful and very accommodating. I would deft do this tour again, and recommend it.
