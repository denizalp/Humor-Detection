I've had packages shipped by OnTrac for years (never by choice), and they are nothing if not consistent.  I have never received a package on time when shipped via OnTrac.  All of their deliveries have been late, some only by hours, with a delivery guy ringing my doorbell at 10pm after my son has gone to bed, to days or sometimes weeks late.  I don't understand why any vendors still use them. When I see an OnTrac tracking number, I know for sure that's one shipment I'm not going to see for a while.
