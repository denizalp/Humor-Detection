This place is awesome!! I was eager to try it after reading all the great reviews and people were right on.  I had everything from salmon sashimi to spicy tuna rolls to a scallop roll and it was all delicious.  They use a black rice which looks purple but tastes delicious.  I highly recommend if you're in the Phoenix area!
