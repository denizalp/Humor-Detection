I had a great time here!\n\nSo we saw the ad, wanted a truly unique experience in Vegas and stepped in.  The whole place was pretty empty and the bar outside the 'freezer' was completely empty besides the girls trying to get people in. We bought the package that was the upgraded coat - oooooohhhh so cute long white coat with a souvenir little Russian type hat.  The package also comes with one picture and 2 drinks.  Sure it's expensive and sure you are wearing the black bulky gloves that are kind of weird but wait until you step into the ice bar. . . . .\n\nThe bar is all carved, great sculptures and of course your drinks is made of ice.  So much fun!  The place isn't huge but comfortable and fun.  And as far as the cold goes I was wearing a small black dress, pumps, hat, gloves and coat - I was plenty warm and as you drink you only feel more warm!\n\nThe staff was great, super friendly.  The bartenders were a lot of fun and listened to a silly\/lame joke I had.  The small crowd was fun, we chatted and danced a little.  You are in an ice bar so it's easy to talk about the surroundings, comment on the sculptures and of course the drinks made out of ice.\n\nI would definateley recommend this bar if you want an experience and don't mind the price.
