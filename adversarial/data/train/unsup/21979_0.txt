Growing up, my absolute favorite movie as a kid was Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo with Eddie Griffin playing TJ, a \"male madam.\" Eddie Griffin the actor is hilarious. Eddie Griffin the comic is a disaster.\n\nSince moving to Vegas, I passed the signs for the Eddie Griffin show at the Rio daily. Yesterday, when my husband noticed that tickets for Eddie Griffin at his new home at the SLS were up for grabs, we pounced at the chance to see this show. The one star is legitimately for the showroom at the SLS - very pretty and comfortable. \n\nThis show isn't comedy, this show is an alcoholic, racist, bigot spewing the most vile hatred for two hours. \n\nAside from the stereotypical black comedy fodder about being beaten as a child by the single women who raise black men and the neighborhood men all going in and out of prison, Eddie took his extreme racism up a notch. His bit wouldn't be out of place at a South African rally where black South Africans chant for the genocide of white South Africans with \"Kill the boer, kill the farmer.\" \n\nWhat next, will SLS just straight up have a Wahabi imam or Democrat KKK leader Robert Byrd do a set? \n\nDonning an Africa logo cap and 6 glasses of champagne, each with a shot of Patron, Eddie became more and more unhinged as his 2 hour set went on. \n\nBefore I go on, let me preface this with - I voted for Obama for president and said that I would vote for Satan before I'd vote for Hillary Clinton, so I'm in no way a Trump supporter. \n\nSome of Eddie's \"woke\" wisdom gems include:\n\n1. White people could never be slaves because white people are lazy. (Never mind that the word \"slave\" comes from the Latin word \"SclƒÅvus,\" meaning \"Slav,\" as in, Slavic people, who are white people. Much of the Roman empire was built on the backs of lots of blonde barbarian slaves.)\n\n2.  All white people are racist and secretly want to call all black people \"Ni**er\" (while Eddie dropped this word about 800 times, because apparently it's a heinously offensive word, except Eddie, because of his skin color, is allowed to use it with wanton abandon.) \n\n3. Trump steals babies. (Eddie is surprisingly mum on the suspicious Clinton Foundation's Haitian child trafficking scandal that Monica Petersen was investigating at the time of her death.)\n\n4. Trump should be swinging from a noose for treason. (Again, Eddie is surprisingly mum on Hillary Clinton's pay for play scandals, Bill Clinton selling classified info to the Chinese, the Uranium One scandal, Benghazi, the email server scandal, the boys on the tracks scandal, etc etc etc.)\n\n5. Obama is the greatest president in the entire world and wasn't anyone's pawn (Eddie didn't mention Obama literally bowing to the oppressive, corrupt, Saudi King though.) \n\n6. America is the worst (Eddie doesn't mention why he hasn't left to go live in Liberia at the time of this review, especially as he claims to be a millionaire.)\n\n7. Bill Cosby should have taken the qualludes because the women he simply had sex with (because, \"Bill Cosby isn't a rapist\") are too ugly to have been raped.\n\n8. Gay men (Eddie used the word \"fa**ots\") have turned Atlanta into the gayest black city in the US and that Eddie is doing women a favor by having sex with them.\n\n9. Eddie can f*** a butch lesbian into a skirt because she hasn't had his d***. \n\n10. Christians should be doused in gasoline so that they burn faster on their way down to Hell.\n\n11. The Bible and Christianity is for white slavers (Eddie fails to mention that the first converts to Christianity were Ethiopians (Acts 8:26-40) and that the patriarch of the faith - Moses himself, was married to Zipporah, a black woman (Numbers 12:1) And we can forget about the fact that nearly everyone who converted to early Christianity was a slave in the Roman empire.\n\nEddie also fails to mention that Muhammed was a white man (Sahih al-Bukhari 63, Sahih Muslim [6081] 107-2343) with black slaves (Sahih al-Bukhari 7263, Sunan An-Nasa'i 3858) who called black people \"raisin heads.\" (Sahih al-Bukhari 7142)) \n\n12. Jesus is pathetic and Eddie wants one super experienced woman rather than 72 virgins, as Islam promises, because virgin women complain about the pain of their hymens breaking too much. \n\n13. Mexicans are important because it is an offense to black people to pick anything in a field and Mexican labor keep prices low. (Eddie fails to mention that businesses prey upon undocumented labor by calling immigration on pay day, abusing and even raping undocumented workers, and Mexican workers are abused because working under the table doesn't afford them access to the Labor Board, OSHA protections, and Workman's compensation should they get injured on the job. Apparently Mexicans should be abused and paid less money so that Eddie can feed his 9 children cheaper vegetables.)\n\nThis show is nothing but a bitter, angry racist spewing hate. I get that Eddie has probably seen some things in the industry, but he's not woke, he's a sellout and a drunk who parrots disinformation.
