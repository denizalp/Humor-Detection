3 STARS. DOWNGRADE. Have been here many times in the last 3 years. Something has changed. It's the little things that make a big difference. They seem to have disappeared. The little extras on the market salad. The taste of the main dishes. Not quite 'there' anymore. The chefs appear to have turned over in the past year. Super chef Pete is gone. The connections between employees. Still all is good, just not superior. I'm giving this a pass for now.
