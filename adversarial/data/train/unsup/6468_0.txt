Harry A. Randolph, MSA, Controller, Finance Express agreed to file my father's 2014 tax return. On April 13, 2015, I contacted (e-mail) him to inquire about the process\/completion. He advised me that he is aware of the due date and will get back to me. On April 15, I called him on numerous occasions, which resulted in no answer and e-mailed him. After a few hours he e-mailed me back that he filed an extension, as he was sick. Right away I e-mailed him asking for a copy of extension and the amount needed to be send to IRS on the same day. It took him 3 days to respond. I was in distress as this is a very serious matter. Again, I ask for a copy of extension and expressed to his my anxiety. Upon receipt of my e-mail he responded that he is not only sick but also tired of me and advised me to find another tax person. All I wanted is to be notified in advance, before the tax day due, what actions were taken.\nHe failed to filed tax return and failed to notify me of an extension by the due date despite my endless phone calls and emails to him. \nUNBELIEVABLY TERRIBLE!
