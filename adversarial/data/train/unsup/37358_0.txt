When you think of what to eat in Vegas it usually consists of steak and eggs, one of the million buffets, prime rib, shrimp cocktail etc...but definitely not Chinese food.  Thank goodness Joanna E. introduced me to this place.  The shrimp fried rice and wonton noodle soup were absolutely DELISH!  Service was pretty fast and efficient.  \n\nI only have one gripe--the har gow and shu mei were like $8.95 for six pieces...now if you are a dim sum connoisseur like Joanna E. and myself you would know that is a RIP OFF!!!  Which is why I deducted one star.
