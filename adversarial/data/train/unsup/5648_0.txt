If you like beer - then go here.  Run here!  Live here.\n\nI was told recently by a co-worker there are \"two types of girls - those who drink beer, and those who don't\".  While I disagree with the bones of this statement, while I might choke down a Fruili if I have to, I guess I am at the root of my being \"a girl who does not drink beer\".\n\nHowever, it is Beer Week and they had a pretty cool sounding event going on.  When we got there, there was a line-up to get in!  But it moved quickly.\n\nI like this spot because it's casual.  It feels like you're hangin' at a friend's basement.  However - the staff are friendly, just like your friend who owns said basement.  Sometimes this casual nature can mean too hands-off service - I would have liked more attentiveness.  \n\nI would have given it three but that's because of my personal opinion on beer, and no fault of C'est What.
