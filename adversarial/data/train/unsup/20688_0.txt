Yes, I waited in line for over an hour for a Famous Polish Boy. I went through many moods during my experience at the C-Town Chow Down: elation, sorrow, anger, extreme hunger, and, finally, acceptance. At the end of the day, this is a sandwich that I would eat every day for lunch if my body could handle it. For five bucks, you get the amount of food a normal person would eat for both lunch AND dinner. They have normal cart\/truck staples like regular dogs, cheese fries, and the like, but the Po Boy is where it's at.
