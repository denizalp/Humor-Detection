A few years back I went for an L.A. dodgers sign. They charged me around $70. The guy showed me the design on paper and I said it was ok just to have it outlined and then pepper shade on the outside. When he was done it wasn't what he showed me. I remember him telling me \"hey if you need a touch up or fix come back\" wtf? lol why would you need to redo it unless you f****d up. I left and went back to L.A. I come back and forth between phoenix and L.A. Today I found the place and went to talk to them to fix it or give me my money back. I don't care if it was a long time ago. The guy says there's a new owner and he doesn't remember a guy with the description I gave him. To fix the tattoo they f****d up in the first place was going to cost me $130. No thanks..I rather go to West Side Tattoos. I recommend them especially for black and grey urban style tattoos. I will upload the tattoo they did of my L.A. My real rating is -0 but the lowest is 1 star.\n\n-Tattoo slanted \n-Lines not same size all around\n-Shading not what was requested\n-Shading done poorly
