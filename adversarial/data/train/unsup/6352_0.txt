I do not know what is the big deal about this place, it seems to be very popular. \nFirst, the parking is way in the back and the exit is very narrow.\nI have been here a few times and I never got a warm and fuzzy feeling. Like service is OK but not actually friendly. A couple other visits were solid 3 stars, our last one was one star... or zero if I could. So in the interest of averages, I will give 2 stars on this review.\nSo we got there, were told to wait to be seated.\nAfter like 3 minutes we got a table.\nAfter like 3 minutes we got chips and salsa...\nChips were over done, tasted a little close to burned. We tried to get new chips and nothing.\nWe waited for someone to take our beverage order and nothing...\nA party was seated behind me and they got service right away.\nThe hostess stopped nearby to seat another party, I asked if we had a server because no one had stopped by.\n...\nTime went by.\n....\nWe got up and left and went to La Barquita (just a few blocks away), and had really good soup for dinner (2 caldo de res, and one chicken soup).
