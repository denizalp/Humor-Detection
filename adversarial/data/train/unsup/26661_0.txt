OK so why does it always take a bad experience to bring me to Yelp to post a review!\n\nI love adding food pictures (944 of them if you want to know) , but tonight there was no food, so inevitably there are no photos of food.     \n\nWhy you may ask?       \n\nWell, let me explain.\n\nIt was around 9:45pm or so when we entered the restaurant, there were no lines or waiting, so we (my wife and I) were promptly seated in what I will refer to as man bun hell.\n\nAfter being seated between two groups of folks along the bar seating area, we were just getting a taste of the evenings adventure as it took approx 5-6 minutes for our server to come over and take our drink order.  We ordered ONE Chicken Marsala to be split, It was not long after that our bread and water arrived, but that was all.  By now it was around 10pm as this was clearly stated by our guest at the table beside us as it was getting late and they were ready to leave.  It was about 5 minutes later that the table to the  right of us received their meals and they had time to finish their food even after ordering 5 deserts to go.  At last look, it was 10:38, we had run out of time, patience and understanding.  Our server appeared to be distracted by a table we will refer to as \"friends\" since he was at that table for at least ten minutes - socializing.\n\nHe did bring by an empty plate for us to share our meal should it ever arrive.  We received two refills during this time. At no time was an apology given for the lack of food coming from the kitchen.  The table to the right was cleaned and a new group of four guest were seated.  The hostess stated that they would be taken care of \"she promised\"......I stated that \"they should not believe the lies\", as we were obviously not taken care of.  They brought this to their service attention, but our own server arrived and I made it clear that we were leaving.  He suggested that we speak to a manager, however it was too late.  I stopped by the hostess stand but the manager came by.\n\nDuring this time, the server was observed laughing and showing no interest toward any guest.\n\nUpon leaving the restaurant I called and was promptly placed on hold for seven minutes.\n\nI understand busy nights, but this was just not the case.\n\nI will be following up on this review........
