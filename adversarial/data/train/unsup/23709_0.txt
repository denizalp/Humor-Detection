I pass by this place almost every day. I finally decided to give it a try last night. Within a few minutes of sitting down, a runner, I'm assuming, literally threw our tortilla chips on the table and almost slammed the salsa down as he just kept on walking. No \"Hello\", no \"here are your chips and salsa\", no nothing. My friend wanted to leave, but I thought maybe he was just having a bad day.\n\nThen I saw the bag of trash sitting right there out in the open walkway. We decided to leave and go to Monterrey.\n\nAdios, y'all.
