Pure Apple Heaven! I wanted a pair of farm fresh pies to bring to my families thanksgiving and having bookmarked this place for years and never going I figured it was high time I make the drive and pay the AF a visit. \n\nDrivers, beware, this is located at the northern tip of Brampton where the houses and plazas are barely new and much of the land is farmland still, so lock yourself in for a 45minute drive from the 416. \n\nDuring busy season right now, the parking situation is ludicrous, it makes pacific mall look orderly. The staff here trying to direct parking do a poor job so just man up and take chances here.\n\nOnce you're parked you'll find yourself in this quaint little farmers market shack turned year round store with everything you could imagine. Local produce, local meats, confectionary, ready-made meals to go, dry goods and most importantly a whole section dedicated to baked goodies - specifically PIES!\n\nThey must have at least 10-15 varieties of pies with the most popular being pumpkin and basic apple. Those two flavours are baked in abundance and accessible first-come-first-serve on two large tables. As for the more specialty pies, you must wait in line to be served from behind the counter.\n\nWe fought for one of the last Pumpkin pies and took our time ordering a caramel apple pie. Before leaving we also picked up a massive pumpkin for only $8 (it's gotta be 50-60lbs easy) as well as some seasonal decorative pieces for fall!\n\nFast forward to Thanksgiving day and these pies were top shelf aka too legit to quit. OMG. If my mouth could have an orgasm I think it would have right then and there. Neither pie was overly sweet, and the crusts held together enough to as to not fall apart but were light enough that they would melt in your mouth!\n\nCan't wait to carve the pumpkin in a couple of weeks, and until then I'll dream of their pies.\n\nEatcrest Out!
