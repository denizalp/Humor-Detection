Used a coupon from groupon and got a cut and blow out from Lorraine. I have hard to cut curly hair and rarely find someone I like. My hair looks amazing (it's been probably 15 years since it has looked this good). I highly recommend going here and ask for a stylist that deals with your particular hair needs and you won't be disappointed.
