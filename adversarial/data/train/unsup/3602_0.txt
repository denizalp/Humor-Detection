Absolutely dreadful service. Waited an hour for food after ordering without being served. Refills on water and naan were nonexistent. To top that all off, they told us they were out of tea 20 minutes after I ordered it. Who is out of tea at an Indian restaurant and why did it take 20 minutes to tell me about it? I won't be frequenting them again.
