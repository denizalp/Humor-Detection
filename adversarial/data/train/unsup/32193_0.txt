After dinner at Bar Isabel my friends and I just wanted a place to get coffee\/tea and continue on our conversation.  We popped in here - late at night it's pretty empty so we found seats at the back.\n\nThere is a mish mash of everything here - desserts, pastries (both savory and sweet), at the back there is a meat counter, sandwiches etc.\n\nNothing fancy but the service is friendly and you can sit here and chill or work away on your laptop.
