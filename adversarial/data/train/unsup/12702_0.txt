THAT'S RIGHT. I stayed at a Motel 6 in VEGAS. What..AM I NOT BOUGIE ENOUGH FOR YOU?!\n\nI don't know what the hell people are complaining about here. I mean HELLO it's a Motel 6. Maybe if there were roaches, pimps, and children running rampant throughout then fine. But really now, Motel 6 has everything anyone can want, and at an AMAZING rate of $30 something a night. Pssh..that's like a green poker chip at the casinos.\n\nThe checklist they fulfilled:\n\n-clean. I mean the rooms are SPOTLESS with a hospital aesthetic. And for any class hotel, that's all I really ask for.\n\n-close to the strip. Motel 6 is located behind Hooters and diagonally across from MGM, so about a 4 minute walk to Las Vegas Blvd.\n\n-there's a pool. The pool's clean, and never packed. How many times can you say that when staying at a big name casino? Also, gf here is not always well kept- you get close enough you can see my half shaven legs, so it's nice being at a pool that doesn't have a ridiculous club scene. Just let it all hang out. \n\n-housekeeping will stop by every day and give you the option to have your room cleaned, or if not, will at least provide extra towels and toilet paper. They're not the friendliest bunch but efficient at least.\n\n-they allow dogs. My gf had to stay at a hotel that allows for pets and Motel 6 is the only one close to the strip that does. I'm pretty sure they'll take just about any kind, because she had 2 large german shepherds and they were LOUD.\n\n-it's safe. Now, there's no checkpoint that guests have to go through to get to their room but security patrols the grounds. I never felt in danger going out by myself. We DID see a pimp ONCE but don't worry. He was friendly.\n\nThings that could've been better:\n\n-the rooms are TINY. As in our room was about 10' by 12' not including the bathroom. We stayed in one of the newly renovated rooms right by the pool so I'm not sure if all the rooms are the same size. The bathrooms don't have tubs, only a standing shower.\n\n-The doors are thin and rooms are close together, so be prepared to talk to your neighbors at least once. The most noise I heard was early in the morning when people are walking by the room. Not too bad.\n\nMake sure to get one of the renovated rooms; they're newer and closer to the strip. Wi-fi is $5 a day, there's a small convenience store for things like water, Coco's Bakery is next door, parking is free, discounted weekly rates, cab to the airport about $15. C'mon..you can't get that good n cheap so close to the strip..without an STD I mean.
