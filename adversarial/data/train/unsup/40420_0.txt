For those parents of kindergarteners who are still looking for Ticonderoga Beginners No.2 Pencils Without Erasers... check-out Wist Office Products!  With a simple phone call, they ordered a dozen for me for only $4.07 a box. I get to pick them up tomorrow after 8am - so quick! Now that is a good deal.  Especially since I'd already driven around and checked Target, OfficeMax, and Walmart (and come up empty).  \n\nI'll remember Wist the next time I need any office supplies, or school supplies!!!  Sometimes, in our daily rush, we forget to support our local community and shop local.  I'm glad I had this friendly reminder. \n\nSee ya there!
