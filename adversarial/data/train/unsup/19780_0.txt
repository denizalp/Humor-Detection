So I've been to Brant House multiple times and I have mixed feelings about it. I've always gone on thursdays and it's always been packed.\n\nThe Good\n- lots of people and lots of space\n- cute outdoor patio in the back\n- acceptable place to get foolishly drunk\n\n\nThe Bad\n- packed\/small bar area\n- fairly pricey drinks\n\n\nThe Ugly\n- sweaty 30 something bankers with their ties loosened dancing like fools and singing top 40 \n\nConclusion: If you want to get loose in your suit on a Thursday, Brant House may be your ticket to a hangover at work on Friday.
