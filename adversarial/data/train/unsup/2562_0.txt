The only way to enjoy a tryst without fear of aggressive STDs?\n\nIt's a Thursday night...\n\nI'm not really a club type of guy, back home in Seattle I'm all about lounges, bars, and kitchy little places with mason jars for cups and pictures of obscure Films on the walls. But Vegas? Sin City? Viva Lost Wages? I gotta wild out.\n\nTryst was the second spot we hit on our March Madness\/Happy Birthday to my little brother trip. All the Electro fist pumping joy of wilding out is evident here. The decor is fantastic, the waterfall adds a classy touch, and the night was overall a good night out. I wish I could have enjoyed it more, being one of the guys in our group that slept for only 4 hours from the night before... it was a rough day.\n\nOverall, I'd go again next time I come Vegas side.\n\n4 there's-a-sign-that-forbids-lewd-behavior-in-the-bathroom-of-a-club-called-Tryst stars out of 5
