Dude.  Writers block.  \n\nLegit Seafood\nLegit Service\nLegit Sabor\n\nI'm creating the SSS Bureau as a result of this visit.  \n\nSo during lunchtime it's crowded.  Expect co-workers to push 3-4 dining tables together so you will be limited in the seating arrangement.  There are tables outside, and if it wasn't sub 0 and if you want your food chilled in 10 seconds...well outside isn't an option.  \n\nI can't speak for the sushi.  But what I did consume were the black-end fish tacos and the oysters.  They have a portable gas grill that they grill to order.  My guesstimate is that they are the local wholesaler and whatever they don't sell they cook.  Quite ingenieous if you ask me.  \n\nBtw...my  mind ISN'T in the gutter, but their logo is quite provocative.  \n\nI'm just say'in.
