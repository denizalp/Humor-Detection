We were looking at the menu at Peachtree the other day when another couple told us it was great, but knowing it had bad reviews.  Having eaten there tonight, we know the problem -- the customers.  Apparently they confuse Cajun cooking with Southern cooking.  Just as most confuse Spanish cooking with Mexican cooking.  This is not a Cajun restaurant.  It is more akin to southern low country cooking.  And we were delighted.  We have a home in Savannah.  We eat in Savannah, and this was as good as Savannah has to offer.\n\nWe did an assortment of appetizers and sides.  The fried green tomatoes with bacon jam -- awesome.  The sweet potatoes -- excellent.  The collards -- great.  The shrimp and cheesy grits -- super (maybe a little salty).  We'll definitely be going back -- because its like home.
