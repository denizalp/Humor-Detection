I love Trader Joe's and always choose to visit a Trader Joe's in addition to your generic grocery stores. Entering a Trader Joe's is like going on a little vacation. They have unique products at a reasonable price. I always find something new and delicious! Sadly, this is not my favorite Trader Joe's location because of their parking. Not only is their parking lot always very crowded, but the customers going in and out of the spots don't seem to pay much attention. I almost got hit and hit someone all in one visit. I will continue to visit Trader Joe's, but just not this location!
