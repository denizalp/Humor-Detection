Beautiful, friendly and covered in pink. Pink Uniforms, pink walls, spa and medical area as well. I went to the Chandler location, they have a paging system, huge waiting room, kids play area. Great staff. Apple computers you can play with once in the room. Been three times in the last month and never waited for than 7 minutes. First gyno I have been very happy with and will stay looooong term. Had an emergency 2 weeks after my first appointment, explained my symptoms, they told me to come down immediately and I was seen by my own dr. within 10 minutes from my call. If you need an ultrasound they are usually booked about 3-4 weeks in advance so plan ahead.
