My first thought as I entered the restaurant was \"Omg is this place on fire?!\". The smell of smoke is very strong. In an attempt to air out the building, they kept the doors open which made way for flies to roam inside. Nothing I love more than swatting bugs away from my food. \n\nIn my vegetarian world of dainty salads and puny vegetables, Fire Side blows them all out of the water with its colossal black bean burger. Not only was it enormous, it was sooo delicious! The sirarcha aioli was so incredible that it makes the heartburn worth it. Just ask my boyfriend who was practically drinking it. The spinach and avocado topping made the burger even better. It was essentially all my favorites in one burger. Definitely one of the top veggie burgers I've had in Pittsburgh! It must not have been a pretty sight to watch me attack my meal. When a burger is twice the size of your mouth, it's hard to eat like a lady. \n\nWould I come back? Absolutely! To all my vegetarians, the black bean burger is a must!
