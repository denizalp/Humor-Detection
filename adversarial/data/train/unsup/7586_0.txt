I am BIG fun of Jamie Oliver's shows,so today was my 4th ani of moving to Toronto.\nso we picked this place to try something new.\nthe guy who was hosting,he did amazing job  care about staff who works there and taking care of line,and greeting to new customer.\nand girls who works at bar are so friendly,they asked as drink right timing and chatting little bit with customers but working so hard.the speed they provide to make drink is amazing.\nso we didn't mind at all for waiting time with great service.\n\nwe got a small table nice and cozy,decided what to order...\nmy husband picked pork chop grill,and i ordered shrimp pasta. sold out the pasta.\nits ok busy night 9;30pm i gonna pick something else.\nand picked other things, yes sold out ummm ok\nordered other pasta which i don't even wanted,\n\nappetizer ; garlic bread and fried squid. both of them taste really great!!\njust problem was waited 30min to get them.\n\nand ok waiting waiting for main dishes for extra 40 min\nhere its the guy brought looking yummy main dishes for us and also spilled my drink on me.\nthanks god it make things more funny.\n\nand tried pasta right away cause i was so hungry!!!\nPasta was so dried due to sitting on the counter 10 min and a chef was adding more and more olive oil during waiting pork chop.\n\nyes,now you can guess,my pasta was SUPER DRY and SUPER SALTY.\nand my pants was soaking wet.\n\nThis has to be a joke.and it was actually fun experience.thanks for making my day guys.
