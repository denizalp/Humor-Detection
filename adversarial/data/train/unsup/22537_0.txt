My friend and I were in a serious mini-golf mood and were looking for a fix.  We figured on trying Kiss Mini-golf but when we drove by it was close to 10pm and they close at 11 and it was hot as heck and didnt feel like being outside.  My friend heard from co-workers of a place near where we lived in Henderson called King Putt.  He were on our way!\nWhen we arrived I had to admit it looked small but I was a bit happy to see it had Lazer Tag (never tried it...really wanted to).  The staff were all extremely fun and nice to us.  We were some of the only people in there and we really got the royal treatment!  Because we played mini-golf there was a discount on our Lazer Tag.  The manager explained everything to us in detail and even offered to play along if we wanted since we were the only 2 playing.  \nBack to the mini-golf....It was AMAZING!  All of it was in black-light paint and there were really great obstacles and cool pulley systems where your ball would go up and then down a tube and it was just really fun.  I've never had as much fun min-golfing as I had there. \nAfter mini-golf we played some arcade games, they had a real good selection of them (not a lot of them because it was a little limited on room) but a real good selection for the room they had.  \nThen lastly is when we played the Lazer Tag and I have to say I really want to try it again sometime soon!  The room was really cool and had lots of good spots to move around too and the Mummy was a cool addition! \nAll in all, this place rocked and the staff were especially awesome and when I get that mini-golf\/lazer tag itch again, I'm definitely going there!
