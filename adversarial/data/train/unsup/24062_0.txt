Frida fan here. I was looking for an excuse to come here and I found it with the SheForks Happier Happy Hour. Also wanted to see Mer because she is the coolest. This is a great spot with neat architectural aspects that initially seem like they would clash but they seamlessly work together. Even the bathroom is rad with its geometric and kaleidoscopic tiles. The outside is definitely deceiving as it comes off as nondescript and simple in design; always a reminder for me to not judge a book by its cover.\n\nThey have a lot of drinks on their happy hour menu but I stuck to water and ordered two appetizers: the house gyozas and the goat cheese mousse (vegan and vegetarian respectively). The gyozas were a colorful sight in a bowl with veggies and a citrus soy glaze (too salty) and filled with a beet, carrot and sweet potato puree. I enjoyed them, they were light enough but somehow filling. My goat cheese came out on a board with various berries, grapes, nuts and a strawberry compote that had red wine in it. I forgot I read that part in the menu and silly me thought it would burned off when it got \"cooked\". Anyways, I thought the smell of alcohol was strong around me and I remembered it was the compote and I stopped eating it. Everything else on the board was yummy though.\n\nI liked that we got to meet the head chef and interim manager. They seemed to take pride in their work and righteously so. I do hope this place continues to be successful, which can be tough with all the restaurant competition in Old Town. Salud!
