I went here on my lunch break today because I'm sick, and tired of Campbell's crud soups. I was pleasantly surprised by the freshness of the ingredients in my roasted-garlic-and-potato soup. Very hearty, along with the baguette and olive oil. The take-out process was easy and Janet was extremely nice even over the phone. I also found it to be moderately priced. Hey, I feel better already! My throat doesn't hurt anymore and I stopped coughing! Garlic is miraculous. I'll come here the next time I'm sick, or just want some great soup. This is a terrible review, but perhaps Janet's soup will cure my cold and I'll be back on tomorrow to write the best review of my life. Only time will tell. Or.. will it?
