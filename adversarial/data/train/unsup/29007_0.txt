Sooooo Alan Karp (CALIFORNIA BUYERS SHOULD SEEK HIM OUT), \n\nThis guy is the man.... helped me pull off the 50th birthday of the century. Had to secretly trade in my wife's 3 series, put together the perfect 4 series, get it at a fair price, tint the windows for me, wrap it in a red bow bring it to the restaurant we were celebrating at annnnnd (insert drum roll here) do it on my credit alone after buying a new house..... all without her knowing and on a saturday at the end of the month.....By the way..... we live in California and he still pulled it out of his hat!\n\nWhat can I say Al.... you pulled it off, made me a poor but happy man, lol and my wife an estatic new 4 series owner. We love Al and all his hard work, and his follow up is impeccable. \n\nThe out of state registration piece..... flawless.\n\nTHANKS Alan Karp & BMW Las Vegas!!
