We've been to this spot twice; once for lunch and today for breakfast.  The lunch was great and they do have incredible burgers that taste like a sirloin steak grilled and charred to perfection. Today we had breakfast and it was excellent!  The over easy eggs were the bomb and perfectly cooked. The service is top-notch and having waitressed myself this is a huge compliment.  My hubbie had the breakfast combo that included our loved steer burger (no bun) and it was just as excellent as it is at lunch. Great place!
