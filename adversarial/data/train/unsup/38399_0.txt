!Absolutely shameful, deplorable, and disgusting service (If I could give zero, I would). Do not get anything installed by Ashley Furniture technicians! I bought an expensive, king-sized wood canopy bed  (with a 5 year protection plan and delivery\/ installation costs around $250 extra). Of course, because the thing is so immensely heavy (and I am disabled), I had the bed installed by their \"professional technicians\". I have had the bed for a few months now, and just got a new vacuum that has a light on the end. While vacuuming under the bed I saw that the middle support posts were completely missing feet, and that there were two metal posts literally sticking directly into my hardwood floors and had caused deep holes into the wood. I called Ashley, and they asked me to take pictures to send to them which I did. They called me back and told me they would send out a technician as \"a courtesy\" (in 2 weeks), but that the floor and the bed were my problem because I only had 72 hours to report defects. First of all, this was not a defect- they forgot parts. Secondly, as a disabled person (or anyone for that matter) how am I supposed to lift up a bed to look underneath it for something I would not think to see. Even if the mattresses were not already on the bed when I was asked initially to inspect it, I would not have seen it unless I got down on my belly to floor level to look with a flashlight. They told me that it looked like the bed had been dragged. Since the holes\/ gouges are only a centimeter at most, this is totally ridiculous. So essentially, because their technicians are incompetent, and Ashley obviously has NO customer concern, I am left with an expensive bill to fix my floor (which is only 1 year old) and we cannot even sleep in our master bedroom because we cannot sleep in the bed until their technicians come to fix it (in 2 weeks). All I can say while near tears is- shame on you Ashley.
