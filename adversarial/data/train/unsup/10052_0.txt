Looking for an old school ice cream parlor experience with a ton of Old Town history?  This is your place!\n\nWith simple menu offerings from ice cream and sundaes, special creations, milkshakes and malts, you're sure to get your sugar fix on... and if you're in the mood for something savory, they offer a limited selection of salads, sandwiches, and burgers too.  I can't speak to the food offerings though.  \n\nOn a recent visit for a friend's birthday, I went with a scoop of their ice cream flavor of the day (it happened to be pumpkin) and a slice of their homemade banana nut bread.  Both were sweet and edible and servings are pretty generous too.  I must admit however, that neither blew me away.  We sat in the arcade area and service was attentive enough, but I can't say I'll be rushing back.  \n\nThere is something to be said for the old school feel of this place, but I'm a sucker for all of the many frozen yogurt and even soft serve ice cream places out there now-a-day... \n\nMy advice? Go to Sugar Bowl every now and again for the overall experience and don't think about your diet when you're there.  Enjoy!
