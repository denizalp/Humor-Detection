From walking into the front door to leaving fully and happy....22 minutes. If you come on a weekday at 11am, you'll be seated almost immediately. Unless you really want to tell your friends about waiting in line for 3 hours to get pizza, then I highly suggest you come here for lunch instead of dinner. \n\nThe best thing about this place is that you can split the pizzas in half when ordering. Half of the pizza was a ROSA, which comes with red onion, parmesan, rosemary and pistachios. The other half was marghertia, which was pretty basic with tomato Sauce, mozzarella, basil. I'm glad we did the half and half because I would not have enjoyed a full ROSA. The rosa was a pretty unique creation with the pistachios, but I know I would have been tired of it if I had to have more than 3 pieces. The marghertia, although simple, was a great complement to the rosa and was very fresh and flavorful. The pizza took me back to my days in Italy.....albeit my days in italy were only 2 months ago, I did have flashbacks of sitting by the Trevi Fountain looking out for gypsies while devouring my perfectly crafted pizza. \n\nOverall, my friend and I split a pizza so the whole meal was only $13. We were both full, but then again we are okay with eating small portions. We got our food within 8 minutes of ordering. We had plenty of attention from the staff and I liked the coziness of the atmosphere. I'm a sucker for brick establishments.\n\nI would not suggest waiting anymore than 35 minutes to eat here, after 30 minutes of hunger you get grouchy and whatever you eat will taste delicious to you. And when you are super hungry, you tend to devour your food instead of tasting it. If you come here to devour, you won't appreciate the pizza as much. This pizza is meant to be savored and tasted. \n\nP.S. They do have a parking lot, but there is a $3 for parking in it. There are some metered parking spots on the block over, which is about a 1.50 for an hour.
