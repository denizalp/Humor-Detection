So...the mandarin is what you'd expect from a giant chain buffet. Plenty of options from Chicken Balls, to Sushi. The food is good considering the massive amounts of it they put out daily to serve an almost always packed restaurant. \n\nRoom C however has a bad smell to it. So if possible, if making your reservation, ask for any room but. Also, in the C section last week we had to ask for our drinks twice, which in my at least 20 visits prior...in every other section than this hasn't happened. \n\nIts about 30$ per person on weekends\/holidays, which is a little pricey, so make sure you come hungry and eat as much prime rib and crab legs as you can to make up the price.
