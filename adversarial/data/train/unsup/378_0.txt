About 13, 14 years ago I was living in the Orlando area and there was a Houston's in Winter Park, I think.  I don't see it on their website anymore, but my coworkers and I would treat ourselves once a month and go to Houston's and enjoy the gracious service, delicious food, and I believe that one had a lovely deck overlooking a pond.  \n\nWhen our anniversary rolled around this year, Houston's came to mind as a place to revisit.  It's still the same classy, comfortable interior and the service is perfect.  Our main server, Russell, was attentive and friendly, and the woman who brought out our appetizer had a quick wit because as she came around the corner I was holding a cocktail in each hand and said, \"I'm having both drinks tonight\" and she said, \"Well you have to taste test them, right?\"  Absolutely!\n\nSpeaking of those cocktails, mine was the elder collins ($13) and it went down way too quickly.  That's a nice summertime drink for sure.  My husband had the Manhattan ($12) which both of us enjoyed (I just had a sip, I swear) and you can tell we don't get out to classier restaurants much because I was so impressed that halfway through the drink, Russell stopped by to pour it into a freshly chilled glass.  That was a nice touch.  \n\nWe then shared the Hawaiian ribeye ($36) which is worth every penny.  Full of flavor and cooked a perfect medium rare, it was fantastic.  We chose fries for the side and those were delicious as well.  We didn't make a reservation, but got there with the geriatric crew and golfers for an early dinner at 4:30 on a Saturday.  We had no problem getting a table then, but by the time we were finished the place was full and people were waiting.  I'm glad to see they are still a wonderful place to go out for dinner.  We need to return more often.  Thank you, Houston's, for a very nice anniversary dinner.
