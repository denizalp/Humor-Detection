Family day. Cute! Chinese Girl and I have no close by family. Her's, a bit farther.Or is that further? Our plan was to hit the Eaton Centre and clothes shop. Well, she'd clothes shop and I'd hold stuff. It's a role I understand. We found our way to Spadina. We were going to get Bahn Mi but the Cute! Chinese Girl was a little frustrated the Vietnamese workers couldn't explain their food in Mandarin. We made our way north to some Szechuan restaurant. \n\n\"What's that smell?\" wondered Cute! Chinese girl.\n\n\"I think it's burning incense.\"\n\n\"It smells like public washrooms in Beijing. Can we go some place else?\"\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\nWe went across the way to E-Pan. They had a lunch special. $8 constitutes a lunch special in the city. Fair enough. Portions were quite nice. The corn and chicken soup was good. You only get two dumplings but whatever. I had the crispy beef with sesame and it was exceptionally good. Move over lemon chicken. General Tso,  turn in your silver stars. Crispy beef is my new culinary overlord.\n\nService was good. Decor is clean and modern. Lunch for two was $20 even with tax 'n' tip.
