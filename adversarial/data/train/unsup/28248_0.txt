I don't know where to begin. First the food itself was tasty flavorful and well cooked. Had the brunch menu biscuits and gravy. the biscuit was perfectly cooked fluffy not dry . The mushroom gravy was to die for earthy peppery nice consistency. But for 10 something a plate I expected a little more bang for my Buck . The gravy was sparing and dish had no sides with it . The avocado toast had this amazing avocado pesto and greens on the side a very tasty flavorful light snack but for nine dollars a plate it also was lacking in portion size one piece of toast and half a cup of mixed greens would cost me 3\/4 of the price to duplicate at home. Again for 9 something I expected at least two pieces of toast and a bigger salad.  Now the wait time was ridiculous the ordering process ridiculous. Waited twenty minutes in line ordered at a counter was given a number. Seating was sparse and what was available was family style seating on long picnic tables on the patio. When informing the wait staff about seating issues we were told to ask to share .My daughter proceeded to ask a number of patrons in family style patio seating who were sitting in groups of two or three if they would mind sharing and got shot down several times . We opted to get our order to go and waited thirty more minutes for our food. It was a very aggravating and uncomfortable experience for overpriced food.
