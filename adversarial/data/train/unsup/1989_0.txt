After reading the other reviews I thought we would give this place a try. Sadly this might be one of the worst places I have ever eaten.....or should I say tried to eat. \n\nThe waiter was very friendly but I am pretty sure he could not have been over 11 years old.\n\nWe ordered the Saturday special. Shredded beef enchilada with beans and rice. The friendly waiter brought us chips and salsa, but the salsa tasted like it came right out of a can. It was horrible! The chips tasted days and days old. \n\nOur enchilada plates were even worse. I could not eat more than 2 bites before I had to spit out my attempted 3rd bite. It was not good at all. The beans tasted burnt and the rice had an odd spice I have never tasted in mexican food. \n\nSadly we left out plates after those 2 bites and left the restaurant. \n\nWe left 15 dollars to cover our meals and a good tip for the wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy too young waiter.\n\nUnfortunately I do not see how this place can stay in business. ...
