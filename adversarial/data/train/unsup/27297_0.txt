I walk into an empty store (no customers, 3 workers)\nI say \"hello\"\nThey stop talking. With a full of himself grin, an associate gives me a head nod and the other two associates just look at me. No one speaks (even though they were in full conversation with each other as I was walking in)\n$1000+ was spent between this store and the fashion show mall location.\nI called before coming to this store to ask if I could get a refund for 1 item from the other store since I was only at their store for 7 items that had been altered.\nThe associate over the phone said yes. \nThe guy handing me the altered clothes, looked at the receipt for refund and said he couldn't do a cash refund because they hadn't done any transactions that day. \nThe head nod guy also had a snarky 2 cents worth of commentary \nVery bad experience
