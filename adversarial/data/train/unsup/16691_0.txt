While stuck in traffic on The Strip, I was fortunate enough to catch this fiery spectacle from the comforts of my car. I turned off the AC and rolled down my windows but only half way though, in case some drunks carrying yard longs start wobbling over to my car, or someone tries to give me a card for escort services.\n\nA number of thoughts crossed my mind as I watched the show:\n\n1. Is that a shield volcano, or was it originally  a cone shaped one that's just been through a lot of hell over the last 10,000 years? \n\n2. Where are those erotic tribal beats coming from? \n\n3. Am I really feeling an intense burning sensation on my skin from those flames?\n\nI must say that The Mirage has a done a good job with improving their volcano show, which is one of the better free 99 shows that you can watch while on The Strip. They've included music and upped the intensity of those flames about a thousand notches. Is it more entertaining than that show at Caesars where the demonic creature rises from the aquarium tank? Sure. Is it sexier than the Sirens show next door at Treasure Island? Uh, yeah. Is it the best show to watch from your car while stuck in traffic? YES.
