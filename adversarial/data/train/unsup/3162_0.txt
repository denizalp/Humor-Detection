I don't know where I would be without Ronee and her team.  I am in the middle of a very long and difficult case and they have supported and helped me every step of the way. Her knowledge and experience have made all the difference when the ex's lawyer has tried every dirty trick in the book.  The staff has been very upfront about what to expect and very reasonable on the fees charged.  I would NEVER go with another firm.  Thank you Ronee!
