As much as I love me some pink taco (obligatory luis m love of the pussy eating reference) I have never actually ordered a pink taco here.  I have had a few of their other menu items.  Their enchiladas are good, the chilaquiles are passable, the rajas and potatoes are a cheesy gooey delite, and the tacos are decent.  Probably a 3.5 star place but being located in the Hard Rock hotel\/casino which is known for it's eyecandy and being so decently priced for a Vegas eating establishment makes Pink Taco a must stop at some point during your stay in Las Vegas.
