Stopped in for dinner before a movie. The waiter James was absolutely amazing! He suggested different beer for me to try, was very attentive and so enthusiastic. I haven't been here in quite some time, seeing as I moved a fair distance away from the area, but I remember it being so much better. Our burgers were over cooked and flavorless. The fries were good, but not work four dollars alone. We were so very disappointed. The saving grace of the experience was the service.  When the manager found out about the food she completely refunded them without any hesitation. Maybe they were just having an off day in the kitchen, but for the money I have spent there and the product I received today I will be taking my money elsewhere.
