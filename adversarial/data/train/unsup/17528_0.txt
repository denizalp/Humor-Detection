Had a pretty poor experience here on Wednesday. \n\nI asked if the did a burrito bowl. It wasn't clearly on the menu, but I figure it's just the same stuff in a bowl, so why not ask? The guy at the cash was really nice and said ok. One point for that! He said he would have to charge for for a large, but I was willing to give it a go. $10.12 later, someone started on my dish. Now, I started having misgivings right away, but having already paid on visa, I felt awkward retracting my order. The female staff put literally a tablespoon of sloppy bean liquid in a styrofoam take out container (Big Fat Burrito in Kensington uses a reusable\/recyclable plastic container. Styrofoam is crappy.) She then sprinkled a tablespoon of rice on top. I'm looking at this huge container which will be my dinner, and which cost me over $10 and I'm seeing hunger. So I asked if I could have a little more (please sir\/mam!) she denied me, but the guy who rang me in told her to put more in. She kept asking him, are you sure? Finished off the bowl with shredded iceberg lettuce, a smidge of tomatoes and red peppers (a tongs worthm maybe a tablespoon or two?). The portion of chicken was decent, but it was quite salty. Very salty. But the guac. Oh, dear, the guac. It was thin, and in a squeeze bottle. This was not guacamole. This was a thin, pale imitation. Literally. No flavour, it was a real let down.\n\nSo, in other words. Not going back.
