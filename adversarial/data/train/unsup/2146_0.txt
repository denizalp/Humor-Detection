I went here on the Friday before Labor Day Weekend, so there was a special holiday dinner going on that night for about $50 pp.  But, I arrived around 2:30, which is before the 3 PM dinner time, so I got to pay the regular lunch price (only $24 pp) - SCORE!  I think that overall, the food was really delicious.  Some notables were the: king crab legs, beef wellington, sea bass, and t-bone lamb steaks.  The beef brisket and St. Louis ribs that were also available during lunch were both very tasty as well.  Some things to pass on are: the Chinese food station and the sushi.  I ate a good amount - definitely worth my $24, but I would not pay $50.  The quality and presentation of the food does not compare to Wicked Spoon or Bacchanal.  If you're going to ONE buffet, go to one of the other two.  But of course, the Bellagio has pretty tasty food and is significantly cheaper than WS or Bacchanal, so if you are going to make a second buffet trip, Bellagio just might be worth it.
