I went to Marquee with very high hopes as it's supposed to be the hottest new club in Vegas. \n\nHowever, I was not impressed by a few quite important factors. But first, let's start with the positives: \n1. Located in the trendy Cosmopolitan \n2. Well crafted cocktails \n3. Higher standards for getting in yet quite feasible - I contacted the promoter Larson beforehand and got me and my bf on the guest list. After that, it's a typical girls on the guest list get in for free and guys on the guest list pay $50 cover. If you're not on the guest list, you can't get in. It's simply that packed and there's a huge line. \n4. Great DJs \n\nHere are the cons and the reason why Marquee is a solid 3 stars: \n1. CRAZY packed. I literally could not even dance on the dance floor let alone move my hand. Since people are so close to each other, drink spills are beyond commonplace. So expect to have cran-vod spills on your sexy Vegas clubbing attire\n2. Very small. The venue is 3 stories with 1 floor for Hip Hop (where I spent most of my time), 1 floor for Electronic and 1 floor for Top 40s\/mashups. Each floor is extremely small with the Hip Hop floor as the smallest. The \"dance floor\" is so tiny that it's no wonder the place is so packed! When I go clubbing, I expect to dance my heart out. And there was simply no room or space to do that. \n3. The stairs from hell. Clearly the genius who designed this club could not have been a woman. To get from floor to floor, you have to walk up a flight of ridiculously high stairs and of course that equates to feet suicide for women.  \n\nSo yes, the music is great and yes, the club is trendy but unfortunately it falls short on a few important tenets that warrant a 4 or 5 star review.
