We went in on a Saturday lunch.  I had the meatloaf sandwich (but got it on a garlic bagel instead)\n\nHOLY COW!!!  Hands down, the best meatloaf sandwich in Arizona.  The tangy glaze on it made it amazing.\n\nHe also DELIVERS IN THE AIRPARK! They will soon know me by voice when I call in.\n\nFriendly service, great food, don't miss the hand-blended lemonade!\n\nMy first sampling of the food was by proxy (someone brought it to me) and it was the chicken salad... another Wow!\n\nI am supposed to be gluten-free, but cheated on this trip, he said he would do lettuce wraps upon request.
