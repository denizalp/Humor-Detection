Yes Yes Yes and.... YES\n\nI absolutely love this place. They have items for every mood\/event\/wardrobe. This is a must visit for when your shopping on the strip. From designers such as Haute Hippie, Zac Posen, Free City, & Beyond Vintage it goes from dressy to casual in 2.5 seconds. I love the broad range of styles and the employees are always nice and helpful. A little pricey but I have a few pieces from here that have lasted years.
