I was on a mission to find another snow place since mine closed down due to relocation. What's a fluffed ice addict to do, right? I happen to be in this part of town so I stopped in after reading Yelp reviews. \nPlace is clean and service is good. I would recommend having tables for 2 rather than large party of 4 tables. \nBoba is their specialty but I was not at all interested in that.  I came here for the fluffy snow.\nOnly 3 flavors offered. I ordered the mango with lychee jelly...you get one regular topping and one premium topping...so I got strawberries and one sauce...condensed milk. They have a wide selection of toppings to choose from. \nIt was served up in a nice rectangular plate that was picture worthy. The small is considerable portion enough to share.\nTexture was light, but still a bit icey that gave me occasional brain freeze. Flavor was good but not the all natural flavor I craved.
