Ok, so maybe this is going to be a hard sell. The girls are not exactly the same caliber as the bigger tourist trap gentlemen's clubs in Vegas. And on a good night (Friday) it can be pretty dead. But if the one club where I wind up having the longest conversations and the best lap dances of any gentlemen's club I've been to happens to be a dive bar too, so be it. Drink prices are reasonable. And having a local buddy with a gold card who gets us in for free every time helps too. I think overall, this place just happens to make this out-of-towner feel like a local.
