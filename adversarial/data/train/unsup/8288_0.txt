Have you tried Wahoo's yet?  \"Nope, I use Google.\"\nFunny name for a Mexican restaurant that doesn't want to be a Mexican restaurant. The building looks more like an Irish pub to me, and I understand that since they took an existing building to open the restaurant but what I don't understand is the decor. Is all about surfing and skate boarding and biking and all the kinds of clothing that goes with it like vans and Oakley and volkom etc. etc. I felt like I was at the mall food court. The food was decent, and prices are great. I really liked the enchiladas with beans and rice. the service was also very good and friendly. Didn't go to the bar area but they have a full bar service.\nWould I come back?  probably yes....... Next time I go surfing.
