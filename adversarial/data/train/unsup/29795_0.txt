If you like the Beatles, GO.  If you like Cirque, GO.\n\nI've seen 6 Cirque shows and this is hands down my favorite.  It's on par with Mystiere.  I do love the Beatles, so I felt it was especially moving -- I wouldn't recommend it if you don't like the Beatles, since the music is such a big piece of the show.\n\nThis show has it all -- music, acrobatics, dance, story line, gorgeous set, daring stunts.  LOVE LOVE.\n\nBy the way, while leaving \"O\" I heard another guy behind me say he also thought Beatles Love was better.  It's not just me.
