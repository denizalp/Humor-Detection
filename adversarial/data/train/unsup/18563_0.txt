So far I have tried Bliss in Chicago and San Francisco.  My boyfriend made an appointment for me here while we were in town for my birthday.  I love the clean modern look of Bliss Spa's and this location is no exception.  The waiting room is super small, but they have the water, crackers, cheese and of course, the brownies.  The brownies here did not hold a candle to the Chicago Bliss, but that didn't stop me from eating 2.  \n\nMy first appointment was a deep tissue massage.  If you have read any of my other reviews, my biggest problem is trying to find a therapist who will actually do a \"deep\" deep tissue-not a problem this day.  She didn't look very strong, but looks are deceiving.  I am glad she started on my back, so I could make silent screams into the doughnut hole.  When I flipped over, she caught me making a couple more faces, but I said-\"keep going!\"  I needed it bad.  My next appointment was the Oxygen facial-which takes 10 years off your face for a few days.  The facial was great.  My complaint is that I added an eyebrow wax and she really did a number on them.  Normally the esthetician will give you a hand mirror for approval, but I never got a peek.  I knew it was probably bad since I don't have a lot of eyebrow to begin with and she was clipping, pulling and waxing forever.  Now, I am trying to let them grow out for my Anastasia appointment in July.\n\nUpon checkout there were tons of Bliss products at the counter that my technicians recommended.  Luckily I am used to this hard sell technique and didn't bite.  I love Bliss products, but when you are dropping spa $$$, the last thing you want to do is drive the bill up any higher.\n\nAll and all, totally relaxed and glowing (with penciled in eyebrows).
