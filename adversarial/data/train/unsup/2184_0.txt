No idea how this place can get a bad review.  The menu's are on the wall.  Right across the street from Bally's (little bit off the strip).  If you can eat all your food, I'll be impressed.  I normally don't like capacino, but theirs...Oh wowza.  Food was awesome however their wine I wasn't a big fan of.  I'll most definitely be back!
