My wife and I stayed at Le Seville through an Airbnb rental and we absolutely loved it.  This place is amazing. We both really enjoyed our stay here.This place was just built about a year ago, so everything is new. Its only two blocks from Atwatter Metro Station and it has a Starbucks and Adonis supermarket in the same building which we both used almost daily. \n\n The condominium has 4 rooftop pools with BBQ Grills, tables, and beautiful views of Montreal. They also have a nice Fitness Center with a sauna, hot tub, and steam room.They also have a lounge area on the 20th floor which overlooks the entire city. This place seems to be soundproof. We didn't  hear any street noise and it's located on a busy part of St Catherine. I'm not a Canadian citizen, but if I was I would really look into living at this place.\n\nSo if you're able to live here, you want regret it. If you just staying in town for a while, there are some tenants that have rentals on Airbnb.  If you want the Airbnb listing that I rented from, just PM me and ask.
