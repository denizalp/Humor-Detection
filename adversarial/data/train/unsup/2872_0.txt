There wasn't a Whole Foods market near my hometown when I was growing up, so I had never experienced one until I moved to Cleveland. Honestly, I think I was a little overwhelmed at first because I didn't understand the flow of the store. That sounds dumb, I know... but it wasn't until my second visit that I began to understand the obsession surrounding this Whole Foods phenomenon. \n\nAs I was slowly perusing all the aisles and displays, I began noticing all the products and foods that I literally didn't know existed. Why did no one tell me there are bacon-flavored coconut chips?? Knowing about cultured-coconut milk yogurt would have saved me so many antacids and lactaid chews over the past few years. And why haven't I tried make-up that isn't made with cancer? Is this what finally being an \"adult\" feels like?
