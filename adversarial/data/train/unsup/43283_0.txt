We have purchased an $1,800 sectional, and a 5 piece bedroom set from this Mor location less than 2 years ago.  We were talked into the 7 year warranty protection plan at an additional high cost.  DO NOT BUY THE WARRANTY! First off, the way they allow you to submit a claim is extremely difficult and they literally make you jump through hoops to get it submitted.  Second, they deny every single claim.  We submitted 2 claims, which were clearly valid in the pamphlet we were given, but denied without explanation.  And nobody will tell us anything other than \"submit another case\".  It's absolute trash coverage and a scam.  \n\nIf you aren't sure whether to believe me or not, check out their reviews online.  \nhttps:\/\/guardsman.pissedconsumer.com\n\nWe won't go to Mor any longer due to them partnering with such a trash company.
