Such a cute salon! I have always been fairly capable at painting my own nails, but on a whim, I decided to let someone else do it. After researching some local manicure options, I opted to try The Beauty Room. As it turns out, this was an excellent choice!\n\nI had no idea what a difference it would make to have my nails done professionally, but they looked amazing. My manicurist took her time carefully shaping and painting my nails. My nails are naturally very rounded, so I asked for the tall order of squaring them off. She admitted that might be a challenge, but said she would try her best- she squared them off perfectly! I was very impressed.\n\nEveryone in the salon couldn't have been nicer, and there's no question that I will be back!
