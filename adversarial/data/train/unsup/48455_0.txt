Surprised that I did not get a written slip of my order or even a list\/amount of items, I asked the attendant about that. He said he would write it all up later.\nWell my request was to have my \"pants\" pressed only, but instead they later wrote on the order press only on my \"shirts\" instead of my pants (opposite of my request), which I assume now means that my shirts never got cleaned.\nThe staff was nice and polite, but I would suggest they hand customers a slip or something with their order to confirm they have it right, instead of writing up the order at a later time creating the possibility of getting it wrong.\nIt was my first time here, next time I will insure to get a slip\/order before I leave.  Looking forward to better experience next time:)
