mmmmm...,,,,mmm... bad! This place was definitely not what a majority of my co-workers had described it.  How can you burn chicken that bad? Here are my ratings for their service:\n\nCustomer Service - 5 Stars\nChicken Pasta - 1 Star (only because the chicken wasn't burnt)\nMashed Potatoes - 1\/2 Star (only for the effort)\n\nI ordered the family 4 meal and it was terrible.  I was hoping to write a good review, but the chicken pasta was soaked in thousand island dressing.  Not a huge fan of thousand island sauce unless i can use it on my \"In & Out\" burger.  \n\nMashed Potatoes? Sooooooo disappointed, they covered my mashed potatoes with gravy for me so when i got home it had all blended in together.  Husband was not happy.  \n\nChicken was very bland in seasoning, but thanks to the charred areas, there was a burnt taste at least.  \n\nI wish I could say more about the place, but unfortunately \"this is all she wrote\".
