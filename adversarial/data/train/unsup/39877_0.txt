Not exactly the best property management company I've ever worked with. I had a pool that was always dirty, because the pump never worked. I was left without AC for far too long living in Las Vegas. The spa was never cleaned. Ever. but they were quick to demand wall thrus. Still waiting on my deposit. It's been a month and ten days. This place sucks end of story.
