Great service and nice ambiance, but the food doesn't hold up. \n\nI started with the spinach, apple and Gorgonzola salad, which comes with chicken, and none of the flavors worked right. The nicest thing I could say about the salad was that the spinach wasn't wilty at all. \n\nNext, we had ordered the four-cheese pasta which features broccoli and chicken, and it fell flat. The rich white sauce lacked flavor,and the broccoli looked good but tasted odd. The chicken was completely different from the chicken on the salad - in a good way, but it was still kind of odd. \n\nI could see myself coming back here just for the convenience factor, but it won't be with any anticipation for good food, unfortunately.
