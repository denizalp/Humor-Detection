A fun thing to do once in awhile. Of course I'm talking about \"The Market\" - the make your own stir fry area of the restaurant. This place is never very busy in my opinion - I never have to wait long in the market line (well not wait behind other customers, tho you do have to wait while your food is cooked). They have now adjusted their pricing which seems to be a good deal - for just a one time charge of $1.50 you can get seconds and thirds and... Then for just $2.99 extra you can get one to go which makes for a very cheap lunch the next day - and you can change how you make it, including your meat and grain selection so it won't be the boring same thing.
