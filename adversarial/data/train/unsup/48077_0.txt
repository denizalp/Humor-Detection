I had a bad experience with this company. First of all, Tony, the associate who greeted us, tried to charge us three different times for unnecessary upgrades in a very sneaky manner. (For example, offering us a car with a GPS without letting us know that cost extra, and informing us that he'd upgraded us for comfort to a bigger vehicle without us requesting something larger). This behaviour was off-putting, to say the least, especially since we were just renting the car for a night and 2 days and had made it clear we were budget-conscious. \n\nWhen we returned the vehicle, we were charged $83.00 extra for fuel and service! We had returned the tank 3\/4 full. No idea where this 83 dollar charge came from. \n\nI will not be using Hertz at this location again and will not recommend it to friends. Have had much better experiences with other rental companies.
