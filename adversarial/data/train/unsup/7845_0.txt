800 Degrees is part of the newly updated front for Monte Carlo.  Decided to check out 800 Degrees since I've heard many good things about it in LA.  They actually claim to be the best pizza in LA!\n\nI went for the Sausage & Peppers, which is their thin crust pizza topped with Italian sausage, peppadews, and caramelized onions.  I also added artichoke as an additional topping and I gotta say, I was quite impressed.  All the toppings' quality is tops and that sausage was straight up addicting.  I sorta wanted to give them a bad review just cause I wish there was more.  Usually I don't like crust but couldn't get enough of the thin crust here!  Mozza and sauce was great as well.\n \nSince it is the Strip location, it is much pricier.  Pizzas are a few bucks more and for each topping added, it is $1.50.  Oh well.\n\nTried two salad here: Caesar and the Gorgonzola.  Definitely go for the Gorgonzola if a salad is a must.  The candied walnuts did it for me.  The Caesar was just way too bland.  But really, just get more pizza instead of salad.\n\nBurrata options on the menu.  Will definitely try that some other time.\n\nThey also have some craft beers on draft, and at the time, Goose Island!\n\nOverall, I dig the simple decor.  Pizza's tasty, salads can be ignored.  Funny how I had to go to Vegas to try 800 Degrees haha.
