Little chunks of dead animal bits on bamboo sticks with seasonings thrown on it then left on a fire for a few minutes...SMART!!\n\nCool new place for Yakitori, a pretty decent selection at decent prices for a decent size. What's not so decent: The flavor. Plenty of deliciousness if you know what to order\n\nLamb - Not very gamey (i like gamey), good fat to meat ratio. lightly dusted with cumin after it's grilled. Very nice\n\nChicken Thigh - Not dry, generously seasoned, damn tasty\n\nChicken Gizzard - a table favorite, ate over 6 of these\n\nChicken Hearts - they've been butterflied and are slightly on the dry side but not to the point where they're hard and chewy, still perfectly tender\n\nChicken Cartilage - I assumed it was going to be the cartilage from the breast since other places i've been to served it that way. Instead i received the cartilage from the joint of what i'm assuming to be the drumlet. This is a hit or miss depending on personal preference, for me it was a miss as i was expecting something else.\n\nBeef - I think it's the ribeye skewer, honestly didnt compare to the others, ribeye is an excellent high quality cut of beef but in my opinion doesnt do very well in this application. chunks of boneless short ribs would have been my choice\n\nScallop - What they lack in size they make up in flavor. these are DAMN TASTY and juicy\n\nSalmon - Salmon\n\nFish Ball - meh\n\nBeef Ball - Whoa these are good, lightly brushed with some sauce they're slightly crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Some good stuff\n\nShiitake Mushroom - Nicely seasoned rehydrated mushroom caps. \n\nGarlic Butter Mussels - Order the 12 piece...6 won't last. \n\nPassion Fruit Brain Freezer Slushy\n - Got this with the BeeGee mix which is the Lychee Jelly and the Passion Fruit Jelly. Very good on the size to cost ratio and even a better deal with paired with an entree. I like it better then Tea Station\n\nWhat i'd like to see on the menu:\n- Okra \n- Chicken Liver\n- Chicken Cartilage (from the breast)\n\nOverall Beegee has a lot of potential once it decides what it wants to be. The menu is part Tea Station part cheaper Ichiza (limited to the Yakitori obviously). The location itself takes advantage of the drive through but i wouldnt consider or recommend ordering anything drive through or take out. Yakitori is ment to be served within minutes of cooking it.\n\nPortion sizes are small and priceing is fair and out of everything we ordered there was nothing to complain about taste wise. Everything was nicely seasoned, sometimes overseasoned but not to the point where it was too overwhelming. \n\nI would LOVE to come here to snack and socialize. There's enough variety and flavor as well as an comfortable atmosphere to bring a few friends, order a bunch of dead animal parts and share a few laughs. Now if only beer was on the menu and instead of a closing time of 11pm it was adjusted to 1am...oh well wishful thinking.
