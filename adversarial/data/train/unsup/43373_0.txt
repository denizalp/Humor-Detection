While the East side shelter may not look like much, I have adopted 4 wonderful animals there. I looked around the Humane Society and even AAWL and some other shelters but I only found animals who's personalities I enjoyed at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control.\n\nSome people have told me that they find the East side shelter depressing. While I appreciate that it is nice to see them in a fancy up-to-date facility, it seems nicer still to take one from that situation home. Furthermore, if you look closely, you'll realize that these animals are taken care of by the techs. In fact, I always found the vet techs really knew a fair amount about the animals I adopted. They always had something to say about them, especially my Molly girl. She was already a senior and everyone was so happy to see her go home. Three people told me what a wonderful girl she was... and she was, the very best of the best. I've never been more in love and I wish she'd lived a lot longer.\n\nI never liked the personalities of the animals at the other shelters. I even spent time playing with them but they never were quite right. Maybe it is the way they are handled or maybe it is the facilities, but my pets were always so personable and happy to come home. I never had to do an animal introduction because they always fit. Perhaps I just got lucky, but when I adopted my most recent dog from the West side MCACC facilities, I had the same experience. I spent all weekend wondering around and playing with different animals but I didn't like any of them. Then, for the first time, I went to MCACC on the West side. I'd never realized how convenient it was to me! The moment I saw my new dog, I fell in love. She just fit perfectly into the family like she was always there.\n\nIf you are overly sensitive to the facilities, please go to the West side center which was rebuilt since I adopted my dog. It is beautiful and open and rivals the Arizona Humane Society's Dobbins Campus. The workers are so thrilled to adopt out the animals and these days their kennels are filled. MCACC tries hard to keep their animals alive. While they may be run by the county, they need those donations too. The more you give, the more they can keep alive. \n\nAlso, Uno por Uno works with MCACC to provide free spay and neuter clinics as well as free rabies! They focus on the low income and areas where the culture is less likely to spay and neuter. MCACC facilities provide regular rabies vaccinations and microchipping clinics at the lowest prices in the valley. They used to provide other vaccines and services but, unfortunately, the AZ Humane Society muscled through some legislation years ago that stopped that. :( I go to their clinics every year now that the budget is tight. Even in all the mayhem, they are generous, organized and always watching out for the pets. \n\nKeep an eye out for their special adoption drives and donating to the Friends of Animal Care & Control.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.maricopa.gov\/Pets\/AboutUs\/Default.aspx\nhttp:\/\/azfaccs.org.mywebsitebuild.com\/about\/
