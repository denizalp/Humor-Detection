Best thing about our stay at Hotel 32 in the Monte Carlo?  Ok besides the Jabbawockeez? Oh yeah, not much.  Certainly not the room, and not even the cupcakes. \n\nI thought, \"Great! At least there's a silver lining in this little old school hotel\", but after I actually had the cupcakes, I was thinking otherwise.  \n\nThey looked really cute, with all the glitz and glitter, but they tasted blah and were really pretty dry.  So, so sad.
