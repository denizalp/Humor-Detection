I've been going to Nazy for years, even before she got this shop and was in the mall. She's the only one I trust with my brows! There has been times she has closed the shop down for weeks  and I still will wait until she gets back and not go elsewhere.  Threading does hurt, I still tear up when I get it done lol but it's definitely worth it. It can get very busy on Friday & Saturdays so I try to go through the week. Always good, consistent results every time though!
