This restaurant is typically hit or miss. When it's a hit, the food order is perfect and food is delicious! But I've had my share of miss and that's when they've messed up my order or overcooked my food! If they address some of these inconsistencies, I can easily bump them up to 5 stars. All in all, they are family friendly and have lovely decor for dining in. We usually order the fish n chips and recently the crab cakes. Free cookie Wednesdays is a nice plus!
