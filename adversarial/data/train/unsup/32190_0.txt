Fish was very fresh and nice - you can choose your own fresh fish.  Service was nice.  Here is my hang up: the prices of the sides, absolutely nuts.  Holland peppers: take a red and yellow bell pepper, cut into thirds. Brush with olive oil, add some salt, place of grill for a few minutes, plate, splash some balsamic vinegar (not even reduced), charge $21 should cost 1\/2 that.
