Excellent work.  Had a few rock chips on my hood that I wanted to get taken care of (Lexus GS300).  Local paint and body places were quoting 700-2000 and saying I needed to repaint the whole front clip of my car.  The paint is in excellent condition, I was not interested in the re-paint if possible.\n\nSaw a deal on Miracle Touch and figured why not? - if it goes bad I have to repaint anyway.  Well I was really impressed how detailed the repair was.  Most of the chips are now invisible unless you get very close.  Just looks amazing.\n\nDid not even realize I had a few other spots, but they got taken care of at the same time.  Could not be happier with the work or the attention to detail.\n\nWould absolutely have them out again.
