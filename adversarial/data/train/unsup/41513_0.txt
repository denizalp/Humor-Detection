I like the patio here a greeat deal.  Correction: I like the patio here before 10 pm. Then it becomes clubby.  Ick.  Once the guys dipped in hair gel, the girls teetering on stripper heels, and the want to be seen crowd roll in, I have to bolt. 'Tis a shame because this is a great location and a huge patio.  The bartenders are very quick and they have a great happy hour, but if you are over 35, it's kinda sad after 10 pm.  Unless you're a Cougar.. then you may love it.
