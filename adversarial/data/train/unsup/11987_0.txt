Had the new roast beef with au jus sandwich.  I was able to sub a caesar salad for the default bottomless fries.  Server was friendly and understanding as I had a few questions for her before I could order.  \n\nThe fourth star was for the complimentary birthday sundae that was waiting for me when I had arrived back from a visit to the restroom.  Now why would I rate an extra star for this, you ask?  Since I actually paid for the meal with a birthday coupon, I had not expected the complimentary sundae.  Quite thoughtful of the server, I thought, and this act garnered her a few more dollars in tips!
