Mr. Hottie and I ventured over here today to check it out. Talk about a diet deviation!  I was a little nervous to disappoint him as he's from Illinois and Great Dane's claims to serve Chicago Style Dogs. I took a deep breath and went inside.\n\nGreat Dane's is an older building that could be designated as a charming little hole in the wall. The inside is covered with pictures of dogs, those you eat and those you pet. \n\nWe went to the counter to order and were greeted warmly. The girl behind the counter was friendly and explained what the various types of dogs were. Mr. Hottie chose 2 Chicago Style dogs (Great Danes) and I chose the Hound Dog (a larger hot dog) with cheese, chili and sauerkraut (hey... don't knock it until you try it). All the dogs come with your choice of fries or coleslaw.\n\nWe grabbed a small table and waited for our order. It wasn't long before our food was brought to our table. My hot dog was delicious. The meat was all Vienna Beef and it wasn't at all greasy or mushy. My hot dog was actually \"meaty\" if you will. Mr. Hottie's dogs were good! (Sigh of relief). He said the same thing about his dog. A few observations he had was that he wished that they added more Sports peppers on the dog. It only came with one on each dog. He also wished for more tomato. The dogs automatically came with sauerkraut which, I learned, is not usually on a traditional Chicago dog unless you ask for it. \n\nOverall, we liked Great Dane's. It's a little old gem and I'm sure we'll visit it again whenever we're feeling naughty and craving wieners! HOT DOGS YOU PERVS! Go check it out. You'll see what I mean.
