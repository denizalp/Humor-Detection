So I've been here a half dozen times now (not by choice mind you!) and the 2 star rating still holds. \n\nAn example of how rude their servers are: \nI ordered a sushi platter described on the menu as \"california roll, and tuna hand roll\". I despise spicy tuna (I hate spicy things and hate mayo) so imagine my surprise when a *spicy* tuna handroll shows up. I explain to the waiter the menu says just tuna so I'd like a tuna handroll. He refuses, says I'm wrong, the menu says \"spicy\" and walks away. I have to freaking go grab a menu , show him the words \"tuna hand roll\" , and ask again for a new handroll before he goes and grabs me another one. UGH\n\nBesides the service, the food is just BLAH. Bland, expensive. I'm into the whole foo-foo lunch thing, but honestly Society Cafe at Encore does the whole concept far better. The surf and turf tacos for $17 are TINY. I got a filet mignon cobb salad today for $18. I order my steak medium rare. The salad is so sad looking and imagine my disappointment to find my \"filet mignon\" is 2 ounces or so of grizzly, tough, dark brown \"steak\". Hardly a filet mignon, definitely not medium rare, and for sure 2 ounces of steak over greens for $18 is a ripoff. The sushi is a step above grocery store sushi - yup, that's the best I can say for it. \n\nRant over . Space is still beautiful but service & food continue to go downhill.
