My cuzn took me here when i was visiting him in AZ. I gotta same its pretty bomb. Buffalo tenders were some of the best ive had. Slide were awesome as were the (mini) ribs or whatever you call them. They make a great long island too!  Its all cowboy themes out & they have a mechanical bull to throw fools on their arse! Only thing sucked is there were more guys than girls down to tangle with it...maybe because it was kinda early. Ill have to go again when its later and do a 2nd review. They aso have med tvs eveywhere showing diff sporting events. This spot gets 4 thumbs up! which equals 4 stars.  If your in the area...do ittt!
