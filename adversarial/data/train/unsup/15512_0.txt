They messed up my name when I went to change it after getting married, and when I went back to have them fix it - they didn't have the autonomy to, so I now have a last name as my first name, and as my last name on my Driver's License and my car is officially registered to \"Mr. Nelson Innes.\" \n\nThe most ridiculous part about the whole situation was their inability to fix the mistake THEY made. I brought my Driver's License and Health Card in with me when I went back to have it fixed, since they had only botched my Driver's License and somehow gotten it right on my Health Card, and they told me I also had to have my marriage certificate with me, which I hadn't brought this time. \n\nI even asked if I could just pay to have my name changed, as I was under the impression this was something that could be done, and I even saw as an option on the Change of Name forms, and they told me I couldn't. \n\nThey didn't have any of the original documentation or copies of it, and when I told them I refused to go home get my marriage certificate and come wait in line all over again for a mistake they had made but could not fix, they told me my only other option was to go get the documentation which was at an office up at the north end of the city, and no they could not \"order\" the documents to be sent to their office. \n\nSo, as a result, my Driver's License is still for Nelson Innes, while on my Passport I'm Jennifer Innes and on my Health Card I'm Jennifer Nelson - so we'll see how this all plays out...
