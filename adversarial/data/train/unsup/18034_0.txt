Noooooo I'm tired of all these boring neighborhood bars in Glendale. You can afford to add something other than budmillercoors on tap. Do something cool. Step into the 2010s. Like, *at least* Four Peaks could be useful here. I feel the same way about going to Hooper's as I would going on a date with someone who starts their day with a PSL and a Meghan Trainor album. Basic as fuck, I want no part of it. \n\nBartender was nice, but I don't trust anyone at a place like this to mix more than two ingredients. So I went with something simple--Red Stag and coke. The coke was flat. Whatever, let's check out what's going on with the jukebox...which was apparently not connecting with the internet. OK OK, it was becoming comically bad. At least it's got a patio, even if it is incredibly narrow. \n\nOverall, this is the kind of bar you only go to for convenience and not because it's cool. The west valley overall is raising the bar for a good dive, and I hope Hooper's can recognize that and catch up. Two stars for being clean, polite, and having a respectable liquor selection, but there ain't much else.
