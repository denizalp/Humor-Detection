What an AMAZING venue! Now technically I can't speak about the food (I know I know), but the venue itself is fantastic. Great decor, swanky feel, super nice staff (shout out to Tim & Angelo) and all the added extras if you're looking to hold an event.\n\nThere are almost three separate areas (but with an open concept feel) - when you walk in there are bench booths and tables for lounging\/drinking with a huge bar right beside. Amazing light fixtures too.\nArea two - Dining tables a few steps up, accompanied with a dj booth that spins every Friday & Saturday.\nArea three - a great upstairs with a few dining tables and could be used as a green room\/swag area, silent auction space etc. There's also a retractable screen that can block this area off all together - so funky\n\nLoved it, GREAT for events (need to book far in advance) but also have dinner Wed-Sat. You're able to book events any night of the week - apparently it's really popular for baptisms, showers, weddings, surprise parties etc.
