I like this place alot. More that volo or the biere market. And i like it more because of the food.\n\nFirst off, they make beer selection a little easier with their categorizaion. And they have a huge huge beer list. But they take it one step further and pair if with your food - that also has beer in it including the icecream.\n\nEverything on the dinner menu is good. Specifically the mussels and i also love their taco, but really everything i'\\ve tried there hasn't disappointed - even the flatbreads.\n\nThe ambience isn't too bad, however, given the location, their is a high concentration of suits to regular people. The suits unfortunately take over the bar and areas to sit down at and it doesn't help that they've probably been snorting coke for 4 hours. There is a dining room area, but you may have to wait.
