oh, you need a bowling ball? maybe a 20ft american flag? oh no? just a dozen kordell stewart jerseys? well then, you're in luck, because this place has it all.\n\ni really just have three words for you though: thirty. dollar. taxidermy.\n\nthat's right, a few years ago i scored an awesome deer mount, antlers and all for $30. even in my limited knowledge of hunting and taxidermy i'm confident in saying that is a steal.\n\nthanks to that deer (no, i haven't named it.. it's creepy enough i have it) i will always be in debt to this red white & blue.
