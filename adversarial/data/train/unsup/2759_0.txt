Why 3 stars? Because updates are desperately needed.\n\n   ---   ---   ---\n\nI've been flying into Hopkins since I was 2 years old. I waited all year long for our annual summer vacation to spend in Cleveland with family.\n\nThe problem with Hopkins is that it seems like it hasn't been updated a ton since 1986. Everything just kind of seems old and worn. \n\nAnd as an avid defender of Cleveland, I feel that the airport doesn't do the city any favors. Cleveland has always been the butt of any joke related to a city that just generally sucks and is totally undesirable. But Cle gets a raw deal here, as there's plenty of awesomeness in the 216 and the 440. \n\nSo my please to the folks in charge of such things: update stuff! Make the airport not look like the mid 80's everywhere. Signage, decor, the flooring, etc. Let's join the modern era! I'd love to see the reactions of people dreading a business trip to Cleveland, who exit the plane, and say, \"wow... this is..... NICE!\"\n\n#TeamHopkinsRenovate
