If you like your burgers organic and non-GMO and all that conscious food jazz, come to Bareburger. If not, still, come here because their burgers are friggin' jawbreakers!\n\nWell, oh fine: you pay quite a bit more to feed these Yankee hipster hippies' cause for using conscious ingredients, and not every burger produced comes stacked over half a foot tall, especially if you choose from preprogrammed options. But how many places are there in Toronto where you can get a bison patty, or elk, or wild boar?\n\nThe greasy appearance of a Bareburger burger immediately washes away any thought of fluffy happy cows on the pasture. You can create your own burger from an organized list of stuff, and if you're me and go crazy with everything, you'll probably end up with a skyscraper of a burger that struggles to fit in a mouth as humanly possible. I find that surprising for a place like this--and just as surprising how quickly my order arrived. My own bison burger concoction was juicy and a carpet bomb of flavours and textures--alfalfa absolutely works well as a burger topping (as does blue cheese as always). \n\nService was generally pleasant, detailing how their build-your-own option works. One thing they failed to tell me and comes as a pleasant billing surprise: weekday $6 draughts and wine happy hour until 7. You're very welcome.\n\n{TTC: To reach Dundas at Bay you shall take the 505 or 6 routes.}
