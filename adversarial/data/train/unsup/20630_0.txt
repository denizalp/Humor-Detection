Beware. Big time. \nIf you just want a ride, they can do that.\nBUT, if you want \"private, intimate & memorable\" with the use of of a privacy divider between you and the driver, get ready to be badly disappointed. My clear request, both at booking, and once the driver arrived, NEVER included notification that due to alleged \"safety and heating\/cooling needs,\" all of this company's dividers are disabled. \nThen please TELL the customer this when booking and before taking their money!\nAfter our experience, I called several other Valley companies, NONE of which used this policy. A couple of them actually had a hard time believing this limo company would not honor clients' privacy. After all, they said, what's a divider meant to do in the first place?\nI gave the Mirage manager every chance to make me a reasonably satisfied customer.\nI suggested they refund the difference between the 3 hour minimum and the 1 hour we actually used. After a quick \"no,\" I asked what they might do to address the situation. All he offered was to launch into a long \"why\" they do what they do and why I was getting NOTHING from them.  \nForget basic customer service too. \nIt took 2 calls and nearly a week for a call back.  This manager, like the one before him, insisted I'd not be able to talk to the owner. The last guy said HE made the final decision and he would NOT be making an adjustment to my account.\nVery well. \nI too am in a profession which lives and dies by user reviews. The customer is NOT always right, but I'll let you be the judge as to whether or not this company did us wrong. You can vote with your pocket book.
