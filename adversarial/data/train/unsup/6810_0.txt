Absolute garbage.  Our 1-year anniversary dinner at GHT would have been \"sub-par\" for a cheap chain like Applebee's.  Instead, the crappy food and poor service came with a tab that ran well over twice that amount.\n\nChicken wings: Small & sickly-looking wings that were over-cooked by an offensive amount.\n\nStrip steak: A *terrible* cut of meat.  Chewy with tendons, I've literally had better $10 sirloins from TGIF.  To their credit, the steak was ordered \"rare\" and cooked just about perfectly.\n\nCocktails: Pretty delicious, except some random busboy snatched my glass that was still 1\/2 full, dumped it into a sink with some other dirty glasses and walked away without as much as a word.\n\nThe service and atmosphere were pretty lame as well. Our waitress was unattentive. I'm still mad at their dopey drink-stealing busboy.  We were stuffed into bench-style seating, cramming us in next to a party of four while nearby tables sat empty.\n\nConclusion: \nPoorly-sourced meats, below-average service & atmosphere, EXTREMELY overpriced.\nWill NEVER eat here again.\nWould NEVER recommend it to anyone.
