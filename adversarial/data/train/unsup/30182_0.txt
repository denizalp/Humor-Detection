I'm surprised this place is so highly rated. The M casino is beautiful, there's beautiful views of the strip from here, but I left here feeling very underwhelmed.\n\nThe food is highly priced. An order of shrimp cocktail is $18 and has 3 pieces of shrimp. That's $6 per shrimp. I don't care how good that shrimp is, but $6 for one? Soups are about $11 for a mediocre size bowl. I can go on and on about everything I ordered, but I think I've said enough.\n\nI've been to the steakhouse at the Silverton, their creamed corn is to die for. Here at Anthony's, we barely touched it. The steak at Red Rock, I still can't forget how the beef melted in my mouth. Eating the steak here, I felt it was tender but I could make it myself at home. Out of all the steakhouses, this one is on the bottom. BUT it was the most expensive. We ordered 4 appetizers, 2 soups, 2 different steaks, lobster, sea bass, and 3 sides. The best thing I had on the menu was the scalloped potatoes and that's a side dish. That's sad.\n\nNeedlessly to say, I will not be back. Not worth the price at all. Service was whatever for such an upscale restaurant. Our bread came out late and was cold. I still think the M casino is beautiful and might be back for drinks and the view but will probably never eat here again. Way too overpriced. I left here angry that I spent so much and was so unsatisfied.
