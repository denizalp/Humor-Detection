Once a year I go to Bear Claw to replace the batteries on my watches.  Jo may not be talkative, but will muster a few words if that's what you need.  After she takes the battery cover off, she'll take the battery and check to see if it really is dead by using a battery tester, or if there's something wrong with the watch itself.  Once in awhile, she'll find that the battery still has some juice left and immediately reaches for a dirty toothbrush (cringe) to clean off whatever dust may be preventing full contact.  After replacing dead batteries with new ones, she replaces the covers with an old pill bottle altered to allow her to apply pressure to the covers with minimal to no visible scratches.  Be aware that the covers of Brighton watches always seem to take more coaxing to detach and re-attach.  If your watches are new, or you'd rather not chance the occurrence of scratches, take them elsewhere, but I've only noticed a scratch, or two after visiting Jo at Bear Claw over the last few years.\n\n$6 for one battery, or $5 each when you bring three, or more!\n\np.s.  Bear Claw seems to sell gently (and not-so-gently) used clothing and other items.  I haven't stopped to actually study what she does sell, so I can't tell you what you may find.  Years ago, the scent of the place reminded me of the food and\/or fish sections of pet stores, and at other times, of used cat litter, or perhaps of a musky dog in need of a bath, but that was before, and now the place just has that old musty-attic scent that lingers over gently- and not-so-gently used human and pet articles.  Anyway, I just go here to get my watches working again, and Jo always sees that they do!
