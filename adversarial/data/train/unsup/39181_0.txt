This homophobic establishment decided to seat everyone but myself and my two guests. We waited over 40 minutes while we watched other guests be seated who came in after us. I expressed my concern with the rude hostess who rolled her eyes and decided to seat us immediately. I told the hostess we should receive some type of compestation for their oversight but she said she would get her manager. She returned with an overly aggressive man who claimed to be the manager. They refused to service us. I'm not sure if it was because we were gay or black but either way I believe I was discriminated against. I wouldn't visit this establishment again!
