I hate to pull the \"Noir Card\" card...but prepare yourself, because I'm about to.\n\nAs a Noir level MLife member, you come to expect good treatment from the hosts and staff at clubs in the MLife family.  Now, I understand that Light Group manages and runs the clubs - not the hotels themselves - but it's still a courtesy to have a little grace with the people who've spent a ridiculous (and I mean RIDICULOUS) amount of money at the casino in which they're located.  \n\nSome friends of mine were in Vegas and after getting a day bed at Daylight, we had a little disco nap, went to dinner, and headed over to Light.  The group was small - just 4 of us, even ratio - and after dropping some serious cash at the pool, we figured that getting into the club wouldn't be too big an issue, considering the SAME \"manager\" was working the night club line.  We. Were. Mistaken.\n\nEven though I'm local, and even though I'm a Noir member, and even though we'd spent a grip of cash that day at the pool...he said \"I'm sorry, but I'm still going to have to charge you a cover and have you wait in line.\"\n\n...Really?  Wait...really?\n\nLook, there are loads of clubs and bars we can go to - so if you want to play the exclusive game, go right ahead...but I'm taking my business elsewhere.
