Went here for my bachelorette party and we didn't get our food for an hour 15 minutes... there were 9 of us. It was quite dramatic, although the food and drinks were good but extremelllly delayed at getting them to our table.  The waitress cried and disappeared, the whole [2 hour] experience was super weird.
