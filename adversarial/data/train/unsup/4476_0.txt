Let's just say it went from bad to awesome.  We make reservations for our birthday party and when we got there did not know about it.  So,  we ended up at a small table.  But our waitress was amazing.  \n\nI wish I remembered her name, because she did an marvelous job.  She remembered all of our orders, got our drinks and food out quick and she was really nice too.  \n\nBetween the drinks and food.  My favorite things at Del Frisco is the VIP, Skirt Chaser, Baltimore Hottie, Roasted Tomato flat bread, cheese steak egg rolls and the chicken wings.  \n\nAt the end of our evening we got surprised with free desserts from the manager.  :)  OMG the coconut cream pie is to die for and the Lemon Doberge Cake was amazing too.  \n\nThank you Del Frisco for a excellent party birthday.  We will definitely be back.
