Wanted to try the \"other guys\" and nearly went into a diabetic Koma at Kuma's. This is not fluffed ice as it should be. The texture is more like frozen yogurt that is overly sweet and gooey with a processed taste. They only offer 2 sizes starting at $5.00 which is high and the smallest size is still too much to finish such a heavy dessert. The plus is that you get up to 3 toppings included and a drizzle of your choice.\nParking lot is small and a bit chaotic. Store is bright and clean with modern feel.\nI do prefer the lighter texture and flavor choices of the other place over Kuma and am happy they are on our side of town. But at least I tried it.
