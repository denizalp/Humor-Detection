Went here for Sunday breakfast on August 2, 2015. Cappuccino was ok, not great but our omelette arrived smothered in cheese which we didn't order so they took it back and rushed a replacement out and it was totally raw inside. The third try was ok but the potatoes were now cold as was the toast. I would skip this one as they have no attention to detail.
