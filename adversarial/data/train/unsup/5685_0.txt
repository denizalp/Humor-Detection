One of the best art exhibits I have ever seen was an O'Keeffe Stieglitz presentation here; it was so personal and detailed.  Really an in depth gorgeous experience.  This was a few years ago.  \n\nThis time it was an exhibit on the human form.  Although it was much much smaller than the O'Keeffe exhibit it was nicely put together with notable pieces from Renoir, Picasso, Hockney all the way to a Cindy Sherman photograph.  Good variety, but small.\n\nThis is one of my favorite places to go in Vegas and will go every time I visit; LOVE IT!\n\nP.S. It is so f-ing LAME people complain about the price- morons!  It costs $15 for a sandwich on the strip and 3 seconds to loose $15 gambling STFU!
