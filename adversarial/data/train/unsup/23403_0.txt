Came in couple of weeks ago to purchase my favorite Anastasia eyebrow pencil.   But since my mom was with me, she all of the sudden had a wicked interest in freshening up her cosmetics.   I loved that as it was her 80th birthday and the fact that she still loves makeup made me happy. \n\nA beautiful young lady with perfect theatrical makeup was the one that helped us.  She was very helpful and swiftly found the items mom needed\/wanted.\n\nI definitely love this location at Planet Hollywood Miracle Mile location.   \n\nThere's always security here.  I think there may be a lot of theft at this location as it's right by the exit.  So don't expect not to have eyes on you.\n\nAside from all that, there are always makeup experts for those that need them.
