If you haven't tried a banh mi sandwich before you should hunt this food truck down and cross it off your foodie bucket list. We were lucky to catch up with them at the food truck rally in Matthews.  \n\nMy husband got the lemongrass beef sandwich and the Asian in me was compelled to get BBQ pork Vietnamese rice bowl....delicious! I highly suggest ordering the egg on top of the sandwich (got this little nugget of info from one of the yelp reviews). The meal came with a ramekin of sauce. We weren't sure what it was or even what meal it was supposed to go with so we didn't ask questions and dumped it over the rice bowl. It complemented the dish well without over powering it.  \n\nThis place is worth following to its next destination. We'll definitely be back.
