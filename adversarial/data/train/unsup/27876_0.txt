Advantage Car Rental at the Las Vegas Airport is the worst I wish i could put 1\/2 star this was the worst experience I've ever had at a rental place, 2 hours trying to rent a car here in Las Vegas, the people at the counter insisting and insisting on you getting their insurance...people in this counter are CLUELESS......do not waste your money or your time PLEASE than we go get the car and there's no one there to give you the car and check it so we had to take a video of everything the car had before we left because NO ONE WAS THERE....what in the world!!!!! ....this is RIDICULOUS!!!! never ever ever again will I or any of my family members will come to this car rental again I will go get any other company and the price is not worth the aggravation we just went through...
