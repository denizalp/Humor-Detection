A friend and I were there for dinner on Sunday 3\/18\/2018.  When we walked in the place smelled like a sewer. My friend from Seattle mentioned the smell. Embarrassing since I had recommended the place from past experience. After about 15 minutes the smell dissipated thank goodness because I was thinking about leaving before we ordered. My friend asks the waiter about Saki. The waiter states he knows nothing about the saki or food there because he does not eat there. WTH???  So my friend wound up ordering Saki he liked but there was a Saki menu hidden behind a tray of condiments some of which he would have liked better . Luckily the rolls, sashimi and oysters were very good still, otherwise the evening would have been an embarrassing disaster.
