This is the worse place to ever visit. My maid of honor and beidesmaid purchased this for my bachelorette party. The staff dont talk to you or give you directions on where to go. 2 rooms were out of order but we were never notified prior to arrival even tho our tickets were purchased well in advance. Then they have a sign that says no shoes beyond a certain point but they never give you shoes. My sister and myself  burned our feet on the hot ground and the owners never apologized or anything. We literally stayed for less than 5 mins and they never even offered our money back. Then the guuy has the nerve to say it must of been a miscommunication. No there wasnt a miscommunication there was no communication. I would never return to this place of business nor advise anyone wlse to go there.  I gave 1 star because i couldnt give zero stars
