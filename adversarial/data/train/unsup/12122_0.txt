I love all the unlimited toppings you care to our on your sub,  some creative choices include candied walnuts,  cranberries,  hummus,  French onions,  and house chips. \n\nYou can also thin your which,  where the cut out some of the middle bread so there's less carbs. \n\nI have been really trying to bring myself to get the Elvis wich with bananas, peanut butter and bacon!\n\nHowever, I think the novelty of the place draws me more than the actual sandwiches.
