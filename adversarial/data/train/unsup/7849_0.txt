I will make this quick because we only ordered lo mein and a eggroll for takeout. \n\nI happen to agree with Lucretiz about the eggrolls...way too much goop. It made me feel like mush mouth when I took a bite. So, we won't do that ever again. \n\nI do have a good word about the chicken lo mein tho. Let the church say \"Amen\"! The chicken was juicy and flavorful but not overly salty which is perfect. The veggies mixed in were fresh and full of flavor. It was worth the bill. \n\nWhile the food from here wasn't stellar, it was good enough to make me keep the menu to order takeout again in the future. They've been in business for a long time and it was packed when I dropped in-- good sign. Crowds say a lot to me so I can't wait to order something different for us next time.
