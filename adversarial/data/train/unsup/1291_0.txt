Got a nice upgrade to my room because of a reservation mix-up!  Well worth the few extra minutes it took to check in.  \n\nBeautiful room, very comfortable bed and very clean.  Unfortunately the few sucked!  My room actually looked at a giant air-conditioner!  (5th Floor - corner room) No sky line, no strip not even a view of another hotel.  Not a big deal because I didn't spent much time in my room, but it would have been nice to wake up to a view or to see the city lights at night.\n\nOne other complaint..  and this goes for all hotels that do this.  Why do you charge Resort Fees?  The cost of the room should include the use of the the hotels amenities!  It's not like you can chose not to use the resort!   \n\nOne big positive, compared to many other strip hotels is free parking.
