Worth the hype is right... I think this was my highlight of eating in Montreal.  The sauce on the chicken is some kind of flavour explosion.  The portions are huge the atmosphere of get in-get your food- get out is really fun (seriously it's like you're on an episode of seinfeld but the staff are SOOO warm and friendly!!).  There is NO OTHER CHICKEN like this in THE WORLD! YUM! GO!
