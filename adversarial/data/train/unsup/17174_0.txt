Korean Restaurant + Hole in the wall location = GOOOOOOOD KOREAN FOOD!\n\nCame here for lunch one day and everything was on point! This is a very unsuspecting location. It looks like a small mall food court. The menu had a decent amount of items listed. They also serve bubble tea. I didn't expect to get ban chan with my meal. I figured all I got was an entree and some rice. NOPE! Only legit Korean serve ban chan and that made me so happy! They served a number of pickled veggies which are my absolute favorite! Of course there was kim chi and some spicy tofu. The portions were a good size I even went home with some leftovers.\n\nThis place is ran by an older couple. The husband runs the front while the wife does the cooking in the back. They make a wonderful team. The husband is really nice and chatted with us a bit.  I found out they serve an elderly community everyday. What a great thing to do! \n\nThe prices here were cheaper than what you would find in the main Chinatown area. About $9 an entree compared to $13 otherwise and you're getting good quality food so I can't complain. \n\nDefinitely check this place out if you're in the area or craving Korean food. They close at 4-5 pm so keep that in mind.
