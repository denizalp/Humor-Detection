I had just finished paying for my lunch with change, when Lou K. said to me \"If you're out of money, just let me know.\" I denied being broke. I went on to tell him about my day so far, and exclaimed, \"I got the best hair cut of my life at Great Clips!\" He replied, \"so, you are broke.\" \n\nYes, the lowly state of my bank account brought me into Great Clips on a Tuesday morning. But, I did get the best hair cut of my life. My stylist, Lori, has been cutting hair for 20+ years and she knows what she's doing. I brought in a picture of what I wanted, and before I knew it, my head was a blur of scissors and flying hair. She was polite, quick, non judgmental, and spot-on. We were done super fast. No wasted time with a shampoo. No upsell with products. In and out in 15 minutes with a great cut that was exactly what I asked for, executed well. \n\nBefore tip, my total was $13.
