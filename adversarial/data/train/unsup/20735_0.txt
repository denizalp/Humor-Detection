I have been wanting to try this place for a very long time. And I have to say....I love it! It's small and not very exciting inside, and not in a part of town I would find myself strolling around but to honest that really didn't matter bc the food was great. \n\nSo we started with trying all of the different salsas with the chips, I liked the hot the best, the green, which is supposed to be super hot, was not much difference and much less flavorful actually. \n\nSo I went with the recommendations from my fellow yelpers and got 3 tacos, carnitas, al pastor and chorizo. The chorizo and carnitas was by far the best. I guess the sweet element of the al pastor I wasn't a fan of, should of went with the fish! \n\nMy husband got a chorizo enchilada I think and that was probably the best thing I had there. I would probably order that next time. And yes there will be a next time. My husband wasn't as impressed with this place as I was, he thought it was good but not great.  We will have to go back and change his mind :-)
