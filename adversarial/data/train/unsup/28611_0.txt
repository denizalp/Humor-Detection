Ray is awesome! He came on a Sunday and not only fixed four different things he also did a free inspection of all the other items in the home including running the dishwasher and washer\/dryer to make sure the connections\/hook-ups were ok. He took pictures, explained everything to me and fixed it that day. The whole time he had a calm and professional manner. Thank you!
