Came here on Sunday evening with the fam to check out the shaved ice options.  Slightly hard to find if you are not familiar with the area - the actual cafe is upstairs and visible only from the street by green cafe bene signage. We were lucky to finding parking right outside but if not I believe there's parking in street behind Cafe. \n\nCafe is small but still spots available for the 5 of us that evening without any wait.  Staff were quite nice and though it looked like a place more for young kids I found it was pretty family friendly! The wait was abit longer than I would expect to order but I suspect that these places it's a given. If not, then that would be one reco for improvement. \n\nWe decided to share: rice cake shaved ice, mango shaved ice, strawberry shaved ice and finally the sweet potato hot latte. Tried to order spaghetti but found out that it would be 30-40 min wait as they were just making the sauce so just skipped it - after all we were here mainly for shaved ice.\n\nIt was unanimous that the shaved ice was a hit. Kids wolfed it down quickly so while the portions are pretty big like another yelper noted, I seriously think the our boys aged 5, 8, 11 could have order their own.  Next time.\n\nThe only disappointment was that the sweet potato latte was lacking in taste. Maybe bc I unfortunately compare to the SP latte in LA (Heyri Cafe brings back good memories!) this one tasted more artificial without as much taste. Wouldn't order it again next time that's all.\n\nNevertheless, loved that the staff were sweet to take extra care to make sure that walnuts were not added to the rice cake shaved ice - our son has a peanut\/Pinenut allergy and thy took extra precautions for us with nuts in general.\n\nFinal verdict - would definitely come again!
