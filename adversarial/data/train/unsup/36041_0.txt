Okay, it's not haute culinary dining on a barge in la Seine, but it is relaxed, comfortable, very afforable,  friendly, bright and clean. The breakfast menu is a pleasant departure from the cliche vegan pankakes, tofu scramble and waffles. It includes Loaded Baked Potato Soup and Chimichuri Avocado Toast. I had the Mashed Potato Cakes for $5. Wow, $5! You can't get even get your shoes shined for $5. Nicely done! My wife had the Pumpkin French Toast Bake, which she \"enjoyed.\" The portion sizes were perfect. Still, because we were about to embark on a very long ride home (with no prospects for a vegan lunch), I also ordered the Biscuits with Gravy and seitan. This was nicely flavored. The homemade hot sauce, though not hot was nicely flavored. However, I did not see or taste the seitan. I was told that it was ground into the sauce. Then, change the description of this dish to something like \"with a seitan infused sauce.\" Otherwise, this place is pretty straightforward. Their bakery items are made on premises, the foods served seem fresh. Very good for a cheap vegan place.
