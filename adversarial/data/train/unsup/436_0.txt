Pon ocha soup, now who would name this restaurant in the little mexico part of town? Lol!!! \n\nDont let the name fool you however, been to this restaurant three times during lunch and its absolutely great selection for buffet lunch. Have to take the price down a dollar though because their competition in buffet asia have the same price and bigger selection.\n\nBut having said that, for thai food in this part of town, its the only place to go. Great service too!\n\nTip: They have a bomb diggity pad prik khing for those that can handle major chili hotness.
