Who doesn't like Mexican food? Really? That person should move in a desert full of rattle snakes and count the days of his\/her remaining life. How about a vegan Mexican food in the middle of the desert just North of Vegas? Then I'll voluntarily move myself in a heartbeat. \n\nGo see Jose and ask for a chicken style burrito. It was big with beans, lettuce, vegan Daya cheese, delicious slices of chicken tofu, a side of tortilla chips, green and red salsa.  The taste was very authentic. The place unassuming. And most importantly, the service was superb. Until next time, Jose. We enjoyed our meal, thank you.
