I LOVE THE JUNKYARD.\n\nThere, I said it. It feels good. \n\nSeriously, though. I loved this place. I loved getting my hand stamped like I was going to a concert or fair. I loved walking through the gravel and rows of cars and feeling that terrifying sinking feeling in my stomach because I knew I'd get lost. I didn't love thinking about how those poor cars died or how their owners felt when it happened, but I tried to keep that out of my head as much as possible. I loved looking up the cars in the computer and getting the slip of paper with all of the information on it, then using it as a map all over the yard. It was entirely not what I expected and such an adventure! \n\nWe came for a wide variety of pieces and parts for 2 different cars. The man's VW and my Honda both need some work; the difference between the two is that the VW is a for-fun-beater that he's trying to fix up and play around with, my Honda is my every day car that I'm forcing not to become a beater. I've given the little guy a name and love him like a family member, so the junkyard may be my most frequented spot soon. We searched and searched for some mirrors that would fit and thought we found some, but they didn't end up working out. But, in the long run, it was definitely worth the $20 chance instead of looking elsewhere and paying way too much!
