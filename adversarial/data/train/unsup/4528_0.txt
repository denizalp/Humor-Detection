It was late at night, we had just gotten off work, and we were on our way home when we heard a cluck, cluck coming from the engine. My boyfriend pulled over and looked under the hood, and then under the car, and somewhat diagnosed the noise as something seriously wrong with the engine. You see, he does have knowledge with car engines as that is what he studied in college. Anyway, he stated instead of getting it fixed right away, he'll just get a new used car. He had actually been thinking of getting another car for a while now.\n\nOn Tuesday night, we decided to start going to dealerships, and Henderson Nissan was the first car place we stopped at. We were greeted immediately right when we got out of the car. There were three sales people standing outside and we were approached by a very nice woman with an Australian accent. We knew what kind of car we wanted which is a used 350Z, but unfortunately they didn't have any. We were told that it is a very popular used car since it is no longer in production. The sales woman was very friendly and she asked all the right questions. One thing I really liked was that she did not try to persuade us toward a different model. She took down out information and said she'll call us if they get in any used 350Z.
