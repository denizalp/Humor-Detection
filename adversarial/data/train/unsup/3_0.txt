This pool was one of the best highlights of my trip. In the morning I would come early to lay out. I would bring my fresh squeezed juice from Blitz. Total Zen. 6.5 acres of lush green paradise with the sun blazing down on you! Every Chicagoan's dream. 4 pools, a relaxing lazy river, a cascading water fall, and 3 hot tubs which I have no idea where they were hiding, bc I never saw one. \n\nWeds & Thursday it's not crowded and you have no problem finding a spot. Come Friday there's masses of people everywhere! It's hard to find a spot and some people lay out their towels on the grass. But what do you expect it's the largest hotel in Vegas. 1 drink is $20. A lazy river raft is $16 to rent or $12 to own. Cabanas are $1000 food and drink tab. You don't have to bring your own beach towel bc they supply them near the entrance. I'd advise not use the restroom near the lockers they're very dirty. Use the restrooms by where they hand out towels. Overall, I love this pool. Its my happy place!
