Well, I've purchased 2 cars from here and wasn't thrilled about the process.  First time was ok, second time a really pushy associate almost made me go elsewhere. The high volume of phone calls AFTER the car purchase was a little annoying too. I just bought a car from you guys, why would I want to buy another 6 months later?\n\nHowever, I just had a very positive experience with the service department. I had been told at another auto repair shop that I needed 4 new motor mounts. Quoted $1100 (and that was with a \"discount\"). I thought I should probably get a second opinion but have always been wary of dealing with the dealership for service issues. \n\nI was very surprised at how they handled my issue. I dealt with Steve (I think that was his name!), who was very personable and without even seeing my car, expressed surprise at the diagnosis of needing to replace all 4 mounts.  He asked that I bring it in so they could take a look at it and give me their estimate. Turns out I only needed 1 motor mount! It would have been very easy for them to try and tack on some unnecessary repairs but if anything, I felt like I got an outstanding deal, especially since my extended warranty had just expired a few months earlier.
