I must admit, this location was difficult to find. I had to call to find where they were located at (next to Wolfgang Puck's restaurant). The waitress was really nice. The happy hour menus were really confusing because they have two different menus. So the first half hour was sorting through the happy hour mess. BTW, they don't serve ramen at the dining area, only at the bar.\n\nWe ordered everything on the happy hour menu. We had sliders with thin-cut fries, salmon tartar, sushi rolls, upside down cake, viet coffee ice cream, etc. I don't remember everything we ordered, so obviously nothing really stood out. Everything was okay so I wouldn't rave about this place. It was just \"ehh.\" The tea we ordered came in this heavy, cast iron teapot.... seriously?!
