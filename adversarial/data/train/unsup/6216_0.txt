Complete and utter rip off.  Where do I even begin?  Put aside the date changes and multiple time changes this was a complete upsale nightmare.  The \"towel\" they advertise is the size of a wash cloth, the inner tube that they are charging $10 for you can get at the dollar tree, the cool after party that you think is included is also an extra cost. Drunk people everywhere does not mix well with small children and throw in a slide is a recipe for disaster.  The child slide they advertised was no where to be found. Horrible experience. Horrible time. Steer clear unless you like being ripped off and exposed to obnoxious drunks.  Blacklight.  Never again!!!
