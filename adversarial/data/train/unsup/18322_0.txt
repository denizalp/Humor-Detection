I have been to see the Chippendale's a few times over the years and I am not afraid to let anyone know lol, \nWho don't like seeing good looking men with their shirts off?\n\nThe one thing I really like about seeing this show is it is more classy. \nThe down side of this is the last time I seen the show I thought it was a little bit too much like a Vegas show now than it was years ago.\n\nThere is singing and more like a show you would expect to see but over the years the show was much different.\nStill nice to see the guys dance and after the show you can get pictures taken with your favorite ones.\n\nOver all it is a fun time if you can get a bunch of friends together, The guys are personable which is nice too. \n\nIts great for bachelorette parties... oh and the other thing I noticed is they are letting men in now, \n\nWould I go back? Of course as long as I was with a few friends or take someone who has never been to see how they react its a fun night out!
