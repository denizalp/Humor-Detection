what lured me to come to gb is my free entree deal I received through the email for my upcoming b-day....sweet. I had until the end of the month to use the coupon.\n\ngiving GB four stars with one caveat: don't come at a time the resto is totally full because most likely you won't get good service, at least that is my experience here. we went on at lunch time today and received pleasant service and we both enjoyed our entrees... We both ordered the BBQ salmon, with jasmine rice, and red onions, spinach. they also accommodated my special request. i couldn't resist and i had one hefe which was nice and mr h had the czech pilsner.
