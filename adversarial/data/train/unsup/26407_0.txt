I had high expectations for this musical, given all the reviews from friends and Yelp...and believe me all the 5 stars on here are legit.  The costumes, set, and actors, were all amazing that I didn't have any gripes about paying $4 for a bag of m&ms.  If I am able to see this show again, I will plan to get closer seats.
