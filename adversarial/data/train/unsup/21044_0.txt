Great food super slow service. \nWrought with good intention to be a good server but the lady (both times I've been I've had the same one) is just overwhelmed. Never enough cream for the coffee (very strong BTW). \nThis last time my omelette was barely cooked but was still good. \nAll in all 2.5-3.0 stars is about the best I can rate.
