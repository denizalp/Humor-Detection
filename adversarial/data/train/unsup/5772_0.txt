I grew up in Phoenix, born and raised on the South-side under the shadow of South Mountain. My family comes from Cuidad Juarez, Estado de Chihuahua and I'm very proud to be Mexican-American. Barrio Caf√© instantly appealed to me with its creative use of names in the menu and its new school approach to classic dishes.\n\nHowever, this place's reputation is greater than what it can deliver. I had the carne asada tacos and they were average at best. My tortillas were dried out and cracked as I folded my taco. Too much time on the comal I suppose. Carne Asada should be flavorful, it should condense the taste of the beef into tender grilled pieces. This place's meat faded into the background of the cilantro and tomato that buried everything on my plate. The carne asada from my neighborhood carniceria out does this place for far cheaper. \n\nThe drinks were good at least and that is something. The Jamaica was tangy and brewed rich. That is something...\n\nI also didn't appreciate the wait staff calling me a gabacho behind the bar, either. Nice. I'm light skinned not deaf, lads.
