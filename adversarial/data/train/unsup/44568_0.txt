A little pricey but the food is very good! Service is excellent. The food is very, very healthy. I would recommend this place to anybody who likes Greek or Middle Eastern food and enjoys a wonderful atmosphere. I get the stuffed grape leaves (Dawali), hummus and hot sauce. It's tasty! You get fresh, excellent pita bread with it.
