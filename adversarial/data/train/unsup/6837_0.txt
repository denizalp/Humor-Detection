I googled for some bakeries and Mabel's was mentioned a few times so I decided to give it a try, then another...and another...... -drools-....... SO ANYWAY, I tried 3 things from here:\n\n1. O r a n g e  B l o n d i e \n(Tangy orange cream cheese layered on top of a very dense and chewy brownie, best texture ever, and dipped in a sticky orange glaze)\n\n2. C o n g o  B a r \n(Coconutty goodness right here. Again, the texture was good, but not as good as the Blondie, it had coconut shavings on atop and inside. Would go great with a cup of coffee)\n\n3. T r i p l e  C h o c o l a t e  F u d g e  B a r\n(This thing is BIG. BAD. & BITCHIN' with chocolate.... the top layer is a smoothe and creamy layer of fudge-like icing and on the bottom is 2 thick layers of brownie goodness. Pretty darn rich, so you should definately grab a drink with this and it can get messy)\n\nThey also have a really good selection of savoury foods. (Quiche, GIANT meatballs (B-cup size), salads etc.) All of which look delicious and at a reasonable price too! This place is gold. God, I saw a carrot cake bar, which I (will,must,going to) try next time. It's a far trip for me, but well worth it and not like the other bakeries this place closes late at around 7pm or 8pm! Sigh \n\nVerdict: -Jumps up with pearly white smile and 2 thumbs up- Ya yo.
