Although my son had fun, I found the front counter staff to be RUDE!! I had made a reservation that they couldn't find and then took my coupon without taking my name because she couldn't be bothered to answer my questions. We then stood there for 15 minutes waiting for our name to be called to go back and we weren't even on the list! The staff of teenagers that work there were great but the older lady in the front needed a hug or coffee. She wasn't happy and took it out on the parents!!
