The atmosphere and waitstaff were great!\n\nHowever, two or three fruit flies made the meal hard to enjoy. I literally had to keep waving my arms the entire time to keep them from getting into my food... \n\nI know things like this happen frequently (especially around food), but it really made it hard for me to enjoy the awesome food they have.\n\nThe fiesta frozen drink is amazing!  It's a huge glass layered with different Margarita mixes and pi√±a colada. The fish tacos, black beans, and chips with salsa were pretty good as well. \n\nI would definitely come back to give Patron another try, but hopefully the fruit fly situation is handled soon.
