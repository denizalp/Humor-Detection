I called just yesterday afternoon needing my 65 inch curved TV wall mounted, they were able to get someone out the next day which was extremely helpful and convenient! The price was really reasonable (I bought a mount from them as well, which was also well priced). Rudy installed it for me, he communicated well about what time he would be here and was here on time. He did a fantastic job! He was organized, thorough, and made sure it was exactly what I wanted. I will definitely come back here for TV needs!
