I have stayed at alpha mill for three years and love this place. The amenities and atmosphere is great and the management staff are always helpful and looking for ways to keep the property exciting. Young atmosphere and everyone seems to be very considerate of their neighbors. Great view of Uptown Charlotte's skyline!
