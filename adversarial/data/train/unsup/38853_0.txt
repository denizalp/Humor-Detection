Came in for a pedicure (no appointment) and was instantly seated as they have many seats and many technicians. I opted for the spa pedi ($30) which i was happy with but I didn't feel like they did anything additional as compared to a regular $22 pedi? I'll have to go back and compare. The only thing I didn't like was that the place reeks of acetone! I felt like I was stuck inside a bottle.
