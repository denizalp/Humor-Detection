This had to be one of the worst businesses I have ever dealt with! First, the parking lot was like a construction zone! Mod, potholes, broken asphalt, rocks, you name it. It was also full of water. Mud holes everywhere! Totally unsafe!\nWent in because of an ad in the paper. Planned on spending  at least $200.Wife asked where the top soil on sale was? The owner (I think), a total a$$hole, said \"you drove right past it coming in! Didn't you see it?\" She said we'd take 5 bags and the guy said pay for it and we'll put it in your truck when you are leaving. You don't want to be lifting 50# bags do you? \nShe then asked where a certain plant that was advertised was. He said We don't have any, they didn't come on yet! She then said I'll take 5 bags of soil, and paid for it. She asked if someone could throw it in the truck (since he had already offered). He said you have someone with you to do that.  Then asked if we  are  buying any plants? No, cause you don't have what we want. Then Here's your money back, I won't sell you the soil! \nRude, lying false advertising. Bitter man!\nNever going there again, nor should you! Went to Lowes and got basically the stuff and didn't spend any more than if we had bought it there. \nTry to buy local and get treated like crap! No thanks!\n\nIf I could do 0 stars I would!
