Husband and I were sick of the same ole same ole in the neighborhood, so we stopped here because it's new.\nFirst impression wasn't great. It's a cramped little spot, tables seem like they don't fit right. The teenager that sat us seemed put off by the fact that I didn't want to sit at a tiny table for 2 people (for the record I am a 6' tall female), so we opted for sitting outside. The outdoor patio is nice and it was a lovely evening, so I cooled my jets and felt much less  bitchy. We ordered drinks and were served delicious house made bread with oil and balsamic. Husband ordered a pizza and I ordered the lobster ravioli. \nThe pizza needed a few more minutes in the oven, but the sauce and toppings were good. The ravioli had a vodka sauce and were so delicious!\nIt took a while to get the food, but we were not in a hurry so it was fine. \nWe both ordered dessert. Tiramisu and strawberry gelato and both were amazing, but the gelato was the star.
