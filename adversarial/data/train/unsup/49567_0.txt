A bit expensive. I'm used to the $19.99 oil changes in NJ but maybe $45 is normal for an oil change in the GTA? \n\nYou pull up and stay right in your car the entire time that they work. They also provide complementary coffee, hot chocolate, etc.. \n\nService was great and everyone that worked there was very professional. They do a complete multipoint check of your car as well. \n\nOne thing you may want to watch though, I think they set everyone's tire pressure to 35 psi. So if you want a higher pressure then you have to tell them. I'm pretty sure they let some air out of my tires when they shouldn't have...
