I've been going to Ana's Nail Boutique & Spa on Bloor ever since they opened there. My vice is the Spa Pedicure. The ladies there are super nice, professional and do a great job. The place is clean and all the tools are disinfected so you don't have to worry about getting any type of infection. I've gone during the week and on weekends (even a Sunday during the summer) and at time can be pretty busy so definitely call ahead. I always walk away happy with pretty toes, great service and honestly, a price that's fair and reasonable. The massage chairs are an added bonus to help you relax. Enjoy!
