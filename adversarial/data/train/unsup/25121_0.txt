The staff here is not trained to handle adult patients as they say they are. Everyone I have visited, they fail to keep me updated on my treatment progress although I ask multiple times. The workers I do encounter do not know the answers to my questions and the doctors are never around to answer these questions. They dentists greatly downplayed my treatment time saying that it was expected to only under a year. I've asked constantly throughout my treatment about my progress, in which they never gave me feedback or noted that my treatment plan has changed to over a year. Every time I call in, the front desk assistants never have the information I need and the dentists are never in the office. Also, the workers so not care to talk to you as they are only concerned with chatting among themselves. Overall, it has been a terrible experience.
