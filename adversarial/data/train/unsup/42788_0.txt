Pretty darn good. The service was good and the farmhouse decor was a nice change from all the glitz of Vegas. I got the chicken salad and it was superb. My husband got the chicken bacon sandwich and it was pretty plain. It needed something to spice it up. Thus the four stars. Overall, it was a fresh, nice lunch.
