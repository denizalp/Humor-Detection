Drink menu is great, food great, but our service started poorly with being ignored at the hostess stand. Our appetizers came out before my cocktail which barely arrived before our meal. I ordered the ham & yam which was tasty but missing a key ingredient. I asked for it and since my husband nearly finished his meal before our waiter returned to tell me he couldn't find it...I just ate it. Our waiter never offered to make things right. I'd like to give this place another try but a little skeptical.
