UberEATS ordered Pad Thai and Mango Sticky rice.   The Pad Thai was delish.   Not too sweet or dry.   It had fresh ground peanuts that added to its wonderful flavor and authenticity.   Minus one star for the insulting small size of the mango sticky rice.  Wish I took a picture... the small size piece of rice was saranwrap (1\" x 3\") for $6.  \nOther than my dissatisfaction of the dessert... this place was good for an an UberEATS option.
