Pain stop came to our office to give free messages. After talking with them I decided to visit the office. Dr. Mitch listened to my concerns. I'm a bowler and had some wrist pain. He took X-rays and had me come back in a few days. \n\nCome to find out I had a little arthritis in my joint. I decided to purchase 8 visits. After the first two adjustments, no more wrist pain. \n\nThe staff is friendly and care about your needs. I highly recommended them.
