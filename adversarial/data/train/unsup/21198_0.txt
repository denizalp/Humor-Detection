The front desk lady has no personality and is rude. The dark hair one with the northern accent. She goes here fill out paper work, being my first time there, I expected a little more friendliness. I read the reviews before going in and yes you do feel like a number. I have been doing injections for 6 years now and I have never been asked to put on my own numbing cream, this strikes me as un ethical especially if a nurse is injecting certain areas. I have always had a nurse or doctor do that after telling them which areas need what. Further more, the nurse did not even look and tell me what area needs what. I felt so uncomfortable especially after putting on the numbing cream they tell you to go sit on the waiting area, how embarrassing! I will never go back here, I walked out.
