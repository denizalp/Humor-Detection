Signs is an interesting restaurant where guests can learn about American Sign Language. \n\nI walked in and was greeted by friendly staff, one already speaking to me in sign language. I let her know that I made a reservation under Kristy and after searching for like 3 minutes, she could not find my name and seated me on the opposite side. Next thing I knew, my friend was already inside at our table.\n\nThe menu is super cute as all of the food items had illustrations of ASL actions that you will need to do when you order. We learned how to say water and everything we ordered to our waitress who was really friendly and took her time to show us how to do the actions. Unfortunately pictures of the menu is not allowed. The portions were rather large at SIGNS. I loved one of their seafood items on the menu, though I felt like a lot of the food can be much more warm than what we had.\n\nComparing it to O'Noir, for the blind, i felt like Signs was less of an experience because we were allowed to talk, which sort of limited the feeling. Maybe they should implement a no talking rule to REALLY get guests into the experience.
