I came here on a Friday night at 8ish, hoping that there would be less people there. Just like any other keg, it was packed, and we waited almost 45 mins to be seated. The area was very dim and it sets the mood for a romantic night out. \n\n I opted for my favorite filet mignon and ordered a Forbidden Fruit martini. The drink was really good; I especially liked the strawberry rock crystals along the rim on the drink. I would recommend this drink for girls, even those who do not regularly drink alcohol because the taste of vodka is barely there. \n\nOnto the filet mignon. I asked for medium rare, but when it came, it was more on the rare side. What's special about the steak was that it was wrapped by a piece of bacon. However, I prefer the steak on its own. The taste of the bacon took over, so halfway through the meal, I separated the two. The steak on its own was very juicy and soft. \n\nJust a tip - the roasted garlic mashed potato side is MASSIVE. Compared to the twice baked potato, the portion is almost double the size! So.. finish your steak before your side.\n\nThe service, like any other Keg, was great. The waiter was friendly and attentive. \n\nAll in all, it was a good experience, but nothing out of my expectations. I wish the wait could be a little shorter and will probably make reservations the next time I come.
