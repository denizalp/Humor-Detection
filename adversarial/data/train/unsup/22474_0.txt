I've been to Goodwill stores before to drop things off or look for halloween costumes to throw together, but this is the cleanest most organized Goodwill store I have ever been in!! \nI'm from Chicago and the stores around me are so junky looking. I mean I know it's a thrift store, but come on, you could organize things to make it look nicer and make things easier for people to shop. Everything in this store is color coordinated and organized according to size..how it should be. They seperate the shoes from the clothes rather than just throwing them on top of the rack. In the back it looks like a mini shoe store..very nice. They also arrainged the furniture nicely and the little knick knacks they may get in. I actually enjoyed my visit to this Goodwill..haha! :)\nGREAT JOB!!
