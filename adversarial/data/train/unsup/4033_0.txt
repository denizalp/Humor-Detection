**** This review is for the casino only ****\n\nI drive past Lucky Dragon now and then and decided today I'd see what it was like.  As everyone notes, it is a small casino.  When I was there around 2 PM, there were about 8 people in the place.  Everything is new and clean and I didn't notice anyone smoking which was a bonus.  Dragon's Alley was closed so there was no option to get a late lunch here.\n\nThe parking garage is OK but beware of many drivers who don't know how to drive.  One person had to wave me ahead because she couldn't drive by me in her little Scion.  She was just one of a couple of drivers of whom you must be aware.\n\nI didn't have any interaction with staff so I cannot rate customer service.\n\nOK casino but it won't be a first or second choice.  I think I'm one and done!
