I should start by saying I normally love this place.  That's about the only positive thing I have to say today, though.\n\nCaesar salad for lunch in Uptown Mt. Lebo - that's all I wanted.  Seems easy enough, right?\n\nOnly one place to get it that was local and easy (not cheap).  I'm pretty excited, because it's like 1:30 pm and the lunch rush should be over.  So, I get the ball rolling.  I call Il Pizzaiolo; no answer.  Call again; no answer.  Third time, someone picks up.  I order my caesar salad with chicken.  I'm told 30 minutes (30 minutes to chop some lettuce and grate some cheese?  Pretty sure the chicken was already ready to go.  Neat.).\n\nFast forward 30 minutes: walk down the street (10 minute walk) and pick up my [$17] salad [that probably cost $3 to make].  Walk 10 minutes back to the office.  Get everything ready to eat... but that's when it hits me.  NO DRESSING.  A caesar salad without dressing is just chopped up lettuce and chicken.  Or, a chicken salad, if you will.  I didn't order a sad chicken salad, did I?\n\nNope.  So I figure ok, fine.  Things happen.  I'll call them and see if they can just have the dressing ready for me to grab.  So I call - no one answers.  Call again - \"Il Pizzaiolo, can you hold please?\"  Sure.  Sure I can.\n\n2 minutes.  5 minutes. 7 minutes.  I've already started walking back at this point.  10 minutes.  11 minutes.  I walk in, still on hold and there are 2 people at the register.  They look at me.  \n\nI let them know I picked up my caesar salad (20 minutes ago, at this point) and there was no dressing in it.  Then I showed them my phone and asked if anyone needed to pick up the caller on hold.  I could see the red light blinking (for anyone who isn't following along: I was still on hold).\n\n\"Who put you on hold?!?!\"\n\nLady, I don't work here.  \n\nOther guy goes to kitchen.  Gets dressing.  Comes back.  \"Sorry, I dunno what happened there.\"  Well, friend, if you have the time - I wrote it all out for you to review, on Yelp.  Have at it.\n\nDid I mention I'm 7 months pregnant, and it's my birthday?  (I couldn't make this up if I tried.)\n\nXo.
