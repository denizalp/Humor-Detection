Was here for a party following an Ingress event (look it up - you'll be glad you did). Excellent food, both the standard bar appetizers and the more extensive menu. Tried the chips and salsa\/guacamole, both of which were tasty. The closest things I saw to buffalo wings were boneless and served with an excellent sweet honey sauce. The flatbread pizza was also good. I ordered a quesadilla burger, which is exactly what it sounds like and was delicious, with roasted jalape√±os and guacamole with cilantro, and was even cooked to my specified medium rare. Full bar and excellent, friendly service from everyone there. Also, their air conditioning works wonderfully, very important on a hot Arizona day. I hear they have great entertainment from some of the locals, but I can attest to it being good food (not just good bar food) and a great atmosphere.
