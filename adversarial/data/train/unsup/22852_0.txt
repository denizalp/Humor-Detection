One of the most affordable shopping joints in town. You can find some really good, branded clothes or accessories at an amazing marked down price.\n\nThe clothes, especially in gents section appear to be in run down state but don't let that deter you from digging through piles and piles of hidden goodies.\n\nThey also have a very decent collection of home decor which saved a lot of money for me while keeping my she wolf happy.
