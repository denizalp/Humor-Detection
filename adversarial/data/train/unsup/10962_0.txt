I was first introduced to bubble tea in Toronto in 1998 so when I returned here last month I knew I had to have some. My pal Yves obliged me and drove me to Go For Tea. \n\nI was initially overwhelmed by the grand space and the endless menu options. Barley embryo, fresh watermelon juice, yogurt with aloe. . .\n\nAfter perusing way too long we got the brownie cheesecake to share and I had the peppermint green tea with tapioca - two choices I was quite pleased with.\n\nSort of makes me wish I had a Go For Tea in New York.
