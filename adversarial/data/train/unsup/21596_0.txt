I LOVED my experience here! Scheduling and working with the staff at Tir Du Soleil was a treat. \n\nI plan the Social activities for my office and a group of us came down for the VIP 2 hour+ shooting extravaganza with the big room rented out for us with the option to shoot with different weapons such as sniper rifles, russian assault rifle and a variety of handcannons. No issue to be found, everything went well All guns and targeting equipment worked without any issues.\n\nVIP event even has a VIP room and round room where you can chill out, chat... drink... eat. The true thug life. \n\nStaff is chill and friendly but they take the event seriously and you to absolutely follow their rules. Our host Val was a superstar and made the event very enjoyable for us.\n\nWould highly recommend.
