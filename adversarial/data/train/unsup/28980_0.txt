We came in last night with a group of 8 and were seated right away. Got our drinks out quickly and appetizers were delish! We had Brussel Sprouts, Mac and Cheese Bites and Falafels, all super tasty.  Hubby had the bison burger, I had the naked American burger, 15 year old kid had the fried chicken sliders and adult kid had the Napa chicken sandwich. Others in the group had bone marrow burger, tacos and salad. We all enjoyed our dinners and the service was awesome. Would definitely come back next time in Vegas! Thank you Eureka for a memorable and delicious dinner!
