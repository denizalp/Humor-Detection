Located right in the heart of downtown where the last of the nighttime crowd was returning to their homes\/hotels free street parking was an easy score and with myself the only person in the restaurant who'd actually been asleep the night prior it was mere moments before we were seated, coffee poured, and orders taken - a plethora of carbs from which my friends would merely pick at prior to retiring for the night thus leaving me with enviable task of playing cleanup to some truly textbook diner food, decadent desserts, and even a pair of fresh baked goods as I hung around abusing the free Wi-Fi and copious coffee refills until 7:00am.  Without a doubt the sort of place where quality and quantity both matter it really came as no surprise that both the restaurant's French Toast and signature pancakes, even as 'short stacks,' were immense but outstanding - the pancakes particularly light and quite literally 'melt-in-the-mouth,' but perhaps more impressive were the pastries and bread pudding - the donut a lightly raised and amply yeasted version without a bit of grease, the \"bear claw\" reminiscent of the Hungarian Nut Horns at Christmas during my youth but warmer and 10x the size, and the bread pudding a dense, steaming hot wedge covered in caramel and ice cream that rivals the best I've found in Sin City - especially at 5am.
