Super cute and cozy diner that's the perfect spot for a Madison brunch! \n\nYou start by ordering at the counter, and then you wait for the head of house to tell you a table has opened up. During prime brunch hours, you wait about 10-20 minutes for a table and 30-45 minutes for your food to be served. It is quite a while, but they're up front with their times so you're not left guessing. Unlimited coffee refills of 3-4 options of coffee plus 5+ options of milk and cream left me a happy camper and not too, TOO hangry. \n\nI went with a simple continental breakfast of yogurt, fruit and my choice of a baked good, and my goodness did the scone knock my socks off. Literally orange, raisin, oat perfection. I would come back just for all of their impressive baked goods alone! Manna is worth a visit for sure!
