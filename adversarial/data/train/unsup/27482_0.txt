I live in Ottawa but used to live in Toronto for 1.5 years. When I lived here, I would chuckle when I'd see people eat near Dundas Square (tourist trap).\nI come to Toronto a few times a year but this time, the group of guys I was travelling with told me that they usually go eat sushi in Dundas square. Again, I kind of laughed but went a long with it. Before I give my review of the food, I need to stress that I'm not a food snob. If it's good, I'll eat there.\nWell, we get to spring sushi and take 4 escalators to get there. We climb another set of stairs and behold, this oasis in the middle of a commercial desert.\nWHAT A VIEW of downtown. I mean, WOW! \nThe restaurant was clean and we were seated almost immediately. The moment you get to your table, you have an iPad and you order, and order, and order.\nMost all you can eat sushi places are decent but you'll eventually get the look of regret 4 hours later ;)\nThe sushi here was fresh, delicious, and above all, perfect for what we wanted. We weren't too crazy with our order but we certainly got to try a lot and each piece that came out was consistently delicious.\nI now refuse to laugh when I hear people say they're eating in Dundas square. Spring Sushi, take a bow - you're awesome
