Jessie B. saved the day. After reading about my pretty kitty experience she messaged me with this wonderful waxer. With how much she raved about it and reading her review I had to book an appointment. I go to the website to find a phone number to call and I see you make your appointments online. HOW EASY! more places need to get on that service. (and just think...no annoying phone calls during whatever you are having done.)\nI was a little iffy about going into her shop as I have been in that little plaza before and everything was so open. I wondered how Andrea could hide such a little waxing service. Her whole little shop is curtained up and when you walk in it is like a mini spa. Andrea was very friendly. She makes you feel comfortable right off the bat. (after all let's be serious here...who is comfortable stripping down their bottom half's after meeting someone for not even five minutes? not I!) She was very nice and quick, but not quick enough to leave a sloppy job. I'm pretty pleased with it and believe I will be seeing her again. Not to mention how it was only $45.\nGreat service, great job, great experience. She really knows what she is doing waxing. (and no double dipping either!)
