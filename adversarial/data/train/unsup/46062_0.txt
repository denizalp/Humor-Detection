To be honest, Persis have really bad reputation and quality in Charlotte. I was hesitating to try this location. However, the food was amazing. So far the best restaurant in Charlotte and nearby area. Owners were really friendly and felt like they wanted to serve us. We tried Methi Chicken, Chicken Kadai, Biryani, Bhel, Samosa Chat, chili Naan, Garlic Naan. There wasnt a single item where I could complaint. Food came on time. I would recommend everyone to try.
