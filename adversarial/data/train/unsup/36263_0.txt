I love Midas! I started going here because their fluid flushes were the best price for my car warranty maintenance out of everywhere I called. They list their prices right on a board when you walk in and don't try to hide them like some places. I just came here today because my car was leaking fluids, and they asked if I just had an oil change. I said yes and they found the problem right away. They took me back and showed me what was wrong so I understood. Jiffy Lube had punctured my transmission filter during the oil change because it looks similar to an oil filter. Phil from Midas worked with Jiffy Lube to resolve the problem without any charge to me! They are always friendly and I really appreciate their knowledge and great work.
