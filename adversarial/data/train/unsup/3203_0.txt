This clinic is awful and the staff doesn't give a damn about you. I don't like my primary Dr. at all she doesn't seem to know what she's talking about and stares at me blankly. Also the wait time is craziness. Over 2 hours? Why do you schedule me at 2pm, if you can't see me until 4pm? Seriously.  Changing clinic\/Dr. ASAP!!
