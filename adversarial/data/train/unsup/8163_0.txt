This review is for lunch service. \n\nI went with 3 companions for a work-related lunch on a friday, a little on the late side. We had no problem getting a table. \n\nService was prompt, and struck a good balance between friendly and unobtrusive. Atmosphere was okay. I didn't love the THREE televisions I could see from my table, which kind of killed the fine dining feeling. Still, I think the biggest attraction of this place is probably the setting. The ground floor of the WID is really really cool to walk around, like a swanky science mall.\n\nThe menu wasn't particularly innovative or interesting... mostly sandwiches and burgers with a few more serious entrees thrown in. \n\nI ordered a burger with blue cheese, bacon, and caramelized onions, and appreciated that I could choose salad instead of fries on the side. Sadly, it came out looking somewhat unappetizing. The patty was too small for the bun, and the toppings seemed to have been somehow amalgamated into indistinct sauciness. That said, it was pretty tasty, and I would probably order it again. My only objections in terms of taste were that the caramelized onions were overdone and overly acidic for my taste, and that my \"medium\" burger was MUCH closer to rare. Other people's sandwiches looked pretty unremarkable. Someone in my party ordered soup, asked for bread on the side, and was told that they didn't have bread, only toast points. Hmm. Everyone else at the table had a sandwich served on a bread product of one kind or another, and you can't bring my friend some bread?
