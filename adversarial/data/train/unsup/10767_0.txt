Came here for dim sum.  Food was okay.  It was early but also it was a holiday so had to pay regular price which could increase your bill double from what you expected.  They take credit cards so when it came time to pay the bill I used a prepaid Mastercard gift card.  Waitress is like what is this, I said prepaid Mastercard.  She's like oh we don't take those.  I'm like yes...you do take them.  She's like no we don't take those.  I'm like if you take Mastercard then you take their prepaid cards, let me show you.  Took the machine and operated it myself.  Payment went through fine.  If people don't know its okay to say you don't know, don't just make up some BS.
