Okay Chin's. Our relationship is seriously flawed. Bipolar even. I love you again! \n\nSeriously. I ain't lyin'! Even my food snobby cousins and pretend boyfriend were impressed. We grabbed take-out last Friday night. Everything was delicious and just how it used to be. Maybe they've been reading my reviews? \n\nAnyway, I'll be hitting up Chin's on the regular again. Those chicken wings are SO got.damned.good! \n\nI'm getting take-out again tonight. F cooking.
