Gross... I stayed here because it looked decent, good price, and my boss told me it wasn't that bad. Maybe I am used to staying at like Mandalay where when you walk in, the check in desk is like 2 feet from the poker tables but thats okay. So we waited FOREVER to get helped just to check in, then we get to our floor we were staying on and as we walked down the hall there was a awful smell. As the weekend went on the smell slowly lingered through the whole hallway, i was convinced there was a dead body in the room next to us or something it was that bad. They knew it too because they put a big fan in the hallway like that would resolve the issue? Our keys kept deactivating as for our friends staying too so we constantly had to go back downstairs for the to reactivate it so we could get into our rooms (waiting forever to get helped each time) and our bathroom was gross, our view was of the backstreet and the \"break\" area of the workers so we could watch them smoke, lucky us! When we were getting onto the elevator a cockroach went running across the floor! Some workers were walking by and I said, umm, theres a cockroach!! and they laughed and said, Im not getting it! and kept walking. They were VERY concerned. The pool was nice, small, but nice! So basically, I would never stay there again!!
