2.5 stars. \nAfter reading the reviews I was excited to come and check this place out. After tasting the espresso, cafe mocha and cold pressed Kyoto coffee I was not very impressed. Espresso was very burnt and very acidic. The ice Kyoto coffee was good. Not sure if I would come back or not. Interesting Decor inside and the service is a little slow but they are friendly. Typical coffee bar scene. Lots of people sitting pretending to be busy but really just wasting time on computers or phones. No one is talking or with one another. Kinda sad.
