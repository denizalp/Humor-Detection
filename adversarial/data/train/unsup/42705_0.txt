I would have given this place more stars because their food and beer selection is one of the best in the city. We usually have a few drinks here before the game but the head bartender is a complete doosh. My friend wanted to pay with a $100 Bill which was not from the recent edition and he refused it right out and told us to take it to the bank and have it changed, not only is that bill easy to check and see if it could be fake, but it has brail and a hologram on it. Most bars in the city which see a lot of cash should also keep a green money pen to check and verify bills. But what really pissed me off about this arrogant Toronto bartender was when I asked him if he accepts U.S bills and if he would take dirty ones from Zimbabwe, he replied yes dollar for dollar, so a old $100US would make no difference to this guy and his own legal tender would. What a joke! Clean up your policies on taking cash, we do not live in the dark ages especially when the new bill was only issued about 2 years ago.
