The State 48 Wit was really tasty & happy hour beer prices can't be beat. We were in here Friday before 6. Despite the reviews on the long food wait we ordered the salmon artichoke dip. Figured that couldn't take long. 45 minutes later we canceled our app after not receiving it. The men next to us ordered the chicken wings as we sat at the bar. They got their wings as we were leaving. So it took their wings an HOUR. I know it's a new location but come the frik on. Need more or better trained kitchen staff. Really bummed we didn't get to try the food.
