I greatly appreciate this church and all the support groups, classes, retreats and child care they have to offer, not to mention the amazing festivals they offer: Halloween, etc.\n\nBut the Sunday services are a hard pill to swallow. The lesson I've found to be inspirational and good. But the music is TOO LOUD, it's got TOO many lights, cameras and it all seems TOO much of a \"show\". \n\nWHY WHY WHY....WHY would you have Sean from the Bachleor come to the church as a \"HONORED\" guest to speak as if he is to be respected as an example in this world?! WHY are we lowering our standards so much?! Okay, so he chose not to 'sleep' with the girls while dating them all. But did he not flirt, play with the eye candy, have impurity in his heart while lusting with his eyes and play tonsil hockey with them???? Come on, CCF, really?! AND to boot you can actually win a ticket to actually meet him as if he's a celebrity or Jesus?!!! \n\nSo disappointing. I was really enjoying attending coming to this church with my family but I will stop now due to the obvious lack of common sense.
