Made an appt for 630 for me and my friend. Gel mani for me. Pedi for her. Walked in, and I'm told another Kat walked in and they took her thinking that she was me. I booked two different services and they tell me that she told them there was no pedi. Isn't that your first idea that that is a different person? Whatever. My friend gets taken back for her pedi but they leave me waiting. Not even letting me know how long it'll be to wait. So I wait 25 min and get pulled back. Service was great though. Love the color and the shape is great too. Will come back for sure. Hopefully next time they won't give my appt away.
