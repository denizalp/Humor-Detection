What a great spot! I had dinner here and it was delicious! With a very modern saloon style atmosphere, Blue Ribbon offers an eclectic menu of steaks, oyster bar, fried chicken, fish, soups and salads, and much more. They had this neat veil that came across the middle of the restaurant to separate the bar from the dining room for private parties which was really different.\n\nOur bartender Shea was great! He was friendly, he knew just what to suggest, and he was funny. We had the house cabernet which was Bench 2015 and it is now my favorite cabernet. I even went out to buy some from the liquor store yesterday.\n\nFor an appetizer my friend and I had the shrimp and lobster cocktail. They were both chilled and succulent. Next we had the endive salad. The blue cheese, arugula, and beets were put together well, however I wasn't a huge fan of the endives. None the less still satisfying.\n\nFor entrees we had the 12oz NY Strip prepared medium with a red wine reduction sauce that was perfect! The steak was cooked properly, the meat was tender, and the sauce was scrumptious!\n\nThe fried chicken was our second entr√©e and it had to be the best fried chicken I've ever had!! Definitely recommend! It was crispy, salty, a little spicy, and the meat was moist. So good oh my goodness! I could rave about this all night. The only thing I wasn't too much a fan of was the gravy on the mash, it was a bit sweet like honey. \n\nOverall, this restaurant was great! The service was excellent and so was the food!
