If you like little joints where the owner will remember your order this place is great! It's the type of place you need to experience a few times before you know what to expect. The hours change now and again so you always have to keep up with the schedule. If you go between 11 and 12:30 you will be waiting quite awhile for your food and checking out can be confusing or have a bit of a wait time. Not to fear, I take my hour lunch at Lowdown often and have never been late coming back. The food is phenomenal. I am not much of a wrap person but I have never had a bad wrap from this place. I recommend the rosemary chicken. Rebecca J's review mentions the relaxed atmosphere. While she finds some of the relaxed behavior odd, I think it is quaint and charming.
