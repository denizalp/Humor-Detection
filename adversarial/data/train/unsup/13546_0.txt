Sausage is always good: summertime on the bbq (yum), hearty German winter dinner (very yum), quick juicy breakfast meat (also yum) and spicy chorizo in your chili (most yum of all). Parma Sausage makes all these and they make them better than anyone else in the city. \n\nThe entire store consists of a deli-style counter and about 20 by 30 square feet of space for people to order: it's like starring down the barrel of a gun--a gun made out of delicious salami. You walk in, grab a ticket if it's busy (even at the height of rush hour I've never waited more than a few minutes), order your stuff and then continue on your merry way down the Strip. \n\nUnless you're like me and you walk in disheveled and feisty and blurt out, \"Surprise me!\" when they ask for your order.* I say that not just because I like surprises (more than you'll ever know) but because I know there's nothing bad in the store: only good can come from Parma. \n\nSometimes I'll be more detailed and tell them if I want something cooked or fresh, but for the most part the choice is up to them, and they haven't disappointed me yet. \n\nI've had their garlic wine salami (boozey), hot Italian (not too hot), breakfast links (perfect), sweet Italian (good in pastas), Genoa salami (great with a strong cheese like Fontina) and hard chorizo (a revelation). Hard and soft varieties are speckled with fresh spices and herbs and everything is relatively inexpensive.\n\nAnd it's run by a bunch of cute local guys. \n\n*Try this if you ever want a quick way to bond with your local specialty merchants: it will endear you to them in a way that makes you forever memorable, and provide insight into them and their product. They'll  be delighted to tell you about what makes their smoked gouda THE smoked gouda, which will increase your foodie knowledge ten-fold.
