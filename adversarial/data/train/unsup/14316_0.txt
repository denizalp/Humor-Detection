We've been wanting to get a nice saltwater setup ever since we first moved here. Been to a couple other aquatic specialty shops, but none of them were as well-maintained as this place. For freshwater, they had a decent selection of live plants as well as fish, (and some amphibians). There were no signs of algae or dead\/sick fish in any of the tanks. All of the saltwater fish and invertebrates looked healthy too. Best collection of living rock that I've seen in Vegas. Wayne was pretty helpful in answering questions and reassuring us that a marine setup isn't as difficult as most people think. He was pretty knowledgeable in species compatibility, as well as group and individual behavior of certain fish. I thought I knew a lot about fish, but his knowledge eclipses mine! He even took the time to explain the available biological filtration systems. Once again, I'm impressed at the cleanliness of the shop. Also, they had a beautiful shark\/stingray tank set-up in the back. We left without buying anything this time, but at least got some good ideas for future purchases.
