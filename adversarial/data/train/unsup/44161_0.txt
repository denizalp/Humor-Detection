This is our local hole in the wall Mexican place. All the locals go here and are repeat customers. Sit in the bar is possible.\nFirst start with the house margarita on the rocks. It's the best in town, not overly sweet like other places.  The chips and homemade salsa are very good and we always finish 1 if not 2 orders.\nThe polo fundido is excellent, as well as the 2 tacos with rice and beans. This place is not for everyone ( Scottsdale attitude will not enjoy). We take all our family here every time they come to visit and it never disappoints.
