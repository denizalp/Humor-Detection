I saw many pictures of their signature dish on instagram and I just had to try it out! I walked in and was immediately greeted and seated by a lovely waitress. She also told us that the waffles were extra big today which was great to know!\n\nI had the hot plate - belgian waffle, earlgrey icecream, topped off with vanilla cream sauce and brownie bits. The dessert was very unique; they give you a 400 C hotplate with a small jug of sauce and you pour the sauce over the waffles. I accidently poured alot of the sauce on the hotplate since I wanted to see the sizzling but try to pour more onto the waffles themselves. Really, the hotplate doesn't provide much to the desert itself other than the presentation and uniqueness of seeing the sizzling waffle. Nonetheless, the dessert was delicious - not extremely sweet and the waffle was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The earl grey icecream is also not too sweet and has a strong flavor. All in all, everything was enjoyable.\n\nThe only thing is that the prices are a little bit expensive, but its definitely a dessert worth trying once.
