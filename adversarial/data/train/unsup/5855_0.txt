My friends have always talked about the frozen hot chocoloate at Serendipity in Vegas, but I'm not much of a sweets person so always just thought \"meh.\" However, while in vegas the past couple of visits, my sweet tooth kicked in and I decided to see what the hype was about\n\nNormally it gets packed late night and the hostess will get your # down on an ipad which will text you when your table is ready. You can always to-go your stuff at the window next door, but my friends have told me the frozen hot chocolate tastes better ordering it in the restaurant.\n\nEverything seems to be in big portions here & the HUGE menu (literally) is cute.\n\nFrozen hot chocolate for 2 - For my first visit my bf & I shared this. It was DELICIOUS! I was really mind blown that it wasn't overly sweet. The drink does is supposed to be 17 oz when you order the \"for 2 size\" the for 1 is 10 oz. I think it's cheaper to order frozen hot choco for 1 b\/c the rest of the 5 oz in the for 2 seemed like it was just extra whipped cream. I love the chocolate shavings topped on the drink. It's fun to scoop and sip at the same time. Definite must try! Hard to describe the consistency, but it's icy and not too thick (for those that think it's a milkshake)\n\nHangover omelette - This is the perfect omelette that sounds delicious when you have a hangover so the name suits the food. Bacon, fries, mushrooms, and cheese inside an omelette yumm. My friend ordered this and it looked really good, I took a bite and it was a great combo of all the ingredients.\n\nCrab Cake Sandwich - I got this protein style. The nice crab cakes are wrapped in soft butter lettuce. I liked the crab cakes, it wasn't too oily and stuffed with a good amount of crab.The beefsteak tomatoes, bacon, and spinach accompanied the sandwich well. \n\nMint frozen hot chocolate - On my recent vegas trip 10\/18\/13, we decided to order this 'cause I'm a big mint chip ice cream fan. My bf & I agreed this was a lot better than their original frozen hot chocolate and usually he's not a big fan of mint chip. Basically it's their original frozen hot chocolate, but they blend it w\/ a scoop of mint ice cream! I guess it sort of tasted like the Andes mint candy\n\nMake sure you get a total rewards card at one of the casinos (Caesar, PH) so that you can get the total rewards discount pricing on the food & Points! A lot of the reviews here say the service isn't good, but we've always had great friendly service the past couple times we've been here. Food comes out pretty quick. One day I hope I hit the jackpot to try the Golden Opulence Sundae here ($1000 sundae!?)\n\nBTW if it's your first time I suggest you check around what other tables are ordering to see what you'd like. I saw a couple of tables get the can't say no sundae and other sundaes that looked sooo good!!! Will be back to try their other menu items. I swear you can get fat just looking with your eyes
