This place is basically a bait and switch. The price you find online, being the lowest is quickly inflated by 'mandatory insurance' despite having my own. The rep rushes you through an initialing process without explaining ANYTHING and they put a $200+ hold on your card for the duration. My '$65' weekend turned into a '$300+' weekend not including the hold!! \n\nThe car had an AC failure on the way to Phoenix from San Diego in AUGUST, so it was an overall miserable experience. When I told them about it, they pretty much shrugged and said sorry. Avoid this company. I'll be filing with the BBB after this review as well. \n\nTL;DR: Total scam, spend a little extra for a better company. Trust me.
