Sauce-d.\n\nIt was an old-fashioned speak easy vibe they were going for an it was an old-fashioned speak easy they achieved.\n\nThough I'm not one to really care about decour, I have to admit that it felt pretty cool to be in place decades away. The deep red walls, velvety lamp shades, wooden stools and old-time-y pictures really gave the place some character.\n\nThe staff were all extremely friendly, happy to serve and worked their asses off during to serve a pretty jammed joint on both our visits last night. Mel, our bartender, didn't quite squeal when we came back after dinner, but it was pretty close and it was genuine.\n\nIf I recall correctly (the delicious whiskey sour hangover is blurring things), there were about 10 drafts, none of which included the usual domestic shit (Coors, Canadian, Bud, etc), but did include Flying Monkeys, Welly, Black Oak and King to name a few. The selection of bottles and tins was all over the map including Gleuten-free beer (a first) and what appeared to be a couple types of sake. \n\nThe music was pretty varied as well, which was great, and played a volume level where you didn't actually have to shout at each other, yet still maintained the party vibe.\n\nI can only hope this place keeps doing what they're doing as I've been without a neighbourhood watering hole for way too long.\n\nWill drink again.
