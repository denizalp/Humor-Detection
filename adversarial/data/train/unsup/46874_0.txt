You'd think a place like this would get it right. Nope. I only went to the 20.00 breakfast buffet. Apparently they have no busser in the floor from 7 to  9:30ish at the busiest time. The waitresses are expected to clear and serve. When I came in i had to wait on a booth bc there were so many dirty tables. Too many to count.  Asked a manager why are there so many dirty tables and she'd just say I'll take care of it....  and to top it off. Lukewarm food.
