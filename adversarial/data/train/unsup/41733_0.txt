The desserts here are amazing! Having said that, I went here for lunch yesterday and was pretty disappointed with the rest of the food. Most things were somewhere between mediocre and bad. At buffets I usually expect food to be mediocre to good. \n\nBut, like i said, their desserts are really, really good. We tried many different ones and none of them were overly sweet. It is my favorite buffet in terms of dessert.\n\nThey did have a few other good things too. Their thin crust pizzas, shrimp cocktail (already peeled!), pesto infused mashed potatoes (amazing idea), and mixed salads were all pretty good.\n\nIf you're really into sweets, I would recommend this place even if the rest of the buffet is not so good (yes the dessert is that good). If you want good non-sweet food though, I would go somewhere else.
