Tipperary's is A-OK, and, well... that's about it.\n\nThey have the average menu items, at the average quality, at the average price you'd expect. They play your average music mix at an average volume you'd expect. They have all the average beer you would expect no more, and no less.\n\nOK... The PIZZA is a standout. Enough to make the whole place stand out? Well, it's doubtful.  But the pie is stone oven cooked, and the herb infused crust stays crisp, even under the layers and layers of ham, sausage, and pepperoni on the Meat Lovers. Pretty impressive.\n\nWhile I don't have any reason not to go to Tipperary's, I'm also struggling to find anything that makes it special.
