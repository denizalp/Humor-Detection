I wish I could rate the staff separately from the room.  Staff gets 5+ stars. Everyone helped me around, talked to me about everything and anything I could ever want to know about Madison and made getting around an unfamiliar city very good.  The room itself was okay. The pillows were very squishy and offered no support. The bed was comfortable though. There was no refrigerator, which seems odd for a city that is so foodie friendly (and has amazing dairy stuff available to you). So really 3 stars for the hotel, but the staff earned it an extra star.
