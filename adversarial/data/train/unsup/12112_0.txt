CM continues to slide. Has CM not noticed their male customers are either gay or suspiciously gay straight men? We appreciate natural light just as much as women. They've decided to banish the male clothing section to the dingy basement. It starts out promising enough with a stair case I might expect to find in Ralph Lauren's home. But it's only a big CMck tease. You're in one dank, dull, basement with clothes just kind of crammed in and dumped there. The shopping experience is so unpleasant I can only imagine they hired someone to deliver it.\n\nBring back the old logo, already. Assholes.
