TL;DR The food is decent, but nothing outstanding compared to what's close by\n\nFirst off, I have to remove my hat before entering the dining room? Sure, forgot it was 1956. Oh, look at how the wait staff is dressed... like they are in 1956 working on a plantation in the south. Next the hostess pulled the table out of the booth so we could get in.... pulled it ALL the way out. I guess if I was in my 70s with bad hips, that would be a blessing (though, they didn't pull it when I was leaving). There was a lot of dishes dropping during our dinner. At least 3 separate things within the first 15 minutes.\n\nI had the prime rib lawreys cut. It was good, but nothing that stood out compared to prime rib at any other restaurant. The salad was pretty good. I think they deep fry their croutons.\n\nThe ambiance is pretty outdated. The service was decent. The food was good. Overall I probably wouldn't come back unless I was bringing my grandma for dinner.
