This place is soooo hit and miss! Where is the consistency??? That's all I am asking for!!! \n\nThe need for a new washer and dryer drove me back this last time around. \n\nSo, just on a sidenote...I hate spending money on things such as a washer and dryer that will just sit in the garage. I know it's necessary, but it's the concept. It sucks. Kinda like toilet paper...who wants to spend money on that? \n\nEnter old grumpy man in charge of selling appliances. After 15 minutes of confusion and being talked down to I left him to have some private time with my dryer...what a bunch of b.s...maybe it was that my hair is too short, or that I was taller than him, or that I was younger than him, or the fact that dared to ask questions, or the fact that I have boobs...who knows...i decided not to bother trying to get appliances at home depot, not from that idiot. \n\nAside from the grumpy man, this home depot is like any other home depot. Solid and cheaper than other home improvement places. The parking lot is a bit chaotic, so brace yourself for that...and other things apparently.
