If I were a condemned man, and had to pick one last meal before getting strapped into \"Old Sparky,\"  it would be a hot dog and tots from the Happy Dog.\n\nI've been to the Happy Dog about 50 times since discovering it a little over a year ago.  Each and every time, I have a great experience!\n\nThe Food - The menu couldn't be more straightforward, or more overwhelming all at the same time.  There are 4 main items: hot dogs, shockingly good veggie dogs, tater tots and fries.  Easy enough.  However, there are 50 really great toppings to chose from, in any quantity and combination you want.  Ketchup and mustard?  Check!  Peanut butter and spicy jelly? Check.  Bacon, egg, cheese with chipotle hollandaise?  Check!  For first timers, I suggest you follow the \"Suggestive Wieners\" cards, as you tend to experience some sort of \"topping overload\" with your first dog.  Then, work your way around the menu.  And at some point...do try peanut butter on a dog...it's shockingly good!  Really!\n\nThe Bar - The bar is well stocked with dozens of great draft beer selections, and the coolers have dozens more in cans and bottles.  They also have an extensive liquor selection.  Their Sunday Bloody Mary selection is top notch! Perfect for a little \"hair of the dog\" on a Sunday morning.  Despite the great selection of beers, my barley soda of choice is almost always the 16oz can of PBR.  Yes, I know it's the hip, new, old, beer that the kids are drinking today in their \"cool-guy hats,\" (of which I am not one of them!)  And I'm normally a beer snob, but it just \"seems right\" to be drinking a PBR and scarfing down a dog.\n\nThe Staff - The staff at the Happy Dog couldn't be nicer!  They are always on their game, no matter how crazy crowded this place gets.  Always friendly and helpful and the service is generally very fast.  When it's a bit slower, like a weekend lunchtime, the bartenders are very friendly, and talk to you as if you are their best customer...even if it's your first time there.\n\nThe Entertainment - This is a really fun place to see a band.  While a little small, and you're practically on-top of the stage if you're in once of the booths or floor seats...or 1\/4 of the bar seating, for that matter...it's a really great place for live music.  A great mix of music too...blues, honky-tonk country, rock...I think they even had members of the Cleveland Orchestra playing one night!  \n\nAnd, of course, for the \"Polka Happy Hour with DJ Kishka.\"  Once a month, a local musician transforms himself into the great \"DJ Kishka\" and spins old polka records for 3 hours.  Think it sounds lame?  Then stay away.  It's without question, the silliest thing I have ever seen.  The crowd is great, a mix of 20-somethings on up to 80 year old Polish grandparents...everyone singing and drinking...and drinking.  But a warning for the kids!  Kishka \"works blue\" after about an hour, so please...stay at home.  It is a bar, after all...who brings kids to a bar?  \n\nI love this place!  A true Cleveland gem!
