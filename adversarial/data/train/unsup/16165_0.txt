The only nice thing to say about the folks here is that they are nice, and they are.  Now the negatives: they don't know what they're talking about; they overprice goods; their juices are some of the worst I've seen that aren't sold at gas stations; and they don't even charge the prices they quote.\n\nI was in Phoenix for a short term trip and wanted to upgrade my tank.  Not being too knowledgeable about new tanks I was shown one that was supposed to be better than what I had.  I'll spare the product details.  I was initially told the tank was $30, so I thought what the heck and got it.  Except when it came time to charge me the price was actually $39.99, and that is what it said in the system.  Well, if it said that in the system, why don't you quote me the right price?  And to add insult to injury, I went to a competing vape store in Phoenix and saw the same model for only $15.  When I told them about the ridiculous prices at Vapor Vortex, they said that's a frequent occurence there.  I felt totally suckered.\n\nI also bought a few juices since I like to support vape businesses and try new things.  Well they were horrid, and I don't even believe the nicotine level was accurate (I buy 6mg, which is low, but this one was almost nonexistent in nicotine content, not to mention it tasted horrible).\n\nIf you ask for help with your new device, be prepared to be given the \"I don't know how to do that\" answer.  Well, I went to a competing store -- I won't say which, BUTT, it's OUT south a few miles.  I was quickly helped, with accurate prices, and given in-depth information on how to maintain my e-cig.  The other store gave horrible advice as they are not real vapers, just salesmen and pretty faces. \n\nI'll take quality and a company that actually cares about vaping than another one just trying to make a buck.
