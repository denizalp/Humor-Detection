I absolutely love this place! You can taste the difference high quality ingredients make. I've tried everything from the Turkey Pesto to assorted baked goods and have never been disappointed. It's my go-to place when I need something to bring to clients or office potlucks. Plus the owners are some of the most gracious and welcoming small business owners I've ever met.
