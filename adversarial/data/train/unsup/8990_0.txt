This company is a bit \"confused\" but they did get the antenna up and it works perfectly. We paid $60 more and got our antenna hooked up and we can plug into any cable outlet in the house to get reception...otherwise it would have been $260 for 2 tvs hooked up. I could have done it cheaper myself BUT guaranteed I would have fallen off the ladder or electrocuted myself so a one time charge of $320 is worth it to me.
