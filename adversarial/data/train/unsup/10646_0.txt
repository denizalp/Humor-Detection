I'm writing this as a review to my future self...\n\nHi Future Self,\n\nThis is Past Self. Did you just drive into the Red Robin parking lot? Then turn around and find somewhere else for your meal. \"It's convenient,\" you might say. Or \"everywhere else has a longer wait.\" Don't let this discourage you, you CAN have a way better experience somewhere else.\n\nYou will undoubtedly walk in and wait at least a few minutes, only to be brought to a table that is either unclean, missing utensils, or something else. The wait staff will arrive only to provide poor service or forget about you all together and you will need to go in search of a team member or manager to help you in another part of the restaurant.\n\nWhen you finally receive your food you will be underwhelmed and left empty, sad that you ultimately did decide to have your meal here. \"It's really not that great,\" \"I don't know why we came here,\" you'll say to yourself.\n\nFuture Self--I implore you, go somewhere else and get lured in by the bottomless fries.\n\nBest Regards,\nPast Self
