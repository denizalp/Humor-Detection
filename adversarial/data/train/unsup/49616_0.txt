Just went there and was pleasantly surprised with their selection of vegetables and herb starter plants. They also had a large selection of them that were organically grown. Found the employees helpful and even willing to get on the ground and find me the best looking plants from the back. Will definitely be back. They also have a nice selection of pots and decorations, including some really cool Buddha heads.
