Great food! But...the place closes really early for a restaurant. Many times we go for a late dinner and many times the waiter tells us the place closes in 5min! When its...9pm...\nThey have great selection of greek food and very generous portions too. I would only go for lunch though...\n2- great food\n3- rudeness and for closing too early
