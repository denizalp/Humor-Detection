I didn't like their customer service.  I called in to ask whether they had a TV for customers to watch if the customers decide to eat in.  The lady heard the word \"TV\" and said I called the wrong number and hung up.  \n\n\nCalled back again, and as soon as she heard my voice, she hung up.  Is this the kind of service you want?  I won't be going back there.
