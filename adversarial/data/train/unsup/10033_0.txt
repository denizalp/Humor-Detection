It's hot as hell outside In Vegas. I'm watching my friends doggies and never come over this way...so stopping here is always a treat. \n\nThey have your typical yogurt flavors... none of which I can try or eat (they aren't vegan). What they do have though is.... PINEAPPLE DOLE WHIP! Vegan and delicious... and guess what... lower in calories than all the other options! Of course I had to get it with a little mix of the orange dole whip... with some coconut sprinkled on top... yeah I know... 115 degrees outside and dole whip sorbets... perfect right? I would say be jealous... but I'd rather you go and support this small business and try it for yourself.
