I stayed at the Bellagio during the first week of November and I thought I would write a review of their Buffet since it is probably one of the best things about the Bellagio. Now keep in mind that I have been vacationing in Vegas for more than 20+ years so I am very picky about my buffets. I also am a seafood lover so that is the main reason for me going to a buffet while in Vegas and paying $30+. The line here is long (even for breakfast) but if you have their player's card you can go straight to the front. Also, if you don't mind eating at the counter you can go straight to the front. Even at 9 in the morning on a Sunday they have their seafood out (bluefin tune, salmon, bass,shrimp, crablegs,etc). I got the made to order ommelette (w\/crab) and then stuffed myself with the bluefiin tuna, salmon and bass (delicious!). Had some watermelon for dessert! If you don't like seafood then I would suggest not waiting in line or paying the extra $$$ to eat their buffet and spend the same $$$ in their coffee shop!
