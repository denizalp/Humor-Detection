Alex was amazing!  He arrived on time and was a true professional.  Even more impressive was his willingness to help drop the car off at the other end, he actually helped us push it up a slight incline into the sideyard!  Amazing service, pleasant conversationalist and truly a car guy.  Good luck on your project car, I know I'll need it for mine!
