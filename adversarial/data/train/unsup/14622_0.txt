Worst fish and chips I have ever had.  For a place that specializes in fish and chips, it was quite disappointing that there was nothing stellar about their halibut and chips.\n\nOn the food alone I would have rated it a 2 star.\n\nWhat put it at the 1 star?  A hair in my fish.\n\nNo repeat customer here.
