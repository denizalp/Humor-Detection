Stay away!!! I leased a camry from this organization and I am  ecstatic that I have turned it in and bought a Mazda. They harass you with phone calls and made a simple procedure such as turning a car in at the end of the lease PAINFUL. \nI had to deal with 4 different people to just get 2 pieces of paper ! The service department never knows when you call if you actually need the service , and when you do they always offer a\"more complete \" servce for double the money.Other reviews started with the positive. I am positive that I will never set foot in that dealership again.
