This place is heaven in your mouth. Hub and I celebrated the \"hell yeah I am baby free and in Vegas for the weekend\" occasion. We both ordered the delicious Innovative Menu with wine pairing. Everything from food to service was outstanding. Eat here! You'll be broke, but you will leave happy and satisfied :).
