A nice little spot where you can get a really good bagel.  While it's not the best that I've had in the valley, Big City Bagels is certainly better than any of the chain Bagel places.\n\nPrices are really low, especially when you consider the area Big City Bagels is located.  I'll take $2.50 for a bagel with cream cheese anytime.  BCB also offers a good list of other breakfast food, sandwiches, and a decent variety of coffees.   It's a little bit hidden in that massive shopping center at Hayden and Frank Lloyd Wright, by Four Peaks.  But when you find it, Big City Bagels is definitely worth skipping your usual chain bagel shop for.
