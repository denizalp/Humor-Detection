I stopped in while I waited for a friend to finish work...boy am I glad I did.\nWhat a beautiful little coffee\/tea shop! I ordered a London Fog with almond milk and it was delicious. The two ladies behind the counter were very attentive and approachable. \nIt's a nice quite study\/read area too...I will be back!
