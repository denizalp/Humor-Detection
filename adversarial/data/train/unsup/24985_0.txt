Both guys and gals will benefit from getting in on the hot secret that is the Third Floor hair boutique on Queen West. It is a small salon owned and operated by two very talented hair stylists and colourists, both of them really interesting, stylish, and fun women. It doesnt get much better than this people, so if you can book an appointment, do yourself the favour.\nLocation: to find this secret gem, you must enter the front doors of Harlots (north side of queen, just west of the second cup) - walk to the back of Harlots and climb the stairs to the 3rd floor. It is a super cool building and really fun to see how big the place is (it would have been an amazing home once!). \nDescription: everything is colourful and has a real mid century modern feel to it (I love the vintage hair blower chair). I usually go in on a Saturday and its always lively with lots of interesting people dropping in - usually some good conversations going on. Cool music is always playing as well, usually something cool, or indie (but sometimes also some cheese, which we all love). You get your hair washed in the back, which has classic rock playing - awesome.\nReview: I am a guy, and have short hair, and have been following one of the stylists here for years. She knows my hair, and gives me the best cut I have ever had. I have also seen what they do to other people and it is super creative. They are well known for their talent in colouring as well, and also, for you people with massive curls, they have that covered.\nOne of the extra little touches is the hot towel on the face while getting a head massage post hair washing - lovely!\nOne of the women does make up professionally, and so they also do weddings.\nThe vibe is slighly punk, totally cool but down to earth, not lame ass wannabe hipsters. Its real, the service is amazing, what more can i say\nPrices: Men's cuts: from $40\nWomen's cuts: from $50\nWash and style: $45\nShine Treatment: $65   \nFull Colour:  $60    \nRoot Retouch: $50  \nPartial Highlight: from $60     \nHalf Head Highlight: from $80    \nFull Head Highlight: from $100\nPermanent Straightening Regrowth: from $70\nPermanent Straightening Full Head: from $100\nExtensions: consultation required\nUpdo: from $60     \nMake up Mini Application: from $35    \nFull application: from $70   \nCheck the website for more details\n\nhttp:\/\/www.thethirdfloor.ca\/
