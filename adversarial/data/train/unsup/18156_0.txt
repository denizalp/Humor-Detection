I have stayed here probably about 5 years ago now. The room, I hope, have been updated since then. If not, your room will look like someone barfed up Pepto bismo. Seriously the whole room was bright pink. Eww!\n\nNow, the location is a central to the Strip and a great place to stay in that regards. The Flamingo is near and dear to my heart as I have won some money and is an older school casino in comparison. You can feel the vibes in the air or maybe I am always drunk here? Anyway be sure to grab drinks (not really good food) at Jimmy Buffets' Margaritaville which is attached closer to the Casino Royale side.
