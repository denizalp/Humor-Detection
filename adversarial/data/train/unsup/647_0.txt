Great food & family friendly. I ordered the prime strip that comes with grilled vegetables and mashed potatoes. Dessert was amazing ! I ordered the banana bread pudding with chocolate ice cream and my brothers ordered the lava cake. Desert enough to share with 2 people. The prices are reasonable. Friendly and fast service.
