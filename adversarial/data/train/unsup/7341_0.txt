One of my go to spots in Henderson. I've eaten here over 6-7 times and it's always consistently good. I love their kumamoto oysters and clam chowder to start. I usually get the crab legs with mashed potatoes and I try my best to save room for dessert because if you have a sweet tooth I'm telling you, they have the BEST desserts!!! The butter cake is to die for, literally die... it's so good, I don't even like cake but I love this butter cake. At least I think that's what it's called... it might have a different name but if you say butter cake I'm sure they'll know what you're asking for. They also have the fluffiest most delicious cheesecake. Honestly I think it's so random that their dessert are so good. But I really recommend it! I'm drooling as I write this review.
