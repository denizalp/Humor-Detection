Have been here twice. Both times I was forced to pay for breakfast even though I didn't want it. Both times they refused to actually give me the breakfast after I paid for it. Keep in mind, we're talking about a bunch of powdered eggs here. Not exactly a five course meal at the Ritz. Also keep in mind most patrons are spending a few hundred dollars apart from the $10 breakfast. \n\nOtherwise, generally sub par club. Would avoid at all costs.
