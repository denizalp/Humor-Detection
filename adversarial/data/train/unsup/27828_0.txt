This is by far the WORST chipotle I've ever experienced. I'm not sure how they're still in business to be honest. \nFirst off, every single time I've ever ordered from this location they have gotten my order wrong. Either there are items missing from my order or like last time, something I didn't order - like a HAIR in my food. The worst was when I ordered from their app on my way home from work a few weeks ago. I accidentally ordered from the location at chandler mall and not from this one like I had originally thought. After I had realized that I ordered from the wrong location I was super embarrassed because obviously that was my fault. The thing that was actually upsetting was the way that the staff went about it from there. When I asked if they could just make it at this location since I had already paid for it on the app, the guy at the register said, \"No, because you could have already picked up the one at the other location.\" Excuse me???? I couldn't even believe he said that. I sat at one of the tables while the other employees just looked at each other and then proceeded to ignore that I was even there. At the time I was 6 months pregnant and obviously showing. The fact that your manager said that it was impossible for them to make my order there was so ridiculous. So I had to drive 20 min the other way (during rush hour on a week day) just to get something your staff could have eradicated right there. Thankfully I got home an hour later with cold food. I've tried to give them chance after chance (mainly because they're close to my house) but I'm done with this location. Unless you want your order wrong, hair in your food, and a rude staff don't come here
