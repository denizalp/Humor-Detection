4 magicians getting together to do a magic show? Should be good right? Unfortunately the answer is no. These guys perform in the Tropicana theater that is inside the Tropicana Casino.\n\n Besides your basic sleight of hand card tricks, each individual had their own set of gimmicks. One guy did some sword swallowing, while another guy did a find the pea from whichever walnut shell that its under after being shuffled trick. The 3rd guy would do gross tricks like sniff a jelly bean through his nose and make it come out his eye. The last guy would ask for a 100 dollar bill, make it disappear and make it show up in an inconspicous location.\n\nSorry to say but I was not all impressed by everything they did. It seemed to me like their chemistry wasnt all that good. I would put this show in the one and done category. Once you have seen it, no need to see it again. I can mention a a bunch more magic shows that I have seen that are better than these guys. Mac King, Penn n Teller, Mat Franco, and even Murray are all worthy of seeing again. \n\nIn the middle of the show I had to go to the bathroom (its a 90 minute show). On the way back I just so happen to check my phone and had some missed calls. So I spend the next 10 mins following up on those missed calls. All the while there were at least 8 people that came out from the show. I was thinking they had to go to the bathroom too but they never came back. Were they that bored that they actually got up and walked out? \n\nIn closing I have a feeling that this show will not last very long as evidenced by a lot of empty seats. I am not one to root for a show to be shut down except for Criss Angel. That has got to be the worst magic show I have ever seen. Hope these guys land on their feet somewhere if this show does get shut down.\n\nYelp 2016 Review #55\n628 overall
