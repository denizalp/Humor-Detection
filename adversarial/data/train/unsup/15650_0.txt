I am only giving it a 4 since I took my order to go, but it probably deserves a 5. I wanted to grab a to go order of food before my flight back to Burbank. \n\nI searched on yelp and decided that this would be a good place to grab food. It is located next to the sports arena and was within walking distance of my hotel and the convention center. The area reminds me a lot of LA Live in Downtown Los Angeles. \n\nSince it was lunchtime, it was pretty emoty when I walked in, but it was happy hour. So while I waited for my to go order, I did get a beer to hold me overm the Grand Canyon American Pilsner hit the spot perfectly. \n\nThe service was great. The food came out quickiy and it was pretty good. I got the turkey pastrami sandwich, which would probably have been better if i ate it in the restaurant, but it was pretty good to go! \n\nIf I find myself back in Phoenix, i will definitely go back!
