The rooms are nice enough, if you like little to no privacy while using the bathrooms or sharing towels since they give you 1 towel for a room with 2 beds...classy!\n\nThe casino is nice, and the dealers are friendly and the poker room is cool.  Still obnoxious that they cant or wont (not sure which) give free drinks to players.\n\nThe customer service, is non-existent for the \"resort\".  It is the most unaccommodating\/rude staff i have ever seen in the service industry and looking at other reviews they are proud of it.  Management couldn't care less about customer satisfaction or troubleshooting issues.  You have to check in with security any time you want to go up to your room and good luck getting to your room if you forget your room key upstairs or someone else in your party has the key.  \n\nAlso, check-in took a long time and i have never seen so many people have to wait for a room to be ready for them at 4\/5pm.  But, check in times and room readiness i will blame on the holiday weekend even though i would bet this is a regular issue with this place.\n\nGoing from hotel to pool they allow drinking, but they wont allow drinks from the resort into the pool area so you have to finish or trash your drink to go into the pool area and buy a pool drink.  You then cant take a pool drink outside of the pool area so you do the same thing to that drink and then you get to buy another drink in the \"resort\" or casino.  I have never seen a resort have so many restrictions and rules...felt like i checked into a Martha Stewart prison.\n\nSumming it up if you want awful customer service, having no bathroom privacy or adequate towels, being treated like a work release prisoner, and have a mediocre time in a \"mostly there\" casino in Arizona THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU!!!\n\nOtherwise there are several resorts with casinos and pool parties in the area and they have got to be better than this place!
