This tint shop WILL NOT honor their LIFE TIME  warranty.  They tinted my car about 2 years ago and my small window bubbled up . The guy at the desk called Bryant \"aka\" owner to look up my warranty and he refused.   Do not used this shop so many other shops in town that will honor lifetime warranty even after several years.
