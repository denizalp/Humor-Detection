With a heavy heart, I had to switch nail techs.  I'd been going to DV  Nails for over a year and my girl, Tiffany, moved.  I was heartbroken.\nA lady at work recommended AJ Nails and to go to Trina, the owner.  She does my acrylics and does a great job.  I knew I was in the right spot when I saw another lady sitting in the waiting area as I was getting my nails done.  Trina said to her \"You want come back lata?\"  And the customer said \"Nope, I'd rather just wait for you.\"\nThey have a luxury pedicure that's $35 and has a whole gamut of different treatments.  There's even a clay masque involved!  At the end, I felt so relaxed that I wasn't sure I could drive home.\nAsk for Trina when you go.  She's pretty cool and tries to make jokes but I rarely get them.
