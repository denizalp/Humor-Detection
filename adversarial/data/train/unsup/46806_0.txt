I am not a big fan of ramens but this is my favorite place and made me crave for ramens once a month. I love it most of the time I came here. I had different ramens everytime, but my favorite is the tonkotsu. The broth and noodle was good, but not sure if they make the noodles from scratch. I had chashu bowl and karaage sometimes too, small portion but so delicious. The meat were marinated or somehow they made it juicy and flavorful. There were two times that I came there and the service were bad so I took one star off. My husband and I came sat for 15mins, the waitress stared at us but didnt bring water out or asked us anything. She only came gave us the menu when we called her. She didnt look happy. I hope she was just tired on that day and not everytimes we come.
