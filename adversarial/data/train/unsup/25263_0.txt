My husband and i order from here all of the time. Love the buffalo chicken pizza, you can't go wrong with that order. We also love the buffalo chicken hoagie (but you have to ask for ranch with it which is extra). The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars is because the service is subpar and we are always put on hold for at least 2-5 minutes when calling. It is an annoyance, understandable that they might be busy...  but an apology every once in a while would be nice. Plus having to hassle for the ranch dressing. I would highly recommend take out.. the atmosphere is very small and not inviting. Good food though.
