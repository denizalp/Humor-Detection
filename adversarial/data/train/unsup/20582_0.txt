Fancy hot dog you say?  Does that oxymoron even make any sense?  Well I thought I would put it to the test as I can say I've had some of the best hot dogs this universe has to offer.  When you're dropping $8 on a dog, you don't want some greasy schneiders hot dog stuffed into a pair of buns.  You want something mouth watering and an experience that brings you back to your days at the ballpark, CNE, or when your grandmother used to fry you up a dog to go with your ramen noodles.  Why because we ghetto like that.\n\nAnyway, this place looks great inside and the decor is definitely that out of a higher end restaurant.  The food however, was not as mind blowing as I would expect for the price I paid.  I picked up a Coney Island along with a few dozen nutella and original donuts on the side.  I'm fancy like that.  The dog was delicious and juicy, it made my eyes half roll to the back of my head.  The toppings however were pretty basic, and compared to a dog you can get from a street vendor, the quality was about the same.  The donuts were good, they weren't hot off the press krispy kreme good, but they tasted like your typical carnival donut from Tiny Tims.\n\nWould I go back?  Sure why not, I love hot dogs and this place has a plethora of choices to choose from.  I think at one point I was staring so hard at the menu that I blacked out a bit and thought about how they make seedless watermelons, seedless.  Knowmsayin?
