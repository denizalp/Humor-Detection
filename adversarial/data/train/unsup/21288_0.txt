Seriously what is it with furniture salesmen, they're just like car salesmen! So we're looking for a few pieces and have been store hopping. Against my better judgement we went to look in the Room Store. The sales guy was all over us. He said he'll let us look around and he'll check on us later but he's literally following us. Any time we stop to slightly glance at a piece of furniture he quickly comes over to tell us all about the piece. Go away! If I need help I will ask for it. I really hate furniture shopping at these types of stores. The sales people are ridiculously annoying and they sell all the same cheap crap...which you can buy online for even cheaper btw (Amazon, Overstock, Wayfair, Hayneedle). So after about 15 minutes we were done. I'd had enough and we left. Won't return, hopefully...you know when you're hungry but you have nothing to eat in your kitchen but you keep randomly checking your fridge or pantry like something new is going to appear, that's how I am with these damn stores. I always hope for better furniture, and better service but it's always the same bs.
