So this review is in part to spite my boyfriend because he loves these cookies and I just DON'T GET IT?! \n\nFirst, I don't understand how this store exists in Vegas. These cookies are such a Honolulu gimmick (there's literally one every street corner), so I was a bit shocked that there would even be a store in the mainland. I mean, if I'm going to Vegas, I'm not sure my friends would want me to bring back gifts branded from Hawaii? \n\nBut really, it boils down to the fact that these are insanely overpriced shortbread cookies. My boyfriend goes nutso for them, but I can't justify spending this much on a freaking cookie. I mean, these sets cost more than nice macaron or Godiva sets I've bought before. That's pure nonsense to me! \n\nThis location is super weird, all of the shops seem very dead so I couldn't even browse elsewhere while my boyfriend indulged his cookie obsession. We were also the only people inside so there was a bit too much attention placed on us to buy. Luckily, I was able to pull him away from spending all of dimes at this place, because seriously, I just don't get it.
