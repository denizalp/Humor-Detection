Food was ok, but extremely expensive for being average. $48 dollars for a pound of king crab legs, that were old, dry and small.\nService was terrible tonight. Think our waiter came by only three times, to take our order, to bring our food, then the bill...took about 20 mins to get the bill and another 10min to get my change...
