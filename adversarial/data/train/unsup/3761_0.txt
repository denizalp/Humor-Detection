I had the worst experience here. I don't recommend this place to anyone I wanna cry. But here's why\n\n1- lady who cut my hair did not speak English very well. \n2- she told me to wait 5 minutes so she could go smoke and come back smelling like cigarettes (and I think she was pregnant)\n3- I showed her multiple pictures of what I wanted my hair to look like and she STILL butchered it. \n4- the place was dirty and was not at all professional (I don't know what these google reviews are all talking about)\n5- I felt like I knew more about hair than she did. \n6- she can't wash hair for shit and she brushed my hair soo hard \n\nI could go on but she sucked soo much and the place was sketch. I should have trusted my gut and not cut my hair there the second I stepped in. The only good thing about it is that I paid 20$. And I regret tipping. Don't go here. \n\nThat is all.\nSincerely, angry client with ugly hair.
