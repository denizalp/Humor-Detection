Green is my favorite vegan restaurant. I have been to both locations and both are equally good. \nDecent sized menu with good variation. My favorite dish would have to be the lemon pesto bowl with fried tofu. The first probably 10 times I came here I got that and nothing else.\nOther items I've really liked: BBQ bacon burger, Wendy's pickle, poor boy mock chicken sandwich. Salad with chicken. Chicken wings for appetizer are also great. Fries are very good. Milk shakes are great \nOnly two items I've had which didn't think were excellent were the shrimp appetizer and the big wac, and a curry dish (I eat a lot of Thia food though so hard to beat thai curry)\nI just wish one of the locations was open on a Sunday, and also the price can add up. Me and my gf came and two dishes a couple appetizers and drinks came to over $60. The food is quality and not greatly over priced or anything, would feel better about it if everything was organic. But those are small issues and overall it is definitely the best vegan location I've been to.
