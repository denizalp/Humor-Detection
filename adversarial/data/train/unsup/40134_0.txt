Cute little place! Got here around 7pm, about an hour before closing. Bf wanted something off of the Savory Crepes menu, but we were told they weren't serving any Savory Crepes at this time.. not sure if they ran out of ingredients or they just stop serving them at a certain time. We got the Smores crepes instead & it was delicious. It was packed with a Ton of nutella.
