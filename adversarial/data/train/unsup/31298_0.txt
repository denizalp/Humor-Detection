Local Breeze is one of our favorite spots here in downtown. The place is seriously low key and reminds me of grad school in Austin. \n\nThe food is great. But I would stick to something on some type of bread. The salads aren't bad . . . but I am definitely not a fan of the combinations of food in the salads. \n\nI love that they open the door for your when you are coming and going, it just says Hi welcome to our place and thank you for coming. That makes me want to go back. \n\nReally looking forward to Fall\/Winter so we can go back to sitting on the patio. \n\nGood job guys keep it up . . . and come out with some better salads. \n\nOh and the portions are HUGE. I usually have to take half home. . . and I'm not a small girl.
