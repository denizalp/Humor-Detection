Candy Store visit only..we did not eat at the restaurant....thank goodness after reading the reviews.  If you want to purchase a 20.00+ Couture Pop- lollipop...this is your store.  It really is a fun store and it's over priced, but again you are in Vegas on the Blvd.  I have a couple of friends who are so hard to buy for...so purchasing over the price goodie bag or lollipop is unique and not something one would receive every occasion.  Anyhow, we had a great time looking around, they do have some cute items and unique.  Definitely a girlie store....enjoy!
