\"...and then this uber skinny hipster guy told me to pick any item I wanted to go in a magical custom cookie that he would bake in under 5 minutes for me... What do you mean it wasn't a dream?!\" \n\nLadies and gentlemen I present to you genius in the form of a cookie! DIY food is honestly the way of the future and apart from DIY sushi this place takes the cake (BTW if DIY sushi actually exists I demand you tell me about it at once!)\n\nSince I generally hate birthday cake, my friends and I planned an epic journey along Bloor West village in search of all things yummy and diabetes inducing. We ended our adventure here and I tell you it was well worth it.\n\nOatmeal milk chocolate chunk coconut cookie with rainbow sprinkles... we shall meet again in my dreams :-)
