Federico's is a nice new taco shop in an area that needs good Mexican food desperately.  It has 3 flat panel TV's wich is a bonus. The food is pretty good. Their beef nachos are really good,  the chicken nachos, not so much. The hard shell tacos are good also. They also have the bottled mexican sodas, I tried the lime soda and it was really good, I get one everytime I go now. Welcome to the hood Federico.
