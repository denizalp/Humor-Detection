Yes, my review relationship with Lee's could be described as fickle, even crazy. I had just come to peace with Lee's because they started accepting credit cards, and I enjoy their iced green tea. However, they have raised their credit card minimum to $15, and we made the chilling discovery that if you order \"light ice\" they pour the exact same amount of beverage. This means that you receive a glass that is 3\/4 full. This is in the top 10 most ridiculous business practice I have witnessed, up there with charging a quarter for tap water...crap, I probably just gave Lee's another idea.
