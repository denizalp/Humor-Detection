Had the brown sugar gnocchi and chicken parm and it was amazing!! The restaurant is super cute and great place for date night or a lot of friends. Great service as well. The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because 1. Wasn't overly impressed with my house special cocktail or the drink selection (especially for a \"barstraunt\" 2. My bf has wasn't impressed with his dinner (i believe he got shrimp alfredo?).  He said it wasn't the worst he had but hes def had better.  He also was disappointed that they didn't serve bread.
