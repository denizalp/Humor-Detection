Minus one star for being the type of place where you're always asking yourself \"ass or crotch?\"  Apparently, it can get way too crowded for its own good so you'll be doing some serious rubbing as you navigate through the sea of yup.  On the plus side, the feel of the Roosevelt is super cool.  Very dark and well-kept.  Perfect for a date who doesn't mind talking really loud.\n\nOn the super plus side, they have Arrogant Bastard on tap.  I can be easy to please.
