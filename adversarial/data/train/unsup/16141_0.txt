I have been going to Origin off and on, and didn't realize until recently that it is part of a chain of restaurants by Chef Claudio Aprile.  Origin's performance is fairly polarized--some of the dishes are superb, others avoidable; on some days the service is responsive, on other days it seems non-existent.\n\nOrigin's menu is quite diverse.  It is tapas style, and has a number of sections--Snacks & Sides, Raw Bar, Mozzarella Bar, Chilled, and Hot, and Sweet.  The tostones with guacamole is a perfect 10.  The fried plantain goes well with the chunky guacamole.  On the other hand, the roasted cauliflower soup with Indian spices is quite mediocre.  Not the right consistency, and the flavors don't seem well integrated.  The sweet potato and kale salad was hard to finish.  But on the other hand, the beet dish with goat cheese and walnuts is just right.   The setting at Origin is contemporary and especially well suited for business meals.  The service is friendly but often inefficient--for example, we had to wait an extra hour for the entrees to arrive last time we had dinner at Origin, due in part to a changing of the guard in the service department. \n\nGiven its proximity to where I spend time in Toronto, I will be going back to Origin.  And will continue to pick and refine my selections carefully.
