We have been going to El Chorro for over 10 years we are from Chicago.  So when our friends came to visit that was the place we wanted to take them for the beautiful restaurant and view.  Well our\/their experience was not very pleasant.  First we were the first person to walk in the door at 4:00 and we were told we could only sit inside or at the one table outside that seats 18 people, so needless to say we sat at that table.  I explained to hostess that we were just having cocktails and appetizers but she stated all tables were reserved.  Ok so after sitting in the sun on the most uncomfortable seats and after appetizers and cocktails we decided we would like to have more food so we wanted dinner.  I went to the hostess and was told we could not get a table.  So mind you the restaurant had many many tables empty all the while we were there (3 hours). So we asked to speak to manager (my husband would not eat dinner at that uncomfortable table\/chair) the manager came over and could care less, he stated they had reservations and there is nothing he could do and walked away.  My friends hated the attitude of staff and we were very embarrassed, all these empty tables and we could not enjoy a meal.  So not sure if I can get my friends back there, not a good experience.  Very disappointed.
