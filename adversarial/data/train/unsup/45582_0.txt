Great service, great food and great drinks. Girlfriend and I went in there for dinner on recent vacation. We were seated at the bar by ourselves and got the full treatment being the only ones there. \n\nWe had drinks ready whenever they were empty and got quick and great food from the kitchen. Awesome lobster roll and clam rolls. And to start we shared the lobster poutine. While the lobster was great, the gravy and cheese curds made the whole dish awesome. Definitely wish there were more places to get some lobster poutine in the U.S.!
