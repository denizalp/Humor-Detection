How to prompt Kate's embarrassment - call me out for being at your shop twice in less than 24 hours.\n\nBriefly, this stuff is good.  Much better flavors than Rita's, for example.  The Bada Bing would be better if it didn't have chunks of cherries.  A flavor or two taste pretty artificial to me (which...they are so no biggie).\n\nMy favorite flavor, which is so rarely actually served, is horchata.\n\nPure. Bliss.\n\nJust try to not get called out by the on-their-toes employees!
