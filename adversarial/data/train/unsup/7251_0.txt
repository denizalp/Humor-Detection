This is my favorite Korean BBQ restaurant in town. The place is very spacious and has a floor seating section which is great for my kids, they have a little more space to wiggle. They also have a private section for parties.\nI have been there twice, one time I ordered the beef combo and second time I ordered short ribs, pork toro and shrimp. Loved them all, their non-marinated meats were really tender with great flavor. They offered many varieties of ban chan, most of them were really good, no complaints there. \nService for both of my visits were good, the servers checked on us often and they cooked the meat properly.
