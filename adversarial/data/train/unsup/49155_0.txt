I had been taking my almost 2 year old to another children's salon that is much closer to home but let me tell you; this one is so worth the drive!! At his old salon, he screamed through every single haircut. At Cookie Cutters, Dianna cut his hair and she took the time to get to know him and even put his favorite movie on a little TV right in front of him. Zero screaming! He might have even  enjoyed it!! He's had a lot of 'hair cuts' in his little life but I think this was his first, not rushed through, legit one. As long as they continue providing this level of service, Cookie Cutters will keep my business....no matter how far I need to drive!!
