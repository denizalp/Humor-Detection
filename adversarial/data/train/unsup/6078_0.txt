Talk about an unexpected hidden gem. This space has been given new life and has kicked out its previous Cowboy Saloon and Toby Keith's roots and emerged as this bright, inviting space with clean line and plenty of smiles. \n\nWe had four in our party and decided our best course of action was to go family style. This is how it all went down. Fried Chicken, crispy but lacking moisture and flavor. The black pepper biscuits were surprisingly hard and again lacking a deeper dimension of flavor. Crispy Brussels slight crunch and great level of acidity. The brisket( fork tender), Jalape√±o cornbread, great level of moisture and season but lacking any trace of heat. The burnt end baked beans, seemed to have too much vinegar and the sauce cried out to be reduced further. Crusted French fries were I feel completely the star of the show, reminiscent of this gas station hot box potato wedges, but this was the grown up version. Garlic roasted mashed potatoes, amazing flavor, fluffy, no additional seasoning needed. The star of the night by far was the Peach Cobbler. The peaches perfect amount of sugar and spice and an amazing crispy biscuit crust. \n\nOverall, we were pleasantly surprised and look forward to trying it again.
