I wish I could give this place zero stars!!! My husband and I just ordered and when I pulled out my pizza I noticed a long strand of hair in the cheese... We called back and spoke to jade who is reportedly the general manager(horrible!!) she refused to give us her last name so we could make a formal complaint! Will never go here
