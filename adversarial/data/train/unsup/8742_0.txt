Came here at 10pm on a Monday with my friend after a hard day of studying at UdeM. It was so close to school and it's two steps from the metro (c√¥te des neiges) \n\nI always thought it was a small fast food place, but to my surprise, it's a decent sized restaurant with a bar and everything! \n\n(They have a little sticker on the door that says \"they love us on yelp\"! I thought it was super cute) \n\nThe place wasn't that busy and the waiter was really nice and attentive. We ordered a large \"frites alors\" poutine to share. The food came very quickly and I was so shocked by how much food they gave! (Thank god the metro was so close!) \n\nThe fries were cooked to perfection, the sauce was the perfect amount of salty, the veggies were cooked perfectly, I could go on, but I'm running out of ways to use the word perfect. \n\nI wish the cheese was a bit more melted, but that's just a TINY thing. I still loved loved loved it! \n\nCan't wait to go back!
