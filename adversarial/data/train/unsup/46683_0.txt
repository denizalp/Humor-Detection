Chipotle has slowly crept to the top on my list of Tex Mex chain restaurants. My daughter and I hit this one up occasionally for our Thursday night dinners out. She introduced me to the Burrito Bowl. It's a burrito in a bowl without the actual burrito. Great concept, although not original (another tex mex place calls it the \"naked burrito\"). Load up on fresh toppings & different heat levels of salsa. I like the \"hot\" salsa myself. It's my new favorite way to have a burrito. I know that there are more authentic Mexican restaurants in the Charlotte area, but for a quick and tasty meal I like Chipotle.
