I hate to give a bad review on a rare restaurant that's actually run by Japanese people (apparently), but it just wasn't a good food. The sushi set I ordered was a typical Americanized sushi affair. Not authentic at all.\n\nI also don't know where they find their cooks, but I seriously doubt the Japanese guy behind the sushi counter was properly trained in the sushi making (at least not in Japan). Just because the guy is a Japanese, doesn't make him any kind of sushi master. It's a profession, not a nationality. He also was very slow in making his sushis. I had to wait at the counter for my sushi set for nearly 30 mins while the guy was chatting a bunch of lame stuff with other customers at the counter. Not only he doesn't seem like a proper sushi cook, his work-attitude was not professional at all. They need to hire somebody else before he pisses off too many customers.
