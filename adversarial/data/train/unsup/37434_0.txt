Feeling upset at the moment. I ordered combination rice, shrimp egg foo young shrimp tempura crab rangoon and 2 drinks. For one they took longer the the time they told me on the phone. I get my food ands not hot. And they forgot my drinks smh... i call them they refunded my card for the amount that will take 3 to 5 business days. But then i go to eat my egg foo young and its horrible. Its burnt and no flavor. I cant tale it back cause im working. Will never go here again.
