Excellent service, excellent food. Their pizza is excellent and their blackened salmon is amazing. I have been several times and wait times are usually very short. Also save room for their pizookie, delicious. They even have a gluten free pizookie that I think tastes better than the other. Overall a very solid place to eat.
