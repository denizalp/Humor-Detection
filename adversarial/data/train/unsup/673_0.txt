This is the Newest Addition to the Raising Cane's Establishment! As other Yelpers have stated, It is located on Decatur and the 215. Across the street from LVAC, and Right Next to Winco Foods.\n\nThe Parking is Only a Few Stalls here, but you can Always Park in the Burger King, or Winco Parking Lots. There is a Drive Thru for your Convenience as well. \n\nI had my 3 Fingers Deal to go, and it took Less than 5 Minutes for My Wait. Customer Service was Awesome, and if\/should you have Any Questions, The Counter Girls will be More than Happy to Answer it for you, as I Witnessed today while Ordering My Food! \n\nBe Expected that at times, It Will Get Busy....You Will Not Find a Seat inside, and the Drive Thru is Busy as well. Just Try to Be Patient..  =)\n\nTheir Sweet Tea is Awesome!!! Just had to say that....lol!\n\nHappy Yelping!
