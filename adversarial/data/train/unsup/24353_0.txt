I love pastrami!  if could get the real \"homemade stuff\" I'd eat it at least once a week!\nIt's so hard to find fresh homemade pastrami outside of NYC.  Stage Deli is located in the MGM next to the sports book.  The sandwiches run about $9 they are pretty small compared to Carnegie but they are also half the price, so pretty much the same thing in my book.. I really liked the pastrami from here, very soft and tender and very flavorful, i liked it better than Carnegie (in the Mirage) it was more moist.  I also got the Daily double, half pastrami half corned beef, i think it was about a $1 more, also very good.\n\nBest pastrami ive had in a very long time!  Next time ill just order a pastrami with double meat to make it as big as Carnegie.
