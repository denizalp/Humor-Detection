Great service and the food was great.  I wish they were open for lunch, but has evening ours only.  It go pretty busy fast so I recommend getting a reservation first.  Had a the chilean bass and lettuce rolls (cups).  The server was very nice and was a solid dining experience.  It is a bit dark interior mainly because the sunlight comes in bring during sunset.  So make sure you ask for seating on the left side of the restaurant when you walk in.  I have not tried enough of the menu yet - only been twice...but I will be back and tell my friends about this place.  My friend told me about this place.
