I was in the area with a buddy when he made this recommendation for lunch.  I was and am normally for anything once.  We rolled in and parked, and upon entering I found the other customers where a cross section of those that are out and about on the strip.\n\nI followed my buddies lead and ordered up an areas with roasted pork butt ($5.00) and a fried egg (.99).  For a beverage a passion fruit drink ($3.00) was ordered.\n\nThe meal was delicious and filling.  I thought I should have ordered more but the maize and it's contents contained within were divine.  The drink equally complimented.  Because I have nothing else to compare to...it's a 4 star for now.......for now.
