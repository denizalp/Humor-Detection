If you have access to a car when visiting Las Vegas, Marche Bacchus is a must to do on your list. I read some reviews and decided to try it out. It turned out to be one of the best decisions in Vegas lol. It is approximately 14 miles from the Strip but well-worth the visit seriously. It has both outdoor and indoor seating. It is set on a \"lake\" in the section of town called Desert Shores. You don't feel like you were in Las Vegas and is a refreshing change from Casino and the hustle and madness in downtown Vegas. As you enter the restaurant you pass a large selection of wine that you can purchase to drink with your dinner. The bottle prices are very reasonable in comparison to other Vegas restaurants from my experiences. If the weather cooperates, dine outside as it is lovely and soothing. The menu is varied - mostly with a French twist - and everything we ordered here was INCREDIBLE. As a Las Vegas visitor, Marche Bacchus is a restaurant I will try to make one of my go to spots when in the area. The staff friendly and very knowledgeable of the menu. You can't go wrong here from staff to the food just a PERFECT EXPERIENCE.
