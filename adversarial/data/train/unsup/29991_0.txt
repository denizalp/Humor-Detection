Very good service. We had a party of 8, including an infant, and someone who is allergic to eggs and dairy - it was no problem. The food was wonderful. Modern looking inside. Had a gelato bar inside, which we didn't try because we brought cupcakes for someone's birthday. And I kept hearing how cool the women's restroom was. The one cocktail I had, ginger-something, wasn't my cup of tea, but food, etc. was great. I'd recommend to anyone, and we'll be back.
