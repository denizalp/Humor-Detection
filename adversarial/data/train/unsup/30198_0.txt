I see all of the 4 and 5 star reviews and I think, I wanted it to be like this!!!  Unfortunately, I cannot say that it was.  The service started off bad and got worse....  the water was...  dreadful....   their ice was so bad that it ruined the taste of Soda, the alcoholic drinks and Im sure anything else it came in contact with.  (it was so bad that when I had my friends that were with me over for drinks a few weeks later, I advised them that my ice was not from the Peppermill) The quality of the food was poor and tasted funny.  Our waitress was very cold and short and didnt do anything out of the norm to impress me.... i am not saying that she should have, but a smile would have helped....    I will not be going back to this place... for everyone else, good luck.  It seems like some people have had great luck here.
