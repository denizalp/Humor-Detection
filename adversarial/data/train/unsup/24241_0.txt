So this is a new place and i just rather to go to chatime but since I'm here in Montreal, I'll give this new place a try.  Came here and there was a long line.\n\nLong lines...boba? Should move quickly right because it's a beverage\n\nWRONG!  I waited 45 min in the heat, obviously I was already in too deep to leave, but 45 minutes?  It's a bit ridiculous\n\nSo I'm finally at the front of the cashier and I see why it took so long.  It's completely disorganized.  The cashier is getting the drink orders, another is putting boba into the cups and such and you got like 3-4 in the back prepping and making the beverages, seriously, this shouldn't have took long but the cashier is taking her time taking the order and then move over to playing with the buzzers and then moving the drinks, while the other who was putting the boba is just....putting the toppings in the cups.  What made is worse is....I see the girls in the back just slowly taking their time, laughing and gossiping and giggling and even, EATING!  I'm not sure if it's a sanitation issue here in Canada BUT ITS NOT OKAY IN USA (I work in food\/beverage) \nThis is literally why it takes so long.  My drink was ready and for some reason, they just left it on the counter so at this point, my patience left and I just ask for my drink instead and storm out\n\nI ordered the panda milk tea, which is milk tea with the black boba and white boba.  I got it at regular sugar level since it's regular, half or 30%.  The milk tea is good, strangely it's a good sweet for me(could be a little less but still) I couldn't really taste the tea.  I like how it doesn't leave that tacky feeling in my tongue afterwards.  The boba has a good texture and just a bit sweet, taste freshly made.\n\nThe drink is good but i wouldn't come back, there's no excuse to this type of wait
