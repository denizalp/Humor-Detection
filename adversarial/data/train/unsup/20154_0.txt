Arrrrgh I wish I could do half-stars!! I feel this place merits 3.5. \n\nThe quality of the food is GREAT. Interesting menu with astonishing variety, quality ingredients and genuinely creative approach. My table shared the mussels and burrata pear thingy for apps, then I had the chicken curry while others had the ribs, the burger and the ribeye. Everything was great, and no pricier than any other gastropub in a Strip hotel. \n\nThe atmosphere is a bit on the douchey side. It's REALLY loud, and opens out onto the epicenter of the douchiverse, the Hard Rock pool. The waitstaff are all waaaay too cool for school; apparently, the shtick is that there are no uniforms; they can wear whatever they want..which means trendy-slutty apres-pool attire for the ladies, and hipster-douche chic for the dudes. The service was OK; it was really busy (right before the Def Leppard show) so I'll cut 'em some slack for the lackluster nature.\n\nI'd come here again, but on a slow night. I like to TALK over my meals, and it was just too freaking loud.
