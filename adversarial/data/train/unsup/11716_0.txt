Finally!! A sushi restaurant in downtown Phoenix worthy of multiple visits. \n\nTo begin with, the service here is impeccable. Very attentive and always on the ball. After having been in the industry for 10 years, I know first hand that great service can either make or break a dining experience...this merely enhanced the amazing food. \n\nThe Hand rolls are perfect. Spicy Tuna is ACTUALLY SPICY. I also tried the 3H roll which was AWESOME. Perfect texture and the roe added a great little pop. The Oh My God Roll came out in fantastic presentation (everyone loves fire) and had the flavor to boot. \n\nLast but not least, I felt like I was stealing from this place for the quality of food the price is outstanding. \n\nAll in all I can't find  anything negative about this sushi joint! Do yourself a favor and try it!
