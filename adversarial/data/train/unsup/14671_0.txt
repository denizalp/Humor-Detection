$19.99 All you can eat sushi on Mondays and Tuesdays.  \n\nNeed I say more?\n\nTheir sushi is pretty damn good for being located in a landlocked state.  The food is made by real Japanese dudes.  \n\nThis has been my preferred sushi spot even before they had that $19.99 deal.  They prepare their sushi better than any sushi restaurant in AZ.\n\nI've gone to places like.. I don't want to name names, but it rhymes with \"RAW\" and \"Rona Brill\",  ; ) and the food at those places seem pretentious and watered down, not to mention expensive as f*ck.  \n\nThe sushi at HonMachi Grill is made better, tasted better, is a better value, and is more authentic than the above named\/hinted restaurants.\n\nAlso, try their teppan grill.  The surf and turf is excellent.  It certainly kicks the crap out of anything that restaurant that sounds like \"Benny Hannah\" puts out.\n\nWith that said, I'd like to leave you with these parting words:\n\n$19.99 All you can eat sushi on Mondays and Tuesdays.  \n\nP.S.\n\n$19.99 All you can eat sushi on Mondays and Tuesdays.
