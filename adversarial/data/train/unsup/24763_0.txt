Teased by the Cosmo for almost a year, the long awaited Eggslut has finally opened and...\n\nREALLY?!?\n\nThere is nothing wrong with the sandwich.  How can you not like soft scrambled eggs imbued with butter, bacon, caramelized onions, melted cheddar cheese and the warm spicy kick of siracha on a fresh, gently sweetened brioche bun (Fairfax)?  Great combo but come on, $12???  A $3 premium over the LA location.\n\nThe bacon, egg & cheese sandwich (fried egg, cheddar cheese, chipotle ketchup on a brioche bun) A-OK.  It's a fried egg sandwich.  Eat it quick or the egg yolk will quickly soak into the bun making a soggy mess.  $8.\n\nFinally the \"slut\" (coddled egg on a silky smooth potato puree cooked in a jar) is definitely interesting.  Mix it all up to incorporate the salt, chives, and yolk into the potato then spoon.  Basically a pureed breakfast slathered on a piece of toasted baguette.  Sans the baguette, perhaps in my golden years when the dentures hurt but for now, I prefer solid food.  $10.\n\nTo their credit, the applewood smoked bacon is well sourced.  Meaty with controlled salinity.  The eggs (cage free) do have a more pronounced yolky flavor.\n\nA fast food restaurant with fast food friendly service.  A little clumsy but this visit was opening day.  It should improve.\n\nIn the end, creative food truck grub at astronomical Vegas resort pricing.  \n\nTo each his own but this slut is not for me.
