Nice employees but worst corporate office and customer service they are all foreigners that can't speak good English there late fee is ridiculous and there rude not helpful and when you try to get things fixed threw financial department it's like pulling teeth painful and they dont give a shit about helping you they love charging late fees and they don't take them off I tried several times if you finance threw let it go to collections it going to be cheaper then paying them all the fees worst corporate company but nice office they are sharks more they get out of you the more there happy to steal from you make sure they don't add e pay without your permission the did it to me and made two payments then when I asked to fix it they pretend that I didn't exist so I filled fraud so beware of the corporate office
