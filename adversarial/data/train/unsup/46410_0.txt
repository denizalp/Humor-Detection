I have been using Swiss American since 1980!  Not many small businesses last that long without losing something.  I can always count on fair treatment as a long time customer, but I often just hang out and bug the crew there and get to see them take care of many new customers.  They are always honest, take the time to explain what they mean and are not intimidating to newbies to the sport.  They have a decent selection, can order anything and work on all brands.  Nick the bike tech can fix all the new technology and still takes care of the simplest things.  Prices are good, and they stand behind everything they sell.  Highly recommended!
