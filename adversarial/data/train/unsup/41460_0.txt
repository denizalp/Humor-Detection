I love Charlies.  Great staff, good prices, fun bar, great entertainment, and clean.  Layout is a tad rough and there is no patio, also there are TV's that don't have anything on them other than adds for the bar.  If there was actual TV on the TV's I may never leave the place.  \n\nThere's always fun to be had at charlies!
