After getting frustrated with a damaged natural nail, I decided to just get acrylics.  Went to Vy's for a full set and have been back once for a fill and a pedicure.  I like to call earlier in the day and set up an appointment, they can alway fit me in! They are very friendly, do a beautiful job and have excellent prices.
