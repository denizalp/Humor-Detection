I am one of the original customers from when they first opened. These people are my family. My people. They will treat you like a friend. Everyone is always talking and the customers join in so we all end up teasing and laughing with each other. My nails always look on point and they take such good care of you. You will not be disappointed going to see them. Great nails, great atmosphere and great people. You won't be disappointed.
