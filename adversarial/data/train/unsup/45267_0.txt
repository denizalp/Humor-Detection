Wait staff was very patient and nice. They cheerfully answered a lot of questions. Each of them deserves strong commendation for the service. A lot of food is offered - we ordered too much! Oysters were among the best I've ever had (as good as those from New Orleans), although maybe a bit expensive at $2.50 each. Mussels were tough and not particularly flavorful. The captains boil signature sauce did not do much for me; I should have chosen a butter and garlic sauce or something more basic. Fried shrimp were typical of a Low to medium priced chain. French fries were excellent. However, I have been to much better seafood restaurants in a similar price range.
