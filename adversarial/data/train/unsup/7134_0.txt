Four stars?? I think not. \n\nThe lovely had lunch here previously, said it was good. We went for an early dinner. \n\nThe decor is old and walking in it was damp and smelled like someone's basement. The whole feel of the place is dark and damp and sorry, not clean. Yeah, like gum under the table not clean.\n\nNice waitress takes our drink order and comes back with yummy chips and salsa. This was the highlight of the meal. Not wanting a carbo load, I order a breakfast burro with chorizio [menu says, egg, cheese, chorizo]. I get a very nice tortilla loaded to the gills with chorizo, couldn't find the egg or the cheese. WTF?? It wasn't even delish chorizo but since I was famished, I ate a third and pushed the plate away. Lovely had chicken taco platter. He ate one and said it was bad, it had no taste. He pushed his plate aside with the remainder untouched. Waitress asked what was wrong and he told her and then she asked me. I told her it was just okay. To their credit, they took Jeff's food off the bill. Damage already done. Awful. Will not go back. E v e r.
