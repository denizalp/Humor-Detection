I go here to get my Korean fix. This is exactly like shopping mall Korean food. They could serve shit on plate call it Korean and I will eat it because there are no other Korean places around. \n\nI see stupid ass reviews about service, go to an Asian place and expect bad service. Just go and eat! I like the food, extra meaty, extra fiber, and it comes out quick. I don't need a smile or peppy service to enjoy my meal. I'm Chinese so if I need some-ting I go up to the server station and grab it myself. For $8 a meal, I ain't expecting \"may I change your socks\" service. If I do it's a bonus. \n\nSeriously writing this review is making me hungry. I usually get the spicy chicken plate and the fucking chap Chae noodles. If you don't feel like driving all the way to china town for it, come here. Excellent place to go before a movie. If you're an Asian guy dating a white chick, bring her here. If you think orange chicken is amazing, you'll like the flavors here.(don't ask for orange chicken.) damn orange chicken pisses me off. Why? I don't want to get into it. \n\nSeriously location, location, location. Five stars for the amount of protein I get, five stars to taking care of my Korean craving, however we all crave Korean girls. Finally I give 5 stars for having the best sides. I'll keep coming here till the day I move closer to china town, in reality if you live in Henderson, why the hell would one move by China town? I'm going to get mugged.
