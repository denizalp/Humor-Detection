This is an all around review of the Strat and attractions within. I found the parking garage relatively easy to get to, just off LVB. Garage itself remained me of Circus. The casino was old but clean and people seemed to be having a good time. We were there for the Spy show and had some BOGO coupons for Sin City Hops. This was a terrific experience, fresh, cold beer and chilled glasses (with an orange.) Tender was friendly and efficient. Picket up the tics (again good service at the box office. We were hanging around outside the showroom while we finished our beers and the ticket person told me we could bring them in. The theatre was fairly large and comfortable. Av was adequate. Earlier we went to LA Comedy to see the Redneck Show (worth the effort.) This is a nice intimate little room with excellent service. Only issues with Strat is the age, airflow and $8 beers. Not sure about the gambling as we didn't play. If I were visiting vegas and was on a budget i would probably consider staying there. But they are certainly past what would be considered the strip and we refuse to walk down to SLS where you can catch the monorail after dark. But with a car, no problem.
