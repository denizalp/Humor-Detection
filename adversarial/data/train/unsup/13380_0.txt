After reading a few reviews mentioning good prime rib, I decided to try Harry's Steakhouse as I didn't feel like venturing too far from the hotel. What a bad choice!! It started with the long wait to get service. Once a waitress finally came by, I was told happy hour only in bar area although I was seated at table in the bar. I then ordered a medium rare prime rib with a side of coconut shrimp. The entree came out before my dinner rolls and soup. I was disappointed that my prime rib looked more well done than medium. The shrimp was okay while the marmalade sauce was entirely too sweet. Never have I wanted to leave leftovers.
