first time at the salon and didnt like my experience. the lady I was with said she was new to the salon so that made me nervous. she didnt talk much and was not very polite. she even checked her phone a few times. i wanted my hair shorter but she argued with me and i left unhappy with my cut. i covered it with a baseball cap and went to another salon. will never come back here
