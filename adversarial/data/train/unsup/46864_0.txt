Easily one of the more welcoming places I've been to.  The services has been fantastic the three or four times I've been here!  How many places do you go to that the bartender remembers everyones name?The food is really good, but please forgive me as it has been a while and any remember exactly what I've ordered.  I've had burgers twice for sure and they are amazing, probably the best burger in the South Hills, of course I have not tries them all.  I would highly recommend Else's Bar to anyone no matter your age; I'm 27 and have never had an issue here. \n\nMy only gripe is that it is really warm in the normal seating area...
