This must be my new favourite Irish pub in Toronto. \n\nIt has a real authentic feel, although it's far nicer than most of the pubs you'll find in Ireland. There are lots of leather lounge chairs in the front room when you enter but once you head up the stairs the decor is more traditional.\n\nThey have a HUGE beer list. I love the \"beer samplers\" you can get - 4 x 5oz mini beers for only $7.49. This way you can sample quite a few. \n\nThe service was excellent and the barmaids really know the menu well. \n\nThey even had a cider ON TAP. Thank you. Finally. It's so hard to find cider on tap in Toronto. This was a Canadian cider - BC Rock Cider, but it was delicious, crisp and light.\n\nThe pub is quite small (hoorah!) and was packed with a wide variety of non-douchy people (yay). \n\nI didn't get to try to food, but I will definitely be back.
