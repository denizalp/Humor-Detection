We've seen a bunch of movies at this theater over the years, so I am surprised I haven't written a review just yet.  Most recently, we went to see  \"The Blind Side.\"  (Loved it by the way and highly recommend it).  \n\nSome of the things I like about this movie theater:\n*Great movie selection\n*Comfortable seats\n*Validated underground parking\n*Easy access to Biltmore Fashion Mall, True Food, and Houston's\n*Popcorn and other tasty treats\n*Clean bathrooms\n*Very good times compared to other theaters\n\nAnd just a few things I've noted during my visits to this theater:\n-escalators not always dependable\n-expensive concessions\n-ticket prices consistent with other theaters but still on the steep side!\n\nThat being said, I'm sure I'll continue to frequent this theater - keep the customer service, movie selection, etc... coming.  Just do me a favor and keep the prices where they're at.. no need to keep raising ticket prices!  Happy viewing all!
