Up until last night the only Gordon Biersch I every tried was the concessions at Chase Field. It was there where I fell in love with their garlic fries. \nAfter leaving a Cardinals game, my friend and I decided to stop in for a snack and a beer or 3. As we drive up we see the sign...Happy Hour Daily (including Weekends) until 6:30. SWEET!! We took our seats at the patio bar and were quickly greeted and served. The happy hour menu had some great, very nicely priced options. And of course I just want the garlic fries. \nThe patio was great and casual and the inside was warm and contemporary but still casual. As the sun set the fire pit got going and provided some nice ambiance. \n\nIt was also on this night that I performed my good deed for the day....from out of no where came a sharp, shrill SCREAM!!!! Everyone turns in the direction of the commotion. I look over to see a man and a lady in a panicked state, jumping around....What was it? What's wrong? The whole restaurant is looking. They could barely speak, mostly pointing I see it....a very large grasshopper, about 3-4in long sitting on the edge of the lady's chair. Quickly and without hesitation, I offered my services calmly but quickly going up to the chair and capturing the grasshopper and then walking over to release it over the patio wall. The man he was embarrassed but I received a gracious \"Thank You!\" from the lady. And plenty of \"Good Job!\" from my fellow patio patrons.
