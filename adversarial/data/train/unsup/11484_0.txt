My boyfriend and I decided to try this place after the gym last night. It was a Friday night at 8pm and their \"dinner service\" consisted of 4 tables. You could practically hear crickets chirping it was such a wasteland. I think I may have seen a tumbleweed roll by. The staff stood around looking bored out of their skulls. The manager\/owner was some macho, guido New Yorker who kept talking to the customers while they tried to eat. Even though the restaurant sucked you could tell he was super proud of it as well as the menu the way he beamed with pride after each dish that was brought out. I guess it makes himself feel better to tell himself these things so he can get to sleep at night. I'm still not even sure who our server was that night, as we had four different people coming up to our table asking if we needed anything else and clearing dishes.\n\nWe ordered mozzarella sticks, garlic bread, chicken Parmesan and the tortellini. The mozzarella sticks were served with marinara sauce in one of those silver gravy dishes. Weird. Everything was sub-par. As Gordon Ramsay would say it was \"Bland. Boring. Uninspiring.\" Not to mention overpriced. The bill was $50. Carraba's is better and less expensive. \n\nThe decor and furniture is garage sale-chic. There's soccer balls displayed in the bar. The chairs were made of wicker and bamboo. It looked like The Golden Girls had a yard sale. There was also a broken big-screen tv from 1996 sitting in the dining area. \n\nI feel sorry for the owner. He seemed very delusional and desperate. I hope for his sake the place closes soon.
