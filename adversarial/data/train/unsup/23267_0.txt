This place is dangerously close to my gym- as in, I may need to go to hypnosis to forget this place exists otherwise I may be in for some weight gain stopping by after my work out.\n\nAll jokes aside, the beef they're known for has been my least-favorite menu item: regular beef, wet, hot and sweet, with provolone, was dryer than expected (both meat and lack of gravy) and provolone was tasteless and minimal, as to render it practically nonexistent. Sweet peppers were good though, and meat\/bread were of good quality. Overall just more miss than hit.\n\nPolish style Chicago dog was a score: thick and juicy, topped just right, but bun fell apart halfway through, which sucks. Bit too wet here with sauces, as opposed to the sandwich having too little moisture. Would get this again, or try their chili dog.\n\nSpeaking of chili, I have strong feelings about chili and usually prefer that it be made WITH beans. The one here is without, and on fries with cheese it is amazing. Ultimate fat girl food. The small is enough to share, I enjoy them too much to try the buffalo bleu fries though they sound awesome too.\n\nCan't wait for the fall weather to get here, as soon as temps go down I'll be back for the full tamale boat with chili and onions. Service was adequate- not much personality but efficient and relatively quick. DÃ©cor is Chicago pride, as you'd expect, done without being gaudy.
