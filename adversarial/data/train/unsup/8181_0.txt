Do not park in the lot next to the suites even if you are guest!  Security guard LaRosa will take your room key and throw it in your face and tell you \"to get the fuck out of here\"... and then get in your face.  Can't make this shit up folks... true story.  Soooooooo disappointed, cannot believe this is what customer service in Vegas has come to... berating and harassing paying guests! smh
