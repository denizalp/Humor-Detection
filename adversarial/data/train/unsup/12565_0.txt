So torn about the stars. First I called on the phone to order the Mother's Day Special Dipped Strawberries. Awesome deal, and the lady on the phone was SO helpful. She really made it easy. I had to pick them up Thursday as I won't be able to drive for a few days, and she got the order placed and ready for me to pick up in under 24 hours!\n These Strawberries are gorgeous! As she suggested I got half Milk Chocolate and half White Chocolate. They had sprinkles on the white ones and stripes on the milk chocolate. They were visually stunning, and the size of my fist.\n However, when I went it to pick them up the counter person wasn't friendly, and didn't answer a couple questions. I saw they had Macarones, my obsession, and wanted to know how much they were. She ignored it, and I asked again, she looked at another employee and started talking to them.  :(\n I picked up treats for my kids and I while I was there. I swear the Canollis I saw in the case were triple the size of the one I got out when I got home. It's wasn't spectacular, just ok. My daughter LOVED her Tiramisu, and my son said the Black and White cookie was wonderful.\n Did you know Freeds sells pieces of wedding cake? Any day you can walk in and get wedding cake! Why is this not trumpeted from the rooftops? I know we'll be going back for some.\n The two lovely ladies that got strawberries said they were delectable, and the presentation was mentioned by both as well.\n All in all it would have been 5 stars, but I can't overlook the attitude of the worker, and the bair and switch of my canolli. (I love that sentence, LOL)\n Locals remember they moved, they aren't on Eastern by UNLV anymore but in Henderson on Eastern. Not a problem as long as you are aware.\n(I'm changing my 3 stars to 4, in hopes that the one attitude was a fluke, I'll update it later if I need to. when I go back for wedding cake.)
