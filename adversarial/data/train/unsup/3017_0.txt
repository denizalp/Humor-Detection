Stopped by last night after the First Friday UYE with the Yelp-izzles.\n\nI ordered a Watermelon Cooler, Wasabi Peas, and Cashews. Everything was good.\n\nWe all stopped ordering drinks after the first round because we wanted to go eat. It took us a while to decide and I think our server was getting a little mad that we were not ordering drinks. She must have asked us 20 times in 30 mins if we needed more drinks.
