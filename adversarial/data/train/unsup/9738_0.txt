I never really felt like I \"went to Ryerson\", even though I was there for two years. \n\nI did the two year 'fast track' journalism program for uni grads. 100% of my classes were in the Rogers building. I had no electives. Saw the same 30 people day in and day out. \n\nI never went to Salad King. I never bought a hot dog from 'that guy'. I didn't use my gym membership. I don't think I ever even set foot in the library or bookstore once. I didn't live in residence or near the campus - honestly, that Neil Wycik building is among the most disgusting, unkempt buildings I've ever set foot in and I daren't imagine what it would be like to live there long term.\n\nI just walked into that building on the corner of Church & Gould, attended class and went home. Everyone in my class hung out in that building too, so there was no reason to ever go to the other buildings. So as a result I didn't get the full experience of meeting other students or exploring the campus. Because it was journalism and pretty hands-on, most of our projects were offsite so we were away a lot of the time, too. \n\nSome of my profs were excellent and put the \"University\" in \"Ryerson University\" (Ivor Shapiro, Bill Reynolds) while others would remind you of the old \"Polytechnic\" days, if you know what I mean. I'll remember the lessons that the former group taught me forever - in fact, I still refer to some of their class notes!\n\nWhen I did my degree tuition was $5000\/year. Hopefully it's not much more than that now?
