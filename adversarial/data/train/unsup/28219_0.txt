I love getting massages at Sol Escape! I recommend Hannah and Liz, but I am sure that anyone there would be great. What's awesome about Sol Escape is that they have massage therapists on staff 7 days a week and they offer evening times, too. It's very easy to book appointments online. The place is very clean and they even have table warmers for winter massages. \n\nAsk about the package deal--if you pay for a 5-visit punch card, it ends up being a bit cheaper.
