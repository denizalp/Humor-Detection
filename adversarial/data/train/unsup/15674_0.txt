I enjoy this place and told many people about it, so when the managers from our Corporate Office came to AZ, i decided to take them there.\nThe food was good as always, but the service...man, the service was terrible.\nThe waitress did not want to bec there at all.  She was unenthusiastic and just went through the motions. When i told her our burner was mal functioning,  she was rude and said that's how it is. She leaned over my colleagues and dropped water on her when serving my other colleague.  I had to call her 3 times to take empty plates and glasses away.\n\nI never felt so embarrassed!!\n\nWhen dinner was over, i asked for the manager. SHE WAS THE MANAGER!!\n\nIt was the first time i had to complain aboit someone s attitude to themselves. \n\nUnacceptable.  \n\nI am not sure if I will ever come back,  but if i do, i will certainly not invite other people.
