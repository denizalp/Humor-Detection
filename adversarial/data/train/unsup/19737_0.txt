We chose to stay at PH because we were attending an event Friday night at the Axis downstairs. Upon checking into our room on Thursday, we find out that the water would be shut off during the hours of 10:30am - 3:30pm on Friday, right at the time we would be getting ready for our show. We called downstairs and told them this would not work as we needed access to the shower and they pretty much said they could not give us any other room and to call the next day between 12pm and 2pm? How would that in any way help?! \n\nAfter charging exorbitant prices for our Thursday,  Friday and Saturday nights stay, they could not even convenience us with a room change? I highly doubt that every room was booked. This is terrible customer service on PH's part and I would NOT recommend staying here. \n\nWe should absolutely be getting compensated for Friday's stay, when the water was shut-off and we had no access to shower\/toilet\/sink. We were completely inconvenienced and had to go downstairs to the casino just to use the restroom because the toilet in our room wouldn't flush. An immediate room change should have been a PRIORITY for guests staying in rooms with water shut-off! RIDICULOUS.
