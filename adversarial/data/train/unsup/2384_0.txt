We stayed at the Encore on our recent trip to Vegas.  It is a very large hotel and I get overwhelmed in malls\/Ikeas easily so perhaps this wasn't the best choice for me.  \n\nBut anyway, when we checked in I mentioned it was my fiance's birthday.  The two women who checked us in (one was in training), Shaily and Ashley, sent up a box of chocolates later to say happy birthday! How nice is that!  \n\nThey offered us a room upgrade for $30 per night and we took it.  Our room was large and had a decent view (although not amaaaazing) so I am overall glad we went for it.  I also liked the features for turning on\/off the lights.  It made the hotel room feel very modern. \n\nThe gym is smaller than I expected it would be.  It is also a little confusing to find.  I got confused by the spa and how the outside of the gym looks a little too fancy to be the gym.  \n\nAlso, the Encore just feels like a hike from other things on the Strip.  I know it is all relative and it is really close but perhaps it was the cold weather that made me feel like a 4 yr old asking \"are we there yet?\"\n\nLast time we stayed at Treasure Island and I think overall that was a better experience.  I felt more comfortable given the size of TI v. Encore and I even liked the gym more.  I don't think we will stay at the Encore again.
