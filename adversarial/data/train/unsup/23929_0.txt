Ok now before you go thinking to yourself, \"hey Andy, you wear make up?\"\n\nNo I do not...at least in public...I came here with my wife...she loves Sephora in Time Square, so when she saw this, she nearly had a seizure on the cold Montreal sidewalk. We went in and did the usual Sephora split...she goes to see things for her face, and I go and check out the colognes.\n\nShe left with her usual items of mystery...things that I do not know how or where she uses them...but she was happy. I did not get anything, but I have to say , the place was immaculate, the staff was friendly and the prices were lower than NYC.
