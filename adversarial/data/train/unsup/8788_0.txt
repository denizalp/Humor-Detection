Super clean, friendly service, food is a little slow to come out -- but that's because it's all made from scratch -- and given the ingredients, that's a great thing.  \n\nTheir salpicon, chopped beef, radish, mint, onions, cilantro, lime, is fresh and fantastic.  \n\nTheir pasteles are large -- crispy -- either chicken or pork with curtido, they're terrific.  \n\nTheir pupusas are best well done -- but they don't quite get that instruction -- but then I don't speak spanish... but they're quite good -- I'm partial to the queso y loroco.  With the curtido and spicy sauce, mmmmmmgood.   Think Salvadoran version of grilled cheese & tomato soup (ok cold tomato soup), regardless, definitely comfort food.  \n\nToday, their mixto cocteles was mostly tomato -- los tacos and la palapa have better ones, but that's ok.  \n\nWe watched a young woman enjoying her sieptes mares -- and it looked truly spectacular.  \n\nAnd their flan, if you're not planning on dessert from Freed's next door, is truly transcendent.\n\nThis place is HUGE, great for groups, extremely inexpensive, fresh & fantastic, plus close to UNLV -- at Eastern @ Trop.
