I came here around afternoon to pick up three Square Pegs to go.\nI can't say much, since it's all already been said. Refer to other Yelpers. They do not lie and the rumours are true.\n\nAlso came for dinner, with a few friends, for my birthday.\nFabarnak rotates their menu (fairly) often, so it's always nice to have a fresh list of choices...and not get stuck in a rut. Luckily, too, all the choices are always delicious and wonderful.\n\nTHEY ALSO CHANGE THE UMBRELLAS! YES! I NOTICE THE UMBRELLAS!\n\nI'm not a foodie...but if I were, I'd be able to describe this place with mouth-watering succulent detail. As such, I can just urge you to come here yourself and experience the mouth-water with your own eyes...er, mouth.\n\nPS, service is a bit slow. The wait is worth it.
