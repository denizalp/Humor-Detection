My husband and I had a night out with friends. We decided on Red Ember base on the reviews!  We were not disappointed and so happy we took a chance to go to this new-to-us place. Our table ordered a variety:  various nigiri, fun rolls (Mexican and volcano), donburi, appies, and even tried the deep fried ice cream dessert!  All the food was fresh, delicious, and well presented. Service was good - never felt rushed. Great atmosphere and reasonably priced. Definitely will be back.
