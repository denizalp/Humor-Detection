What an awesome looking bar in Vegas.  Stopped by here after eating at an Asian restaurant around the area.  \n\nThe ambiance seemed fun and I love the dÃ©cor.  :) \n\nThe only negative I'd say is that it is heavily covered in smoke.  But hey, it's Vegas and there's no rules for limits for smokers out here.
