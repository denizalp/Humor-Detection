Service was okay, if a little annoying because our waiter was bring trained. The brunch menu is limited, and this place needs to give up on the small plate\/family style business. The trend is over, and it doesn't work with biscuits and gravy anyway. I had the brisket sandwich this time, which was drowned in an overly sweet bbq sauce. Stick with the fried chicken.
