Tom at Reality Flooring does not return phone calls.  i gave him $750.00 for half of the carpet and install price back in May and the carpet never came.  He used the excuse that he was in the hospital or sharing his other personal woes as the reason  for the delays. \n\nWe tried several times to get it installed and he always had an excuse, (Out of state, etc) and finally I just want my money back.  Once I asked for the $$ back he refuses to answer his phone or return messages.  This guys is very shady.\n\nTom called me back after I posted this review and asked me to remove it with the promise he would pay me back.  I asked for a payment plan and I would remove it once my deposit was returned and he has yet to follow thru with a plan for repayment.  i have called him several times and it goes straight to VM.  RUN from this contractor!
