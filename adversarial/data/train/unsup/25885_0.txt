Got married this weekend - and wanted to celebrate at The Salt Cellar on Saturday Night. \nI have been here several times, and the food is always great! \nWe made a reservation for 8:00 PM. \nService was great - they messed up my order, and was able to get the correct order in on-the-fly... the only part that sucked was that my husband had waited until my food came out because he didn't want to eat without me. So, he had to eat cold lobster. (I told him about 15 times to please eat. I would just pick off of his plate.)\nI felt horrible - it was an easy mistake by the server. \nWe did not give him a hard time, because he was very stressed out and felt awful about making a mistake.
