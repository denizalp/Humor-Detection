Maybe it's the lack of hair on chef Tom Colicchio's head that inspires him to dispense with the culinary smoke and mirrors and keep the cooking clean.  The thought behind Craftsteak's menu is so simple that every steakhouse in the country should be embarrassed not to have thought of it: quality meat, perfectly prepared.  But maybe that's the sign of great cooking -- so subtle, so simple that the taster delusionally believes anyone could cook it.\n\nWe had the filet mignon, dry aged t-bone and free range chicken.  Each dish was brilliant, filling, tasty--emphasizing the flavors of the meat.  Most people have never actually tasted the flavor of great meat, well prepared.  And Craftsteak is an excellent place to get an introduction to how amazing the flavor of well-prepared steak is on its own, without a sauce.  After you eat here, you will never try a lesser-quality steak house because they'll just seem like McDonalds with different flavoring.\n\nBut that's just the food.  The bar's whiskey menu is certainly worth mentioning as well with its well-stocked collection of Scotch, Irish whiskey, Bourbon and Canadian whiskey.  The night we were there, the bartender had a solid base of product knowledge and was able to expertly direct us around the whiskey menu.
