Holy greasy thai food Batman.  I get this stuff every time I'm in the area.\n\nI pregamed with their pad thai when I went to Freak Fest this past year.  We got take out, and food took longer than expected.  They seemed to be running out of supplies, but again Freak Fest was going on and Lady Gaga was sharing a drunken noodle with Kate Gosselin, Lady and the Tramp style.  My cousin, a Madison native, said she had never seen the place so busy.\n\nIt was delicious regardless of the festivities and the left overs were divine.\n\nSee you next time.
