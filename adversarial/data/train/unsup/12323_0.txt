Worst experience. I was so excited to go see what my baby looks like . I went at 28 weeks , they completely ruined what could have been a beautiful experience. My appointment was at 2:30 pm I called to let them know I was to be late by a minute or two due to traffic . When I arrived the 2 women who worked there the ultrasound tech and receptionist barely greeting me . I asked for the platinum package and they tried getting me to change it because they had schedule someone after me, which makes no sense . Pictures came out horrible the DVD was a complete waste. OUT OF FOCUS ,BLURRY you could barely make out the baby . Gave them 2nd chance. I went at 31 weeks . They messed up again I had the same ultrasound tech she doesn't know how to do her job! Again pictures are horrible . I seriously just threw it away such a waste and disappointment.
