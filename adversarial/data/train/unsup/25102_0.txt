Brought my son here while we were visiting Las Vegas for a family trip. This place was so much fun not only for my toddler but for my husband and I. \n\nWe had a great time and would love to come back and visit.\n\nP.s go when they first open. We had the entire place for ourselves for an hour before people started coming in.
