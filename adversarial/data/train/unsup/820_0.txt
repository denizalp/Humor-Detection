Forget the Strip.  If you want to see REAL Vegas...I'm talking flashing, neon lights and old school coin operated slot machines and some people livin' it UP...Fremont is the place to go.  I went there last night since it was a beautiful warm night and they had an 80s cover band playing, and it was magical.  Here's a list of things I did in 6 (count 'em - SIX) hours:\n\n- Elvis flying on the zipline\n- 80s cover band rocking out\n- George Eads shooting scenes for CSI (I'm about 98% sure it was him)\n- People having drunken debates about the existence of God (best quote ever, \"Excuse me, sir?  You dropped your soul.\")\n- An old man dressed as Santa Claus rocking out to a Whitesnake cover band (yes, this is June, people)\n- I took a picture with Tupac Shakur\n- Saw a pirate lady with enormous boobs...seriously, e-nor-mous\n- Lady with an alien type of baloon hat on pretending to be a bull and charging at a man dressed as Zorro\n- I went to the Golden Nugget and chilled in the Chart House lounge with some very refreshing summer drinks (read: mango mojito)\n- I saw my boss who was there with his frat buddies from college...and got him a tequila shot (that'll be awkward Monday)\n- My friend randomly ran into a girl she went to high school with in Wisconsin\n- We went to Drink and Drag and saw some pretty busted Drag Queens and some fat chicks bowling who thought it appropriate to undress down to their bras and undies\n- Went to the Glitter Gulch Strip Club and was hit on by two old men\n\nPheeeewwwww.  You tell me where else in the WORLD you can do all that?  The Strip ain't got nuthin on Fremont Street.
