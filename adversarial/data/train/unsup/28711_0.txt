There are other way better hot dog joints in town. I had the Coney Island and the casing of the hot dog was too hard for me to bite through. That led to a very messy lunch and I must have gone through 15 napkins. My friend and I also tried the cajun fries and there wasn't much cajun about them. They had little to no spice and to be honest, the experience was so underwhelming I think I'm done composing this review. On a positive note, they put a boatload of chili on that hot dog, so they don't skimp. But what's good about having a ton of food you don't truly enjoy?
