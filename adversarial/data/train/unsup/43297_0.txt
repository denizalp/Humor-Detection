Talk about a new flavorful experience this is the place to go! I love their margaritas I had two hot mango margaritas and my mom had a cucumber serrano which was a little too spicy but our waiter switched it out free of charge for a casa margarita and then she had a cucumber serrano one without the chillies which she loved! We enjoyed them thoroughly! The food was excellent as well I ordered the roasted pork tacos which had amazing flavors in the pineapple avocado sauce that came with them. My mom ordered the grilled fish tacos which were really juicy and had great flavors as well. Even though it was really hot we sat outside and they had misters that kept it feeling like a cool breeze. The ambiance was really fun with the lighting and the service was amazing as mentioned before my mom did not like her drink and he replaced it with something new free of charge! Definitely recommend coming here for a new twist on tasty tacos!
