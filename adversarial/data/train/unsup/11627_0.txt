I have driven past Blue Fin many times and never realizing it.  We finally, after hearing great things, decided to give it a try.  So, we met a couple of friends for dinner and grabbed a table.  I like the feel of Blue Fin as you walk in.  We were in the first section, not near the bar.  So, we didn't have the bar experience, which I have grown accustomed to.  But, the service was quick and friendly.  I like the menu a lot, and was able to get out of my comfort zone a bit.  I am still a sushi rookie, but I kind of know what I am looking for in a good roll.\n\nThe first thing we ordered was the poke.  I had a couple of pieces but, it's not my thing.  Everyone else at the table loved it.  Anyhow, we started to order rolls after rolls.  Now, I don't know the names, but know that they were good.  Screaming O's, spicy tuna, and a roll that I will probably crave for a while now, that had guacamole.  It seemed every roll came out looking amazing and tasting even better.  \n\nWe also had an interesting experience, and no fault at all to Blue Fin, a customer must have had a little too much Sake and was puking her guts up in the bathroom.  But, as soon as she was finished the staff went in quickly to clean up and sanitize everything.\n\nSo, I'm sure we will definitely be back.  Great location, prices, sushi and service.
