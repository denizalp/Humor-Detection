My boyfriend is the mother-fucking best for the sole reason that he brought me here. Vegan donuts! What more could a girl want?\n\nWith the exception of a few trays on the bottom shelf, everything is vegan - including the donut I most craved, a cream-filled donut with chocolate icing. Absolutely delicious and about $1. In total my boyfriend and I got three donuts and an apple juice for around $5. Definitely a good deal, and you couldn't even tell they weren't made with animal by-products. Who needs them when they are that mouth-wateringly sweet and tasty? This place deserves an A+ for creativity and cruelty-free treats to die for.
