You would have to also hate puppies and Jesus if you decided that See's candy was teh suck.  The women tending the chocolate bar are like grandmotherly versions of Oopma-Loompas, bewitching your chocolate, pecan, nougat, peanut brittle, caramel, and fondant fantasies.  Oh, and they provide a free sample and a discount on purchases (a substantial percentage) if you are on their list of businesses that qualify.  I was stoked to find that my job was worth discounted chocolate.
