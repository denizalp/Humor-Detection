Been to this place a few times now, and it's overall pretty good. There's not many of these kids of brunchy places up here in Markham so I'm glad I found it!! Food tastes great, portions are HUUUGE and service is friendly. However, not the best idea to go in the summer because there's no air conditioning. It get EXTREMELY hot and unpleasant to eat:( Also, not the best idea to go if you are IN A RUSH!! Food kind of takes forever...even when it doesn't look busy in there. But overall, I like the place and would definitely go back!!:)
