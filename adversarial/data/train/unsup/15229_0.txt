Hands down, one of the best Italian meals I've had outside of the kitchen of a family member. If they have it, get the fettucini with funghi porcini, or any fettucini dish, as Emma makes this stuff in-house. It's the most fantastic fresh pasta ever. \n\nThey start you off with a fresh slice of bruschetta drenched in olive oil. The service is excellent - our waiter was incredibly attentive and helpful all night, and even gave us some suggestions of where to visit after dinner. \n\nIt's not going to be a cheap meal, but your money couldn't be better spent! It was a nice night when we went, so we ate outside, but the inside of the restaurant is really nice, so if you're only going to eat there once, I'd recommend eating indoors.
