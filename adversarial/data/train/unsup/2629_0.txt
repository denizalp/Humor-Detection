I was in town for the iQmetrix Retailer Summit and decided to grab a quick bite at the Well & Being. I had the Roasted Red Beet Salad which was described as \"Seasonal apples, frise'e, and a flax seed vinaigrette\" and my colleague had the Curry Yogurt Chicken Breast Lettuce Wraps described as \"Raisins, green apples, butter lettuce, Israeli couscous, and a tomato-cucumber salad.\"\n\nFirst, I had to ask what Frise'e is. Apparently it's a really frizzy (hence the name?) green. Once I saw it I remember eating this before in other salads.\n\nThe salad itself was a real let down. The frise'e is really bitter, as was the apple. The Roasted Red Beet (that headlined the salad 's name) was minimally proportioned and a welcome break between the bitter bites.\n\nThe salad really needed something acidic, I squoze the orange from my drink into it. It just wasn' t enough. It could be vastly improved with a mix of greens (add some Butter Lettuce, and perhaps some sliced tomato?) and please add some more beets or change the name!\n\nMy colleague said the tomato-cucumber salad was, \"slimey.\"
