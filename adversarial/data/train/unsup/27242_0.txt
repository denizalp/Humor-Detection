Good, interesting food.\nI go here pretty regularly and mostly have the same dish or variations on it, so I'm not really going to be able to comment on the overall menu (sorry). I can't say much about how Green Pepper compares to other Korean restaurants, especially those that may be located in Pittsburgh because this is the only Korean restaurant I've ever patronized.\n\nI find the wait staff to be very friendly, especially once you go a few times and they recognize you as a regular. They are very amendable to special requests.\n\nThe dish I usually order is the \"Spicy Chicken Meal Set\" which never disappoints me. It comes in a rectangular serving tray with compartments. It's very cool looking. \n\nThey serve these delicous, clear noodles called, I think, (and spelled phonetically) \"Chock-chay.\" These are wonderful. I would just order these, if I could. \n\nI can't say that I've ever had a bad meal. The kimchee is always very flavorful and the vegetables are always fresh. Sometimes they serve a tasty kind of pancake and other times, it's tofu. The chicken is sometimes more spicy than others, but I have always enjoyed it.\n\nThere may be other, \"better\" Korean restaurants but for Pittsburgh, I think this place is \nworth a visit and I'm glad I found it.
