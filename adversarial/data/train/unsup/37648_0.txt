Great BBQ and a pleasant setting for date night with the Mrs. I'd recommend the four meat combo for two. Just enough to share and walk away without waddling. As in other reviews, the pulled pork is outstanding. Next time, we are doubling up the pulled pork, getting the jalape√±o sausage, and trying something new. Potentially doubling up on the tater tots as the two sides as well. Awesome
