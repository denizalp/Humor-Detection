While waiting to get our oil changed at Firestone we were starving, so we decided to walk across the street to get Panda Express.\n\nWhen we walked in we were excited to see all of their options and since this was my first time dining in a Panda Express, I had no idea what to expect.\n\nThe quality was average fast food Chinese but it was great that the food was hot and ready. The price was decent, the quantity was large, and overall we enjoyed sitting outside while eating our lunch.
