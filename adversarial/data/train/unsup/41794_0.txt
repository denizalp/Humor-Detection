What an interesting selection of chocolate covered strawberries! I love the variety of chocolates and sprinkles that they have on their large chocolate covered strawberries.  YUM!\n\nSo after having a few of these yummy strawberries I had to stop by the actual store on the strip. It was REALLY crowded.  The only thing that I was craving was ice cream and they had gelato.  While the mango gelato was very good, they didn't have many fruit flavors but they had quite a few cookie and candy flavors. \n\nI'm sure this is a tourist trap and the prices for candy is outrageous.  But then again, isn't that the theme on the strip?
