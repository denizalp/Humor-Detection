Ok, I loved this place.  It's probably not for everyone, but if you are even slightly a marvel and\/or Avengers fan, you will probably enjoy yourself at this exhibit.  Sure, some of it is a little corny, but just checking out the items in this place as if you are at a real museum is very entertaining.  You can save some money by downloading the app on your smartphone instead of renting their equipment.  Make sure to bring your headphones too.  I seemed to be the only one that was doing the activities on my phone while the rest of the family kept walking around and taking pictures of all of the different items in each room.  I almost got a perfect score, but missed a couple items.  Not sure if that means anything in the end, but it's great bragging rights.  \n\nMaybe you will be worthy of picking up the Mjolnir!  Or not.  Either way, check this place out.  It's not too expensive ($33 plus service charge), is air conditioned, and is a pretty neat place to spend some time with the kids if you run out of things to do.  \n\nCheck in on Yelp - You're welcome!
