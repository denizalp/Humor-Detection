Is there anything better than finding a friendly and affordable Dr?  Especially when it comes to my French Bull Dog Bosko. He's a bit of a sketchball and get scared very easy. But he seems to actually enjoy going to the vet. They are so sweet and loving when they see him and handle him. That is not the only reason I love this place though. They are affordable, they are honest, they give you many options and they don't haggle you or BS you. They have told me before \"Well you could buy this from us for $$$ or you can just go across the street to Fry's and get the same thing for $. Its up to you, I recommend you just go to Fry's.\" They have given me that advice multiple times. They even call you the next day to make sure your loved fur baby is doing well. WHO DOES THAT!? I recently signed up for their vaccine deal. It's $100 for your first visit. It will cover my dogs Vaccines for life. Every year I will bring him in and get his Vaccines and it wont cost me anything extra for the rest of his life. I would say that is a darn good deal. I recommend this Veterinarian to all my friends and will continue to do so.
