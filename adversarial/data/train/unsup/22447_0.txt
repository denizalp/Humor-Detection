I visited Sushi Tei last Friday night and thought the atmosphere is nice, the service is okay, but the food wasn't as great as I had hoped. (We come here maybe once a year...and now I remember why.)\n\nWe ordered a kimchi with pork belly dinner and chirashi sushi. The kimchi with pork belly dinner came in less than 5 minutes. It was a busy Friday night -- I figured they had probably pre-cooked the pork belly, so all they had to do after we placed the order was to stir fry it a bit more with some kimchi... But there was really no sign of pork \"belly\" and I could count with my fingers the number of slices of pork that went into the dish. I was unimpressed...\n\nThe presentation of the chirashi sushi is nice and I liked the touch of sesame, seaweed and tobiko on the sushi rice. However, the fish did not taste very fresh. For the price I had paid, I immediately thought of the fish I had at Fune in Toronto. Fune is ever so slightly more expensive, but the fish was a lot more fresh and the slices were thick. It's unfortunate that we don't have very many choices in the area, unless you're willing to drive all the way to downtown or uptown for fresh sushi if you're looking for a non-AYCE restaurant.\n\nThe complimentary soup, salad and ice cream is not bad...but that's not enough to bring me back here again.
