Awesome happy hour and we came on a taco Tuesday. $2 street tacos and big margaritas with a corona sticking out is a great way to enjoy a night in Tempe! The atmosphere was great, the weather was nice and the food was great. Not sure what else we could ask for!\n\nAs a tip make sure to try each of the different tacos as they all had a unique flavor.
