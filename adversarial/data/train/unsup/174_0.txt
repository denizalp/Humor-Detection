Please note!  This restaurant isn't the Chingu BBQ at West Beaver Creek - from what I've been told they are the same owners though - thanks Jenny!  This place has no real table top BBQ for those who are looking for that and come to this place.   They are in the place that Solo Maria used to be. \nNow to the review.  3.5 Stars - extra half because it is new and they need time to make adjustments. \nThe meal here is not stellar, but more of the same that has been popping up all along Yonge Street.  We had the SoonDuBu, GamJaTang, and Chicken Katsu.  The Katsu was a little thicker than I liked it to be and was a little over fried.  The SoonDuBu was the seafood variety and it would have been good if the seafood was not tiny morsels.  The GamJaTang was pretty standard fair - tasted like the one from the Owl of Minerva.  There was a good portion of pork in the meal and plenty of soup.  It was also served really HOT!  So hot that I am now writing this review with blisters.  Ugh.  The GamJaTang was $7 for their grand opening.\nI like the word \"Grand Opening\" but their was nothing grand about it here.  The place lacks life in the decor - stark white walls, and the service - needs a caffeine boost!?!\nIs it a return visit place?  With plenty of parking and not having to wait for 30 minutes at ChoSunOk - our main go to place, it would be a yes.  I'm also always a sucker for giving new places a try or two or three.  Let's see how it goes.\nCheers!
