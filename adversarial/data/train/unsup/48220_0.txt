Been back twice in two weeks! Amazing local find with gourmet food, terrific service, and great prices. Chef Rudy and the staff, are so friendly. A must try, the lamb chop appetizer! The breadsticks are the best, with the balsamic reduction and olive oil. The Seafood Mediterranean pasta dish is huge and so flavorful. The salmon sandwich was cooked to perfection... crispy on outside and so moist inside. We just went back yesterday for the #VEGASSTRONG fundraiser. Well, the Chicken Parmesan was out-of-this-world... so moist, with just a hint of breading. We feel that we have our on personal chef cooking for us when we eat here. Ask for Rose when you go or Roger. Already booked my birthday party for Dec. Also, Friday and Saturday dinner they have Prime Rib... will check that out soon.
