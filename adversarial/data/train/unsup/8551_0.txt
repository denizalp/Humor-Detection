Wow so the wait at this place 30 minutes before closing was 40 minutes! That just screams \"GOOD FOOD HERE!\" Luckily, the bar was wide open so we sat ourselves down and went to town on some good drinks and food!\n\nThe bartender\/server was AWESOME! She knew her drinks AND knew all the Thai terminology! Ordering was such a breeze with her!\n\nThe nitty gritty:\n\n- My Thai: This was so good!! You definitely have to try this, they do a lot of yum Thai twists on classic drinks!\n\n- Tamarind Margarita: Yo.. this drink was fire too!! I would have never thought to add tamarind to a margarita but this worked out SO WELL!!!\n\n- Spicy Basil Chicken (5 spicy) with Sticky Rice: OMG this had so much flavor!! One of the best I've ever had! It wasn't as spicy as I wanted it to be, but they're more than happy to bring you Thai chilies in fish sauce. And the portion was so big! I ate less than 1\/4 with my side of sticky rice and was stuffed!\n\n- Spicy Shrimp Fried Rice: I'm not a fan of raw veggies in my fries rice and this had so much cucumber\/tomato mixture in it! The flavor of the rice was good but I'd probs have to order it without all that extra ish in it. Blehhhh\n\n- Garlic Fried Rice: The guy in our group eats fries rice like me. Plain, with no veggies LOLOLL. I didn't try this, but it smelled SO DELICIOUS when she set it on the table. I seriously just wanted to go to his plate and lick some off!\n\nI would defs come back again after a ratchet night on the strip! Or maybe you should get ratchet with me and we can go together!
