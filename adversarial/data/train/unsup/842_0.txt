I stay at hotels all over the US. I feel like customer service is always a must . Guests should be acknowledged at all times when present. It was clear that most of the staff didn't like their job or lacked guest service skills. Then to blatantly lie that they were sold out but yet I could make a reservation for rooms. I would not stay at this location even for the convenience to downtown. Rooms weren't bad but service was poor. You had to speak to the staff first to get a good morning or afternoon when passing in the hallways.
