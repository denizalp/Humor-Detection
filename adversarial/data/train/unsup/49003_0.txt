This place is a great place for breakfast but my lunch meal was just ok. I got the gyro and it was overwhelmed with sauce and too many onions as well. No lettuce at all with my gyro. Also the guy seating people was rude. The place was only 1\/3 full and I didn't want to sit at the bar but wanted a Booth and he became very snotty. The waiter I had was very nice. All in all its a must for breakfast in Vegas!
