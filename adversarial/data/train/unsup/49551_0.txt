After a few weeks of seeing the tastey n beautiful pics on Instagram my family and I finally made time to go n check this place out. Upon walkin in, there were not as many people or as busy as I expected on a warm Saturday afternoon. My family and I excitedly looked over the menu and after a few minutes of trying to decide what each of us wanted to try, it was out turn to order. We placed an order and COULDN'T wait to try it All!!! There were a total of 5 drinks and 3 food items. A few minutes go by and our # is called, only to find out that it was 2 of our food orders and that was IT. Another 5 minutes go by and ONLY 1 of our drinks is ready and my family ordered 5. After a total of 17 minutes of waiting for our order to be completed it sat on the counter for a bit and my order # was not called like the past 2 times. I then asked if i could take my order or if i has to wait for my order # to be yelled out. At that point i asked about my 3rd food item and it turns out that the order was NEVER imputed into the system. Their process is EXTREMELY unorganized and slow for having at least 15 employees on a not so busy afternoon. My family and i will NEVER go back and DON'T recommend u go. The food and drinks are mediocre at best. And nevermind that some items that are on the menu are NOT available.
