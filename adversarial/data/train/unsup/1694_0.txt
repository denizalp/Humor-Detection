I love buffets, and I was excited for this one, but it was crap.\n\nCons\n-They don't have the bbq wings they're currently advertising, which was the whole reason we went there. We went during dinner hours, when the website says they have them, but they didn't. I asked if they were going to bring them out, and they said no.\n\n-Girlfriend tried getting a well-done steak. The guy kept telling her to come back in 5 more minutes, which she did 5 times before we left without ever getting it.\n\n-We had to wait in line for an hour and 20 minutes.\n\n-The food was a slight step up from Hometown Buffet, but there wasn't much that you couldn't buy out of a box at Walmart.\n\n-Total cost for both of us was $30 (2 buffets + 1 drink + tax) We should have just gone to Wingstop, where $30 would have bought us more than all we could eat, plus sides and dessert. \n\nPros\n-If you like steak (but not well-done) you might be able to get your money's worth here.
