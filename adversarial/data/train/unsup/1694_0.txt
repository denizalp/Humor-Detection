What's not to love!  The best rooftop in the Burgh with a retractable roof!  Great selection of drafts beers and attentive servers.\nIt's a little odd that you are limited in menu selections based on where you sit, and they do not take reservations, which is a bummer.  The meatballs and sides are absolutely delicious and it's worth the wait!  \nI would recommend going on a Sunday.  It's still full and fun but not as crowded and overwhelming.
