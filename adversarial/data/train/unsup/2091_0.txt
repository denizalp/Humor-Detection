Can I review some of the people who go here? Because I know one idiot who would get 1 star.  (But the park still gets a 5)\n\nOne dude let his dog pee on me! And the little bugger was fast! He'd prance toward you, and before you knew it, his leg was up and piss was streaming out of his winky cannon! \n\nMy friend was tinkled on multiple times; she wasn't able to jump out of the way very quickly since she was pregnant. Did the man say anything? Only that his dog was only nervous. Are you kidding me?\n\nAlright, I got your number. In return, we very actively encouraged our Australian Shepherd to play with the little terrier. Why? Because the Aussie Shep becomes a drool monster at the dog park, and the little pissing terrier (who only likes to pee on people, not trees or anywhere else in the park) ended up DRIPPING the Aussie Shep's saliva. Sweet! (that was the only time we didn't feel guilty about her saliva marking other dogs).
