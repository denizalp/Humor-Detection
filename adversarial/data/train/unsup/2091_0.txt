My yelp ethics compel me to begrudgingly write this review because if too many people find out about this place, I'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nJust a great atmosphere, replacing my previous front-runner, Dark Horse expresso, for best coffee\/work place. Individual or communal seating. Great large lattes served in tall glasses. An excellent selection of crisp and unique sandwiches. Old white cheddar, avocado, bacon served on a toasted raisin bread....yum. \n\nA great playlist manned by a quirky, energetic, entertaining staff. \n\nPlease limit your visit to 15minutes so that I don't have to wait.
