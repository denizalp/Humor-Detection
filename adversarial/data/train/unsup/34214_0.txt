This place is depressing and dark, straight out of the 80s.  The only good stores for an adult  are Dillards, Aveda, Victoria Secret.  They have a Macys and Express, but they dont have good merchandise.  The rest of stores seem to be for teenagers and there are some weird ghetto stores.  I do like the Chompies restarant.  For the location I would have expected a decent mall. Oh and watch out for the train that goes through the mall!
