Out of my five experiences here, two have been under par.  \n\nThe last time I was here, the barista made my \"soy hot cocoa no whip\" WITH whipped cream.  She called me up and told me she made it wrong.  Then she asked me if I was allergic.  I answered that I will get sick from the milk.  She asked me again \"Yeah, but are you allergic?\"  I answered her no, but I will get sick.  She sighed, said she would remake it and then gave me the new drink within a few seconds.  I ended up with a stomachache about twenty minutes after drinking my drink.  I can only assume she did not remake it, but who knows for sure.\n\nAs an aside, I ordered a blueberry muffin - it was not that good.  There were not many berries and it was far too sweet.  They didn't have any plastic utensils visible for me to eat it with, so I had to hand split it.  That's just a minor point, but still.\n\nThe previous time, I was double charged for my Starbucks Via pack that I bought in the drive thru.  I didn't realize it because it was on my Starbucks card and I was not provided with a receipt.  I had to go back the next day to get refunded.  The nice thing was that I was comped my beverage that day after I got my refund.\n\nI am not a huge fan of Starbucks, but I do love their hot cocoa and their green tea lemonade (no added syrup).  I will come back (not necessarily to this location), but now that I no longer have any money on my Starbucks card... it will be less frequent.  I much prefer drinking out of real mugs versus paper anyhow.
