\"This world needs a new plague\" - Dwight K. Schrutte\n\n\nThat's how I felt after my last trip to Mario's. Perhaps it was because I was the only sober person on Carson Street at 1 am on Halloween but I have never been angrier at a bar ever. To start the doorman was an ass. I can't blame him all that much because I would be pissed too with the amount of \"21\" year old asshats coming through the doors but at least TRY to maintain some professionalism. Same with the bartenders. Ok I get it you are busy. But you are going to make a grand tonight so suck it up cupcake. Also use you head. Don't spend so much time on the drunk sluts who order 10 drinks one at a time and don't tip. My biggest complaint however was the clientele. So many assholes that for the first time I honestly hoped a place would spontaneously combust with everyone inside just for the good of humanity. I wish I could say that this was unusual but this seems to be the same story song and dance every weekend at Mario's. \n\nYou may ask why this review is getting a 2 star. I must grudgingly say that Mario's does have some redeeming qualities, just earlier in the day. The decor is almost \"Cheers\"-like. Lots of wood and stained glass. The service, when the bar is about empty, has always been at least pleasant. The food is ok too. Nothing great; standard greasy bar food. \n\nAll in all this place is a passable bar prior to about 10 pm. Otherwise avoid Mario's like it was giving out free Ebola injections with every admittance.
