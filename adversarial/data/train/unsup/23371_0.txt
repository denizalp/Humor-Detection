Whatever you do, do not ask to substitute a pancake for the biscuit when you order the chicken fried steak. I did, and it seemed to put the waitress into high-speed wobble's. At first she said they couldn't do it, then she said they could but there would be an up charge. I agreed to the up charge and then she asked me if I still wanted the biscuit. I said \"sure\" at which point she said they really couldn't do it because the pancake would have to go under the meat. What??? Apparently this is the first somebody has asked for a substitution.\n\nThe chicken fried steak itself was about middle of the road compared to others that I've had. The eggs and the fried potatoes were on par, but I was a little put off by the biscuit and gravy underneath the CFS. I ordered iced tea to drink. The waitress never came back to offer a refill. The layout was the same as the other Lodge location I have been to, whereas the dining area is surrounded by glass looking into the bar area. \n\nIt was an OK experience, but with so many other places in the area I don't think I would make a special trip to go back.
