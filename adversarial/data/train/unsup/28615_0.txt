In a city chock-full of Vietnamese restaurants, this was a great find. Slight in appearance & unassuming, we weren't sure if we ordered at the counter or there was waiter service (it was the latter). But Oxtail certainly delivers on the food! Great spring rolls, wonderful chicken with basil, tasty pad thai, all fresh and served by a very friendly, polite staff. We had a lovely experience and will certainly return.
