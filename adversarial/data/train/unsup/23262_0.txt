This is my most favoritest breakfast joint EVER! I used to live in the area and come by at least once a week. Now that I moved for a job (nurse probs) I am not as close but still try to come as often as I can. Everything that I've had here has been literally mind blowing good! I love their Eggs Benedict Wildberry Bliss Crepes, and Popeye Scrambler! And here's another tip, ask for protein pancakes and get ready for your life to change forever! Everything here is good, from the coffee, fresh squeezed juice, and the service. \n\nService here has consistently been five stars for me. I've always had great, quick, friendly servers who get the order correct the first time and always anticipate everything we're going to need. They offer all kinds of sauces, Tabasco, syrup for the pancakes everything you could possibly need! Did I mention the food comes out so fast! So if you have a slow friend it's OK to let them order after you because their food will be out just as fast lol! I've even noticed the quality of the bussers. They're always coming by to clear unused plates and make room for you on the table and are also very friendly. I consistently hear other patrons asking to speak to the manager-normally this would be a scary thing for a server but every time the customer comments on how good of an experience they had and I 100% agree. This will be my breakfast spot for life!
