This is one of my favorite bars on Mill. The blue-lit basement atmosphere is really fun and the music is awesome! I love the dueling pianos--the musicians are really talented and will play any song you suggest (you can grab a mic and sing along, or just let the pros do their thing). Most the songs are sing-along hits from the 60s through early 2000s.\n\nLast night they had a great deal for $7 AMF buckets. Their other drinks are also good but can get a little bit pricey. \n\nIt's a great place to stop in if you're drinking your way through Mill at night. It offers something a little fresh, fun and dialed back.
