The parking lot at this local strip joint is always full, but the inside is never packed. The best time to come is during happy Hour where all drinks are half off ($3.50 beer) from 7am to 7pm. No cover charge and usually a nice bartender on hand as well. Yes the attractiveness of the women are not Rhino quality, but lately the crop of talent has been quite good. IT's been around for years and is one of only two or three strip joints where you can gamble. Most of the time, the girls aren't hovering around you like the Big Boys, but you can actually have a conversation and not be pressured to purchase a $20 dance (most of the time). The kitchen closed a few years ago and the Monday Night Football buffet usually leaves a bit to be desired, but overall this is a solid local strip joint with friendly dancers and a cool attitude and vibe to match. Last night there were about six or seven dancers and several of them had some crazy great moves on the pole and others had great moves in general. With the NBA finals on the TV or other sports , SAm's is always worthy of a visit at any time of the year.
