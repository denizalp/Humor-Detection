Had the opportunity to check this place out with the Las Vegas Pizza Posse tonight and they definitely get five stars. For me a big part of the experience is the service, and Candace definitely took good care of us. The pizza itself was really good. The owner told me they have the dough delivered in from the east coast several times a week and you could definitely taste the quality in the crust. The pizza had a thin layer of sauce so that you could taste the sauce but it didn't overpower the toppings which I have to say were in ample supply. And the white pie was served up as a white pie should be, with dollops of ricotta scattered around the pie, very tasty. I can honestly say that no piece of pizza was left behind. If you're over near Boca Park and looking for some really good pizza you should check this place out, I doubt you'll be disappointed.
