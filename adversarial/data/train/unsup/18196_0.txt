Yummy boba tea!! Thanks to IG I had seen some really pretty drinks from here. Pretty drinks draw me in, LOL. So I bookmarked it and tada!!\n\nThe place is very white and bright so it was very welcoming and inviting! I was greeted by both workers and given sometime to look over the menu. The menu on the wall had some really good looking pictures. So I found myself having a hard time picking one drink. \n\nI went with the Rose garden drink with lychee jelly and boba. They offering many different types of toppings and if you are unsure what you want, they let you sample it, so go to town with the tastings! The drink was so refreshing and light. I loved it!! \n\nThe offer a rewards program so sign up, I got an offer for a buy one get one drink.
