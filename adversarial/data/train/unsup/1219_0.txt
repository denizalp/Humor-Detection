This is one hopping spot! It isn't your quiet brunch but rather a very dynamic place for millenials to dine and wine.  Music is extremely loud while everybody is having a blast.  We've eaten here twice.  Each time has been enjoyable, food is really excellent, fresh and well prepared. Service is quick, friendly and our plates were ready in minutes.  Veggie taco with grilled pineapple is super good, fries are thinly cut and crispy.
