I've been coming here for almost 10 years now and it's always been ran by the same few people not sure if they are the owners or what. This place has SOOOOOO much potential if only the right people came in and renovated the place. it's a shame to see what it has become. I remember when the replica outfield had graphics of Mark Maguire and other pro players. Now it's nothing more than a rusted half torn down wall. The cages are cool sometimes they throw at your head but I prefer that because it keeps you on your toes to better simulate a real game environment haha. All in all don't come here expecting anything special. Hopefully someday they will remodel the sports center.
