We tried the seven courses tasting menu here on our anniversary day and were very disappointed. The first three dishes were almost made with the same thing and tasted very plain. Main dish was fried chicken and neither juicy nor tasty at all! Bread were burnt too much. The only thing we like is just the chocolate cake dessert but nothing special. Not worth for the price! Won't come back for sure
