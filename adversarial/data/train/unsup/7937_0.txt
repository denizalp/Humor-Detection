Zagat put the Burger's Priest on the top three Toronto food joints, but-----I was not blown away. I waited, and waited, chewing and savoring every bite of my lukewarm burger. This classic Armenian joint, I mean,  American burger joint, is in fact tiny and a definite grab-and-go kind of place. The wait time is not what bothered me actually. Thankfully, I decided to come on a Wednesday night, and even had the chance to sneak in inside and not wait in the cold. \n\nWhile I could hear people behind me chattering and hyping up the \"secret menu,\" I was greeted by Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian upfront. Leopard wedges are not appropriate work attire, however, very cute. If you don't' like showering twice a day, this place is not for you. \n\nAfter getting our greasy bundle of joy, we ran back to our car which was literally four steps away. The fries were definitely a good portion. More than a good portion. I actually really enjoyed these fries, they were not soggy but crunchy.  The burger on the other hand--lukewarm. I will agree that the quality of the meat is there. This is not your ordinary McDonald's pattie, but it did not transport me to nirvana. It was a good burger, but not a MIND BLOWING burger. It is not a gourmet burger. I don't get the hype. \n\nNow, if this place served lavash bread too, it'd consider coming back.
