Service was horrible and food was mediocre. We were a party of 3 and there had been a couple ahead of us. They were given #1 and we were given #2. When the couple were seated then logically the next available 4 top table should have been ours. That did not happen. The head waiter gave that table away to the couple that came in after us.  And when we were finally seated the head waiter berated us for not ordering ahead of time. When the food came it was not piping hot. The pan-fried dumplings were soggy and the Shanghai noodles were way too oily. We felt absolutely rushed to order, eat and leave. I think next time we will travel a little further to the North York location or Scarborough location instead
