This is one of those great quite places that you can have a morning meeting in or just relax and enjoy your day.\n\nThe food is always great. The service is some of the best that you can ask for. I love the corn beef and fried egg as well as the biscuits and gravy. Oh and lets not forget the coffee I would go there just for a cup of coffee and a quite place to read a book. If you are looking for a good morning out with amazing breakfast look no further.
