Well all I can say is the chicken wings we ordered were still half frozen when served to us. We told the server, he reaches onto our plate and grabs a wing off of it, then says \"yea, you're right, let me tell the cook\" He comes back out and takes another wing off the plate to \"check if they're all cold\" at this point I don't want any of the food on the plate after his hands have been in it. The nachos were very, um, creative? They had canned stewed tomatoes. Stewed tomatoes. Gross.  I asked for a greyhound with kettle one, which was basically ocean spray white grapefruit juice, no kettle one. \n\nSo in closing, I'd say avoid this place. Go next door to Roberto's. You have a better chance of getting decent nachos.
