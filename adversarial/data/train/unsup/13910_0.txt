Came here tonight to The Living Room and ordered an Irish Coffee. Gal behind the bar seemed unsure...had to go get some other guy to go in the back to get the coffee. Okay, whatever, but that took 5 minutes, she presents me with a to-go coffee cup, takes off the lid and proceeds to pour less than half a shot of Bailey's in it...\"there you go\". Really? An Irish Coffee, my dear, is Bailey's, Whiskey, and coffee. What she brought me was hours-old coffee with no discernible Bailey's at all. I tell her what's in an Irish Coffee. \"Oh, I put some Bailey's in it.\" \"Could you throw a shot of Jameson's in that for me, please? And, I've never seen it served this way before.\" \"Oh, how do you get it?\" \"Usually in a glass mug. I'd like that for here.\" That took another few minutes while coffee guy searched for a mug. Sheesh! \n\nShe was nice, but...really? I was just surprised, as that is an all-too-common drink. $10! 2 points for bartendership. I like the chillax atmosphere, though.
