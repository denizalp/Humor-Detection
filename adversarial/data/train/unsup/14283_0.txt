Management needs to train their salespeople how to sell. While the sales staff is cordial,  emphasis needs to be placed on educating the staff on the features of their product, upsales, etc. I bought a watch winder for my Tag and was helped by a younger salesperson. I set a price point of $200 and was shown a wolf model. I've heard that Wolf was one of the better winders, so I trusted the salesperson that this model would work for my watch. Apparently,  there are certain duty cycles(how long the winder stays in motion), and unfortunately for me,  this one doesn't stay on long enough to wind my watch. When I called the rep at Wolf,  I was told the newer model of my version stays on longer,  but I should look into a different model. Although the other model costs a little more,  I would've bought it as now I have a $200 paperweight and a alack of trust as to the competency of the sales staff at this store.Their selection is decent,  and I am looking for a nice Breitling for my dad,  fortunately,  they aren't the only jeweler in town.
