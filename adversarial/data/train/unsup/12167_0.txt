Parking is super Easy. The food itself is really good!!! layered with flavor and seasoning.  I love everything I have ever gotten here. It comes out super hot and you can tell it was made with love and attention. \nThe staff is usually pretty nice and the place is packed with all walks of life. When coming for lunch or dinner.. please be sure to allot a min of an hour. The food takes quite a long time to get to you, especially when the place is packed.  Sooooooo be sure to plan for it.  You can call ahead to make a reservation. \n\nThe Seating here is a bit tight, so you wont want to schedule and private meeting here. \n\nThe hooka lounge is connected to the same building, but totally separate entrance and not noticeable from the restaurant. I didn't even notice it was there until my lunch guest pointed it out. \n\nThe bathrooms and the vinyl seating could use a little updgrade, but nothing major. I would come back here again and again.
