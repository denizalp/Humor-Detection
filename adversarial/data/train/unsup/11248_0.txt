Palio! Not paleo! But worth it!! \n\nFound this rare gem! I mean rare because there really isn't many sit down coffee shops on the strip is there!!?! I need and want just a good cup of cappuccino or a latte for breakfast. That doesn't come in a paper cup! I mean seriously! Nothing I hate more than drinking a good coffee in a paper cup. Unless it's plain black coffee! \n\nFound out they have 2 of my breakfast essentials: croissants and lattes in a proper plates!! :D Yey! Took a little bit to find this but alas! It's so cute! Love the art and decor! Love my pool view! The patio was open too but of course full!! \n\nMy latte and a chocolate croissant came to $15+. It's Vegas! It's worth it! Really glad I got the last chocolate croissant though. That thing was MASSIVE!  I didn't even finish half but I had a blast playing with my food!\n\nThey had other food too: sandwiches! Toast! It smells all kind of delicious in here! I'm good with my latte! Huge latte and huge croissant! What else is good! Oh and champagne!! Wooo!
