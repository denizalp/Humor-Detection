So me and my girlfriend watched avengers and we walked by the ranch house and asked the hostess to see the menu and what kind of specials they have. They had 8.95 lunch specials I thought it was gonna be great..... The service sucked waited for 10 min for our waiter to take our order...well we ordered the honey glazed chicken and the ribs......once we got our food we splitted our food......the ribs were only 4 pieces and the chicken was pretty small....we tried the chicken first and it was pretty simple white rice with grilled chicken and just salsa on top wasn't really what I was expecting.... the dish was pretty mediocre and the ribs came with a choice of a side so we had the corn bread......the ribs were pretty dry and it tasted like it was smoked and it wasnt tender at all but there was good thing about the dish was the cornbread it seemed like it was homemade and it was sweet and tasty and not tasting like it was store bought or premade. The server was giving us pretty bad service he asked us about 4 times if our food is alright within the 5 min we had our food and the 5th time he asked me if I was done with my food which I wasnt ... I felt like I was getting bugged and rushed to eat my food.... I hope this place steps up I know they're new but the service and food needs to step up a little.. ill give it 5 stars the next time I visit if they step it up a notch and listen to the customers on yelp that love real food...
