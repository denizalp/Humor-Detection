My normal routine is to ride from my house near Rampart and Vegas, get to Alta through the Summerlin neighborhoods, ride behind Red Rock Casino, see the construction of the new mall going up over there, and hop on the trail adjacent to the 215 Beltway.  This trail is excellent for cyclists, runners, walkers, and the random homeless person with a shopping cart.  Going south from Charleston Blvd., it's nicely paved and you can traverse it without having to deal with traffic, save for the stoplights you'll encounter along the way.  If it's early enough, you'll get to see the hot air balloons that are often aloft in the southwest part of the valley.  I highly recommend this trail if you're in the area and want to enjoy the great outdoors on your feet or on wheels powered by you.
