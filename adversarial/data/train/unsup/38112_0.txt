I have to start this review by stating I am a picky first-time mom who is a senior operations director and childcare licensing expert for childcare programs for a major organization in Arizona....and I cannot more highly recommend Denise's Safe Haven Daycare!!!\n\nWhen we had our son, we knew we wanted him in a smaller home-based daycare for his first 3-4 years. We wanted a small group setting with a consistent loving provider. With no family in Arizona, and both of us working full-time, we hoped to find a place that felt homey, loving, and SAFE! When we found Denise, we found all we were looking for! \n\nBefore enrolling I checked her ADHS childcare licensing report (open to the public for viewing) and found she had a stellar record. We interviewed her and loved how she immediately got on the floor and played with our (then) 4-month old. Two years later, we are still thrilled! Balanced meals, educational activities, letting kids have fun and get messy, and lots of hugs...these are just a few of the experiences my son has every day in her care. \n\nShe does watch multiple part-timers, mostly to accommodate parents with varied shifts and work structures (I.e: police, nurses, etc). We drop off and pick up at varied times throughout the day and have NEVER seen more than 6 kids in care, which is her licensed capacity at any point. Usually she has up to 4 a day.\n\nYes, there have been occasional incidents of toddlers biting, playing rough, having potty accidents, etc. but she has quickly and immediately addressed each instance, communicating it to the parents and taking action for resolution. I think you would be hard pressed to find a center where this does not occur, but Denise handles each one in compliance with all regulations but more importantly with the love and focus on safety we as parents expect. \n\nFeel free to reach out to me directly if you have questions about Denise's Safe Haven!!!
