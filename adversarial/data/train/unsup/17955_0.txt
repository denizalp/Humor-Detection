Nooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I went here on a Saturday evening to watch college football with friends, because when you watch college football you need beer and the bigger the selection the better.  I don't mind that all the waitresses are female (girl power) or that they're in short skirts and a bra (motivates me to want to get skinny for a quick minute).   \n\nThe size of the venue is great!  I could imagine when the Pirates\/Steelers are in town b\/c it's so close to Heinz Field and PNC Park it's probably packed!  I get it.  Lots of tables.  The servers are all women with short skirts and bras, so if you're ok with scantily clad women you're good.  It honestly motivates me to want to do some sit ups, but I'd rather have the beer menu in preparation for my hibernation during the winter.\n\nIt was Saturday evening, and all of the other restaurants on \"Restaurant Row\" were pretty packed. When I say this place was dead it is an understatement.  There were maybe  4 tables in the big open area nearest the road.  They might as well have closed down for the evening.  Got there around 7:30 pm and it felt like the air conditioning was off.  Nothing says \"welcome\" like turning off the A\/C.  I wanted to immediately go somewhere else, but we were with a group of people and already told them we were coming to the Tilted Kilt.  The beer selection is just \"ok\".  I had a couple of \"Yvengling\" because they didn't have any Octoberfest\/Pumpkin beers (and before anyone gives me any grief about it being September, in Germany they celebrate Oktoberfest in Sept\/Oct and I consider them the experts).\n\nThere was a UFC fight that started toward the 4th quarter of the college football game we were watching.  There were only two tables left full of people (as well as people at the bar): the other table was 2 adults and 6 kids and my table was 8 adults.  The kids table was watching the UFC fight. My table was watching college football drinking beer.  Management decided to turn on the sound to the UFC fight, but they turned the sound up so high we had to yell to talk to our server and each other.  That was a HUGE sign that they don't like money (because we were drinking beer and eating food) and the other table was just there to watch the fight.  We left immediately after in complete disgust. My ear drums are still ringing from that night.\n\nIf they treated us like this on a slow night I can only imagine what happens during a sporting event\/concert.  Try it at your own risk!  I've had enough Tilted Kilt for a few years.  I'm going to work on my beer belly somewhere else.
