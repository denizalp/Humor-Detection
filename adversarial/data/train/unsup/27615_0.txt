Found out about this place as a top essential Vegas eatery, and decided this is where I wanted a fun and quirky birthday dinner. It did not disappoint! Since it is open 24 hours, we got there around 10pm and was not surprised to find it very crowded (normally a good first indicator). There is plenty of parking surrounding the building which is unusual for the Strip. Once inside, we were hit by the sights and smells of a typical diner, but with a uniquely Vegas flair. It almost shouldn't work, but yet it does. They immediately pop over to take a touristy souvenir picture (it turned out really good, so of course we bought it). The drink menu has all the super fun drinks you can think of. As for the food, let's just say you aren't going there for the food, but it wasn't terrible. We got the strawberry shortcake for dessert, and upon its arrival, had everyone laughing around us as we all pondered how 2 people were going to eat this monstrosity!! Certainly a tad oversized, but again...Vegas. Service was friendly and I thoroughly enjoyed my time at the Peppermill.!
