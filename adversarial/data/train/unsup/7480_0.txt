The Skinny: decent eats for the price, fantastic root beer (3.5 stars... The extra half for the root beer) service: our server was friendly enough but messed up the check 3 times... And still didn't get it right (2 stars) value: not as good a value on the price as before,  service could use some work (2 starred review). \n\nFYI -  they must have recently raised their prices on the 8oz steak and eggs deal. There was a sign in front of the Cafe that lists it as now $6.99. \n\nSo I was hankering for prime rib without the exorbitant price tag.  We decided to hit Ellis Island for some eats after the good reviews\/pics on Yelp. As their top sirloin steak special is listed perennially on Las Vegas advisor as one of the top 10 deals in Vegas,  we thought we could check it as well. This joint is no secret from the locals who frequent this place. At 11am on a Sunday,  there was a half hour wait for a table of 2.\n\nJust FYI -  the steak special with 20 oz Ellis Island craft brew is $9.99 with their players card. (It isn't $8.99 like the signs say in the hotel) If you play $5, you will receive $2 off this deal. You have to redeem both these coupons at one of the player card kiosks. \n\nAlso,  despite what their website says,  they also raised the price of the prime rib dinner to $14.99 from $13.99.\n\nBoth the steak special and the King cut prime rib special comes with green beans,  choice of potato\/rice, soup\/salad and a choice of their Ellis Island craft beer or root beer. \n\nThe highlight of the meal was the root beer. Creamy with a hint of spiciness, it was pretty wonderful and I would not hesitate to get it again. \n\nAfter that, our side salads arrived at the table which were pretty generic. It was basically iceberg salad from a bag with a tomato on top with really cheap croutons. Not something you would order on its own  but because it comes with a meal,  it's okay. For a side salad, it was a pretty good portion. \n\nNext came our main entr√©es.  My prime rib,  ordered medium rare, came out medium well. Being as hungry as I was, I just ate it. It tasted not bad for the price with some minor fat and bits of gristle. It just isn't a superlative experience. The portion size was respectable (like a regular cut of prime rib) but certainly not a super large portion as suggested by the \"king\" cut moniker they use. The meat comes with horseradish and au jus. \n\nThe hubs' top sirloin steak special fared a bit better although the cut was a bit too lean(didn't melt in your mouth). It was done to a perfect medium rare with a bit of charred flavor from the grill. \n\nThe green beans were a bit overdone and stringy but adequately seasoned with a good amount of garlic. The baked potato was okay and large but lacked the perfect golden crispy skin. \n\nIf it were only the food,  I would give this place a fair 3.5 stars with the half star bump up purely from the awesome root beer. However service was spotty at best and I think it had more to do with our server. \n\nAlthough friendly enough, she forgot things - like the waters we asked for. After we got our food,  she checked in with us once and then we didn't see her for a while. Finally,  it took 20+ minutes to get our check done incorrectly. It took her 3 corrections and she still didn't get it right (she forgot our coupons, then she didn't put all of them in, then she forgot to take off the charge for root beers which is included in the price of the meal). She did some sort of correction where the fees for the root beer were waived but we still paid tax on them... Even though the meal price included the root beer! At 25 minutes in, we weren't going to argue about it. But it is largely the principal of the matter that was bothersome. \n\nOverall,  the food is okay but the service needs to be better. Is it worth a half an hour wait and 20+ minutes of messed up checks? Not so sure. If you consider that Station Casinos offers prime rib buffets for $16.99 on weekends, the price for the prime rib dinner is not so great (after experiencing the lackluster salad bar and cooked veggies at Feast buffet this week, it still beat the side salad\/veggies offered here hands down). The price of the steak dinner however is a decent deal only if you get the aforementioned coupons. Given this experience, I give this place a 2 starred review.
