I had a great experience with buying my car. The salesman was awesome. The finance guys were surprisingly ethical and professional. (I say \"surprisingly\" because of previous car buying experiences with other dealerships.) \nThe reason I don't give five stars is what has happened AFTER I bought the car.\nI cannot get in touch with anyone other than the girl who answers the phone. \nThe first time we had to provide additional documentation for finance. We ended up driving from Buckeye to Scottsdale to give them the information because no one would answer their damn phones. \nToday, my husband spent an hour on the phone getting transferred, hung up on, and given three different phone numbers to \"try\" to reach someone regarding the fact that my temporary tags expired and the permanent one hasn't arrived yet. The girl who answered the phones advised my husband she has been getting calls about this all day long. Don't you think by now (5pm) you would know who we need to talk to about this??!!\nShe ended up giving my husband the number to their corporate office in Peoria. The woman there told my husband to call back in 20 minutes to speak to one of the finance guys as they are currently busy with customers. *sigh. So many, many reasons to hate buying a new car. I thought this dealership would be different. Color me disappointed, but not surprised.\n\n**Update***\n\nWe called back and the woman at corporate told my husband he needed to contact the dealership where we purchased the car. \n\nHe called them AGAIN and was told to speak to Curt. My husband explained to Curt what was happening. He got huffy and irritated and told my husband he had to talk to Laura. Laura talked to him for a minute and told him we have to go there to get the tag. Ummm...no. We live damn near 2 hours away. So, Laura transferred him to another guy who asked my husband why it took us three days to call about the tag. \n\nOkay, F&*(& stick, it DID NOT take us three days, first of all. We have been CALLING to get a hold of someone for three days but no one there can ever answer a *()()6%^&^* phone. SECOND, I SHOULDN\"T HAVE TO DO THIS AT ALL!!!!! IF WHOEVER IS SUPPOSED TO GET THE TAGS SENT OUT WOULD DO THEIR JOB, I WOULDN'T EVEN BE CALLING YOU NOW, THREE DAYS AGO OR EVER AGAIN! \n\nPiss-poor customer service irritates me to no end (can you tell?) The fact that the finance guys didn't screw us and the sales guy wasn't a blood-sucking vulture has been completely negated because of the sh&#@* customer service AFTER the car has been sold.
