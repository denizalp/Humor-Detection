We went to Pratt's as I had heard it was a good place to go buy chickens from.   I have to say, it was fun bringing my 4 year old daughter with me as they had quite a few other types of animals to see and she had a blast in the store.   Since this was my first chicken purchase, I was a bit confused on what kind of chickens to buy, but I have to say, that the sales guy was awesome.  I wish I could remember his name as he was very helpful and informative.   I read some of the other reviews on here before posting and noticed a mixture of bad and good.   I didn't experience any of the bad but I know sometimes that comes with the person you work with in the stores..    I will be using them again.
