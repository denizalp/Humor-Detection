When we went to Vegas, we had planned on daily trips driving to places around Vegas. And so we wanted a place where we could get food on the go and start with our drive. Came across Rani's World foods with a Google search and it couldn't have been any better!! We didn't shop at the grocery store but the food and service at the kitchen was so good and the cost reasonable that we decided to stop by and get our food for the next 4 days and even for dinner! \nThe lady in the kitchen, Rani, is the best!!! Highly recommended.
