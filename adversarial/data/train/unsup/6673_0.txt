I will never stay here again 3 main reasons. \n1. Hidden resort fee of 18 bucks a day no biggie but then they charge u for things like using the pool fitness center prepare to get nickel and dimed \n2. Every were I turned some person was in my face trying to sell me a time share FYI if some person offers u a free show or a welcome package it's a ploy to get u to a time share sales pitch\n3. Poor poor service and restaurants and very pricey not a fun place\n \nIn short I go to Vegas to gamble drink and see a show I don't care what my room looks like but what I will not tolerate is being treated like a pice of meat or interrupted from gambling by some low life selling time shares. Do not stay here pay more for a more central strip location
