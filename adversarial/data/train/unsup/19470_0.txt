Stopped in here to inquire about an alignment based on reviews from Yelp.\n\nSadly, things didn't go so well. I pulled up, walked into the office and was immediately told that it's impossible to perform an alignment on my vehicle. It's 2005 Mercedes, certainly not anywhere close to \"new\" and it was dismissed out of hat without even a peek or an inquiry as to the model and year of the vehicle. I was told it was impossible for them to do anything because Mercedes didn't build them to get alignments. There are no camber adjustments or toe in or anything they can do. Problem is, I'm well aware that isn't true and it's quite easy to do the necessary work on a W211 model, I guess I must have looked stupid or something.\n\nThe worst part, it wasn't even a polite \"sorry we can't help you\". The guy behind the counter was in an aggressive stance and had a super nasty attitude about it. Didn't think to catch the name on the patch. I could have easily argued the point and told the guy how and where he was wrong, but I know when I'm not wanted so I quietly excused myself and went on my way.\n\nMaybe he just hates Mercedes owners? I don't really know, either way, disappointing after so many high marks given here.
