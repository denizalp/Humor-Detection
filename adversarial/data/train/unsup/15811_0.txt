with the Olympics coming up, I need it to get my Canada gear and were our colours proudly. So a trip to Roots was a must, plus they once were the official outfitter of the Canadian National Olympic Team. Now they just are a proud Canadian brand. \n\nWhile they have mostly been known for their winter gear, they have stepped it up with the summer clothing lines. An they are really playing on our emotions with the Canada logos. As a proud Canadian I am happy to support this great brand! Plus I got a shoulder bag here that I really like and now they have a new one that I just has to get. And who does not have a pair of their famous my sister even has that little monkey that is made from the same materials. \n\nI defiantly like the brand and the lifestyle they represent.
