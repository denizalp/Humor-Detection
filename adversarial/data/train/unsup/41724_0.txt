OK, the food here is good people.  I will definitely give it that...  But not good enough to stand in line for 30 minutes to an hour as some did.  we walked up and the lone was around the corner into the ladies bathroom hallway!  \n\nNOPE, walked over to Holstein amd had a snack, chilled, had a drink.  Walked out and saw...  WHAT???  No line???\n\nWalked in, order my breakfast sandwich and cookie...  Both good, but not OMG I've got to have this again.\n\nWould come back?  Hmmmmm....  Still debating that.
