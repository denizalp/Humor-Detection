Flew in to Vegas for a birthday,was looking for something away from the strip to eat and found Sin City Soul Food Caribbean Bbq. \nCalled Chef Will to confirm his hours and was treated like family from the start. \nTo say that the food was great is an understatement, to quote Chef Will,it's not about me,it's about the food,truer words have never been spoken.\nThe brisket is the best I've ever had and we're talking about 52 years of eating and barbecuing. \nThe sides were very generous,tasty and more than enough for the party 4 we came with.\nThe ribs were off the chain,meaty,juicy and the overall presentation was great.\nTo sum it up,Sin City Soul Food is a hidden gem that needs and deserves to be discovered. \nSorry for the pic but the food was so good we were killing it,so not much to show.\nGive the place a chance,you won't regret it.
