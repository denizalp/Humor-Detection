BEST GREEK RESTAURANT IN THE WORLD!!!!! I would like to thank Estiatorio Milos for opening a location here on the West Coast...and it is because of you why I always head to Vegas every six months (oh and also since I love the beautiful fountain-view balcony suites at The Cosmopolitan Hotel...sigh).\n\nSorry I digress. Anyway, I am hooked on the appetizers here at Milos. Don't get me wrong, the fresh seafood served as entrees look delicious but I was kind of underwhelmed by the lobster pasta, grilled mediterranean sea bream, & lamb chops that we prdered for our first visit. I'm sorry don't hate me Milos HAHA!!!!!\n\nBUT.......the appetizers.........please I need a second to myself LOL. Not to be dramatic but....the appetizers are AMAZING. Simple yet perfectly executed with quality ingredients. I'll admit they are not the cheapest appetizers but man will they keep you salivating for more.\n\nWhat I Ordered:\n\n* Grilled Octopus: Super tender and nicely charred. The most delicious grilled octopus I've ever had. Seriously. No fishiness here. It's lighly dressed with olive oil & tossed with capers, parsely, & red onion. \n\n* Greek Salad: Once again, quality ingredients stand out here. Remember it's a salad, so you're not cooking anything which means that the ingredients play a HUGE FACTOR to its flavor. The tomatoes were sweet and firm. The cucumbers were crisp and clean tasting. The Greek feta and kalamata olives were salty & briny yet perfectly balances the textures and \"delicate-ness\" of the vegetables. The red onions just provided the nice hint of spice and color to the dish. I'm telling you I've never been this excited to eat vegetables.\n\n* Milos Special: How could you say no to fried veggies & cheese! I was totally blown away by this dish. It really is the best thing I've ever eaten. The zucchini & eggplant are sliced thinly and battered then fried to a crispy. Served with fried cheese, oregano, & a homemade tzatziki...I could just cry. PLEASE TO WHOEVER INVENTED THIS DISH....I DEDICATE MY ENETIRE VEGAS TRIP TO YOU.\n\n* Complimentsry Table Bread: I know what you're thinking. BREAD?! Believe me their bread is delicious. It's specially made for them by Whole Foods Market & it has the perfect balance of nuttiness from the wheat & and tenderness from the white flour. I love how they toast it on a burner before they serve it. It gives such nice toasty flavor yet leaving a moist center to absorb the olive oil.\n\nVerdict:\n\nI can't believe it's been 3 months since I've been to Vegas. I really don't think I can handle 3 months 'til my next visit. Milos...I don't know what you've done to me but you know I'm going back. Even if you aren't cheap, I will continue to see you for what's on the inside haha. Cheesy I know LOL.
