Paid $35 total (tax + tip included) for a Sunday brunch.\n\nTo avoid any disappointment, I would make sure to be cautious of what your expectations for the food will be. Reading Yelp reviews made me expect delicious crab legs, lobster, macarons, and creme brulee. When I finally went, none of these existed, except for crab legs that were \"okay\" tasting, and served very very cold. After reading more reviews and using deduction, I believe the buffet price will fluctuate (up or down) depending on what specials they might serve at the buffet, and that it won't always have the same foods. Which is a bit disappointing, since you get excited over reading reviews or hearing about it from friends, and then if you happen to go during a different day or season, you might end up having different food served. That's my biggest disappointment with this place. It'd be great if they could straight up list the highlights of food served to justify the differences in prices.\n\nAs for the buffet itself, make sure you know how to pace yourself and make sure to go only if you like variety. There is a good amount of food to try, but if you are picky and\/or don't like some of the selection, you're not going to get your money's worth unless you find the dishes you really like and stock up on those. I personally give this place 4 stars because I ate here for at least 4 hours and went out with such a happy belly.\n\nSome food I really enjoyed (this was on a Sunday, some were for brunch and some were for dinner menu): prime rib, shrimp, spicy tuna handrolls, all sashimi and nigiri sushi, tortellini, bacon, eggs benedict, flan, cheesecake, chocolate mouse, banana french toast, seaweed, pesto mashed potatoes, wonton soup.
