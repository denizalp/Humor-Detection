CROISSANT REVIEW:\nDecent to passable quality.  Solid enough structure (read it doesn't look like a used sock on the floor).  Slightly underbaked, more bready than flaky, no distinctive butter taste, not particularly crisp.\nI'd like to give it another try fresh out of the oven, tried this one about 11:30 am.\nI'll mention that with tax the croissant only cost $1.68 which is an excellent price, none of this well over $2.00 nonsense.
