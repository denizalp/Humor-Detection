If there was ever a prime candidate for the public ax in these lean times it would be this library.  It really offers nothing more than some air conditioning, a couple of 1990's era Sports Illustrated's, and some half empty book shelves.  My illiterate nephew has a bigger book collection than this place.  The middle of the Sonoran desert has more electrical outlets and workstations than this \"library\".  \nI'm sorry.  I love libraries and books and all but I just don't see much learning coming out of this place.  There are some great alternatives in the area (Burton Barr and Scottsdale).
