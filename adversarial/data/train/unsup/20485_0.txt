Being such a niche hobby these days, your options for pinball sales and repair in Phoenix are relatively scarce. And if you're someone like myself who loves pinball, but doesn't quite have the skills to repair the machines, it's great to have a \"go-to\" business like Firebird whenever you need some assistance.\n\nTalk to Kris for a few minutes and you'll immediately discover that the man is a human encyclopedia of pinball machines. He knows the intricate details of mechanics, rule sets, modifications, as well as random trivial facts that he's more than eager to share.\n\nFirebird originally helped me find and shop out a 1992 Data East Star Wars. This was a lengthy process, which included multiple requests and a few delays (on my part) due to some requested changes. In the end, they did everything I asked and gave me a great game that I was very pleased with!\n\nI required the assistance of Kris once again several months later, only this time, for some help with my Medieval Madness Remake. Kris came out and helped me install a diffuser under my playfield, as well as some additional add-ons that I was not comfortable doing myself. I intend to use him again whenever I make further modifications to my machine next year.\n\nFirebird always has a variety of machines for sale. They keep a very well maintained website, keeping people updated on what they're currently working on, as well as what's coming up in their queue. Unlike slot machine stores, their prices are honest.  \n\nIf you're interested in buying a pinball machine or just need some help with repairs of what you currently own, this is probably the best resource you can have.\n\nRecommended!
