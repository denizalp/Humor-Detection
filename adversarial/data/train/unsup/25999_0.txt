So good! The matcha soft serve was not too sweet and had strong matcha flavor. I would definitely be coming back often. I got the matcha lemonade drink with soft serve, matcha latte with Soft serve on top, and just a matcha soft serve. All were really good. The only issue I had with the drinks were that there was too much ice. It is understandable to have a full cup of ice to keep the ice cream up.
