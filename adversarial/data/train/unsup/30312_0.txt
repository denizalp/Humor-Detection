Truly a 1 Star establishment. I love a bargain and I love Marc's but I will never come into this Marc's again. There's a large sign over the front counter  that says \"customer service\" but let me assure that's fake news. There's no such thing as customer service here. You ask an employee a question and they tell you \"I don't work in close outs\" and walk away. You go to the customer service desk and hear \"ask someone in close outs\"- it's just a store filled with people not willing to help.
