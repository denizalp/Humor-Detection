I love Yakitori with the passion of a thousand skewers and Ichiza gives me my Yakitori fix, effortlessly. I won't beat around the bush and admit that you will encounter some misses here, but the hits definitely outweigh them. This is an uber casual, Ã  la carte, Japanese Izakaya style dining restaurant, with everything served on tapas-like portions. They also typically get pretty full during weekend dinner rush hour but we have never waited longer than 10 minutes.  We typically get seated at the giant family style table with other patrons.\n\nMy recommendation is to stick with the Yakitori items and steer clear of the specials that are trendy, \"gimmicky\" dishes, some of them are terrible. I never pass up on ordering a comforting miso soup and an assortment of Yakitori\/ skewers of grilled goodies. \n\nHere are my favorites:\n* Bacon wrapped asparagus - you can never go wrong with bacon wrapped items!\n* Chicken meatballs $1.65 - very juicy and drenched in a slightly sweet Yakitori sauce\n* Chicken - simple grilled chicken on a skewer, but a nice filler\n* Shishito pepper $1.50 - super simple, but we are shishito fans\n* Okra - super simple as well, but we are okra lovers\n* Quail Egg - very simple, but great flavor and fun to eat\n* Most tender Beef tongue $2.50 - my absolute favorite thing here! Grilled perfectly, very succulent and slightly sweet\n\nOther items I love:\n* Spicy tuna roll $5.95 - basic roll, but also a tasty way to get satisfied\n* Miso soup $1.50 - I love their miso soup here! Always piping hot and very chunky with tofu and seaweed\n* Seared salmon and shiso wrapped with salmon - a wonderful, refreshing combination of flavors\n* Ankimo with ponzu - (monk fish liver) super fresh and buttery\n* Uni with ponzu - very fresh and naturally sweet\n\nThe SKIP list:\n* Deep fried chow mein  $7.95 - This item is nasty! Not appetizing in the slightest. The gravy was too gooey and scary-looking. I also couldn't get over how bland it was, it almost tasted like someone randomly tossing things onto the plate with dish water and that's not even the worst part, the fried udon noodles were dry and had a teeth shattering consistency?!\n* Veggie croquette $4.50 - it was extremely bland, chunky, with unwelcome hard bits, and lacking the smoother consistency we've come to love in Japanese croquettes. \n* Yellow-tail tartare - Super thick and hard wonton chips sandwiched with a ton of dense rice in between and the tiniest portion of yellow tail. The flavor was lost in all of the rice.
