Went to Cafe Hollander with a large group this past weekend. We knew it would be busy on a weekend but only had to wait about 30min. Everyone enjoyed their food and table service was good not great so I am going to leave it at 3. But bar service was dismal. If we didn't like food I would be rating a 2. It's just this place has been open for a while now, it's Saturday and you know you're gonna be swamped. You should have experienced, fast bartenders working. Not new people or people in training or if you do staff with other experienced staff. No one in our group was able to get a drink before our table was ready. And when we were helped finally the bartender seemed confused as to what we wanted and where to locate it in the bar. As we were texted our table was ready he proceeded to bring out 3 different beers to see if it was what the person in our group wanted. We just said forget about it because our table was ready. We also got a text for our table however there were also 2 other groups waiting for their tables as well, so not enough hosts and confusion as well.\n\nI really enjoyed my meatloaf, would get it again but probably should be served with a salad or veggies, maybe fried onions on top. The meatloaf was slightly mushy but I like it like that. The potatoes also a soft texture so something else would've helped, gravy was delicious. I had a bite of my mom's veggie burger option, a pistachio burger it was also very tasty. Their burgers were a nice 1\/2 pound, but a little skimpy on the fries. We also got 2 pounds of mussels to share, they were OK but for almost $20 would probably skip next time. Server was OK pretty fast if not just a little awkward but better then the bar service. Service is a 2 food is probably a 3 or 4, wish I could give this place more.
