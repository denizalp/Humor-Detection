I deducted 2 stars today because they had my food ready but was waiting on egg rolls which they said would take 7 minutes...15 minutes later and three customers that came behind me later....I finally had to yell at them to get their attention since they were so busy talking and chatting they couldn't hear me at first... Because they were being so loud Then when I finally got their attention they were so very flippant about the long wait... No apology.... No nothing.... Just have me a look like I was crazy. They never asked me if it was to go or for dine in. They had everything packed like it was to go. The fourth person that came in after me got their food literally seconds after I received my sandwich... No egg rolls... These I received another 5 minutes after I got my sandwich. So how does 7 minutes equal 20 minutes on egg rolls???\n\nThen when I finally got the food...I was really annoyed about the wait and I let it show... Then they stood there in the kitchen talking about me... Saying things like she needs to chill...Uummmm... Are they really that retarded that they think that I can't hear them over the glass that doesn't even go-to the ceiling. \n\nThey seriously need to retrain their staff... Seeing as how it was a manager that was talking crap about me to one of her staff... NOT COOL. I can say that the manager on duty Mirasol was more interested in laughing and chatting with her male employee then actually doing her job.\n\nThe service here has really been off and on.... Now because of this crappy service, I won't come back. If they really don't want my money there are plenty of other places.
