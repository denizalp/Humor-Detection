Wow, TERRIBLE customer service. My friend was in a regular line that was being held up by a customer who forgot something. The regular line's cashier apologized and told my friend, who had 16 items, to go to the next line, an empty express (12 or less) line. \n\nWhen my friend moved her things to the express line, that's line's cashier (Tonie, according to the receipt) literally raised her voice to my friend, yelled at her, and told her to apologize to the people who had just gotten behind her -- because she was over 12 items. \n\nThat's right. My friend got straight-up yelled at by a cashier because she had done something ANOTHER EMPLOYEE STANDING RIGHT NEXT TO THEM TOLD THEM TO DO. \n\nTalk about lack of respect. If I could rate them zero stars, I would.
