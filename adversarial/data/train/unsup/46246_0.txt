I dropped off my primered bumper that had a crack on it. I took it to a big name shop earlier that day to get a quote but they wouldn't touch it. I called bumper medic and dropped it off. They told me it can be finished in 2 days. I came back and picked it up. Paint quality was great and it looks brand new. The paint also matched really well. Price was very very reasonable for the amount of work done. I'm happy with the repair and the paint job. I'll be back for more business in the future.
