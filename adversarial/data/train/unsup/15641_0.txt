The drive from LA to Vegas is brutal.  Well, not horrible, but sitting in a car for 3.5 - 4 hours deserves some kind of reward.\n\nWhen planning our Vegas trip, of course one of the first things we do is decide what and where we'll eat during the weekend.  This place was the first one on the list.  It had been on both of our bookmarks for a long while.  It seemed only fitting to treat ourselves to a delicious meal from Oyster Bar after our long drive from LA.\n\nWe read the Yelp reviews and knew that we had to hit this place up when we got into town.  We would be arriving at about 1-2am, and according to the reviews, probably the best time to avoid the wait.  After searching the casino, we found this little tiny bar.  Yes people, the reviews are all true.  It's tiny.  It's basically a bar with seats around it (about 18 or so).  Get in line to be seated, and be prepared for a wait.  \n\nOf course, by the time we were seated, we knew exactly what we were going to order.  One combo pan roast and 6 oysters.\n\nIt was 2am in the morning, and I was struggling with the concept of sleep and enjoying my delicious meal.  But this meal was too amazing to pass up.  The oysters came, and my friend and I had three each.  Paired with the cocktail sauce and horseradish, those oyster were a great prelude to our meal.  The oysters were fresh and at $10 for 6 (midnight special), it was well worth it.\n\nThe pan roast.  OMG the pan roast.  If you come here and can't decide what to order, just order the pan roast.  You won't be sorry.  My friend and I shared the plate.  There's a $5 sharing fee, but you get two scoops of rice instead of the one it's usually served with.  Besides, we could not have finished one each anyways.  We ordered a 5 level spicy, and that was good enough for me.  Not too spicy, just enough that you know there's some spice in the dish.  Yes, order the pan roast.  You won't be sorry!!\n\nGreat meal for the start of our Vegas trip.
