I stayed here about 6 months ago, and the hotel was fine. However on this trip it was a different story. From the rude clerk at the front desk it went downhill. Only one elevator was working, my room wasn't cleaned. The bathroom was filthy, the towels were thread bare and frayed, a couple even had holes. The TV reception faded in and out. I called Ms Rude at the front desk and was told the reception wasn't the hotel's problem. The ice machines weren't working, and that was not their problem either. Guess the hotel has no problems! I did find out the root of the problem. The hotel has hired a new manager. That explains most of the problems. Time to hire a new manager and restore the hotel to how it was 6 months ago..
