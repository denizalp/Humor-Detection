This is the second time I've gone here to try their fried chicken and it's not on the menu. Apparently, the menu changes on a daily basis. Both times it was a Saturday early evening between 5-6pm. Long island iced tea was pricy but very well made. The pretzel bites were just ok this time around. Lacking the delicious flavor they had on my 1st visit. Probably will not try this restaurant again because of my two disappointments on both occasions.
