Food here was good.  I really enjoyed my mango roll and my grilled salmon.  They have a huge selection of alcohol, I mean really good ones (not just beers on tap).  However,  they only had one Saki bottle available which was a bit of a let down.\n\nSS is a fusion Japanese Brazilian steak house.  Our waiter suggested we order their  sampler which was good for a large group (starts at $60 to $150) per person, but our group opted out and went with a la cart instead. I'm going to have to revisit that next time I'm here. It sounded really good.\n\nThe highlight of our night with SS was our waiter and their staff.  They were all magnificent.  Our waiter also knew his bar menu, to the dinner menu all the way to dessert. Bam, home run!!  We can't thank you enough for taking such great care of our group.\n\nIf you're looking for a Japanese fusion with a twist of Brazilian, this would be a good place.  Their servings are adquate, their drinks selection are fantastic, ambiance is classy, and their menu has a variety of unique dishes that will tickle, even one with the most discerning palate.\n\nNote:  Sushi Samba is located on the 2nd floor of the Venetian (take the escalator from the main entrance where you see the \"ice like\" sculpture.\n\nUntil then, be kind to one another and Cheers! ~ :p
