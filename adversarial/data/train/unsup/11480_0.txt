I bought 3 Groupons for this place and took the family here on several visits.  Here are some of the menu items we ordered:\n\nChicken Wings, $8.99\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/rosatis-pizza-scottsdale-3?select=uXCKrisM1Vqcg1a5w7kGtQ#uXCKrisM1Vqcg1a5w7kGtQ\n\nGarlic Cheese Bread, $3.95\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/rosatis-pizza-scottsdale-3?select=33lpUwpjo3k0jaoiZcNLhw#33lpUwpjo3k0jaoiZcNLhw\n\nDouble Dough Pizza, $17.85\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/rosatis-pizza-scottsdale-3?select=weJ1ixAXmQKOjOOuewBwcQ#weJ1ixAXmQKOjOOuewBwcQ\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/rosatis-pizza-scottsdale-3?select=4pbanx3TwID22I8rZ8-b8A#4pbanx3TwID22I8rZ8-b8A\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/rosatis-pizza-scottsdale-3?select=fohsiTE8O96NDIkRoQ_8LA#fohsiTE8O96NDIkRoQ_8LA\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/rosatis-pizza-scottsdale-3?select=mQwuZtnqjGeFv7_WMljQzg#mQwuZtnqjGeFv7_WMljQzg\n\nThin Crust Pizza, $18.75\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/rosatis-pizza-scottsdale-3?select=gvuauVRCr_Vh4-OSYTRq8A#gvuauVRCr_Vh4-OSYTRq8A\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/rosatis-pizza-scottsdale-3?select=LGQ1IzFFUuF40_zzEv95xg#LGQ1IzFFUuF40_zzEv95xg\n\nBreaded Mushrooms, $5.95\nMozzarella Cheese Sticks, $6.95\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/rosatis-pizza-scottsdale-3?select=QRQkkXUPr3oPQ5S1G3NtvQ#QRQkkXUPr3oPQ5S1G3NtvQ\n\nTiramisu, $3.99\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/rosatis-pizza-scottsdale-3?select=KoGLjma1iQXgJvJT5vUpFA#KoGLjma1iQXgJvJT5vUpFA\n\nWe enjoyed both the Double Dough and Thin Crust Pizzas.  They each have slightly different flavors and textures.  \n\nI didn't care for the Chicken Wings.  They douse it in Buffalo Sauce here....it's not \"baked\" into the Wing, so it's more like a dipping Sauce.  I prefer it the other way.\n\nThe Fries, Breaded Mushrooms, and Mozzarella Sticks are so\/so.\n\nThe Garlic Cheese Bread is awesome.  I could easily order 2 of those and a bottle of Wine and I'd be good to go.\n\nThe service here is hit & miss.  It's a young group of servers and they haven't quite learned real customer service yet.  However, not much you can expect from a chain pizza joint.\n\nIt's too far out of the way for us to come here on a regular basis.  If I'm paying full price, there are other Rosati locations closer to our home.  However, if there's another Groupon with 50% off, it will be worth the drive.\n\nReturn Factor - 50%
