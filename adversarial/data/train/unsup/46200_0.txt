Good stuff!  As I suspected, any negative comments here must be from those who don't like fried foods period. This chicken is very crisp and not greasy at all. It's a little non traditional in its style, i.e. the thighs are filleted, but I like that because it gives more crispy surface area. The wings are not traditional as they are not coated in sauce, but they provide a nice assortment of sauces at the table. Service was very good. Bright airy environment, I will definitely be back many times.
