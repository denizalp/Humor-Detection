Whenever anyone asks me where to eat while they're in town, The Mission is always on my list! I can't believe I haven't written a review here yet! \n\nSome of my team members are visiting this week so naturally we came here for din! I had the Paloma for my first cocktail and it was SO tasty! I love that they put St. Germain in it! It came in a fancy frosted martini glass with a salted rim and was refreshing and delish. \n\nTo start - YOU MUST get the tableside guac because it is probably some of the best guac that i've ever had in my life. I also LOVE their chips - they're thin, crispy, and not oily at all. Paired with their homemade salsa, i'm a REAL happy camper. We also split the grilled little gem salad and this was pretty disappointing. There were no grill marks or char on it whatsoever but the flavors were good! It just wasn't what the menu advertised it to be. \n\nFor my entree, I got the Flat Iron Steak medium rare and added the poblano grits to it instead of the small cheesy rolls that it comes with and it was TO DIE FOR. The meat was cooked perfectly. I loved the tomatillos on it, and overall, it was just really flavorful. In my opinion they should serve it over grits all of the time! I enjoyed it with a glass of house cabernet and they paired perfectly together. \n\nAll in all, we had a great experience and I still stand firm behind my recommendation to colleagues and friends! :) \n\nP.S. SO sorry for no photos - the restaurant is pretty dark and hard to take quality photos! My OCD just didn't even go there. ;)
