Perfect breakfast with a cute friendly environment. Perfect brunch atmosphere. A small quaint place to sit and enjoy some coffee and great conversation. Loved the omelettes, pastries, and the friendly service. They made you feel like a regular and when you're visiting a city, that's a great thing to find.
