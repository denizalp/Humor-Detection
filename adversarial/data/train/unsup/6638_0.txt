Oh sweet lord! I think I've found a place to satisfy my craving for sweet things.\n\nI first heard of Gelatology from my cousin, who told me about it before they opened their doors officially. It's right near a coffee shop called Serenade, where we frequent often for a place to study. I'm glad she took me here because everything about this place is spot on!\n\nWhen we entered, we were greeted right away. The interior was bright, fun, and enticing -- a perfect fit for a gelato shop! The guy behind the counter happily explained the process of making gelato along with giving me and my cousin a tasting tour of all the different flavors available.\n\nAmong my favorites that I tasted were the strawberries 'n cream, pear and gorgonzola, and the Fior di Latte (which I heard is the traditional, authentic flavor in Italy). Initially, I thought flavors like the pear and gorgonzola weren't going to be good, but was proven wrong when I ate the samples. I ended up going with the strawberries 'n cream flavor because I wanted something slightly sweet.\n\nI felt like the tastes of the gelato were true to their labels. It literally tasted like what they were advertised as, so I wasn't let down when they gave us a sample of each flavor.\n\nThey also have a small baked goods section, which I chose a Nutella biscuit to munch on. The biscuit was so good, but I feel like it would be better paired with coffee or some other hot drink.\n\nWith a unique array of flavors that not all gelato shops have, I think Gelatology did not disappoint. I can't wait to come back for more!
