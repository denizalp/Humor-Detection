The food was excellent. My friend got the lobster carbonara and I had the Loup. We were quite uncertain about which wine to have so the serveur had us try some (we had different one, because different food) and I must say it was on point.\n\nMake sure to come in early so there is some of that chocolate cake left (we didnt have the chance to try it but I'm sure it is as amazing as the rest!)\n\nWe will be back !
