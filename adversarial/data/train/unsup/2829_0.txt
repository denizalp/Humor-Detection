HERE'S THE DEALIO. I would've given them 4 stars but I knocked them down for this very 1 reason. Here it comes, are you ready? Ok, sit down. \n\nMy friend is gluten-free. Not in the \"I'm a hipster and so I think being gluten free is cool even though I don't know what gluten is,\" but in the actual \"has weird body reactions can't process gluten\" type of gluten-free. Therapy has many gluten-free options so we decided to go there. WELLLLL my peeps, she orders an entree CLEARLY MARKED GLUTEN-FREE and then when our food is about to come out, our server asks whether my friend is actually gluten-free BECAUSE THE SAUCE IN THEIR GLUTEN-FREE DISH HAS GLUTEN. This was after my friend confirmed before ordering that the entree was entirely gluten-free. So, that's a MUY BIG PROBLEMO, seeing as how you're representing that a dish does not contain a certain ingredient, but in fact it does. And that certain ingredient can cause health repercussions. Can someone say lawsuit? I mean, would you say that a dish doesn't contain nuts (for the nut allergy peeps) and then later when the food is about to come out ask if it's okay that it has nuts?? NO WAY JOSE. That would be a personal injury attorney's dream. And then, their solution is that my friend eat it without the sauce bc \"it's still juicy\" and the other entree she tried to order would take 30 mins. I CANT EVEN. Also, it was not juicy and it was bland. So bye Felicia. That's my story. \/endvent\n\nThe good part: the drinks are good and my food was good but overpriced f'sho. I'm just glad I'm not gluten intolerant.
