The beer selection is pretty good here. You will want to order a drink right away. It comes in handy for the ordering. Once I figured out how to order it went smoothly from there. \n\nThe hotdog was definitely really good. The menu includes things that pair well together. Use that as a guide if it's your first time. It helps when choosing your toppings. \n\nThe tater tots are normal tots. It's the dipping sauces that make them great. You can try any sauces that you like. I suggest to skip the plain ketchup. I didn't know any better and asked for ketchup.
