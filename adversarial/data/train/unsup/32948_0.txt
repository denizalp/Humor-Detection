I recently started working in the area and have been to the Roastery a few times now.  So far, so good! The lattes are good (although a bit strong for my weak tastes) and reasonably priced. They also give a discount when you bring your own mug.  \n\nThe service has been fine on my visits, although I haven't been in when its super busy.
