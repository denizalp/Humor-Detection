If there is one thing I mass about ol' Chambana - it's Red Herring. This place is just so wonderful. Where do I start?\n\nMy typical memory of it would be walking in on a blisteringly cold day. I'd be greeted by steamy warm, earthy air. My glasses would fog up and I'd go blind for a moment. Once the fog disappeared I'd be greeted with a wide variety of the community - from the still thinks-it's-the-70s hippie to the like-oh-my-god-check-out-my-North-Face-fleece! sorority girl - everybody is represented. Definitely more hippies than greeks - but yeah. I suppose I fall in the middle there and never felt out of place.\n\nThe place is staffed mostly by volunteers who as I recall get paid with a meal for a certain amount of work. Go there for a little while and you'll quickly get to know the staff - they're all great.\n\nSo next it's time to order. They have their daily menu listed and it's always different. Prices are not bad - $5-8 will get you a full meal as I recall.\n\nSo the food - I have yet to buy something here that wasn't fantastic. Maybe I'm easy to please (as some of the other reviewers would make one think) - but geeze - it's all so great! There is a clear stand out though - the BBQ tempeh sandwich. I've tried to recreate this item at home (since I now live halfway across the country!) but I just can't get it as good as Red Herring did.\n\nI've taken many people here - from red blooded meat lovers to normal folk and everybody else - and I have yet to hear a complaint. Fantastic place - highly recommended!
