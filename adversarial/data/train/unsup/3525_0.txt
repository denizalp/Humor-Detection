Worst customer service ever! I asked if they had a satisfaction guarantee if there were printing errors, to which they responded, \"How about next time I go to church I ask for a guarantee that God is perfect too!\", followed by a \"why don't you find another print shop\"! I was too stunned to say anything for a while after my question and his response, so I finally just said \"maybe you're right\" and hung up. At no time was I anything but pleasant to him.
