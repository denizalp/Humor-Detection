KEVIN LEPINE DOES NOT DISAPPOINT!\n\nIf you have never heard of him than you will be in for a treat!\n\nHis show is similar to Anthony Cools and Mark Savard but just like the others, he has his own style and twist as well. Not for kids under 18. I REPEAT, NOT FOR KIDS UNDER 18! What Kevin brings to the table depends on what kind of crowd he has. If you and\/or your party has the \"Party like a rock star\" attitude, than you guys will have an awesome time! You will have a more awesome time if you volunteer and are able to be put under. This the most important part of the show. If nobody volunteers, than I wouldnt blame Kevin for not having a good show at all.\n\nAs for the show, everybody has fun whether you are the one hypnotized or the one watching. Dont worry, he doesnt make you take your clothes off or anything like that, BUT be prepared to laugh and be thoroughly entertained.\n\nSo after eating some wings, go check him out. When I went, they were having a promo for 2 for 1 tickets. I wouldnt mind watching him again and actually volunteering now that I know what to expect, but that doesnt mean he will do the same antics as the last show.
