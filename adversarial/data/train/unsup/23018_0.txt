I was so disappointed in this place. =\/ \n\nWe came here for my sister's birthday for dinner. I ordered the mushroom risotto. I usually don't eat a lot so I don't even finish my plate. However, their plates here are tiny. I finished almost the entire thing. For $20 a plate you would think it would be a pretty good size plate. The mushrooms were very flavorful. The risotto however was extremely bland and had no flavor whatsoever. My boyfriend ordered the tagliatelle bolognese pasta. Let's just say he left the restaurant still hungry. The sad part is the dish was delicious. \n\nSince we had a huge group, we had two waiters. One on each side of our table. The side across from us got their drinks, food and check way before we did. It took almost 30 minutes for us to get our check after requesting it and to top it off it was incorrect. The only plus for me was was my lemon drop martini that the bartender whipped up that wasn't on the menu. We spent a total of $60 and left hungry. We won't be back.
