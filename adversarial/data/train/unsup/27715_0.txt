Well, what you can you say... the service is bad! That's what's supposed to happen. So everyone played their part and made it a great experience. \nThe food... Ok. I mean what do you expect, 5 star cuisine?\nAt the end of the day, this would normally end a 2.5\/3 star review. But for what it was and the expectation... you have to go all out and give them a 4.  Why not. 5? Well... the food did take a while to get to the table! A 4 is still respectable!
