Had to up the star rating here. Sure, the interior is still the capital of Grime City, but the super gyro is tasty and the chicken boti, while small in quantity, is still a good dish. Plus, I didn't see any bare feet this go-round. Seriously though, the gyro meat is solid. Moist, spicy and flavorful, it's def the star in this sammie. As usual, prepare to wait 10 min for your order. (Call ahead!)\n\nNew tastes: \nHummus (avoid)\nGreek salad (sub par)\n\nHmmm. Maybe it should be a 2.5 star rating....
