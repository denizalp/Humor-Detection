We had a great stay at the hard Rock.\n\nThe hotel is located about a half mile off of the southern part of the main strip.  It's definitely in walking distance though the area in between the two can seem a little dodgy at night. A cab costs about $10. Beware of the $3 surcharge if you pay with card. There is a bus which will take you directly from the hotel to the mall at the northern part of the strip. Ask about the schedule and make sure to get there early as seats fill up quickly. \n\nThe front desk is right off of the casino,  in the main area of the building. Everyone was very friendly and helped us get situated quickly and offered up several recommendations for food and things to do. \n\nThere are several wings with rooms located throughout the building. The rooms were very large,  comfortable and the restrooms were  nice.  Beware of the mini bar and other items for sale.  If you pick one up and put it back down you're automatically charged. The CVS accross the street has everything you could need (including liquor) for far less. \n\nHousekeeping was great and kept everything very clean and tidy. \n\nThe building has a few restaurants,  none of which are excellent,  but all of which will do if you need a quick bite.  I especially recommend that margaritas at pink tacos.  There are also a few shops including two coffee spots (with surprisingly good espresso)  and a tattoo parrot. \n\nThe casino itself leaves something to be envied.  While it has all of the games and tables found at all casinos,  the floor is small and the dealers aren't always the friendliest.\n\nThis is a smoking location,  however they have a great ventilation system so we didn't notice it and our clothes didn't smell.  Our room was non-smoking and didn't smell either.
