TERRIBLE SERVICE. Waiter was very rude and took over an hour with my food (even though I only ordered toast and eggs). They weren't even packed, yet my food came out cold and stale. I thought this would be a nice restaurant because of the great location, but I was wrong. Please, don't waste your money here. There are plenty of other restaurants around the area that have much better service and good quality food, unlike this poor excuse for a restaurant.
