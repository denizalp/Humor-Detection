Quite good for this kind of joint. Portions are large and good to share, if you choose to. Our wait was about 5-7 min on Dec 30th, mid-day. Table was clean and server was pleasant. Brought our tea out promptly followed by some tasty bread. Actual food took a bit longer then i'd like but nothing too bad. If not for nasty little kid screaming behind us like he is being murdered, it would be nice little lunch. \n\n4 stars never the less. Good place! Try their 7 cheeses grilled cheese!!! \n\n\"I like\"\n\nEugene
