Sometimes you can get great core service, but some ancillary thing can leave such a bad taste in your mouth you just don't ever want to go back.\n\nI went into Mirabelle's this morning for a big ol cup of coffee and a lil snacky. I was greeted by a pleasant girl and purchased a delish pastry. They don't have large coffees (and their French Roast is FAR inferior to other places in town). Total on the pastry and not large coffee: $4.25. About a dollar more than I would have liked, but not out of this world expensive. Straight out of low cash, I whip out the card and she drops the bomb: $5 minimum on credit card purchases.\n\nI recognize I am being a bit melodramatic by freaking out about this, but tactics like these by retailers are in violation of their agreements with the credit card companies and they really piss me off. Consumers are third party beneficiaries of these contracts: we pay (in more ways than one) for our credit cards and all the good stuff that comes with them. I fully understand why retailers do this, as credit card companies charge a percentage on all transactions, with minimum charges on smaller purchases. The minimum charges are more significant on small-dollar transactions. I get that. Stores don't have to play the minimum purchase amount game, though. The have other options, such as offering a discount for cash transactions or not accepting cards at all. They also can empower their clerks to waive the limit if the customer balks.\n\nSo, the net result? You already know this chubby bastard ordered another pastry. It was also tasty. However, I ended up spending almost $7 all told when all I wanted was a (larger and better) cup of coffee and a lil snacky.
