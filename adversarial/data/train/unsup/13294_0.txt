Super annoyed & pissed! I'm walking thru the store w\/my nephew, husband & niece,  (mind you were in the store almost 10 minutes at this point) & the security guard asks my nephew if I was w\/him.... I'm standing right there, & proceeds to tell me that I can't have my purse in the store!!! I don't carry a giant purse! I understood at first (he said it wasn't against me over & over  but didn't take my nieces purse from her, as we were paying  2 other females w\/ pretty big purses (way bigger than mine) walk in the store & he approaches them but doesn't take thier purses away from them!! I asked the cashier why that was & he had no answer for me!! Why isn't this person at the door checking bags as people walk in instead of approaching them in the store mid shopping making people feel like shoplifters! I shop quite often at the one on flamingo & Pecos & NEVER HAVE THEY MADE ME FEEL LIKE A SHOPLIFTER!! I know I'll NEVER spend another dollar at this location!!
