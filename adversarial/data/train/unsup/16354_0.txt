I hate my morning flights out of Sky Harbor, but there is one place there that makes the check in and security line a little more tolerable. Cartel Coffee Lab on the C Concourse. I will make a quick run down there to get my latte before the flight out of AZ. As good as any of the other Cartels in town, this place has great service and awesome coffee goodness that will get you thru that flight with the crying kid and odd smell that is coming from seat 8C.
