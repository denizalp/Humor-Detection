I had an appointment initially with Lindsey for an ombre and a cut, it ended up looking patchy after a couple of days because the toner didn't take in well, but the cut turned out fabulous. I emailed the salon to inform them about my patchiness and unevenness colored of the hair and they called me right back on within an hour (which was surprising because they close on Sundays). I got scheduled with another stylist 3 days after named Candace, she's absolutely amazing. I got my hair toned a few shades darker without a charge. I am truly happy with the results and would definitely recommend this salon to anyone who wants to get their hair done.
