Ordered a Dog-ables arrangement via 1-800flowers who contract out to this florist. The picture says it all, the first pic is the first sad arrangement that browned in 12 hours, the second looks like it got hit by a car and we are still waiting a week later on a third. Normally Id just ask for a refund but its Easter, this is what she wanted because it reminds her of her poodles. DONT USE THIS FLORIST
