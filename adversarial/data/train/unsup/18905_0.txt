BabyStacks Cafe is the locale formerly known as Babycakes Cafe.  I am updating my review and adding another star because I am truly a fan of their pancakes.  In fact, I have yet to encounter a pancake that didn't make me swoon.  The non pancake dishes and even the coffee are whatevs, but the pancakes are reason enough for me to return again and again.  Carrot cake and Red Velvet are my favorites on their regular menu, but keep an eye out for their seasonal specials because THOSE are spectacular, particularly the pumpkin pancakes... yummo! \n\nI am glad I only live around the corner, because the wait times on the weekends are ridiculous.  I have done it once and learned my lesson. (Boy, was I grumpy!) Weekday brunch dates when my husband rolls into work after noon are wait free!  Stick to the pancakes and you won't be disappointed!
