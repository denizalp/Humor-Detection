I waited about 40 minutes for my appointment with the optometrist, thought I had an appointment. The exam itself was fine, though there was a lot of disorganization apparent through several staff interactions I observed.\n\nAfterward, I was browsing frames and had questions about the cost, but the staff told me, verbatim, \"It's not worth calling your insurance to get the exact pricing until you're sure you want to purchase them. It's a hassle to call back then if you decide then you're not getting them.\" They weren't sure whether or not I could be eligible for their 2-for-1 promotion in addition to my insurance benefit, and couldn't seem bothered to find out.\n\nI think the kicker was when I asked about their hours they explicitly said they were really busy Sundays but there was only one employee then, so don't come. I wondered, if you know you get a lot of customers at a certain time, wouldn't it make sense to staff appropriately?\n\nThanks, but I'll take my money elsewhere. I'm going to shop around, and if you can't accommodate that, you won't get my business. Don't go here.
