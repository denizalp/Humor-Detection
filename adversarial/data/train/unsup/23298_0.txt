I am pretty sure, every time I've ever visited Vegas (which is a lot), I've made it a point to visit Mon Ami Gabi.  It is fabulous!!\n \nThe experience is started with the warmest, freshest french bread you'll find this side of globe.  It's served with a yummy salad of carrots and pads of melty butter.\n\nAny dish you order will be delish, and the alcoholic beverages you choose will knock your socks off.  I've only had one bad experience there - my husband got food poisoning from a raw steak (he asked for it \"still mooing\").  I warned him it looked too raw, but he ate it anyways.  So, the restaurant can't lose points ;-)\n\nThe frites are excellent, green beans tasty, and any steak on the menu is fabulous.  I haven't tried a dessert there yet, but plan to soon.  Going back for our first wedding anniversary, the perfect place for a romantic dinner... Also, if it's a warm evening, ask for a table outside - you'll get a fabulous view of the Bellagio water show!
