I really like the double wide. That being said, it doesn't get 5 starts, because I have had some bad experiences there (plural). Their veg menu is awesome. The veg faux chicken wings are to-die-for! Most everything I have tried there was good, and their brunch has some interesting and delish veg options. \n\nThat being said, I have had Turrible T-u-r-r-i-b-l-e service there more than once, and from different waiter\/waitresses. They don't really seem to care if you need anything or want anything, and even when you ask, sometimes you don't get. I have also had food come out two shades gray of luke warm and then come back definitely microwaved, yet still delish...\n\nOverall, if you have time to wait and tons of patience (or are drunk) go there, they have good food and beer. If you are in a bad mood or rushed, skip it.
