Northeast Ohio is fortunate to have many great burger locations.  Swenson's, Flipside, B-Spot, Skyway, The Rail, are just a few examples.  This is not one of them.  \n\nI was in the area on a Saturday afternoon and craved a burger.  I walked in, and the place was nearly empty (bad sign for lunchtime on a weekend).  I proceeded to order a double cheeseburger and onion rings.  The total was over $11 (I ordered a water).  They charge $.40 for grilled onions on the burger...\n\nI took in a seat in a booth and soon received my food.  The burger was wrapped tightly in paper, which was odd because this was not \"to go.\"  Anyway, the bottom bun was completely soaked in grease.  I regretfully ate anyway.  The burger patties had zero flavor.  Also, for an $11 meal, I expected more than THREE onion rings.  The batter was way too thick and overpowered the measly onions inside.  \n\nOn top of this disappointment, the staff consisted of high school kids who were on their phones and ignoring the few customers that were present while I was there.  This is the worst burger experience I have ever had.
