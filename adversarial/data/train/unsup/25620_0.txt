This place has went down the tubes.  My friend and I had appointments today. Walked in the girl that was mine was sleeping on the couch when we walked in. She was not very friendly and didn't do all of the things that make up a pedicure. I paid for the $45 level 3 and got a massage a little rubbing with a pumice stone, no cuticle removal.  Sucks should have complained but I was so pissed  off I wanted to remain calm.  The woman next to her had to keep telling her what she should do next. \nWill never go back.  Don't waste your time this place looks dusty and dirty inside.
