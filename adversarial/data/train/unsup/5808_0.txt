Another Food Network find.... \n\nSupposedly the best thing cheesy \"Chef Beau\" ever had was the onion soup from here..... In looking at Zinc it boasts some local awards for its French cuisine... I am on vacation sure why not. \n\nService Stellar. Frankie was super funny, polite and ensured we felt like we were his only table. \n\nThe food: \nI did get the onion soup and it was good.Yes the crispy gruyere was yummy and the soup was good but not the best I have had....HOWEVER the scallops were probably the best I have had in a while. I got the scallops with black lentils and mustard cream... I give those two thumbs and a snap around the world. They were perfectly seared, sweet, buttery and huge. The lentils were firmer than I am used to but not unpleasant. The mustard cream was a perfect topper. We also got the parma\/truffle fries were good. The fries were not greasy, crispy and the aiolis that accompanied them were a good complement. The curried chicken sandwich was well liked by my boyfriend. Other things ordered at our table: duck confit sandwich, chicken salad and house fries.  \n\nOverall: great place to grab some lunch, excellent service, don't believe the hype about the onion soup.
