Moksha Yoga is a specialty type of hot yoga that is developed on a series of postures and each class practices those same postures.  For this reason, I don't practice Moksha very often, I like to constantly learn new postures and challenge myself by adding things to my repertoire.  That is not very Yogic of me, I know, but it is not very Yogic of you to judge me, so there!\n\nNow that I am done having a fake argument with my implied reader, I will continue my review.  I think with this special breed of yoga comes a certain attitude to those that work there and I have to say I don't like it.  What is more, last time I was there I rented a mat that squeezed out a puddle when I lay in it.  When I returned it, they told me they just washed it and it must not have dried.  Unless they use a detergent that smells like footn'ass, I suspect a little Pinnochio action. \n\nThe school does offer \"small room\" classes that are not hot and are not Moksha inspired but if you're planning on getting into yoga, my suggestion is to start somewhere else.
