If I could give zero stars I would. A girl name Jess helped my friends and I out. NO customer service at all. It is my 21st birthday she didn't help us out at all. Rolled her eyes EVERYTIME I had a question. I have never had one of these before, and was asking questions and she continued to be rude even after I said it was my 21st birthday. We had to ask someone else to help us.\n\nJESS WAS VERY RUDE.
