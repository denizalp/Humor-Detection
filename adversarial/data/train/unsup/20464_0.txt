Could this place be anymore crowded? I can't get down the aisles, due to crowding of staff, other customers running into me. One gigantic cluster fudge. I did end up buying Kale for my greek tortoise but that is everywhere so I won't be returning. Even then there is no order to checking out. Everyone just cuts in front of you and my God I couldn't get out of there fast enough.
