2010 Opening day of Rehab and to avoid the chaos and cuz he can, we get to party in a cabana at Skybar.  Peaceful without the Rehab mess...no bumpin elbows or pushing ur way to get around.  Just like a secluded personal party at the biggest party that day.\n\nHostess was pleasant, made sure she made drinks for everyone, and our food orders came out quick.  Beautiful day, Dj spinning hot beats, gorgeous people, infinity wading pool, and the real lounge spot upstairs.\n\nSecurity is tight but friendly.  Not sure why you would want to go elsewhere from here but if you do (like someone begging you to check out the rest of the pool scenes), make sure not to wonder towards the HRH Beach club cause once you do, you'll have to go ALL the way around...through the casino, and Rehab to get back to Skybar.  Not that I didn't love the experience of walking through the casino in my bikini and heels but wasn't what I had on my list of things I had to do that day.\n\nGood Times as always!! =P
