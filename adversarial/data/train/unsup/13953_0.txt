Attended university but couldn't stay because the professors were inhospitable, inept, and the traits of the instructors passed to the pupils. As an international student it was an unbelievable waist of resources for me. The worst is the low regard of intelligence the peers hold for Americans, which is absolutely absurd and quite frankly hilarious considering the university ranking of which I am currently attending. I recommend not attending unless this school is a third or fourth choice needed for a degree. In addition, if you are American expect to be treated as though you are an indignant with a low intelligence quotient.
