The food is better than typical bar fare - my husband and I both enjoyed the food - but I cannot recommend this place because we had such a bad experience here. \n\nThis was our first visit to Duke's on McDowell Road, which is pretty close to our home. Great location for a sports bar and a cool place to watch sports on a hot summer day in Scottsdale. \n\nWe went to Duke's to watch Game 7 of the NHL Western Conference playoffs, and the owner refused to put it on in the main part of the bar, despite multiple customers' requests.\n\nHe told hockey fans to go to the pool (billiards) room to watch the game. No one went.\n\nAs we were leaving, my husband told the owner that we would have stayed longer if we could have heard the game. \"What do you want to hear, the puck going into the net?\" he says, laughing at us. And he tells us, \"See ya later,\" telling us if we don't like it we can leave. Who does that??\n\nWe weren't asking him to turn off the Dodgers game. We wanted him to turn off the sound for baseball and turn ON the sound for hockey.  \n\nWe'll never go back to Duke's. Scottsdale has many other, better choices.
