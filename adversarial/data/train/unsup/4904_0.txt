Bizarre location at an outlet mall-same typical inflated prices as other non-outlet locations. Really disliked how half the store is packed with boxes right at the front display windows- guess they don't have a stock room?\n\nSeveral employees just standing around, far too many for the size of the shop and the limited amount of foot traffic this place seems to get. \n\nStore isn't juts vitamins though, has an expanding section of beauty products, including shampoos, conditioners, lotions, scrubs, and cosmetics. Don't recommend buying here though, since the products are taped-shut- wish they'd put out a labeled tester bottle for each fragrance, as few are inclined to buy without knowing that major aspect of the product.
