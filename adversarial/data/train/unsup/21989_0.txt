I love sushi...Who am I kidding? I love food!  But sushi is towards the top of my list when I'm deciding where to go to dinner.  So when I searched for new sushi places near me, I found Nori.  The reviews seemed good, and the recommendations were right up my alley.\n\nHad a little trouble finding the place, since the address directs you basically to  Desert Ridge Marketplace, but to the corner of Deer Valley and Tatum.  Ended up calling them after driving around for 5 minutes without having a clue where to go.  When we got there, the patio had a couple tables open and the inside was half full, so we decided to sit outside.  \n\nI took advantage of the check-in free edamame and we looked over the menu.  I love tuna poke so the tuna poke roll was a must have, along with the softshell crab appetizer and another of their specialty rolls.  The server was incredibly nice and attentive.  She came by several times to fill up our water, and make sure we didn't need anything else.  I'd give that part of the experience 5 stars.\n\nNow for the food.  The tuna poke roll had crushed Doritos on it, which was an unnecessary addition.  Plus they were stale and just stole from the taste of the fish.  The softshell crab, which I've had at other sushi restaurants, was bland and the mango salsa it came with was hardly salsa at all.  It was more a salad, sans lettuce.  Just large chunks of cucumber, tomato, mango, and red onion that had very little flavor.  \n\nI think the biggest reason I gave this place only 2 stars was the price.  We had two rolls and an appetizer, without drinks, and walked out of the place for $50 after tip.  Hardly the price point I search for when it comes to so-so food.  Unfortunately, I don't see myself coming back to this place.
