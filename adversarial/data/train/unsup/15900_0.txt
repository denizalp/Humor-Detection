If there is a place on the entire planet to avoid when it comes to shoes, medical shoes or orthotics - this is the place.\n\nEverything in the store is extremely overpriced.  That's not the worst part though...  \n\nLack of selection, overpriced, yesterday's fashions pretty much describe the goods.  Oh ya, all of the staff there have a terrible attitude. \n\nThe place  inside is a pure dive as well from the display racks to the carpet to the wall colours.  The place is also extremely disorganized so prepare to waste a whole lot of time as the staff search for sizes.  They usually take what you want and return with a bunch of poor alternatives that cost significantly more.\n\nAVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE.   Not worth your stress.
