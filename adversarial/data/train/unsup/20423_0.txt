I love the funky pink building.\nI love the authentic decor and traditional Spanish music that was playing.\nI love the cute little preggo chick that seemed to do it all (hostess plus waitress for ALL the tables).\nI love the food - tortilla soup and enchiladas for me and beef tacos for my guest.  Delish!\n\nHowever...\nI do not love the bathrooms (seemed kinda unclean).\nand I do not love that they only offer chips if you order the guac.  Pardon me, but giving me several salsas before my entree but no chips is just straight up rude.  DON'T YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I LIKE, NAY LOVE, CHIPS?!?! It was practical torture, but I simply didn't have room for guac. We tried to pay for chips alone, but were again told we could only have chips if we bought guac.  Weird.
