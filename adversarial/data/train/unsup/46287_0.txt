I know what you're thinking... It's ramen, how good can it be? Well, it's that slurping good!!! \n\nMy wife and I sat at the bar because we always find it enjoyable to share our dining experience with others. To start, we ordered the pork bun which was a harmonious balance of sweet and salty. Next, I dove into the Morris Ramen! Wow! It's a ramen broth mixed with noodles, pork belly and a soft poached egg which translates into heaven for your stomach! Finally, my wife ordered the Veggie Miso and added the beef short ribs. At first, I thought it was strange to add meat to a vegetarian dish, but the combination actually worked well together. The veggie broth was full of flavor and the short ribs were extremely tender. \n\nPut on a shirt you don't mind getting slurp stains on and get to Morris Ramen!
