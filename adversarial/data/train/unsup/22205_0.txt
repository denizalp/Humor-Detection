This place is amazing! I cannot get over how awesome the staff is! Everyone is so friendly and always there to answer any questions that I have. Dr. Blacker is very friendly and gentle and explains everything thoroughly. \nLeigh Ann takes such good care of me! I feel like I have friends every time I come in. I highly recommended to everyone! Plus, you have a beautiful view of the ducks while you're in the chair and the office is clean and beautiful!\n\nI'm here for braces. Dr. Higgs from Aquila Dental sent me here to prepare my teeth for a full mouth restoration and I've been in the best hands from both offices! I still have a long road ahead and I guarantee it's all going to pay off and my smile will be astonishing ! I can't thank everyone enough!\nWorth 10 stars here,  you'll see :)
