Tried this place for lunch after church and it was pretty good. We both had pulled pork sandwiches with fries. The pork was very flavorful and the fries were fantastic. However, it should be noted that they cook their barbecue in a variety of spices that I found to be too spicy for me to be able to finish my sandwich. I could see the red pepper flakes very easily and since I don't eat spicy foods at all, I wasn't able to finish my sandwich. Prices also seemed a bit high. We may try it again if we're in the area.
