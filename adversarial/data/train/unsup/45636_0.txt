After all the hype, I finally got to experience this buffet.  It is an ok buffet, but definitely not a contender for best in Vegas.  They have a variety of desserts, but no real standout dish for me.  The wait was down the ramp, around the ropes, but only took about 30 mins.  Maybe it was over-hyped and my expectations too high, but I don't think I would return to this one.  I heard this buffet has steadily declined since Steve Wynn sold the place.  It is one to try once to rest your curiosity, but if you miss it, you will live.
