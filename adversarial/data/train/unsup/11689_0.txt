My food was ordinary. My friend and I got the Maria pizza. It was not good, and we left about 1\/3rd of it. My other friends got the Factory pizza, they said they really liked it. The beer selection is OK for a bar. The staff were friendly and polite, but didn't know much about the beer. \n\nEDIT: George, my review was honest and reflects my opinion. However, I have updated it to better reflect my opinions, and that my other friends enjoyed their food more. The Maria pizza was unenjoyable, we left about 1\/3rd of it. The beer selection is limited (imo), and the waitress was unable to answer my questions about the 2-3 of the beers I asked about. Attacking a customer's review in this manner will do more damage to FG than my average review will.
