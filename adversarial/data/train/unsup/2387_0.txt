To be completely honest, if I didn't need work clothes so bad, I would have turned around and taken my dollars elsewhere given the customer service I received in this store.  I usually don't think any person providing some sort of service to me sizes me up, but I definitely felt like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman courtesy of a staff member. Yes, I'm wearing jeans and a thermal top on my day off- doesn't mean I don't dress well usually and trust me, I can afford to purchase the clothes that your store is selling. I was there for awhile, and she eased up a bit, but as someone who worked retail for many years, I was more than a bit shocked by her bad behavior.\n\nThat being said, NY&C is a great place to get stuff for work!  A friend told me about this store when I was being whiny about needing more work clothes and it definitely fit the bill. Lots of great pieces, almost everything on some sort of sale and they give a teacher discount on all purchases!\n\nI left the store with $150 worth of goods, supposedly a savings of $124.36.  2 pairs of pants, 4 tops, a sweater and a pair of leggings. So, even given the bad vibes and lack of help, I was fairly happy with my purchase.\n\nGreat product, but customer service needs some work.
