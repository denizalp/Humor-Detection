This place is what I would call the \"Speedy Gonzales\" Mexican food.  They remind me of that little Mexican mouse ~ extremely quick, small and ready to go.  \n\nThis is a convenient location if your near I17 and Happy Valley.  They are a fast food Mexican joint, but I enjoyed my meal.  \n\nLikes~ it is very cheapo-la to eat here.  I like how they have their restaurant set up with several flat screen TV's broadcasting sports and news (you don't get that at Caramba's nor Carolina's)...  I had their Carne Asada Torta meal.  It was very good and extremely cheap.  I've also had their Carnitas Torta and Burrito and their Pollo Asado Quesadilla, all were very good.  Did I mention they are cheap to eat!\n\nDislikes ~ NOT Eco-friendly using the dreaded styrofoam, offer only Pepsi products with a few Mexican sodas, no brewed ice tea, no beer and their salsa.\n\nFor a quick bite to eat, it's a good place to go for \"Speedy Gonzales\" Mexican food!
