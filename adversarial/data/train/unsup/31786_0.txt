The worst experience at this location. Will not go back again. The enterprise Markham location is by far the best. \nMy friends arrived from Asia and Niagara and leaving the next day for Montreal. I made a huge mistake suggesting this location. There's no care in the preparation of the food. Basic prime rib not available at 7:45pm? And the place is half empty. \nReturned my cod cos it was so over cooked the edges tasted like cardboard. Unacceptable because I specifically asked for the sauces to come on the side but it was all over the cod. \nMy friends steak was cold??!!!! It's a steak and the waitress had the gall to say it was perfect and it wasn't that way. Even though we had our meals redone this shouldn't have happened. \nBasic food and yet they couldn't even do that \nNo effort no care no business \nAnd we were a group of 10! Paid over $330! What a waste!
