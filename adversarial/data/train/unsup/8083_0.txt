This is my least favourite music shop in the city.  I can't think of any reason to go here.  And I am pretty sure this is the only music shop in the city where I've never bought anything.  \n\nFirst of all the snooty, hipper than thou attitude permeates the shop.  And this is the only shop I've ever found this in.  It is present in the new location and was around in the last location too.\n\nSecondly, the selection, at least for CDs, isn't anything to get excited about, new or used.  The only thing I can remember being excited about was over a used copy of the Japancakes' cover of MBV's \"Loveless\".  \n\nThirdly prices are high here--especially for new CDs.  \n\nSince getting into jazz, I have not bothered to stop in so I can't comment on that specifically.\n\nTickets?  Just go to Soundscapes--I don't think RT would have anything that SS would not.  \n\nThe only way I could ever recommend this is store is if you like being looked down upon, think the world begins and ends with Arts & Crafts, are living off of mama and dada's money, reside in the area and can't be bothered to travel beyond Queen West.
