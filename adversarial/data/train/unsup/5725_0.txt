Came by for dinner the other night. The highlight of the meal has to be the talent working here, from the hostess to the waitstaff, the talent here is much better than the strip! :D\n\nService by the staff is excellent being courteous and attentive!\n\nFood:\n- Chicken Karaage - Nicely fried, chicken wasn't too fresh and there were at least a couple pieces of white meat.\n- Bacon wrapped mochi - Decent.\n- Miso Black Cod - Definitely worth a try. Pretty good.\n- Beef Tongue - Very tender and flavorful.\n- Ichiza DX Ramen - Buta Kakuni was okay, on the coarse side and slightly over cooked. Ramen was okay and soup was rather heavy.\n- Yellowtail tartare - Unique with rice, fish, and chips all sandwiched together\n\n~$27\/head dinner after tax and tip.
