Stay away from these guys.  If there was a way to rate them a 0, I would.  \nAmerican Home Shield uses Advanced Home Services as a contractor and even though we had full coverage (minus a $100 deductible) to cover the new water heater and the labor, Advanced Home Services quoted us $780 out of pocket to do the replacement.  They said the items were \"required by code.\"  Liars!  We did it ourselves and didn't do any of the quoted items because the City permit inspector said they weren't required.  What a surprise!  The only thing we had to pay was $78 for the inspection from the City.  We saved $700 by NOT using them.  By the way, when we told them we weren't going to have them do the replacement because of the ridiculous cost, they offered us a \"discount.\"  What did they want to do, reduce their thieving to only $680?  We didn't pursue because we were so disgusted.  How about just giving a reasonable and fair price that's representative of the work?   \nWe also lodged a complaint with American Home Shield and filed a review with the BBB, hoping we can help someone else avoid these jerks.
