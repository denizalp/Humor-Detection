So happy I found this place... Didn't realize what  a dump LA fitness was until I went in and checked this place out.\n\nand extra $100 bucks a month is worth being able to use an obsessively clean locker room\/sauna\/steam, have a locker, have room to work out...\n\nI have found I spend 3x as much time at the gym being at Village vs what I spent at LAFitness... it makes working out go from being a chore, to being something desirable... atleast for me.\n\nThe ONLY thing I can complain about is the price, and it's hard to complain about it because I like the place so much...
