Oh my, these were some of the finest tacos I've ever eaten. We ordered the Pastore, marinated pork in sauce made with authentic Chihuahua chilis and pineapple. Carne Asada, cooked and flavorful flank steak. All tortillas hand made and delicious. I added the saut√©ed onions with Maggi sauce from sauce bar that are sooooo gooood. The cheese quesadilla melts in your mouth with an extra thin handmade flour tortilla. The gorditas were so tasty, shredded beef with green sauce and potato and beans. True authentic dining experience. This will be a regular stop when in Phoenix.
