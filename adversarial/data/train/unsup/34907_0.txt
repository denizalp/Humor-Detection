We decided to try Musashi on Friday night after reading some other Yelp reviews and I'm happy to say it was a great experience!  Everyone in there seemed like regulars (several were commenting that it was busier than usual on a Friday night), and some seemed to have \"their table.\"  Just like another reviewer said, I always take it as a good sign when I visit an ethnic restaurant and see it full of people from that ethnicity.  We were definitely in the minority at Musashi and so I knew the food would be very authentic (and awesome).\n\nThe service was a little slow and disorganized, so that's the only reason I can't give Musashi 5 stars.  I ordered the vegetable tempura dinner that came with rice and miso soup and it was fantastic.  We also had the vegetable spring roll appetizer.  My food arrived to the table about 15 minutes prior to my husband's sushi.  Would've been nice to eat together but it wasn't a deal breaker.  Like I said, a little disorganized but otherwise very good.  \n\nWe will definitely go back to Musashi - great food, authentic experience and well priced.
