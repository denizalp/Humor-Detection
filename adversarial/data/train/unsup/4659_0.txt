Decided to visit this place a few months ago when they were located near the postal depot and found the food expensive for the portions and nothing special.  Then, we went to eat at Trattoria Restauranton on Edmonton Trail and found it was no longer there and this restaurant had moved from their old location and taken up the space.  It was decorated better than Africana's previous location which was dingy and dark, so we decided to stay and try them again. \n\nThat was a mistake!  When we received it, the whole meal was cold (not even warm!).  When the waiter finally came by and we advised him our food was cold, he abruptly told us that was not possible.  I welcomed him to try it, since he seemed to imply that I was lying, but he said he would take care of it.  He returned 5 minutes later with the platter and said he had reheated the food for us.  When asked how, he replied \"in the microwave\".  I couldn't believe that I was paying $80.00 for a platter of microwaved food - the beef, chicken and shrimp were now hard and dry, while the casava was limp and soggy.  \n\nWhen we told him this, he said that the food is the way it is supposed to be.  I asked for the manager and after waiting for 10 minutes asked for the bill, which took another 10 minutes - and still no manager!  I asked the waiter why the manager hadn't come and he said he was busy.  I went to find the manager and saw him sitting near the bar having a drink with a friend.  When I approached he said \"yeah I know, I'm coming\".  I told him I wanted to leave and he told the waiter to take 5% off my bill - for a platter that was still 3\/4 full and inedible.  \n\nI paid and left and will never return.  \n\nDo yourself a favour and avoid this place - horrible food and even worse customer service.  \n\nI recently tried a place called Safari Grill.  If you want to have African food done right, go to Safari Grill, it's about 10 minutes from here with amazing food and exceptional service.
