Birthday shopping for clothes. It's been forever since I've shopped here, not much had changed.\nOne employee was rude, the managers were nice.\nStore was clean, some good deals.\nAll in all it felt like dropping back to 1979, back to school shopping. Did you know they still make velour jogging suits?
