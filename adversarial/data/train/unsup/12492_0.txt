When you don't follow the law and inundate a neighborhood with your employees (even worse when your customer service rep states they will stay out of your neighborhood- soliciting is against the law_) and they show up and laugh because they know the cops won't enforce it...shame on you.  I hope your company gets no new customers.  Worse yet, half of your employees didn't have the legally required identification badge and your employees thought that was funny.  I don't care how proficient you are, you have chosen to break laws and think that's ok.
