Had chicken roti wrap from here twice and it tasted pretty good, but found a strand of hair in it both times. Wish they were more careful when making food. The food itself tasted pretty good, until of course I saw the hair and had to throw it all out. Until I have a better experience at this place, I can only give it 2 stars, based on the fact that I found hair every time I've had food from there.\n\nAt least if it was once, I understand, mistakes happen. But twice doesn't seem like a mistake.\n\nTaste-wise though, it's a pretty nice restaurant.
