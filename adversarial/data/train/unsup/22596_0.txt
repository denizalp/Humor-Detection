This place is an awesome breakfast place! I recomend having the Eggs benedict here.. I have gone here a couple of times and the service and the foods never fails me.. the wait may be a bit long.. i dont recall them taking reservations either.. But for a party of two i only waited for 5 minutes.. If your not in a rush and love a great atmosphere this place is Eggceptional!  For those who are own a strict diet you may choose to order egg whites with wheat bread, that's what i ordered when i was on a diet.. still a great meal! try now! it's located off of green valley parkway and pebble..
