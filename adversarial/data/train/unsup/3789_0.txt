With the moniker change from Foodland to Shop 'n Save, the first thing you notice about this tiny store is the shelves seem to be more stocked than before. One of the worst things about this place as a Foodland was the empty shelves from bad management. \n\nThe bakery has changed, not for the good though. One of the best things about Foodland was the bakery. It's still adequate. The deli does beat Foodland's, best to wait for the two day sales that Shop N Save is famous for. \n\nAll in all, for the people who are stuck shopping here, the change over to Shop N Save means the shelves are stocked at all times. It's still not a great grocery store especially for those of us who Market District is the top of the mountain.
