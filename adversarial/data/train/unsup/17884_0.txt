But really, I think Presti's was the best cannoli I've ever had in my life. Also, i've never had so many handsome men offer to hold the door for me (why I am not spending more time in Little Italy?), but, I digress. There's also a few free parking spots directly in front of the bakery (score!).\n\nPresti's really does have it all. I love the high-energy environment and open space concept. When I visited, there was a wonderful mix of students, business folks on lunch breaks, and diverse and intergenerational people overall spread amongst the tables working, studying and having coffee chats. This immediately made my heart really happy to see so many different people coming together. When I walked in, I immediately grabbed a number and waited for it to be called. The cases were packed immaculately with everything-- cinnamon buns, cheesecakes, creme brulee, brownies, custard puff, cassata cake... literally anything you can imagine to entice you while you wait your turn.\n\nIt was a little busy when I visited, so I ended up getting a cannoli to-go while my friend opted for the cassata cake. There's probably not words to appropriately describe this cannoli-- but the filling was so fresh, creamy and unique. I feel like I could pick it out of a lineup. I tried a bite of my friends' cassata cake, and it was layered to perfection without being overly sugary. Sometimes cassata cake can be a lost art when the cream\/frosting is a suger overload, but this one was perfect. Overall, I don't really think you can go wrong with anything here. But then again, has anyone ever gone to Little Italy and had a bad experience?! Come get yourself a treat, you deserve it.
