came here for dessert after having ramen since i've been wanting to try this place for a while now. love that the inside has white marble detailing and their logo is a baby penguin - bonus point for them because i LOVE penguins! \n\ni also love how you're able to watch them 'roll' your ice cream from the other side of the counter.\n\nsince i went near the end of the day, most of their flavours were sold out, so i tried \"love @ first bite\". presentation was a bit slacky in my opnion, compared to the pictures on their instgram, but it may have because they still had lots of orders to complete. \n\nhowever, taste wise, the ice cream was delicious - not too sweet - and you can also tell that their whipped cream is made fresh and not from the can as it has that milky taste. \n\non the downside, i was a bit disappointed that they didn't have the matcha flavour anymore as i really wanted to try that one. \n\nit's a bit pricey at $7 for each \"polaroll\" but i think it's worth trying. \n\ni may go again to try \"taro with a twist\" but if they bring back the matcha flavour, i will definitely be coming back to try it.
