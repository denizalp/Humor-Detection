We walked in at the tail end of their night. Only a couple tables were finishing up their meals and I'm pretty sure I was ready to eat the arm off of my date (not enough meat, not worth the effort) or else I would have felt a bit guilty about coming in so late. \n\nThis also meant fresh, hot, well-made food. It took a bit longer than usual to receive our order, but it was completely worth the wait. Nothing had that old oil flavor that I tend to taste in a lot of Chinese food. Prices were fair and the portions hearty. I even enjoyed the tea that they set out. The shrimp in the walnut shrimp were really tasty and surprisingly full sized. They aren't cutting corners and getting those tiny lil' frozen buddies you can find at Costco, thank god. House special chicken was crispy, fucking delicious, and fully satisfied my hangry state. \n\nMy only complaint is that the place is too quiet. Though it was fun to hear the employees yammering to each other in another language back in the kitchen, I found myself speaking in hushed tones which is not in my nature. Blast some K-pop. Okay, so maybe not blast it, but at least turn your zither muzak up.
