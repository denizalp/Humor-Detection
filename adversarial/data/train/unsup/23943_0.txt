I really liked my burger.  Good quality.  My husband got the larger \"rehab\" size patty while I got the smaller \"relapse\" burger.  His burger seemed a little bit too large and was extremely messy.   Since my burger was also a good size + a lot easer to eat I was glad I went with the smaller option.\n\nCall me a stickler, but I was really bothered by the fact that some of the employees were wearing flip-flops and other open toed shoes in the kitchen.  I know that laid-back beach style is sort of a thing here....but really?  What other gross health code violations are going on back there?\n\nAll in all I liked the place, I like the food, but I can't make myself go back in light of that one little thing (inappropriate footwear) especially when I can find many other burger places to get a good burger.
