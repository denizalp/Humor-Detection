What a great idea-what a poor way to run a business. Part of the experience of wine tasting is the fun of conversing and discussing wine with the proprietors. In my case, this not only did not occur, but we felt like we were an annoyance for asking questions. It is unfortunate that the attitude was \"I am in the business to make money\"-even if you are, your clients should never get the feeling that that is the ONLY reason you are in the business. A little personal attention and kindness go a very long way-this was not what was felt by myself nor those in my party.
