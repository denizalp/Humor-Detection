We visit this amazing buffet every time we travel to Vegas.   It is hard to beat the regular selection and the atmosphere.  They are attempting to mark items as Gluten Free for Celiacs and the gluten sensitive, but there are a scarce number of items so they need to work on increasing the selection of GF items they offer.   We noticed a more self-serve atmosphere which is good and bad.   I like being able to get drink refills at will, but not everything is offered at the self serve beverage area.  We always find this buffet clean and the food warm and tasty.
