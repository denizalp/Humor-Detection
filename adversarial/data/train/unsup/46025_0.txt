I always call in my order & when I arrive I tell the girls that I'm picking up an order for 100 wings & 10 XL pizzas! I love to see them scramble looking for the non existing order. Finally I break & give them my real name & order & they crack up! This pizza is amazing! Wings are great & so is the salad bar! \nCustomer since 2008! \nThe dough is like no other in the 602!
