Nothing fancy, not a whole lot of variety on the menu, but everything is just right. My go tos are the papa taco and the flip taco. The potatoes in the papa taco are really tasty, and the chicken in everything is kind of amazing. I'm a big fan of the medium (green) salsa, but all 3 salsas are very good. The hot is quite intense, a bit too much for me, but I'm not a mega spice guy. The fixings for the tacos include finely chopped cabbage, pickled onions, chopped raw onions with cilantro, and fresh lime, and I use all of them in every bite. In case the term \"flip taco\" is new to you, as it was to me, it's basically a chicken and bean tostada with a soft corn tortilla laid on top. I eat it like a sandwich. It is *delicious*. Friendly service, easy parking on the street. I go often. If this were located in NYC, there would be a line around the block 24\/7.
