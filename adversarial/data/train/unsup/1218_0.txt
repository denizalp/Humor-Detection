Gotten take out sausage pizza here many times and I dig it.  They have great coupons in the local coupon books.  People are super nice and they are always working their ass off when Im in there.  Place is always busy and thats a good sign.  Cant comment on delivery time because aside from having a newborn at home or being paralyzed I think people can get off their ass to get food.  If this place served 40s it would be a 5 star joint no doubt.
