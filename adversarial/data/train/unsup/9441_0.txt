This place use to be great but on Monday night I called to have some food delivered I called at 4:30 the women on the phone was so rude I should have just hung up and called another place!! But I did not she told me I would not get the food until around 6 I said fine so we waited around 5:50 our food arrived I placed everything on the table and opened it up everything was room temp I was shocked! How dare them have us wait and to serve our food cold. I called them and the rude lady answered the phone again did not want to transfer me to manager finally she did but the manager did not even care all she kept say was what do you want me to do?? ignorant people work here and have no clue on what customer service is I WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AGAIN 55.00 bucks down the drain this place SUCKS!!!
