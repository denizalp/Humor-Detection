My friend came over with some vegan nachos from Simply Pure one day & it was so good that I kept craving it. So we finally go to meet up there & the girl at the register was a sweetheart. I wanted to try other things but the portions were too much. \n\nI got the nachos with cashew cheese & tacos. They both were big portions  & had similar taste but we enjoyed it. My friend got the lasagna & a pressed juice & let me try it. It was delicious! Everything was good & there was a good vibe.\n\nThe space was a little tight in there & I had a double stroller so I had to leave it in the outside seating area. It would be too cramped for me, my 4 kids & friend to be eating in there so we just found s nice place outside by the play area. We'll be returning.
