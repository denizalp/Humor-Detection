Chicken and waffles. Chicken...AND waffles? It sounded strange at first, really it did. We gave them a call for a delivery and a very quick 25 minutes later I opened the door to a wonderful aroma. The fried chicken was AMAZING, the skin came right off and the seasoning was just right. The eggs were cooked to order perfectly, over-medium. It came with a side of gravy that I ended up just eating by itself, it was delicious and I don't even like gravy. Once that was done, I had two warm, fluffy Belgian waffles covered in butter with a side of warm syrup and it was in that moment that I understood. Chicken and waffles makes all the sense in the world. Whether you love it already or you are curious to find out, I highly recommend Jorge's Chicken and Waffles!
