This place is located in the California hotel.\n\nI can't believe I almost forgot to write a review for this place.\nMy friend just came back from Vegas and bought me half pound of beef jerky peppered and once I opened that bag up my memory of vegas came back. \nOh but the jerky here is super delicious and flavorful. The peppered jerky is made from brisket of beef (which is all in my tummy after a day) is so tender and addictive. I'm almost tempted to call Shige O. to ship me some since he lives out there :P\n\nAside from jerky this place is pretty much like a crack seed store except with less variety.  \nIts pretty much a taste of hawaii in a sense. I'd recommend them for the jerky, so go and check it out if you're in the California Hotel!
