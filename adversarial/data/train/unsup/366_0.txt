Backyard Taco!!! OMG this is the best hole in the wall place I have found out here in the valley! \n\nDon't except fancy schmancy, because you won't find it! What you will find is some pretty great street tacos.\n\nThe place is cute; it looks like someone gutted out a house turned the yard into a parking lot & place into a restaurant.  They do have tables inside & a nice seating area outside (they do have the portable heaters outside too) \n\nThe menu is up on a board its easy and simple to follow. You can see the meat cooking on the grill behind the counter.  The kitchen is a busy place, the place is a busy place, but everything moves fast & smoothly. \n\nI have been to Backyard a few times now and I can absolutely say the carne asada tacos are the bomb! So So good!  I'm sure the chicken & veggie ones are too.  Also dig the carne asada burrito, so damn good! When you check in on Yelp, you get a free order of chips and salsa and let me tell you they do not skimp out on the chips!  They also have a great salsa bar to pick up some extra too!\n\nBackyard Taco is quickly becoming my favorite grubbing place to go, in a moment of weakness I took my son and his boyfriend and now they are begging to go back too....so much for keeping it just my spot haha.\n\nOh and they even hand out a Repeat Eater Card after the 10th visit you earn a free meal, I see this happening soon haha.
