Lets see, \n\nMy review history is akin to that of a born again virgin. I used to give it up (5 stars) so easy, but now it takes just the right restaurant to get the fiver.\n\nI had been waiting to go to Salt for a while, but always seemed to end up elsewhere. Kevin Sousa really has left his foot print on Pittsburgh, and seems to be rather polarizing by some standards.\n\nWhile I was waiting for my family to arrive, I had a drink at the bar with my girlfriend. Their cocktail menu looked pretty good, and I would actually go back there just to drink. I ordered the Rye. I love the matter of fact names for all drinks and food. The Rye was a great drink, and I am anal retentive about Whiskey. If I didnt have a bottle of wine in front of me, I would have loved to try more.\n\nMy family ordered, and shared several apps: Carrot, Hamachi, Biscuit, and Risotto\n\nI think my gf and I were the only people that liked the Hamachi, but I love cured fish.\n\nThe carrot and biscuit were both dripping with flavor and extremely delicious. The risotto was nice, but nothing spectacular.\n\nI ordered the lamb as my main, and also got to try the pork and duck.\n\nThe lamb and duck were wonderful, and perfectly cooked. Both were succulent and juicy. The pork was also cooked just right.\n\nYou can tell Salt has its food prep and cooking down to a science.\n\nWhy 4 stars? Nothing really jumped out at me as otherwordly distinct in flavors. Everything was great, but not a memorable \"oh man, I remember back when such and such was on that menu and DAAAAAAAAAAAMN that was good\".
