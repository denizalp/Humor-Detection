Didn't like it AT ALL since the first day. I felt that they wanted to steal my money in all of my visits.\n\nI went for LASER HAIR REMOVAL. DO NOT GO HERE. Results were not good at all and It was very painful. I even got blisters every single session because they are not good in technology.\n\nMy mom was very excited for me to get this procedure because she just got it done in another place and she was AMAZED that it was so painful for me and giving me blisters because she never felt like this. \n\nFew months later i got it in another place in my vikini where is supposed to be wayyyy more sensitive and hurtful that the armpids and didn't hurt at all. Results were excellent from the other place and i didn't even have to go back because the hair was reduced more than 50 percent.
