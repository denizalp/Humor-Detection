This used to be my favorite restaurant.  Now, it's permanently off the list.\nThe calamari was rubbery, under-cooked, and the breading was coming off.  Likely the oil wasn't hot enough.  My steak sandwich was very raw-disgusting.  I had to send it back and I don't like sending things back.  It ruined my appetite.  My friend ordered their chocolate cake-like desert (first item on the desert menu) and it had a long, black hair in it!  The waiter correctly didn't charge us for it.  In addition the wait staff seemed under-staffed as our waiter was literally running around the restaurant and had little time to give us attention.  Long periods of time went by where we wondered if he was on a break or something.\nI'm very disappointed as this used to be someplace that I held above other restaurants.  I was very wrong.  I'll never be back.  Save yourself the disappointment and try someplace new.
