I went at 12:49am on the night of Friday the 13th, 2016. We went to the drive thru and no one said anything for a whole minute so we just went up to the window. A guy named Frank opened the window and refused to service us even though all we wanted was ice waters. We're in Arizona and it's 100 degrees outside isn't it illegal to refuse water? Frank needs to get fired. If we had to buy something to get them we would have but he told us to drive around the drive thru all over again just because he never said anything at the intercom. How is that our fault? There was only 1 car  next to us in a double drive thru when we went. After we waited forever behind a car he told us to go around and wait in a now long line for just ice waters. I don't know what that guy's problem was, but customer service is definently not what Frank should be doing. In case there is more than one Frank at this location. This guy had some tats on his arm. I will never go back to this location, not as long as Frank works here.
