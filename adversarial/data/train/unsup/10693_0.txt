I hadn't checked Yelp before going here, but it's on the light rail and I've been wanting to eat here for weeks. It just so happened that I was split between two offices today and Blue Fin was in the middle. So, I exited off McDowell and was treated to the amazing aromas of BF. \n\nUpon entering, I'm greeted by the nicest lady I might have ever met. She admires my plaid jacket. (BTW, there's a Yelp sticker on the door!) After reviewing the menu--which has a good selection of choices--I decide on the panko fish over white rice. That wonderfully kind lady was sad to see me leave because she wouldn't get to see if I liked my food. Waiting at the LR station, I was glad I picked up an extra pair of chop sticks because some crazy-eyed man was looking at my bag. Although it had been about 10 minutes from the time I received my food to the time I walked back into my office, the food hadn't really cooled down all that much. Nice! The fish was super crispy on the outside yet marvelously moist inside. And the rice was good too. \n\nI'll definitely be back, kind lady. And hopefully I'll be able to eat there with you so you know how much I appreciate great food and expectational service.
