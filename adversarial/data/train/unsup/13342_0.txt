Worst service of all of the hooters I have eaten at. To start we asked for a booth but was told it was reserved for larger groups but then took up to a table that sat the same amount as the booth. Then 15 mins in we flag down a waitress and tell her we have been here for 15 mins and still have not got our drinks ordered. She said one sec ill get your waitress, no sorry or ill go ahead and get the order for you. 10 Mins later we flag down who we didn't know at the time was our waitress and I state we have waited now 25 mins and still have not been asked our drink orders. Again there were no sorry or anything she just said I can take your drink order. We ordered our food at the same time for fear it would be another 25 mins just to get our order in. At the time we submitted our order our friend asked for his fries to be brought out asap because he was hungry. The waitress said okay. 10 mins later and no fries, my friend asked the waitress who was walking by about the fries and she said she would find our waitress. She comes back without our waitress and says the waitress said he didn't ask for his fries first. We all said he did and she even said okay when he asked. Our waitress comes to the table a few minutes later and gives some excuse saying they were short staffed and the manager today was a no-show. The funny thing is it seemed like it was just her that was neglecting us. The other waitresses were tending to their tables. No apologies for not putting in the order to have the fries come out first or the amount of time we have to wait to be serviced, nothing and to add more insult, when we asked about the memorial day special for veterans\/military which was options of a free entree like the free 10 wings we were told her manager decided they were not going to offer the advertised deal and decided what he would offer is buy 10 wings get 10 wings free. No sorry about that or anything. Needless to say, we won't be spending our money at Hooters again.
