I'm a grown-ass woman and I like to day drink in parks. I have a 'real' job, but still find time for park drinks with pals every so often. If you don't, you should. \n\nTrin Bellwoods is a hipster haven on steroids. Bocce ball, leash-less dog park, lots of picnic tables and bike paths. It's often taken over with people doing those weird tightrope walking stunts between trees and playing croquet. They're my least fave people in the park, but that's my issue, not yours. \n\nYesterday, my friends and I were facing a group doing couples Yoga. It was disturbing, but a lot of fun to watch and analyze. As we drained the bottles the comments got funnier. Ruder? Same dif. \n\nCentral Park, Villa Borghese in Rome, Waterloo Park in London; these are some world class parks. Trin Bellwoods is not even close to competing with one of those downtown retreats, but it's still pretty fun to relax here and people watch.\n\nPEPPER POINTS: For their decent washrooms in the community centre in the south-west quadrant of the park. Very handy for park drinking. Did I mention park drinking? No? Oh, well I like it.
