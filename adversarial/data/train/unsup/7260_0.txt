Go for the drinks, go for the atmosphere, maybe even for the music, but skip the food.  The food I ordered smelled like dirty dishes, and the waiter took so long to come back to check on me that it wasn't even worth asking him to bring me something better\/that didn't smell like dirty dishes.  THe margaritas were awesome though.
