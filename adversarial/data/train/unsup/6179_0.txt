The rating is on solely on food quality.  \n\nMy brother and I came here after spending a day in Cleveland.  We saw the $25 for $50 promotion,  so we decided to come down and use it. \n\nYes, it is an adult club,  and we knew it was a bit ridiculous to eat there as though it was just a regular restaurant, but whatever. We weren't sure what to expect,  but we figured,  \"why not?\" \n\nThe food was surprising good with impressive portions. I ordered the fettuccine alfredo, and the loaded fries.  My brother ordered a hamburger and onion rings,  and we split boneless chicken and pizza. The chef had a great sense of item food prep time for every item came out at the same time (without any item being cold). QUITE THE SKILL; VERY RARE. The bartender\/waitress was great as well, as so the manager. \n\nMy brother enjoyed his part. I enjoyed mine. The fettuccine was to Italian restaurant quality. I was quite impressed.  The fries were great as well. Both fresh and flavorful.  Everything was great except for the pizza. Constructive criticism: modify the dough, and add more seasoning in the sauce.\n\nBottom line: no matter the reason for entering Diamond's- your stomach and taste buds will leave happy.
