Worst attitude from the person who was checking customers' recipients. She was located left corner of exit with small warmer\/heater and small black cushion pallet. She never moved her feet for the customers. All customers including me tried to go to her place to check their recipients. I saw that some customers was dumbfounded about her attitude because they smiled bitterly. She was happy today's evening with heater and cushioned pallet,  but customers.
