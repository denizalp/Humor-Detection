Went for wing-night last week. Very yummy, had the hot wings and teriyaki wings. Not bad at all, juicy and straigtforward, and a fair price for your wing quarter. \n\nThe service was fine, not bad, not over and beyond either. Now the enviroment......\n\nThe whole place reminded me of my parent's recroom in the 80's. Plenty of room, and the seats are comfy and well used. We went early, and noticed it was the working crowd along with us, coming in and eating their dinner. food looked nice.\n\nK
