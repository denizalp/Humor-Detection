Walking into a very very hot room with a large wall of mirrors you face to admire yourself and others with a teacher who makes you feel like a loser if you take a break or leave the room so you won't pass out is not healthy, mindful, nor is it yoga, at all. Sanskrit is incorrect and the teaching is uninspired. A really wierd method. Forced sweating is aggressive and exhausting. Turn the heat down, take care of students who are dropping like flies and learn correct terminology. Nice lobby though.
