The stylist was nice and patient but the two at the front desk were complete bitches!!! The chic I spoke to ( who was also very confusing on the phone) got my son's name wrong, my number wrong, claimed she was the one who I spoke with yet was certain she spoke to a \"dude\". But when asked for a name I gave her mine at first and she replied with \" your sons name is Jennifer?\" I said \"oh sorry my sons name is Cruz\" so she got everything wrong and pretty much called me a dude. And I'm 100% sure I don't sound like a dude. The other one standing there stood there with bitch face, even later when I smiled at her when she didn't deserve one.... Not sure I'll ever go back again even though the stylist was awesome and she is the only reason i gave it three stars.
