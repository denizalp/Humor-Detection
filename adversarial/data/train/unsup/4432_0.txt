Wow-- this place is good. Need a taco fix? This is it!\n\nWe shouldn't have been surprised that all the meat was shredded vs. grilled or al pastor style but once the initial shock disappeared and my mind opened to a street taco concept other than what we were used to, it was game on.\n\nIf I could order a bathtub full of the barbacoa and then spend the next several days passed out in a tub of deliciousness, I'd be able to die a happy person.\n\nThey suggested a green avocado salsa while we were paying saying, \"you MUST try it!\" So we did. Yum. It's pretty freakin' hot, but when consumed in moderation adds a nice level of heat to the situation.\n\nLooking forward to trying things beyond the tacos-- like an enchilada stuffed with green chili pork, or a burrito filled with the adobada. And I just might have to bring a bathtub next time... I suppose if I succeed, you'll know. Cheers!
