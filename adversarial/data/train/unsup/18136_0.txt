Not sure why everyone keeps raving about this place....\n\nAfter much insistence, I gave up and went to see what all the hoopla was about.\n\nGoing during the dinner rush, I was immediately crushed both in front and back with families of 6 to 8.  No one ever brought bread to our table even though all the tables around us were served at least two or three times.  We requested bread four times and had to ask for our drinks to be refilled.  Still no bread, and I ran out of water so consistently that I had to swallow the food dry.\n\nThe roast was cut with the grain, making it inedible.  Veggies were overcooked.  The famous steaks people are always talking about were nowhere to be seen since they closed the grill.\n\nAs we left, the manager must have seen the unhappy look on our faces and asked if there was anything he could do.  We explained what happened to which he apologized and said that if we sat back down, he would make sure bread came to us.\n\nYeah, cuz the bread is SO good we want to go sit back down and wait for possibly forever again.  GUH!\n\nThanks, but no thanks...ever again.
