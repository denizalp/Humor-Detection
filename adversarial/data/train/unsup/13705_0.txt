We have been using Horizon Pet Boarding & Grooming for nearly three years and found them to be great!\n\nLorraine, our groomer does a wonderful job.   She is also very reasonably priced, as compared to nearby PetSmart, or the Posh Pets in the area.  Those two were our previous dog groomers and we will never go back now that we have found Horizon Pet Boarding & Grooming and Lorraine.\n\nYes she's that good, and a hard working nice person to boot!
