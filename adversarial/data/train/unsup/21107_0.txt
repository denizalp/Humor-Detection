Since I haven't written one of my fun Yelp reviews lately, here I am!\n\nReturning with a ton of new places to yelp about, here is my latest discovery on the King Street strip of restos near my apartment... JOE MAMAS!\n\nDuring TIFF, I was thinking about restaurants I have not experienced or ate at near my apartment.\n\nLiving behind the long strip of restos on King Street, in between John Street and Peter Street, we came across Joe Mamas and had an amazing meal there! And it definitely did not lack in romance in terms of its atmosphere for any people look for a fun date spot!\n\nJoe Mamas is a warm feeling restaurant with the sounds of jazz and R&B music in the background - creating a sexy and sultry feeling right when you walk in. The dark red and deep wooden interior also makes you feel all romanced.\n\nFor dinner, I ordered the Surf and Turf Fettucini, which was packed with juicy pieces of chicken breast and HUGE tiger shrimps - all topped off with white wine alfredo sauce and a small amount of parmesan cheese. This lovely meal was $23, but it was a HUGE portion and did not skimp on the shrimp.\n\nMy friend ordered the classic Honey Garlic chicken, smothered in the tasty honey garlic sauce and cooked to perfection. She paired her chicken with seasoned veggies and some wild rice - all for $20.\n\nFor dessert, we split the \"melt in your mouth\" (as I would call it) RED VELVET CAKE! This cake was absolutely to die for! I am being serious!\n\nAfter our meal, dessert and coffees came to an end, our bill came to around $55, which is more expensive than usual but well worth it!\n\nI would definitely recommend Joe Mamas as a food spot, a key date spot, a resto stop if you are catching a movie at the Bell Lightbox later in the night (it is right across the street from it) or if you are looking for food with that great Southern taste!
