At first I was surprised there was no line, then quickly realized why.\n\nWe were  greeted warmly and with a smile; then this young lady asked us to follow her to a table, as we were following her, \"OOPS there is no table available at this section\", anyway we came back to the front, she went to find a table and came back to guide us to the table.\n\nA few minutes after we seated, our server came to our table to take the orders, due to my eating style I asked for a dish from sandwich section with no dairy on it. After 20 min the server came back and apologized that they can't make it without dairy; I quickly changed my order to medium cooked grilled lamb burger with lettuce wrap. \n\nAs I was chewing slowly, I tried to recall what I had at GR in PH. This burger tasted great and delicious; however lack of amazingness made it less pleasant compared to PH location. I was stuffed but semi-satisfied from the food, service and the dining experience.\n\nBecause of more variety and higher prices I was expecting more compared to the other location but it seems more variety makes it less compelling.
