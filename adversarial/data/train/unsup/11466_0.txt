I e-mailed and received no response.  I called and got a confused young woman who could not tell me what would be served if I arrived at the \"24\/7\" spot at 7am.  I stopped by at 2pm on a Saturday and found a truncated lunch menu, entirely indifferent service, and a space where only two other individuals sat.  I left.  \n\nWhat's the over\/under on this place?  I say 6 months, and I'll take the under unless the PR folks can hand feed some positive press.
