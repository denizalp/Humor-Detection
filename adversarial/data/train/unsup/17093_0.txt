Came in during happy hour to get a couple drinks and watch the gorgeous sunset from 107 stories up, and a great choice it was. I advise getting here about an hour before sunset if that's your motive. We did that and got our pick of tables, but noticed that they started to fill up pretty quick after that.\nThe happy hour here was BOGO free drinks. I ordered two peach margaritas. They came within a decent amount of time since it wasn't too busy. They tasted very good and weren't syrupy or too sweet. I got a great buzz from them and it was a great start to a wonderful evening. \nService was great and everything was super clean! Our seats were also super comfy which was great since we'd been on our feet all day.\nI highly advise making this trip to the bar in the Stratosphere while in Vegas!
