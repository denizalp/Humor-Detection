I'm heartbroken at having to post this low rating. I've used their services two separate times for a month each. I've went from 180 to 165 and I'm maintaining, this final month was supposed to be my final use and put me down to my BMI correct 155. \nHowever, simply because of the unprofessionalism and rude behavior of the receptionist Lajoy I don't think I will ever be back.\nI showed up at 2:40 for my 2:45pm. I saw a lot of people in the waiting room and I said: \"oh are you guys a little backed up today?\" She rudely \"responded we have 6 Drs.\" Not a smile understanding anything just one of the rudest coarsest responses I've ever been given from anyone working with the public. 2:55 I asked if it got to 3pm and I wasn't called back was it possible to get a refund (so at this point let me explain, I have personal clients I see, many of which I've referred here for weight loss, I had a 4pm client so if I wasn't called back by 3 I couldn't be late for my client because this office can't stay on time) she says: \"do you want to reschedule\" absolutely ruder and more dismissively then I've ever been spoken to. (She didn't even address my question at 2:55 I was still just curious if I could even get a refund if it got to 3pm) well after being talked to twice more in humanely then I'd speak to my worse enemy, I said no, no I would not want to reschedule, she flung my money back at me and said here's your refund.\nOne lost customer and promoter of your business because you can't hire individuals that have a shred of compassion or empathy. LaJoy, rudest customer service agent ever.
