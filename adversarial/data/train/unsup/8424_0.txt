First time here with both my wife *and* my daughter. Smiles and enjoyment all around!\n\nYes, Sunday brunch on a sunny day is going to be busy and we were waiting for every one of the twenty minutes that the hostess said it would be. No fault there.\n\nWe started off with a plate of beignets, which had the required heavy dusting of powdered sugar and also a small pot of strawberry jam for dipping\/scraping. Very hot and very tasty. A nice starter while you look over the menu.\n\nFor mains, we each went with omelets or the crabcake benedict. Each was a good portion with plenty of filling and lots of hollandaise on the benedict. The hashbrown potato casserole was very yummt and the omelets also came with a small bowl of fresh fruit - blackberries and blueberries and such. Nice.\n\nVery good coffee. Cappuccino was very good.\n\nService was good, ambiance was great and the food was very good.\n\nWe'll be back to Cafe Monte for sure.
