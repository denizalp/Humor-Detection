Back in Vegas for 4 days, came to stroll strip wo huge crowds today. Stopped in to try out GUYS spot. Nicole served and was excellent in recommendations and conversation. Ordered Vegas frys and the bacon Mac burger, great stuff. Fries are def different and welcome and burger was great. House made ranch dressing was awesome and even the quality of the ice cubes is here. Large square good ice cubes and actual cloth napkins , love it!  Best part of the visit was running into Hunter Fieri , Guys son. Doing an intern at the restaurant! Great great young dude! Big things ahead for him. Can't wait to try some more of their restaurants.
