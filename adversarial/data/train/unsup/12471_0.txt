I have been procrastinating on doing this review, but now it's time I finally get this done!\n\nI was with my previous doctor for roughly 8 years and even though I hadn't been satisfied with him for the past few years, I did not want to go through the hassle of switching doctors. In the beginning he was okay, but over the past few years I would wait any where from 60-90 minutes just to see this guy and he couldn't get out of the room fast enough! Literally 3-5 minutes in and he had a hand on the door knob trying to walk out as I still talking to him and had questions to ask. After my last visit I said \"enough is enough\" and decided to finally make the switch!\n\nI should have done this years ago!\n\nI did some research and found Dr Lee online through some review sites, but basically decided just to roll the dice since he was accepting new patients. Dr Lee is outstanding! This guy has sat down with me for upwards of 30 minutes at a time, answering questions and explaining things to me in great detail! He is the polar opposite of my previous doctor and I appreciate that so much!\n\nI had 2 separate issues that my previous doctor had just chalked up to \"getting older\". What horseshit!\n\nDr Lee treated the problems and resolved everything in a matter of a couple of weeks! Because of him I am back in the gym 5-6 days a week, which I hadn't been able to do for the better part of a year! He seems to take a genuine interest in his patients health and well being!\n\nI really should have done this years ago.\n\nThe girls at the reception desk are always very nice and friendly and efficient. Plus the staff at the lab next door have always been pleasant to deal with as well.\n\nI am so happy to have found a medical professional that I can feel confident in with their work and assessment(s) and medical opinions. \n\nThank You Dr Lee!\n\n5 stars.\n\nAs good as it gets!
