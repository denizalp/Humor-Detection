Started going a few weeks ago- and now I go every week.  It's a tough and awesome 45 minutes.  Annie's Thursday 9:30am class is the only one I've tried, but I look forward to it every week.  I'm completely new to spinning (is it still called that?) and found that the first two classes I had to learn the moves and make modifications, but quickly figured it out.  Great music- super motivating!  I've never sweat more in my life which equals a great workout for me.    The workout is to the beat- they don't measure distance or rpms- just ride to the beat.  I like that.\n\nThe studio itself is beautiful- very clean, lots of amenities - they even let you borrow free shoes and give you clean towels to use.  Erica, the owner, is so nice and welcoming especially for a newbie like me.  The women's locker room is very clean and has everything I need in it-including showers.  \n\nBtw, parking on Tryon at a meter is super easy- but they also will validate from the parking deck if you'd rather park there.
