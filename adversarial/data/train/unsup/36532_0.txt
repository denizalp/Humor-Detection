This place is great! We came in on a Sunday morning and it was busier than i thought it was going to be\n\nI ordered the blazing chicken & waffle sandwich thinking it was just chicken and waffles (didn't read the sandwich part ) it also came with waffle fries which were super crispy and delicious! The waffle is fluffy, crispy on the outside, warm and soft on the inside\nThe chicken was my favorite it was so tender.. The plastic knife cut through it like butter \nThey add this buffalo style sauce but so delicious definitely coming back for this same plate. \n\nMy boyfriend got some red velvet pancakes with fresh kiwi and strawberries the pancakes were fluffy and delicious as well \n\nThe reason why i don't give it 5 stars is because i thought it was a little pricey and it took about 20 minutes for us to get our food.. Which could be because it was a busy Sunday morning \n\nOverall great place if you live in the area
