One word:  Legit.\n\nBeing a southerner at heart and also from the DC area - this place is as close as I'm going to get to some straight up dirty BBQ in Vegas.  I would go to this place just to smell the beautiful, and oh so addictive smells and then head off on my merry way.  Mmmmhmmm.\n\nI have to mention the cornbread right away.  No BBQ joint would be official without some fresh cornbread.  They've got it right and tight!  So right, that I ordered a ton of extra to-go for a party I was attending later in the night.  Even more right, that I asked for a sample while ordering..  Sad, but very true.\n\nWith all the smells, I was a little overwhelmed on what to order.  I had my sides figured out, but my main plate was hard to pinpoint.  I was experiencing one of those \"eyes are bigger than your stomach\" moments..  Oh wells.  After jostling the idea of ribs around for a few, I kept it real and went with the Beef Brisket.  Ribs are tricky and I'm incredibly picky, so I needed to start slow.  :)  No regrets there.  Flavorful and plenty to eat for leftovers.  They offer a few selections on the amount of grub you order, which was neat in my book.  Now, back to the ribs...  They have a variety to choose from cooked according to whatever region in the states.  Loved that!   Next trip:  RIBS!\n\nAs far as sides go, I was also a little overwhelmed in this department as well.   Never overwhelmed in a bad way.  I went all out with the fattiest of the bunch and had the Mac 'n' Cheese, Loaded Mash Potatoes and the Bacon Potato Salad.  Yes, BACON.  POTATO.  SALAD.  #WINNING!\n\nThe service was friendly and they even complimented me on being so small but yet ordering so much.  \"Is this all for you?\"  \"Hell yeah it is.. C'mon now!\"  \n\nCoolest part about this joint (other than the food, of course):  They deliver AND offer party packages where they'll actually wheel their smoker to your party and hook....you....up!   Whaaaaa?! \n\nRollin Smoke has my foodie heart forevs!  \n\n**This is a popular joint, which means.. lines, lines, lines.  Try to skip the food rush and go during a slower time of the day!  Don't get me wrong though, the long lines are worth it in the end.
