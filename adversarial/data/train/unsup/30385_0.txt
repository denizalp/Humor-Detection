Several times I have wondered if there is a place where I can go to get my hair styled and my makeup done and needing something nearby and convenient for my upcoming baby shower I searched yelp and found Primp and Blow.  Down the street from me, affordable and they had an opening exactly when I needed it I decided to give them a try.  Ashley did my hair and make it look amazing in a short amount of time and Lily did an awesome job on my simple eye shadow and lipstick.  She even happily made the changes I asked for as she was working.  This place is exactly what I was needing! You can't go wrong with Primp and Blow.  I'll be using them for all of my upcoming special events.
