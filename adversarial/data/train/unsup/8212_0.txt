I am sure that at least half the visitors to this shop nowadays are Pawn Stars fans -- I am one of them -- but even so, I was surprised by how much of the space is dedicated to Pawn Stars merch rather than actual items purchased by the shop.  \n\nThe shop itself is much smaller than it seems on TV, and I would guess that about a third of it is dedicated to Pawn Stars mugs, shirts, blankets, glasses, whathaveyou. Still though, there were some interesting items to browse through, and who am I kidding? I totally bought an \"I Heart Chumlee\" mug.
