Completely different experience from the first time we dined here. We started in the beautiful bar area where we each had a Mastros signature cocktail. The Fashion Forward was a refreshing twist on the old fashioned and the hubs had a classic martini with a lemon twist. For dinner we shared the chefs cut bone in ribeye 33oz of medium rare heaven! Truffle buttered mushroom and a side of lobster mashed potatoes to die for. Our server Duke was amazing as well as Erma so friendly and helpful. \nOur dining experience lasted nearly 3 hours we truly enjoyed every minute of it. \nMinus 1 star because the gift card that was sent to us from Corporate was not accepted ??? Regardless we are happy to have given Mastro's a second chance.
