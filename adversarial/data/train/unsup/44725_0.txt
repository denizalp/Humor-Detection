I walked in and was acknowledged with warm welcomes immediately. Service was great. They were very attentive. \n\nHad the fried rice, sesame cucumbers and pot stickers  everything was delicious although I wish the cucumbers were served in a larger portion. \n\nI was able to find parking right  in front but I bet it could be a challenge during peak times.\n\nI would go back!
