I traveled 27 minutes to this place because I saw all of the great reviews on yelp. WASTE OF TIME. It was half past 1 on a Monday and they had about 8 donuts. They had none of the gourmet donuts I was looking for, JUST 1 cream filled left, and everything else was regular. Same donuts I can get anywhere. They close at 5 pm and had next to nothing left several hours before close. The lady must have figured I would bad review it, so she gave me a box of half dozen regular donuts to make up for the fact that they had nothing to offer. She did this after I came back in to take a picture....\n\nI get it is a small mom\/pop business, but you are highly rated for your different variety of donuts, so you should have at LEAST 90% of the donuts you advertise UNTIL CLOSING!!!
