Dropped my car to get some repairs and was out with my 2 daughters, one of their' s fiancé and my grandson, so a party of 4  1\/2 and it was early and we wanted food. I didn't really know what was around the area we were in so I went my yelp app and found Crackers & Co Café, we got directions to the place and drove past it, it didn't look like it was opened, went up the street to waffle house, but then said nope lets go back to Crackers, man are we glad we did!  My grandson, who is a year and half is a ham, he thought everyone should be paying attention to him and to get to him be quite wasn't gonna happen, so thank you everyone at Crackers for putting up with him LOL, our server was Felix, and he was good and made sure everything was always filled! I like that, don't like it when my coffee cup becomes empty LOL  My daughter ordered the French toast! WOW that's some toast!! Looked delish!! I ordered the farmers skillet, which had ham, onions mushrooms and country potatoes and eggs, with cheese!!! I got a side order of salsa and that baby was good!!! All the dishes that were ordered looked delish! My other daughter ordered the biscuits and gravy!!! That would have been my 2nd choice and the fiancé ordered huevos rancheros,  again everything looked and smelled delish!! I think next time I am going to try the eggs benny!   Lesson we learned that day, don't judge a place by its outsides,,,,haha
