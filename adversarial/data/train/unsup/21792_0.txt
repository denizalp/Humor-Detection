I was in the Venetian for business and decided to try Bouchon for lunch.   Maybe my expectations were too high but it if I had to describe it in one word it would be \"disappointing\".  My server Douglass was great.  Long time Las Vegan and fun and prompt.  I rarely send back food but the escargo was so bad I did it.  Bad escargot in a french place is a sin.\n\nI might give it another try but with so many other places to try n Vegas, it's unlikely to make the top of my list.
