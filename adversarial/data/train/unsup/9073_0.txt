I used to really like this store, until they hired a new assistant.  He came across as arrogant and condescending and in the end, he clearly had no idea of what he was talking about.  I had purchased a $500.00 Proxxon mini table saw and he told me the saw was top of the line, deadly accurate, but if I opened it, I owned it, no refund. When I got home and set the saw up I realized that it was scratched, had a small crack (minor issues) and the 3\" blade was not square to the fence or the T-slots.  I rushed it back to the store to show them the issues and the young assistant was making excuses for all my concerns.  The manager came out to take a look, and although he was making suggestions of how to compensate for a un-sqare blade, he offered me a refund in the end.  As a professional licences carpenter and craftsman, I can say for certain that there is no way a saw with a un-square blade will ever make a straight (wide) cross-cut, no matter what adjustments you make, the blade will always force the waste into or away from the mitre fence and pull\/push your material into the blade. Very disappointed with the service and lack of knowledge here.  I won't be going back any time soon.
