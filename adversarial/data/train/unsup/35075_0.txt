Wanted to give it zero stars but can't on this review board.  Owner is ignorant (patron enters and says \"oh you're open\" and owner says \"well you walked in through the front door didn't you?\").  Food is absolute crap, disgusting.  Then when you can't finish the food because it's so bad the owner says if you can't finish your plate they will charge you $3 bucks to dispose of it.  Owner says if you don't want to pay the $3 bucks then we'll give you a container (very small) and you gave give it to a homeless person - appalling behavior, worse food.
