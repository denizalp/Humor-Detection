I attended the cooking class held in a downstairs room at this restaurant.  Had an amazing time! The 4 course meal that Carmela  cooked was wonderful.  Only the highest quality ingredients were used and everything was delicious.  Started off with a melon, mascarpone and crispy prosciutto appetizer, followed by a minestrone soup.  The entrees were a gemelli pasta, endive and homemade sausage dish and  a chicken and peppers entree.  I walked away with some great recipes and new friends in  Carmela and her husband Joe. Based on my experience,  I can't wait to try out the restaurant.  I highly recommend the cooking class.  Carmela is an excellent  chef and is so charming!
