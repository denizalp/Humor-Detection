Pretty small bar in Container Park that will benefit big time when it gets warmer since they have outdoor tables and a balcony on the second floor that I plan on lounging at in April.  But when it's freakin 28 degrees on a Wednesday evening in December, I am only here to DRAAAANK!!\n\nYou go right in through the sliding doors and there's the bar and seats.  That's it.  They don't offer a happy hour but they do have some interesting concoctions.  I went with what I thought was the oddest one called \"Alkyhol Dikshunary\" for $10.  Not sure who the crazy scientist in their lab is but I now know what a mix of whiskey, Miller Lite, lemon juice, simple syrup and egg white taste like together.  First one tastes like the feeling I get when my football team makes a field goal.  Two of them got me feeling pretty decent.  I would consider doing the Ickey Shuffle after 3.
