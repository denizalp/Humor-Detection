THE place to stop for ready-made Russian food to take home and enjoy! BF is from St. Petersburg and did not learn to cook traditional food before moving out here and most of the family recipes unfortunately seem to have died with older family members. Our hometown doesn't have much in the way of Russian groceries or restaurants, so it's always a treat when we find a place on vacation.\n\nBF lived here at one point and this was his go-to place. Naturally we stop by every time we're in town. The grocery shelves have all varieties of pickled vegetable, fruit spreads, and buckwheat blends to purchase and enjoy at home. The deli case in the back has everything from fresh-cut creamy Havarti cheeses with dill to thick Moscow ham, both bought in bulk and enjoyed until they're gone. \nBut the best part is their ready-made stuff: fresh pierogies and stuffed pastries, oliveye (Russian potato salad with peas and chicken), and beet salad. These go great with some herring, too.\n\nIf you want to explore some Russian culture by way of your mouth, this is as good a place as any to start. The employees are helpful and friendly, and the store itself is not limited to Russian but is just primarily what we go for.
