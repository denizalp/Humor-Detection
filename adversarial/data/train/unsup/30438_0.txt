Visited with a party of seven thirty minutes before closing time.  Their hours seemed a little early for Las Vegas, but I am not complaining.  They were able to comfortably seat and serve us promptly.\n\nThe staff was very accommodating, and the service is approaching five star but not quite that formal.  I had the 10oz Filet with Béarnaise, creamed sweet corn, and one of my favorites, Crème Brûlée.  All fantastic.  \n\nAs the adage goes--you get what you pay for.  Tenders is not budget friendly, but the food is among the top 10% of any I have had.  Additionally, we discussed business long after closing time.  I never once felt that they were trying to chase us out.  Again, very accommodating.
