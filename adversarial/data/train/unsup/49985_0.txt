So, I had found this practice through their reviews on Yelp, and let me tell you that they live up to what is said about them. I have a very busy schedule and didn't realize how far they were from me (only about a 35 min drive) but their service really makes it worth it. Very professional and great team. Sara had cleaned my teeth and was so sweet and helpful! I was having a bad day the morning of my appointment, and they still let me in even though I was 30 mins late. Ha. Great place and quality work.
