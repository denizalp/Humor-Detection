Had dinner there for my mother's birthday on Friday night.  Sat us on time for 5 people in their spacious side patio.  Restaurant was pretty busy, but service was outstanding.  The table shared the dumplings for the appetizer, they was quite tasty.  Also liked the tempura battered vegetables.  Everyone was happy with their meals, I personally had the shrimp and it was good.  Had some of the sushi around the table and it was also good.  Had awesome onion rings, real thin kind, sort of spicy.  Mojitos were great (better be at $10 a pop) and all in all, another great meal and service.  Been here 5-6 times and haven't had a complaint yet.  Menu seems to have something for everyone, service is great, not cheap, but feel you get you pay for.  Large portions generally.
