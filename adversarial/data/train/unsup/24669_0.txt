Pancetta brought me here... \nbut I left with some Guanciale.\n\nLooking for a fancier Bacon substitute in the GTA, I did some WWW searching.\nWhat is fresh local, what is made-in-house, what is representative of Woodbridge?\nThe answer lead me to this wonderfully designed website.  www.dolcelucano.com\n\nOne on One (www.dolcelucano.com\/one-on-one.php): \n\nA glance at the webpage and it's easy to recognize the level of commitment.\nAnother glance and I dreamt that  I could make my own WaYnE brand Salumi.\nMaybe a dash of szechuan peppercorn, a pinch of...  In my dreams~~~\n\nOff I went to meet the local Meat shop in a well hidden path away from everything.\nIndustrial manufacturing neighbourhood more like autobody shops than food eats.\nWe step inside an average size butcher shop space with various items for sale.\nDry pastas, canned goods, spices, but Salumi take up a good chunk of space.\n\nWe go up to the fridge to discover, learn, browse, smell, touch and admire.\nMeat beautiful meat of various Italian cured and processed varieties packaged.\nProscuitto, sopressata, capicollo, pancetta, guanciale to name just a few.\nAs I pick up what I believe to be my choice of Pancetta, a lovely staff came...\n\nI had a thorough conversation with this Lady about the cooking with Meat.\nLadies, if you wish to gain a Man's heart, simply learn to speak Carnivore.\nAt the end, I was directed to the Guanciale as the Meat weapon of choice.\nLet's just say my dish of Moyin Moyin steamed bean dish was a fan fav.\n\nMy accompanying friend says it tastes like Chinese cured meat...\nbut then everything taste like chinese cured meat to her.   :P\nFyi, many restaurants use Guanciale to begin their soup base.\nWish someone can give me a reason or money to visit this shop again.\nIf I go on a regular basis myself, I'm sure I'll need a second mortgage.
