i just got an ad in the mail from this store and it made me think - most of my reviews are restaurant \/ food \/ booze places ... yet i do other things in vegas ...sadly...one of them is the dreaded shopping with my girlfriend ...as with most guys, my standard of a decent store ( as in women's apparel store ) comfortable seating and hot babes shopping in the store.  I'm always encouraging my girl to shop at bebe ( i try not to be too obvious and suggest oh ...let's see...victoria secret ....in fact , we've never shopped there ) but bebe's \"comfort seating\" is non-existent !!  \n\nTahari's couches are too comfortable....you sink into the couch and 30 seconds later....i'm waking myself up from the loud noise...of my own snoring !!  ( you know what i mean - you first look around - a combination of not being sure  if you  were the one snoring and\/or did anyone hear you....EVERYONE HEARD YOU ....DUMBSHIT  !! ) anyways, i digress....\n\n2 x-mas' ago my girl was looking for a nice leather jacket - found one at Tahari....40% off...but not her size...she was trying to figure out if she could taked a large jacket and have it tailored to a medium size....geez...women ( i'm sitting there in my nike sweatshirt, old navy jeans and flip-flops...yeah...i blend !  oh yeah...and we're looking at a jacket that cost more then all my clothes in my closet ) \" oh honey....bummer...maybe next year.....\"  the sales person says, \" wait...let me see if we have a medium at another store. \" with my best poker face...\" could you ???  please ?!?! \" they didn't  have it....darn !!\n\nfast forward ( or is it still reverse ) to december 2007  same store...similar issue...hell...i even snored after 30 seconds...again...this time though, i awoke to  a hottie asking for my opinion on some jeans she tried on....thank god she asked my girlfriend too and my girl  suggested that i provide some input ....  anyways...my girl finds a leather jacket...in her size...oh great !!!  and to pour a little salt in the wound....on the only rack that isn't marked down....Lord your laughing at me right now ...aren't you ?!?!  and ...she likes the jeans that the hottie tried on...she finds her size...at least they were 50% off...so while my girl is trying on the jeans, i casually ask the salesperson...\"the jacket...it was on the wrong rack...yes ?....it should be 50% off \"  she laughed...sorry...  at this point, i didn't look at the price tag...afraid to....i try to be cool...casual....can't find the f**kin' price tag...son of a ...oh...here it is....$1,200 !!!!  are you shittin' me !! i don't know if it was because of my hands shaking as i held that jacket, the tear in my eye...not sure...but the salesperson said, \" you know, that jacket is suposed to go on sale sometime next week - let me see what can do .\"  she took the jacket, went to the counter, called someone ...i look up...still laughing up there ?!?! she put the phone down...slowly walked over....stopped because someone had a question ...i'm screaming inside - get your lil euro booty over here !!  she final comes over....\"50% off \" ....YEAH BABY !!!! so i buy both the pants and the jacket.\n\nwhat really made it funny for me, as we left the store, my girlfriend commented on how they gave us such a large bag for just a pair of jeans...she didn't notice that i bought the jacket !!  i looked at her, i said \" look in the bag ,\"  she did - she was so shocked that the jacket was in there ! ( see - she knows what a cheap bastard i am !! )\n\ni gotta admit - the jacket does look great on her
