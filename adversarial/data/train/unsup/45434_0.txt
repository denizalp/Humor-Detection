Typical bar within a hotel.  On a quiet Wednesday night, esposa and I sat for over 5 minutes before being recognized.  We ordered a bottle of wine.  Server brought it and two glasses to the table, filled our glasses and left.  No knowledge of wine pouring (i.e., pour a sample, allow client to smell and taste, offer comments).  Spring rolls were very good.  Service was sporadic, with server just checking on us with no chat.
