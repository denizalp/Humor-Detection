The food is fine, but it's the patio that gets ya. You are literally tucked away in the trees with the patio feeling like a little meadow in the center albeit devoid of grass in favor of patio bricks instead. It's both charming and romantic and sets the tone for a great lunch or early evening date if you are looking for a spot to wow. Again, the food is just ok (I got the Rectory Caf√© Salad and a pita\/creamy cheese dish and was satisfied enough, but not blown away), but the service is great. A must when you are visiting Ward's Island (not that there are many other options! lol!)
