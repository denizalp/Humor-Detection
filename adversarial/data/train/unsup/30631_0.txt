I sang this morning....(after Dr. Singh performed LASIK on me) \n\nI can see clearly now...the glasses are gone\nI can see all obstacles in my way\nGone are the pitiable looks that had me sad\nIt turned into a bright (bright), bright (bright)\nSun-Shiny day. \n\nI have never been able to see.  So when I opted for lasik surgery to rid me of my coke bottle glasses, I did some serious research.  I \"interviewed\" many doctors but it was Dr. Singh's confidence and personality that won me over.  He was confident of his abilities.  \n\nOne a lighter note, besides being a doctor that cares about the well-being of your eyes, he is also quite an expert at putting the drops into my eyes..... It usually takes more than 10 tries for me (yes, i'm that scared of those things), but Dr Singh did it the first time. \n\nIf you love your eyes, this is the man who will help you take care of them. I can definitely see why he gets 5 stars in every review...he comes  \"Eye\"ly recommend!
