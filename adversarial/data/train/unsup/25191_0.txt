Took my car in today in preparation for a big road trip, it's older car and I haven't had in shop in a while! I voiced my concerns to manager Phil Halverson that I assumed there were problems, to please have a full check done along with oil change! \nTo my shock all was good! I ended up getting small maintenance item done but was shocked at the honesty of these guys! \nMy service was fast, Friendly, and affordable!! I'd highly recommend this place if your worried about trustworthy auto techs!! \nPhil was very knowledgeable and even checked out my tires to assure me I was good to go on my trip!! \nI would recommend this place to all my family and friends!!
