Coquette has become my favorite little spot-- seriously come here the first chance you get.  It is SO stinking cute & unique. I could go everyday. They have the best french press coffee (even offer almond milk as creamer) with the most decadent macaroons I have EVER tasted. When you bite into them, you get a slight crunch that turns into a soft texture that is just to die for and the flavor is mouth watering.I want to try every flavor but have to hold myself back! \n\nI love to come here to read and relax while enjoying their tasty treats or spend a little time with my husband because he can't get enough of it either! Oysters and cheese\/ meat trays accompany the menu, as well as quiche and various pasties and beverages (yummy champagne & beer options.)  It is just absolute perfection. I cannot wait to go back and take friends.
