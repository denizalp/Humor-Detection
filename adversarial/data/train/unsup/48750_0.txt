tonight was the first night this store was open.  after eating at the dumpling house, we stepped outside and noticed this bubble tea place.  in we went to order our drinks.  prices were pretty much the same as other places.\n\ni forgot to mention i did not want a lot of ice and sugar.  the drink i got was called \"3 guys\" which consisted of tapoica, pudding and grass jelly.  it was pretty sweet and the cup was full of ice.  the actual tea was not bad, but it was just too sweet for me.\n\nwill i come back...  i don't think so.  compared to Chatime, this place falls a little short.  if i was in the area, i would rather go around the corner to Marathon and get a HK milk tea there.
