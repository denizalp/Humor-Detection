This is a great historic bridge. As someone who travels quite a bit, I always appreciate this baby more when I get home. Not all cities take the time to maintain their bridges, so for that, I'm appreciative. This bridge is often included in the picturesque shots of Cleveland we see everywhere. \n\nWhen I mentioned the decent attention to upkeep, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention how much I appreciate the uplighting. The green and blue lights are always working and I don't think I've ever seen a bulb out. It gives me a lot of pride to show the view of Cleveland from the Superior Viaduct with this bridge glowing brightly in the background. It completes our skyline from the Flats angle.\n\nBuilt-in 1918 for $5 million (think about that for 1918 - crazy), it was the biggest bridge of its kind in the world and was helped financed by the bigwigs of the time. Its a cool part of national history and Cleveland history. I'm glad its ours.
