They say the island of Manhattan contains everything. It's not true. At least, there is no bar in Manhattan as Pravda for the communists!\nI definitely love the decor and the theme of this venue. I guess the tiny red part of my brain must be actively triggered when dancing here! All the Soviet symbols, banners with pictures of communists look very masculine. But if you look into the details, the lighting, the couch, the interior, it's actually very sexy and feminine. \nWhen everyone in this bar were standing up, singing, toasting while the Soviet Union anthem was started, I seriously thought of Dr. Henry Norman Bethune, the Canadian communist doctor who had helped China in the war... O Canada!
