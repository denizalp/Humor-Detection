Probably one of the best Italian foods I have ever tasted by a family owned business. \n\nBesides Alice Fazoolis, Folco's Ristorante is another that serves warm bread with olive dip instead of butter. That's already an additional half star, to serve warm bread with non butter dip.\n\nWe love getting their mussels as an appetizer to share. I recommend any pasta here because their tomato juice is \"on point\". All of the mussles are slowly cooked and opened perfectly and are gracefully covered with appealing tomato sauce with herbs. The pasta, well, it's pasta, but it's delicious because of the homemade sauce.\n\nIn the summertime, ask to sit on the patio if there's no construction, it really adds to the feel of dining at a restaurant in Main Street!
