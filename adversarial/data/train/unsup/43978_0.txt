I had Aaron as a bartender there and she was fun, out going, and efficient with everyone and myself she tended to.  A dancer named Veruka was very friendly and professional with me.  I definitely will be returning and would recommend this club to anyone.  Food was great.  Prices of food and drinks were what I would expect and not outrageous.  Great place for a Friday night.  Open till 4 on Friday and Saturday is also a great plus. They have am outside HEATED patio where you can smoke with an outside bar and can even get cigars at.  And I mean GOOD cigars, not those cheap ones.  The floor guys were great too, they were there, but not where they got in the way so you are always tripling over them.   The female DJ is a great bonus because when I go to these clubs, I like hearing a female voice over a male.  So wrapping it all up, great professional dancers, outstanding bartenders, and great music from the DJ.  A must go place in Cleveland!
