If I could give this bank and Over all rating - it would be ZERO!!!!! they tell you, that because of your \"credit issue\" (regardless of if you have any) that you'll be put on an \"opportunity account\"... They'll tell you that you can get off of it within 6 months but that's a LIE. I've been with them for a year & a half...requested 3 different times sitting with a banker to get off, and have basically just been put on the back burner for more than 4 months now. They ARE VERY SNEAKY and will do anything for more money. DO NOT GET AN ACCOUNT WITH WELLA FARGO!!!!!!!!!!!
