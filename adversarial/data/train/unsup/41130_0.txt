I had my daughter's sweet 15 party here this pass weekend and we absolutely loved it. The staff was super friendly and the food was fantastic. I am very happy that I booked my event with them because they did all of the work  for me and it all came out great! We had about 20 teenagers and they all had something to do from pool tables to foose ball to ping pong tables.  I highly recommend this place! Even to just stop by for drinks and food.  My guest all talked about how good the food was.  I will definitely be back.
