I'm itching to change my ratings for Boiling Crab and Hot and Juicy because Urban Crawfish Station is BY FAR the winner. I only wish I had known about this place sooner!\n\nOne major plus is that they do actual combos, which offer you more in quantity than just picking from a la carte. For example, if you buy individually, it's by the pound while the combos can range from 1.4-1.75 lbs depending on what you get. You get your money's worth alone from that. I was absolutely stuffed. \n\nI really like that if you do order the combo, they serve it to you in pots which I've come to learn is SO much better than the tiny bags restaurants usually stuff your seafood in. By letting all the seafood spread out flat inside the pot, it's able to soak in the sauces more and just flesh the flavor out to its max potential!\n\nThe urban mix sauce is also my favorite sauce out of all the similar restaurants in the valley. The flavors just meshed together so well and left me wanting more even when I was completely stuffed. I left as a very very happy costumer. \n\n\nPS: Brownie points for offering frog legs. I haven't seen this appetizer at a restaurant in ages!
