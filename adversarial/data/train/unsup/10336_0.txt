The representative of company named Nityo Infotech Corporation called me and offered discounted online course. Initially I inquired about course fee and other details of the course. In call they said course discount is ending today-itself and asked me to pay the fee. They promised to refund full money If within 15 days incase if I'am not interested. So I agreed to pay. After the payment I noticed the charge made by other name and it is international transaction. The amount also varied what they communicated. Next day I was checking review of the company and understood it is scam. Immediately called the company and informed, I told I'm not interested and asked refund. They agreed to refund in a day or two. Also I sent email. After that many times I tried to call them and unable to reach representative. Multiple email I sent and no response for any email. \n\nPlease stay away from this
