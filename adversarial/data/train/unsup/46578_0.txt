1st time was great...but 2nd visit losses stars.\n-1 star:my food was cold & they scrapped the bottom of the grill for my potatoes. Nothing but burned pieces\n\n-1 star: when I addressed the waitress, she said sorry but did not offer anything else. Reheat my food, new set of potatoes,  discount on bill.....nothing!!\n\nSorry buy off my list now
