The old crew left to go somewhere else. The new crew is very friendly. I didnt realize that the hours had changed under the new crew so they had to kind of hurry us up around 1030pm. The sushi was alright, id say it was slightly better before.\n\nIf anyone has info of where the old crew headed off to, please let me know. Thanks!
