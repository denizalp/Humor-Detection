We've been looking forward to Lidl opening. We loved it but it won't be for everyone. If you've heard of Aldi it's similar better larger\/fancier.  They have great baked items, their produce is very good, and their meats are nice.  They have just about all we needed except e.g. individual cottage cheeses, and whole grain waffles.  But their prices are amazing and they sell other non traditional items at grocery stores like clothing and shoes.  \nThe thing that may turn people off is you have to buy grocery bags and unload your cart AND put back in your cart THEN bag yourself.\nBut the bags are plastic and hearty and can be reused. \nAgain, the baked items like bread are worth at least one visit.\nHighly recommend!!
