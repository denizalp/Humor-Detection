OMG! I love Copenhagen! The fun and unique contemporary designs have lasting appeal. Want to have art on your floors and supporting your bed, as well as on your walls? Well this is the place. \n\nNow, keep in mind: your going to pay an artistic premium for each piece. I tend to have expensive taste (it's a curse) The bed frame I want: $3K. The sheets I bought for my bed: $200; blanket: $800; specialty pillow: $250; couch: $4K; coffee table: $400; bar stools: $350 each (OUCH!). You know what though? It looks amazing! That bedroom and living area will really POP, in all the right ways! \n\nDon't we all wish we could afford the things we wanted? Sigh. Maybe I'll have most of that stuff before I retire :\/
