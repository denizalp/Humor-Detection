Here I am sitting in front of the building because they don't want to give me my car because of the way I'm paying. Someone from another state is paying and they won't accept it. they took the form of payment yesterday for the down payment but today nope. So who knows if I'll get my car back. IT WOULD'VE BEEN NICE TO KNOW THIS WHEN I CAME IN YESTERDAY WHEN I BOOKED THE APPOINTMENT!!! I would have gone somewhere else if I knew this before hand and now they hold my car hostage!!!
