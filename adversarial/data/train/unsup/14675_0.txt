One of my favorite trails!  The scenery whichever way you look is so picturesque! \n\nWe did a couple of miles and the trail we took loops around.  Norm is our hiking guru and if you ever see a hike he has put on the yelp event calendar, I would highly encourage you to join.  He is so informative and makes it just a great experience. The rest is up to you to take in what nature has to offer.   \n\nThe difficulty of the trail is not hard.  We saw some streams, petrified wood, horseback riders and plenty of desert plants.  I believe there was about 15 of us on this trip and some even brought their dogs. \n\nThank you Norm, a great time had enjoying nature one trail at a time!
