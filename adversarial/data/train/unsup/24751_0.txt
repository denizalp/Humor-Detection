Dr. Phillip Wade, MD, DDS, FRCSC, ENT specialist... and certified black belt? This doctor seems to be a jack of all trades, master of... well, all of them!\n\nI accompanied a patient to his office the other day and was amazed at how thorough Dr. Wade was. He took his time and explained everything in clear, layman's terms and was quite animated in his delivery. He is extremely personable and has a wonderful 'bedside manner', so-to-speak. It's no surprise that this doctor has so many successes in his life.\n\nWe did not have to wait long past our appointment time, perhaps only 10 to 15 minutes. Overall, a pleasant experience.
