So, I have to tell you, whenever I travel, I try to find a range as close to my hotel as possible, just to go check it out, maybe throw some lead, or buy a t-shirt. Generally, it's a good experience, and nothing too special. Well, we have the exception here. The Gun Garage is just about a half a mile down the street from my hotel, so, what does that mean, SCORE for me, as it is very close, but, that's not the best part. The range is very clean and the atmosphere is very down to earth!! The staff, well, you cannot get a more polite staff than this. Very friendly and willing to help. I walked in at 4 PM on a Saturday, and I will tell you, the place was packed, but, the staff did everything in their power to make sure no on was inconvenienced while they were waiting for a lane or waiting to pay. If you are ever in Vegas, and are looking for a place to shoot, go to the Gun Garage, you will not be disappointed!!!!!
