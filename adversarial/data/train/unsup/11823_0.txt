I had been wanting to try out Jackie Chen's for a while and was not disappointed. \nFirst of all, this place is not fancy. It's very nostalgic for me - reminds me of my hometown mom & pop Chinese restaurant that I went to as a kid. Decor is a mix of traditional Chinese art (complete with a Buddha and lots of dragons) and outdated wallpaper. But as nostalgia often works, none of that mattered because I felt perfectly cozy in our cracked pleather booth! \nThe food was all very good & there was a lot of it! We ordered one of the combo deals - I wish I could remember the details - but essentially for $15 each we got an entree, two ribs, two crab Rangoon, two shrimp egg rolls and soup! I had the Hunan chicken and my husband had the General Chen's. Both of us found our chicken to be tender and delicious. The general Chen's was all white meat and the perfect amount of breading.\nOur server spoke very broken English but was able to communicate with us just fine. She was very accommodating and friendly. She also knew the menu very well - my husband has food allergies and she understood clearly and was able to point out which dishes to avoid.
