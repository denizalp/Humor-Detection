What a difference a day makes.   Yesterday's complaints of wait times, unused tables, and poor food left the building at sun rise. \n\nI came in here twice on a Thursday night. Around 6:45 for a drink, left for a meeting, came back at 9:00 for a burger.   Early visit, place was packed, lots of people waiting for a table, but saw nothing open. Found a seat at the bar (only seat open in the joint). Megan was on me like stink on shit and had one of their 24 Ohio crafted beers on me in no time. Had a nice chat with the guy next to me, visiting from Baltimore, and commenting on what a nice town Strongsville is. \n\nWent to a meeting and came back for the Local Yokel Burger (bacon, egg & Swiss). The burger was very good, but the bacon was outstanding. The fried egg was over hard. Would have preferred a runny yoke. \n\nAlso, ordered fries. The ones I got were cold. Meagan took them back and what seemed like an unusually long time, got a hot, fresh order in front of me. They were good and Meagan took them off the tab. \n\nI, too, will compare this place to the neighboring B spot, but I'm going to give the Rail the nod. The design of the bar makes it feel much more open. Although I miss the B Spot's pickle bar, not having Rosemary in my fries is worth it.  The TVs make it very sportsbarish too. A good thing when watching the Tribe and the Browns at the same time.  And, not having to pay extra for only ice in my bourbon is priceless.
