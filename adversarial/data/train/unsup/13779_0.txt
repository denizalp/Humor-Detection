SO I've been to Moon twice now and it's really one of my favorite clubs in Vegas...wait what?! Yes you read that right, and here's why....\n\n-Great music! I can't stand house\/techno music outside of the gym. It drives me crazy and I want to dance to some top 40\/hip hop type of music and Moon always delivers that for me (on Friday nights anyways).\n-The crowd. Somehow the crowd at Moon is less pretentious then at places like XS. The vibe at moon is that of people who came to really just dance and party and have a good time, not just people who want to stand and be seen.\n-The view, freaking breathtaking and really you never get sick of it, one of my favorite Vegas memories happened on this patio with that view, but of course I can't tell you that because what happens in Vegas.... ;P\n-The bartenders don't skimp on the alcohol and the last time I was here they really hooked me and my girls up.\n\nAs a disclaimer the two times I cme here I was staying at Palms Place so I can't speak on the worthiness of a cab ride but if you get a cabby who is cool and doesn't take you the long way to gyp you it seems worth it. \n\nSo no, Moon isn't the prettiest club, but really if I wanted to look at something pretty I'd go to a friggin museum, just saying.
