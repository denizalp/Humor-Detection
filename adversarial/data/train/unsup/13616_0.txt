This burger joint is overrated as a mother f*cker.\n\nBurger:\nI ordered a bacon cheeseburger all the way. It was top 5 greasiest burgers I've ever eaten. I was worried for my heart after finishing. The flavor was average as was the quality of meat. Honestly, I wouldn't be able to tell between a burger patty from Burger King and Five Guys.\n\nFries:\nI ordered the Cajun Fries. Saltiest things I've ever eaten. I couldn't finish more than half of them and let the others go to waste.\n\nI hear people comparing this place to In-N-Out in SoCal and I just can't see it. I'd rather eat at McDonalds than eat at Five Guys. At least at McDonalds, I don't have a bag and wrapper literally dripping with grease and oil.\n\nIn-N-Out c*ck slaps Five Guys.
