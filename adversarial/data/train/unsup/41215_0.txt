Just had the worst breakfast ever at the Pancake House in Scottsdale.... long wait, bad coffee, burned tasteless pancake, slow disinterested service and when we complained they did nothing about it, saying that we should have told our waitress about our poorly cooked food (and perhaps we would have except she never came back to check on us again). I can't believe the lack of customer service of this place... they did not make our order right and seemed to relish charging us an exorbitant amount for disgusting food.... Maybe my standards are too high, but I will not be giving my cash ( and I agree with a previous poster...cash only?  please! It's the 21st century!) to this restaurant ever again.... Don't go unless your standards are low.
