I booked my appointment at Natural Solutions and had Jewel as my Junior Hair Stylist. I was very happy with how she cut my hair and the time she took to give me a really nice blow out. She is very friendly, a good conversationalist, & gave me advice on how I can start blowdrying my hair because I had told her I didn't know how to do it.
