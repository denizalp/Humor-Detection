Kuljit is that hole in the wall you tell yourself you're better than, until of course, you actually eat there and realize how wrong you were; this place is phenomenal and they're serving up some of the best Indian food in the city! \n\nThat's what happened to me. I was put off by the ugly decor and the scratched up, stainless steel dishes, however, upon trying their food,... let's just say my expectations were blown out of the park. The food is incredible, specifically their butter chicken and vegetable pakoras! The server, presumably the wife to the operation, is sweet and really takes care of you. The cook, again assuming it's the husband, makes fantastic food. And that's all there is to it.  True Indian food at an amazing price.
