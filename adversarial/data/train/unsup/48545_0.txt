Dr Markin and all of his staff are superb! My daughter had a complex set of problems, and we were getting conflicting advice from our dentist and oral surgeon. Dr Markin took the time to consult with both of them, and in the end, they all agreed with his course of action, which was the least invasive. Her braces were supposed to take one and a half years, but she was done in a year, and her teeth, which were a real mess, are perfect! Everyone, from the receptionist to the hygienists, are professional and friendly. They would even call to remind me when I forgot to make a follow-up appointment! It's a bit out of the way, but on the 401 it takes less time to get to his office than it would to get downtown. Highly recommended!
