I've been to this location a lot, and it used to be a three star place, they seem to have stepped up their game.\n The fish tanks look incredible! No algae visible and packed with fish! They have hard to find Kribensis, pretty Discus, and quite a few I've never seen.\n I wanted the Electric Rams, but I've been searching for Kribensis for years, so I stuck to it. The guy working walked me through some of the prettier ones that would do well in my tank, and had some great ideas.\n The rest of the store is clean, and has a bigger variety than it used to.\n I was checked out quickly and the friendly cashier made sure I had all I needed.\n The outside was clean, big enough to make it easy. They have adoptions on weekends, and a nice overhang so the pets are in the shade.\n I'll be returning to this location a lot more now, saw some Bettas that caught my eye and I have several rooms at home with no Betta tank. Gasp, the horror!
