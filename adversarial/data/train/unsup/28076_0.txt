It's your normal American-Mexican fare but it was delicious. The service was great and the food did not disappoint. I went for lunch on a Saturday before going to Concord Mills so it wasn't crowded. I actually plan to go back! I'm not sure why this place has such mixed reviews - I had a great experience!
