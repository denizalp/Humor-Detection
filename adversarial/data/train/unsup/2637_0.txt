I'll admit, I only came here to browse the clearance. I knew the regular merch would be a bit pricey. Really nice stuff, classy. From fishing to camping to umbrellas. If I had some extra foldin' money, I definitely would have splurged. Also, they take dogs. Yes, my Miss Roxy went full on shopaholic. We were eyeing a $40 leather leash, but she's 9 now. She's not going to be around long enough to justify that purchase. Settled on a hunting orange leash for $16. The help is very cool and not in your face. They didn't even mind my jerkhound's growling(she was pissed about not hitting up Tiffany and Co). Very fun for pooches and outdoorsy types.
