Pretty good, though if I returned, I would stick to the original. I ordered the pulled pork poutine, but was not impressed by the pork. My friends got the original, and it looked like better value. I enjoyed the real cheese \"squeaky\" curds, and the gravy, which was not overly sweet or salty. The fries were not bad either, though I prefer them crispier. Pretty disappointed to learn that they don't sell crepes anymore. I would have loved one!
