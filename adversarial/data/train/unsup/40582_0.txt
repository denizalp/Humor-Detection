My Husband, 2yr old and I dined here for dinner on a whim; I read some of these great Yelp reviews and wanted to check it out! We were able to get seated right away at 6:30pm on a Friday. Upon walking in we were hit with super warm heat...I'm not sure if the AC wasn't working or if it's always that hot, but it was super warm. The ceiling fans helped a little, but once we were finished dining and walked outside, the 80 degree weather felt amazingggg. Anyway,  we sat at a long narrow table, with a narrow bench on one side. Not the most comfortable seating in the world, but we made do! \n\nWe were brought chips, salsa and some pickled veggies right away. The chips and salsa were pretty standard, but the veggies were great. Definitely something unique! I ordered the Frito burrito with veggies and my husband got a chicken burrito. Nothing crazy; we both liked ours. Wasn't anything spectacular. Mine was kind of dry and had a very light drizzle of crema, so I asked for a side of sour cream ($1.50). I was brought the wrong beverage as well, but it was fixed fairly quick. My daughter liked her French fries and chicken nuggets  \n\nWe will definitely come back and give it another go!
