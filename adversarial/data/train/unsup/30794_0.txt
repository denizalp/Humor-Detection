I love this place, I have to travel to Pittsburgh 5-6 times per year for work. I always stop at Sonoma when I'm here. The glazed Indonesian duck is amazing and the main reason I am giving 5 stars. It's awesome, I've had other dishes (I tried some of their fish dishes) all good especially if you get the pick two or three. But any time I have gotten anything but the duck I'm disappointed. It's that good.\n\nGreat selection of wines (pricy compared to what you would pay if you bought them from liqueur or fine wine store. But the staff is very knowledgable and fun, I've been here probably 20 times and have enjoyed each time.\n\nThe crab bisque is fantastic the sampler (if you have enough people) is really good too. I've heard the steaks are average but I have never tried them so I can't say. Overall I love this place, great drinks, great staff and great food.
