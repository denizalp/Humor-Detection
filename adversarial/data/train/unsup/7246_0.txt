Note: it is 2am and I have slept about 30 mins since I got here. \n\nThis hotel is a complete nightmare. How it is \"over-sold\" is a total mystery. The moment I arrived, I've had issues. My check in experience was awful...they claimed that I only had a room for one night even though my company's travel department had me booked for 4 nights. They claimed When I finally did get to a room, it was filthy. No one had been in there to clean it since the last people left. I'll post pics. When I went to complain, they put in me in one of their suites. It's a gorgeous room....WITH NO A\/C! Also, the toilet won't flush...Fun times! Once I post this review, I am packing up and moving to another hotel. \n\nWestgate, get your sh*t together....
