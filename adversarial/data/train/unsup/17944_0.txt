Found their service through Groupon. I scheduled my appointment on Sunday and almost forgot about it. I went to get my lashes done hungry-as in starving since I woke up late. The whole time Jenny was doing my lashes my stomach was growling. I mean, all I can think of was food and donuts they had for the customers.\n\nIt took about 45 mins and my lashes was awesome. Jenny was friendly and professional. Will get my fill next time. They were awesome. Okay, my ramen is here- time to eat.
