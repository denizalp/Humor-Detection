The Asian girl that works here is never paying attention to what she does and always off in her own world. Avoid having her do anything other than grab you a juice from the fridge at all costs. Everyone else that works here pays attention and is attentive. I've had numerous bad experiences with this girl after always tipping at least 15%.  (FYI I'm the bald white guy with tattoos that comes in smelling like weed all the time. Stop f**king my orders up please)
