The BBT invasion is well underway with word getting back to HK\/ Taiwan  and Mainland China to launch all Tapioca balls directly at Toronto and the GTA! Hitting the area like a bomb, Happy Lemon, the latest edition, has launched with 5 locations already.\n\nScarborough and Vaughan are the latest and greatest and I had the chance to visit the other day and try not one but TWO of their signature bubble tea beverages.\n\nEvery bubble tea business has their signature teas that they do better than anyone else, for some it's the classic milk tea, others the toppings\/ingredients, and some it's their blend of fruit and tea flavours that make them better.\n\nFor Happy Lemon it HAS to be the two beverages I enjoyed: green tea salted cheese and the mango lemon slushy.\n\nYou read that correctly, a green tea BBT with a thick cheesy foam on top accented with salt for a sweet and savoury flavour like no other. The other unique elements to this drink were the specific recommended way you should drink\/enjoy this beverage AND the full mouth feel of the thick creamy cheese as it mixes with the green tea. Sounds revolting I know... but you know what, it drank like a cross between a beer and a milkshake and I FRIGGEN LOVED IT!\n\nThe mango lemon slushy was more standard but unlike other beverages there were not lychee jellies but a lychee jello which filled the bottom of the cup. So crazy!\n\nThere are a number of options that are unique and worth a try at Happy Lemon, even egg waffles for snacks. Definitely worth a visit!\n\nEatcrest Out
