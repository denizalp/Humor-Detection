Bar George- for anyone who has attended McGill, this building resembles one of the many faculty clubs owned by the University. It screams McGill even though it's part of a hotel. \n\nI came here on a Saturday afternoon for brunch.\nWalking in the bar is located on the left, the main dining hall is straight a head, followed by the hotel entrance on the right. The decor is beautiful- classic and hand carved wooden ceilings decked with chandeliers. I won't like lie- the dining hall is very dark. It almost a feels you're part of Harry Potter's dining Hall and I magically need a wand to  light the place up. I wouldn't have picked this venue for summer- too dreary.\n\nThe menu is simple yet overpriced. I ordered the avocado toast for around 20$ that is a popular dish reading from yelp. I'm south Asian and this dish did not settle well in my mouth - chutney on avacado toast doesn't make it fancy people! To wash out the aftertaste I thought a 5$ freshly squeezed juice would do the trick. To my surprise - the portion of the juice is what you get in a happy meal. For a Virgin drink - Let's be nice Bar George and serve bigger portions! Although, the side order of buttermilk scones for 4$ was totally worth the price if not more as it is served with a variety of fruit spreads.\n\nMy bill came out to 27$ for 3 dishes. I was hoping for a better brunch menu for the price I paid, but maybe a dinner soiree will have prove me wrong.
