If I could give 10 stars I would. The last 2 months I have been looking for the perfect engagement ring. Like most guys I had no idea what made rings special. I also had a limited budget and didn't want to finance. I looked all over Vegas and found the perfect ring in gold rush. After asking a million different questions in person and on the phone over multiple times I purchased the ring at an absolutely wonderful price. I couldn't have done it without the two wonderful owners who helped me along the way and absolutely did not pressure me at all. I will definitely be recommending this place to anyone who is looking for a jeweler. Wonderful customer service, extremely knowledgeable, and amazing prices
