A small venue that knows how to book some acts.  I think the cap is only about 120 people.\n\nWith most of the smaller to medium sized venues in Charlotte closing down over the last few years its more important than ever to keep local music alive.  This place, The Visulite and Smokey Joe's all are worthy of your money.\n\nI've seen some amazing shows here.  They had Snarky Puppy twice!  Tauk has played here. I'm sure there are tons of other names I am forgetting about that have graced us with their presence at such an intimate venue.\n\nFYI, they did just start selling liquor and are now a \"private club.\"  So you do have a little paperwork to fill out when walking in the door.  Don't blame them, its NC law.
