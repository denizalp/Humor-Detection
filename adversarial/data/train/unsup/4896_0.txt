They can have this store... it reminds me of a bootleg bougie Aldi. It could be worse, but it could be much better. The layout is not customer friendly. Most of the employees that I came in contact with were friendly except for Craven, the guy with the blue hair. He seemed as if we were bothering him when we asked him where an item was located. They do have a couple of items that I would purchase from them if I am in the area, but they wouldn't be a regular store for me.
