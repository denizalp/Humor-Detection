I wish I had come here shopping for books because I am a confessed school addict! I want to go back to college, alas, I am in the real world now, so I was only there to peruse their selection of UNLV fan gear. I can't comment on the prices of books, although I assume like most school books stores they aren't cheap! However, the selection of UNLV fan gear is abundant! From Rebels clothing to stickers to giant no. 1 hands to rhinestones for your face, they pretty much have everything (even mini stick on staches)! Pricing is not cheap, but I was happy to have so many options. Plus, the young lady working the store went above and beyond to be helpful. She greeted us promptly and was unexpectedly positive for a book store attendant. Go Rebel Books!
