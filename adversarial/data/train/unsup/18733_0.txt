I was super excited when I heard sprinkles was coming to town!  But I was a bit disappointed after tasting and tasting and tasting!  I tried just about every flavor they had when they first opened over a period of a month (it's a surprise my pants still fit after that).  And I just felt like their cake was too dry, OR too oily.  \n\nBUT, recently I went back to give it another try since I now work so close by.  Oh my god they have improved!  Whatever kinks they had they worked them out!  I LOVE almost all of their flavors.  The chocolate marshmallow, banana, coconut (my favorite) chocolate coconut, mocha, black and white, etc etc.  I die.  \n\nBut I will say I wish they would go a little lighter on the frosting.  Some frosting still tastes a little like plastic, but their chocolate and cream cheese frosting are to die for.
