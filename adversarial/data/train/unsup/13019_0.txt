More often than not during long Toronto winters I am drudging around this hood and am, indeed, Thirsty and Miserable. They're the third business I can remember in recent years in this lil location, and I am definitely cheering for them to survive. They are, after all, my namesake. \n\nTheir beer list reads like a who's who of local and celebrity brews, and I tried my very first sour beer here. I thought for sure that I would dislike it. I was wrong, it's tasty and doesn't at all taste off. They have only a small drink list aside from the brews, but they do have free wifi and you're in the heart of the market, so if they don't have what you're after walk 20 steps and grab a bite or a different beverage somewhere else. Or, you know, some vintage shoes. \n\nThe interior is small and wood-clad with some red touches. It's pretty and friendly and the woman behind the bar is always smiling. \n\nCash only, but they have a bank machine inside. \n\nPEPPER IS PISSED: Incense is not helping the strong smell from the fish market. Gotta figure that out!
