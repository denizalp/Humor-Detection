Uh, what's not to love?\n\nThis is an amazing place to go bike riding, which is one of my favorite things to do, by the way. There are always people out there biking, running, walking with & without dogs, playing frisbee, and even fishing. I am completely grossed out by anyone who would eat a fish out of the \"lakes\" here, so I always look at those people a little suspiciously.\n\nAnyway, people all seem to be enjoying life here, but not in a way that annoys you. You know what I mean, come on.\n\nPlus the golfers I see as I ride by always seem to be overweight & riding around in those carts. They make me feel better about being in such bad shape myself right now. Thanks guys!\n\nI have made it as far as the North side of Tempe Beach Park so far. I plan on heading all the way in to Tempe soon.\n\nIf you haven't been get out & enjoy the greenbelt before it's 1000 degrees again! ;)
