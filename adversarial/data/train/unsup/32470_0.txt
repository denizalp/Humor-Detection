Cheapest hotel we found close to the airport. Stayed a night, it worked fine. Would be rated three, but main reason it gets knocked down a star is because the faucet smelled like marijuana smoke whenever it was turned on in a non-smoking room. Hotel didn't feel super clean, but it was enough for a place like it. Nice front desk people.
