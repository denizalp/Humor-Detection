Jumpstreet used to be awesome but they made some changes and it just isn't as cool as it used to be. You cant jump with your kids anymore. If your kid is over age 4, they can purchase an additional wristband, which the parent has to purchase as well, and jump on the general population trampolines along with the grown ups and unruly teenagers. Those are your options. Pay out the nose to try to protect them from the adults, or send them to the under 7 section and stand by helplessly while they get stepped on and you are not permitted on the trampolines. \n\nOn thing that has not changed about Jumpstreet, the bitchy blond who works the front desk. It was almost like she was enjoying telling us all the things we could not do there. Never once did I get an apology or a please or a thank you. Just awful. I'll go to Airworx from now on.
