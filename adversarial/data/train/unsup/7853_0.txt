I'll take Vegas Neon history for $18 please!\n\nYes, the prices have gone up. But now they have a working restroom on-site and the La Concha visitor center is open. They also offer discounts if you are local, a student, active military, veteran, or senior. Children 6 and under are free but I *suggest* you don't bring them unless they are super behaved. \n\nNone of the signs here are fixed up and they don't plan on fixing them anytime soon. The guide told us that they are pretty much just gonna leave it up to the elements and if a generous donor comes along, then maybe they'd restore some of them. He mentioned the price to be somewhere along half a million and up.\n\nDefinitely book a tour online to save you the hassle and frustration. They may or may not take walk-ins. The area is small but what makes it worth while are the knowledgeable docents and of course, the neon signs of years past. \n\nThey have free parking available and it's a short drive from downtown Vegas. You can even walk there from downtown if you're brave enough.
