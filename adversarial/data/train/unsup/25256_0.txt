Terrible service. Came with a party of six. Took 50 minutes to get 5 of us our food and another half our for the other.  Out of the 6 orders 1 basket of wings was hot and 2 were the wrong flavor. All if these mishaps happened with only 1 other table in the place. And they refused to comp the order of wings they forgot about. Don't wast your time.
