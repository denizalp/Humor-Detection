My family was in search of something unique that for my brother's urn. He passed away unexpectedly at 26 years old and, we couldn't make ourselves buy one of those urns at the funeral home, they were all so generic and expensive. My Dad remembered Circle 6 Studios because my brother had taken a class there years ago and really enjoyed it. \n\nJohn helped us create something that was weird and unique, just like Jason. He took our ideas, and what we told him about Jason and ran with it, creating something that is really reflective of my brother. I imagine that is Jason were here, he would love the blown glass. AND, John spent weeks on it, for very little money. He is a good guy and I would recommend Circle 6 Studios to anyone in need of something unique. Thank you John.
