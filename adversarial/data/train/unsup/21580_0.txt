THE WORST MOST HORRID HORRID HORRID HORRID HORRID BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD AND WORST THAN INFINITELY BAD restaurant in the world. There are flies swarming the heating trays. The food looks radioactive due to all the food colouring. The floors are slippery and it is disgustingly humid because of all the condensation from the heating trays. This place is a shitty mess. Buffet Maharaja is like paying a stranger on the street to vomit regurgitated putrid sewage back into my mouth. This is horrid Indian food and most likely the worst restaurant in Montr√©al. This places boasts a hundred different dishes in their buffet and they all taste the same. You will be disappointed to see that everything is stored in aluminium slosh buckets heated underneath with propane burners. This is never a good sign. Also a very bad sign is when an Indian resto is soooooooooo shitty and desperate that they've got to serve stale French fries. This is a pitiful and sad state of affairs. It boggles the mind to think that this awful awful place is still in business after all of these years. This is one of the oldest Indian restos in the city. I remember back in the 90s that they used to run advertisements on the television. Either local CBC or CFCF12 or Global. Or maybe it was SRC I forget. There was soft core porn late at night and I think between programmes Buffet Maharaja would come on and brag about how they had like a hundred different items. The first time I went there was when I was a teenager and I knew it was absolute shit. But hey! Unlimited food! And they served me beer even though I was underage. I went back about a year ago just because I'm an optimist but it still sucks donkey balls. Go anywhere else. See my other reviews for suggestions. Peace out.
