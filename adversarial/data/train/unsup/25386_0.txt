Came here as a VIP guest for the Garth Brooks concert. \n\nSeats aren't great, and for a tall person they may be too close together for long legs to fit. The VIP boxes are very well done, and the staff is quite friendly. The place is clean (obviously, it's brand new!) and well laid out.\n\nParking was surprisingly well done. After leaving a sold-out concert at the end right along side everybody else, I was out of the venue and onto the freeway within 10 minutes.
