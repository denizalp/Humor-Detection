Crunchy Spicy Tuna!!! Oh so Delicious!\n\nI underestimated Arizona....This place was just awesome!\n\nThey have the best happy hour I have seen even in LA. $5.00 beers and $5.00 sushi 8pm-close. Yup we closed the place. \n\nIt a small little whole in the wall restaurant that is located in a shopping center next to a subway.\n\nWe arrived here after our 7 hour Drive from LA to AZ. The place closed at 10...i think, but we arrived at 11:15 and they still let us order food and beer! YAY\nEven after we were done....they let us order dessert! Excellent Service and Awesome Staff. \n\nOh Yen Sushi...You had me at Hello....
