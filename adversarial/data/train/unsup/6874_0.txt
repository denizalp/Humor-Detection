HANDS DOWN BEST RESTAURANT ON THE STRIP that I've tried so far.\n\nInnovative, colorful dishes.\n\nWe got the purple private room and had the tasting menu.\n\nThis was back when I still ate meat and am I ever glad I got to try this before I got converted being immersed in the \"vegan, organic, go-green\" side of LA too long. \n\nThe bite-size piece of kobe beef must have been the best tasting bite of meat I've ever had.\n\nEverything from beginning to end was exquisite. Definitely one of those experiences you don't want to die without trying. Oh and a glass or two of Caymus 2006 vintage cabernet (unbelievably smooth and pairs well with most of the dishes) just makes the night in heaven all that much more dreamy!
