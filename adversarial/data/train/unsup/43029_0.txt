I have to say a lot of the reviews are true as far as the wait but I love my doctor. Dr Alejandro Lopez is wonderful. I have been going here for almost 2 years and despite the inconvenience of the wait I stay. Dr Lopez is caring and spends the time it takes to help me. Everyone at the front desk and elsewhere has always been kind and caring. I believe they do the best they can and try to help as many as they can. It is not always possible to have an appointment when you need medical care.
