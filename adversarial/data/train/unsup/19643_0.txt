When traveling, we are always on the lookout for local coffee shops that are not Starbucks. \n\nThings I like about Grouchy John's: Love the name, love the fact that they're not a corporate chain. The employees are friendly and appear to enjoy their job.\n\nWhat I didn't like was the coffee that we ordered and the lack of seating. My babygirl's soy latte was piping HOT! Almost as hot as my Americano. The flavor wasn't bad, although temperature control would be a useful lesson around here. My Americano on the other hand was good and well made. I would order that again in a heartbeat. \n\nAs for the seating, there was a good amount, but they were busy. Can't blame a place for being popular. There are a few outside tables but who wants to drink coffee in the desert heat?\n\nThe interior appears to be a redecorated Starbucks. With lots of reading material on the shelves, it has that local coffee shop flair. They have a drive-thru window which furthers the former S'bux impression.\n\nI applaud them for not being just another chain, however their drink menu is pretty much similar with a host of sugary frapps and just barely considered coffee drinks. No V3gan pastries on display either. So it's basically the same thing to me. The reason Starbucks is successful is consistency. I can get a tall soy latte from any ol' S'bux and it'll taste pretty much similar no matter where I am. \n\nIf I were local to Vegas, I would consider visiting here more often. Perhaps it would grow on me. Then again, Sunrise Coffee is vastly superior in ever facet, so I doubt even the frequent buyer punch card offered here would lure me back for more.
