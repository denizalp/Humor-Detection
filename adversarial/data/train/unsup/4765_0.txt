I would give 10 stars if I could!\n\nMy experience with Dr Khorsandi was absolutely amazing and I have already recommended him to all my of girl friends looking to get anything done! He is very professional, knowledgable very honest about his work. Dr K and his whole staff are always very friendly and welcoming when I visit his office. Catherine is also so sweet. She is very friendly and patient with my endless questions. \n\nOverall, I honestly wouldn't go anywhere else. Dr. Khorsandi is the best doctor in Las Vegas!
