Sorry for 3 stars, but if I have to be honest it's over priced and I don't like the customers.\nThe place is beautiful and great for selfies and Instagram pics but like a $20 turkey sandwich..no thanks.\nAnd the drinks are like 7-10$+ \nI'm not a fan of macaroons so I didn't try any.\n\nI just felt like I was in Disney land having coffee...\nIt's not worth it to sit and have coffee.. not enough tables and it's squished! You can literally smell the person beside you.
