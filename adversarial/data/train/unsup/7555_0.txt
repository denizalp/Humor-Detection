I usually give any place that ISN'T Guitar Center extra points just for making it, but you have to have some kind of customer service. Staff is rude, snobbish, and their guitar selection really isn't that great. Yeah, I've played Martins, Gibsons, Fenders, yadda yadda yadda, so has everyone else and their grandmother. Get some vintage offsets, Gretsch, or Vox guitars to even start being \"bizarre.\" Prices were on the high side, but if you're going for the Rics, money is no object anyways I suppose. I'm fairly certain if they knew I was in the market for one, they'd perk right up. \n\nI'm not surprised other people had bad experiences with returns or even sexual harassment. In fact, as I walked out, I could of swore I heard 'Deliverance'-style dueling banjos playing, or maybe it was 'Comanche' by The Revels? Avoid and take your hard-earned cash elsewhere.
