After getting to Montreal and checking into my hotel, I decided to order some food before going to sleep. I asked the front desk what was available, and they told me about this place. I decided that a burger would do, so I went with that.\nI also ordered a poutine and some orange juice. The order came in less than half an hour, and it was delivered straight to my hotel room. The delivery person was nice, and we chatted a bit as I paid for my order. Afterward, I went to chow down. The burger was ok, it was nothing over the top but not bad either. The poutine was ok as well, the cheese on top tasted fine but the sauce was not too good. The orange juice was great, it was actual juice and not high-fructose corn syrup.\nThe negative was the stomach ache that came after. I expected the food to settle better in my stomach, as food in Canada is prone to have no fillers\/preservatives. But that is what happens when I order such food late at night. Oh well.
