I found this resort to be just wonderful. Our room was very large, but unfortunately there was only one chair, besides the desk chair, on which to sit. That was the only negative, aside from the extremely rude, LOUD guests that walked the halls. Not the resort's fault that some guests have no manners. \n\nThe grounds were lovely, the fountain out in front often had birds drinking, and the trees lit up at night were beautiful. \n\nEverything was convenient, i.e. shops, highways, restaurants. The pool and hot tub were refreshing. \n\nSangrias has a great happy hour. \n\nOur room looked out onto the golf course. \n\nPeople that have complained about the size of the bathrooms have, obviously, never been to New York. The outer dressing area with sink worked very well so that two people could get ready simultaneously. \n\nThe wedding we attended was held in an area that we had not previously explored. Loved the fountains. \n\nI would definitely return if in the area.
