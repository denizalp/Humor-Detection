Golden Spoon froyo beats the Pinkberrys and Red Mangos. \n\nFat free and lo-cal but with the decadent toppings. Mm, edible oxymoron. Live cultures is the buzz word. \n\nI don't know if the Pinkberrys think its cute to only have two yogurt flavors., but I don't. Its lazy in disguise. Golden Spoon has like, ten at a time. And you can combine. Asinine. \n\nThey have typical white person toppings, like Heath bar and hot fudge and stuff. But the Almond Roca is not really Almond Roca. Hello, false advertisement? I want some authentic toffee, goddangit. \n\nA small is plenty enough for a 120 pound Asian girl with a tapeworm. ~$5 with two toppings, I think. \n\nWhite people froyo is WAY better than Asian froyo. You win this round, white people. But we'll come back with something as bomb as paper or noodles or cell phones that can shoot laser beams. \n\nI wonder if you can suck bandwith from Panera next door ... \n\n* off the strip, non-casino
