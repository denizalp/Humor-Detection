I hope that the Yelp gods take my recommendation and add \"Local Flavor\" to the category list along with \"Shopping Center\" because honestly you should NOT be going to The Grand Canal to shop. The shopping is terrible, terrible, terrible. The only redeeming shopping quality is that you can walk through it to get to the Palazzo shops. Most of the stores are random one-off boutiques with an assortment of nothing I need or want. I think I have perhaps actually walked into two stores along the Canal (one was a watch store that I was drug into unwillingly), and I have been there at least 20 times.\n\nSo, why the 5 stars? Because there is a fake Venice right smack dab in the middle of Las Vegas complete with a canal full of gondolas, a miniature Piazza San Marco (sans pigeons) and a funny smell! It's so ridiculous and fun and crazy and weird and... it screams for 5 stars.\n\nYes, I have been to the real Venice, twice actually, but I am not about to freak out about the inauthenticity of what is clearly a fake. What's the point? Some people will not make it to Venice. If this is as close as they get, and it makes them smile to pay $16 for a gondola ride, I am going to smile a real smile right along with them. Plus, the sky is impressive. \n\nAs for that smell, I have always despised the smell of The Venetian, but all of the casinos have a custom scent they pipe through the vents. The Venetian's is called \"Seduction,\" but I agree it should be called \"Musky Mutilation.\" Still, as people have pointed out, it is not as if the \"real\" Venice smells any better, and in Las Vegas, that artificial scent is in many ways the true \"flavor\" of our town. If that makes you angry, then you might want to stick to the odor of \"garbage-strike\" in New York City.\n\nMe, I'll brave the scent any day to take a new visitor to the Venice of the desert (of the real).
