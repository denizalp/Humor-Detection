I have no idea how this restaurant got such high rates!\nWe have been there for the \"happy hour\" menu.\nThe spagetti with meatballs ($12) was litteraly one scoop of pasta and one dry and untasty meatball on top. The sauce tasted industrial...seriously it was less than a kids portion wish I had a picture of it.\nRest of the food came in tiny portions as well and way overpriced for the taste and quality especially for a happy hour menu.\nWe paid $50 for 2 tiny pastas with tomatto sauce and a sample of ceaser salad including tip.\nWill never be back again.
