This is a buffet. I know you aren't looking for a newspaper column critique, so here's the long story short.\n\nAtmosphere: Slightly dirty but not off-putting dirty\nService: Quick, efficient, not warm and friendly but not rude\nPrices: OK to maybe a dollar or two too pricey for some\nVariety: Above average for Madison\nTaste: Slightly below average for buffets for about half their offerings, average for the other half\nTrend: Slowly but noticeably getting worse since first coming here a couple years ago but still good enough for right now\nSelf-loathing level after eating: 50% indifference, 35% glad, 10% regret for not going to an Indian buffet instead, 5% unable to process because your brain is fighting off a food coma
