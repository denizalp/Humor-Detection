Fabulous soups!  I ordered 2 gallons of their mushroom soup for my Christmas Eve celebration and my family LOVED it!   Stop in for a pick-two (soup + 1\/2 sandwich) and I'm sure you won't be disappointed.   And the people running the place are lovely.  So nice to have a small business with quality service and excellent food.
