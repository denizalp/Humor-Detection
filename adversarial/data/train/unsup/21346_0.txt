I swear the \"four assed monkey\" from South Park is in charge of this place.\n\nWhen you have customers in front of you waiting on a pizza that's been sitting, here's a hint, HANG UP THE PHONE AND DEAL WITH THE PEOPLE WAITING TO GET THEIR FOOD!\n\nWe were there on the evening of May 7, 2012 around 8pm. First when we walked in there were two other customers sitting in the line, waiting for someone to come to the counter and give them their food. That took ten minutes. Then, before the idiot behind the counter could tend to us, she wandered off for another five minutes. When she finally got back, she took a phone call while running our card so we could get out of there. This took a total of 20 minutes. That's madness.\n\nThe pizza isn't good enough to justify our wait. Won't be going back. PPP should FIRE EVERYONE WHO WORKS HERE and start over. Bunch of half witted no whits.
