Extremely professional company.  The owner dropped everything to pick up a thermostat for us.  Technicians are skilled and curteous. First company that has not tried to up sell to us.  Also discoverered and corrected a major flaw in original installation of the a\/c unit that saved us $ in cooling costs.  Highly recommend.
