Chris G. makes a good point about not arriving too early and I would say the same for arriving late. They kind of shorten the conveyor and do not replace the old stuff with fresh stuff. Our personal experience has been that the best time is generally between 6PM and 8PM. To grab fresh stuff off the belt that is. \n\nAs mentioned by other reviewers, they'll make rolls fresh for you. The other reviews are all pretty much on the money. It's definitely a fun place to go with friends and affordable. The wait staff are very friendly and accommodating. The food is a super value, great price for good quality sushi.
