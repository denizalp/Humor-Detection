Not really sure where to begin with this company. First let me start off be telling you any purchase you make there is not guaranteed! At least mine wasn't. They still have my umbrella, in like new condition...that I paid for. The umbrella was supposed to be fixed, and the part ordered for its replacement. It was... a call was made to me to let me know it was there anytime I wanted to swing by and pick it up.\n\nLong story short, they \"lost\" the replacement part, tried selling me on a new umbrella over the phone and still have my existing umbrella!\n\nThanks for your wonderful service \"after the sale\"!
