Came here for the 2nd time with the hubs to meet up a friend.. We ordered a bunch of things and I was STUFFED by the end of the meal.. but it was SOOO yummy! \n\nTo start, the waiter brought us roasted seaweed squares with a sesame oil dipping sauce with lime infused sea salt while we were looking over the menu.. it was nice and light. Personally I liked getting some of the salt on the seaweed.. otherwise it's a little too light. \n\nFor appetizers, we ordered the Grilled Ribs.. which was SUPER YUMMY.. awesome flavoring, though slightly dry this time.. and pork sliders trio on lightly toasted hawaiian bread (which wasn't on the menu, but I hear they have a secret menu, so it might be on that??) Edamane was served with a garlicy soy sauce reduction and the same infused sea salt from the seaweed..it was VERY tasty. i'm not used to putting sauce on my edamane, but i have to admit, it was GOOD.\n\nI ordered the waffle stuffed with sweet chicken curry. it came with two eggs.. i'd probably recommend it as a breakfast item or something on a very empty stomach. i couldn't finish the waffle cuz i was already getting really full. But the curry inside was good, not too spicy. eggs were cooked according to your request, i went with over medium. So in the end, I ditched the half waffle and ate the curry and eggs. \nThe guys ordered a ramen ( i forgot to ask him how he liked it, but it looked good) and the steak salad. I was very impressed with the presentation of the salad. it looked delish. \n\nDessert was so good. I only had a small bite though if I wasn't so full, i wouldn't have shared. we had the strawberry custard brulee, which now that i look isn't actually on the menu either. ha. lucky us! seriously, i would have licked the bowl clean if I wasn't dying of fullness. \n\nall in all, i was impressed with the food, service (waiter was very good about checking in on us often, refilling water glasses etc) and decor. the bathroom signs are the best. very clever.
