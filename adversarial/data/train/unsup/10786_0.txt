I went here months ago and haven't returned. I purchased 3 bean burritos for the kids and myself, bought a few extra tortillas and 3 drinks. We pulled over in the parking lot to eat in the car. I was dispersing some of the beans in the burrito to one of the extra tortillas I bought, and I found a bug inside the burrito. I pulled it out and told the kids to stop eating. I had them examine it just to make sure I wasn't going crazy. \n\nI immediately drove back to the window and showed the cashier what I had found. She brought the cook over who insisted it was just a burnt piece of tortilla. \n\nI guess burnt pieces of tortilla also have wings and legs?\n\nThey failed to agree it was a bug but returned all of my $ to me. \n\nI have never been back and will never ever return to this Filibertos. Gross!!
