So after going back to yoga again, i reread the \"donation form\" about them not making enough money and it turns out that the owner is asking for $4\/class, not per coupon holder.  That works out to an extra $80 if you were to donate each class...definitely not as good of a deal anymore!\nAnyways i was prepared to donate for the class i had just done but did point out that paying an extra $4\/class would bring the voucher up to $100 in total...he told me that it was a donation and that  i didn't have to pay, i insisted i would, argument ensued, i didn't pay since he refused it.  Quite ridiculous really.  He informed me that people shouldn't feel obligated to pay but when he gives you that form after every class...\nBUT besides the owner the classes are decent.\nThe other major CON is their love of burning incense in the yoga studio during class, when you're breathing in that deeply for an hour...it tends to get suffocating\/allergic\/cloying\/gross.\nNot sure what's going to happen with that studio but i would say if you've got that pass - use it asap!
