Alright place....nothing out of the ordinary....they have about 5+ pool tables in the back.. Decent music going on... Was pretty slow on a Monday night after St. Paddys day...but this was expected and we were only int town for Spring Training...\nI did have their Habereno Shot...not the best tasting shot... But always interested I doing something out of the ordinary...\n\nTalk about a burn!!!! Burned going down and for at least 5 minutes....almost like taking a shot of Tabasco but without the salty vinegar taste
