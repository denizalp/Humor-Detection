I love Zagara's! Produce department is great. The staff is always super friendly and helpful. After becoming my regular grocery store, some of the employees started to recognize me and remember what I previously ordered. I have even gotten onto a first name basis with some of them! \nThe prices are a little higher but that is because that are family owned and operated, many people don't realize this and will try to compare them to their big box competitors (Dave's or Giant Eagle). I don't mind the slightly higher prices simply for the fact that I know my money and taxes are going to stay in the community. \nAnd to address the reviews complaining that the neighborhood is dangerous, I live less then a mile away and have never had any problems.
