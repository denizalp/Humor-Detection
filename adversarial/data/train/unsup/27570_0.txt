We have been coming to this place off and on for years. We like the soups, broccoli beef, cashew chicken, house chicken, and the yummy crab puffs. They make a hot mustard in house that is a must try. It's small and quiet. The people working there are very friendly. They have reasonably priced lunch specials. Here are pics of the hot and sour soup, egg drop soup, broccoli beef, and the mustard. The plates all came pretty, but the kids and I dug in before getting the pics.
