Came out from california to check this place out. Let me say it was so delicious! I had the unagi, nigari salmon, Dynamite roll, and rainbow roll. It was all to die for. The service from the staff wasn't so great which is why i'm giving it four stars, but I must say the owner Juno is awesome! He came to our table and introduced himself to us and told us how they've only been here for 1 1\/2 year. He was very nice and kind. I will definitely come back.
