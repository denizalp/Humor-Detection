I go to this Frys because my prescriptions are sent here. However if you shop here check your receipt as they tend to make mistakes. Most recently they over charged me by $42. When I question my cashier Dan about the amount he said it was correct. I told $150 for what I bought is just too high. He said look you have full basket. Not once did he look at receipt or took the time to ensure he rang everything up correctly. So not to argue I just went over to customer service and they corrected his mistake and refunded me $42.91.
