Dim Sum in Toronto is GREAT!  What appears like an old fashion manison on the outside is actually a large banquet hall restaurant.  I love the facade of this restaurant as it is very discreet depicting someone's home which I actually at first I thought I was visiting someone.  Large wall mirrors, chandeliers, and museum paintings depicts this restaurant with a nice charm of a estate residence.  The outside of the restaurant does not promeniently display the restaurant's name which adds to my admiration for being discreet.  No flashy signage.  Waiting time for a table is moderate but my party of three was promptly seated and immediately serviced.  The shrimp dumplings 蝦餃 (haa1 gaau2) is large filled with three shrimps per dumpling and the chicken noodle soup were solid as we ate our fill.  The rice noodle roll 豬腸粉 (zyu1 coeng4*2\/4 fan2) is large but with very thick skin filled with large shrimp.  The steamed meatballs 牛肉丸 (ngàuh yuhk yún) were large and very filling.  There is a parking lot.
