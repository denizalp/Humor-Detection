Four stars are for the Blueberry pop tart. It was delicious and something I would never usually consider.\n\nMy margarita pizza however was terrible. It was dry, hard and smaller than I expected. There was virtually no flavor to it. \n\nMy husband said his burrito was pretty good though. \n\nJust stay away from the pizza and I think you'll be fine.
