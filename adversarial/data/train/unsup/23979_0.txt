The staff are helpful and nice, and there is more selection here than other Curry locations. If only this could be on the subway line that would be great.  \n\nI live up north and it took me 1.5 hours to get here on the TTC.  By that time I had to go very badly and this store has a washroom.  So I went, and ended up buying 150$ worth of stuff, then I used the bathroom again before I left.
