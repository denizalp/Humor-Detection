I love this place!  I have been coming here for 10 years.  Most of the people are the same and it feels like family here.  The owners are so kind and they do a wonderful job at what they do. They have all of the latest nail trends and many pedicure and manicure options!You should definitely come here. You'll never want to go to any other nail shops. There prices are great and everyone does a great job!!
