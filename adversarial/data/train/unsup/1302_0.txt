Now I know why they say that you should wait a few months before trying a brand  new restaurant. We heard about this place while at Mi Va Mi (which I go to whenever I'm in town) and decided to try it. Do yourself a favor and stay away from Ba-Li Laffa. The humus with mushrooms was ok but the lamb kebab with 'special' rice was awful. The lamb was basically pieces of grilled fat. And the rice was    overcooked white rice with canned peas and carrots. Not so special after all. The server-Anais-while sweet wasn't all that well trained and kept apologizing. We asked for the chicken Shish Kebab and it was just OK. Nothing special or even good.  They left off the potato garnish on this one so I can't comment on what potentially could have been the only edible item.  Needless to say, the experience left us cold. And hungry. We gave our feedback to the server but got the feeling that it would fall on deaf ears. While I'm all for competition, I don't think Mi Va Mi has much to worry about.  Unless that is Ba-Li Laffa gets a real chef and someone to run the place. I was shocked that no one came over to get a read from us. After all, in this age of customer crowd sourcing they're missing out on not only constructive criticism but a chance for redemption.
