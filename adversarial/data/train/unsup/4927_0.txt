Took my two nieces to the Science Centre for a day of fun (more to give their parents a break for a day). They are 15 and 11.\nIt is the only time in the last year that I've seen the two of them agree on anything...they were laughing, they were playing with each other, they didn't roll their eyes at each other...it was almost as though they liked each other. Any place that can do that is purely magical.\nThe OSC encourages, no it demands, that you explore the exhibits with a hands on approach. Brilliantly conceived, it teaches kids science and biology and astronomy and aerodynamics and chemistry and geology and, and, and...without them realising it ! OMG !\nBuy tickets on-line as they're cheaper than at the door. It is a great place to spend the day...although the restaurant is packed and the food selection isn't the healthiest of choices....
