Cool atmosphere. I'll definitely come back once my bro is in town since he stays with my mom in Goodyear and we have nowhere else to go after dinner. The place offers gelato, coffees, beers, wines, live music on weekends, and a vibe I'm not aware of existing in this part of the west valley. \n\nThat said, Mr Owner of Ground Control, may I suggest that when a first-time customer walks in (which your counterchick knows because she asked me), you devise some sort of system where he isn't told that he's not allowed to order his simple goddamn cup of coffee at the counter and that he has to instead go wait at a table for someone to go ask him first, which he then dutifully does, until he gets so sick of waiting after 15 minutes of being ignored that he gets up and leaves. \n\nI just wanted a coffee. I was willing to do the work for you by walking up to the counter and placing the order. When I bother giving you another shot, which might take a while, I'll consider upping the stars.\n\nEDIT: Upped to 3 stars because of a polite response to my review by the owner of Ground Control.
