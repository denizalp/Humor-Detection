Some bullet points to go with the bullet proof glass cashiers were seated behind:\n\n-You will likely have a tough time finding this place. \n\n-It's in the smoke shop\/beer mart.\n\n-My burrito was not the best lengua I've had.. nor the worst. It didn't wow me enough for me to consider risking my life going back.\n\n-Minimal AC in the place.. super hot inside.\n\n-There isn't really seating or tables available.\n\n-The red sauce is pretty dang hot.\n\n-3 stars for the guy at the stove (possibly Chuy?) working his tail off. If he had the same operation almost anywhere else, I would go back.
