Got a trim and color from Lisa A. Color turned out great, rich tones and a spunky blonde in the bottom\/back that I love. \n\nThe salon is fun, not super high brow over the top fancy, more funky with dark woods and fun green accents. Owners are the coolest french couple. \n\nIn a strip mall, next to Spencer's furniture. All in all, totally recommend and will definitely be back!
