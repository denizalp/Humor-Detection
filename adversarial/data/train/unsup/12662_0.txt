Two Words: McFail Service\n\nMy friend and I came here for drinks. It's important to note that I paid for both of our drinks. \n\nMy friend had asked for water as he never served it to us when I asked twice while I was signing my bill.\n\nShe asked four times and she was constantly ignored! He called security on her for asking for water. I've never heard of this before as she was very calm and asked politely.\n\nShe was kicked out (and I left with her). I will never come back and I'm writing this to hopefully save someone time and money from this poorly run joint.
