So lucky to end up here my first night in Charlotte. Food is phenomenal - recommend Cherry lamb lollipops & Mac & cheese (amazing but super filling). Had to go back my second night in town (convinced there can't be better food in Charlotte). Calamari was awesome!  Brian the bartender deserves a raise! Amazing service!
