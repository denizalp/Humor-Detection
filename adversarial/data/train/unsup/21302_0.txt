How can you entertain your In-laws? Bring them to Jersey Boys! \n\nSince most of the music is from their era, we thought it would be a nice show to see.  The Jersey Boys takes you back and tells the story of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons.  So fun! The actors did a great job keeping the audience enthralled.  The singing with live instruments were fantastic.  I couldn't believe how many of the songs I knew.  Plus there were a few I didn't know they sang.  I loved it but it's obvious with a 5 star review.  I wouldn't recommend it for younger children since there is quite a bit of profanity.  \n\nIt's located in the Paris Casino & Hotel in Le Theatre des Arts.  Ushers are there to help finding your section and row.  Seating was comfy as well.  That helps when the show is over 2 hours long.  They do have an 8 minute intermission so at least people have a chance to stretch.  \n\nI am overjoyed.  Can't take my eyes off of the Jersey Boys.
