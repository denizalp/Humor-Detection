A few days ago was my first day in. I am looking for a washer and dryer that is newer used. Did not find what I wanted but I can say I was impressed by the service. The women who helped me came right up to me the moment I walked in the door and asked me what I was looking for. She showed me a few options and was extremely helpful. I would return in the future based on my experience. \n\nThis store is located in a shopping center next to Ross. They have a variety of home appliances to choose from. Affordable pricing for those not looking to pay expensive store prices.
