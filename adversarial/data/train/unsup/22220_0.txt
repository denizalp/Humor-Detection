Monster buffet with many very high quality items at a very reasonable price. Plus the setting of the buffet (a big circle) was incredibly inviting and pleasant. We felt *invited* to sit there for 3 hours. The service was excellent.\n\nNY strip, lamp chops, prime rib, all actually edible and flavorful! I loved the penne bolognese and the meatballs too. The salmon in the japanese section by the sushi was also a winner, while the salmon cooked on bamboo planks was more of a gimmick than anything else. The salads were super fresh. \n\nBeer and wine included (with thomas kemper on tap for mom!).\nCoffee drinks made to order, with a shot of your favorite liqueur!\n\nThe desserts...well, i can \"only\" speak for the flan, the crepes, the gelato,  the tiramisu, the creme brulee, and the parfait when I say \"damned delicious\". If I had more room I would have tried the chocolate souffle.\n\nDiggity!
