The food was delicious, but I felt like they threw a stick of butter in my lobster pasta. It was satisfying the first few bites, but then it became too much. However, I loved the foie gras burger, the sweetness of the maple syrup mixed with the foie gras was delightful. The service was great and I'd say that I don't regret eating here at all.
