5 stars because the service was excellent! I came in one morning and I wasn't sure exactly what I wanted. The owner happened to be there and she went through and let me try almost every juice they serve (excluding the spicy ones because I'm not into those). She explained everything and how the ingredients would benefit my body. I spent almost an hour going over the juices with her. She was not only informative but the juices and experience was wonder.
