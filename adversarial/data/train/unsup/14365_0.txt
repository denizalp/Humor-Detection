This is def 1 of my Absolute Favor8 places 2 go every opportunity I can & I'd luv 2 give them a Perfect score but unfortun8ly out of the countless Xs I've been there, my 1st experience there doesn't allow 4 that 2 b the case. Guess it's pretty impressive that out of all those Xs since, it's been nothing but an EXCEPTIONAL experience Every single time in service & food (other than WAY 2 much salt on popcorn once), but it still can't take away what wasn't handled as it should have been 4 the 1st impression. Have dined in both the fork & screen & the Cinema Suites (both r Gr8 but our preference is the Suites: b~n roomier & more luxurious)!\n\n   My 1st visit was 4 a special occasion 2 celebr8 the birthday of my very special guest.  Unfortun8ly it never fails, there was a crazy lady seated 2 our left in the row behind us.  I'd like 2 think she had tourette's syndrome but found out rather quickly she was a deliber8 instig8or &\/or a bitter attention wh*re hag who was trying 2 ruin every1 else's time, not just immedi8ly around her but in the entire theater. 4 whatever reason (in her head) she put most of her focus upon us.  \n\n   It was well b4 the previews & the server was explaining everything 2 us while taking our initial order of appetizers & drinks.  She kept clearing her throat way 2 loud whenever any1 was ordering anything but when our server came back w\/ our drinks, she loudly said \"Gonna order anymore b*tch?\" right as the noise of the present preview ended.  Every1 including our server looked @ her as she tried 2 play off not saying it while loudly eating her tub of popcorn worse than the cookie monster off Sesamee Street.  \n\n   We assumed our w8er left 2 notify management but that wasn't the case.  She continued w\/ her antics throwing her popcorn & insults all through the final preview & on in2 the start of the movie.  My guest went 2 notify management & 2 c if the w8er was in process of doing so.  I sat there clenching the arm rest trying not 2 turn in2 a She~Hulk while we were missing the opening. \n\n   Our w8er was busy tending 2 his orders but confirmed what had happened 2  management which my guest relayed.  Returning, he came back w\/ some lady \"manager\" (using that term very loosely) confronting the lady who immedi8ly burst in2 tears playing the victim & claiming she had a headache & would apologize 2 us after the show (like that was supposed 2 make everything ok\/understood). \n\n   Then the manager approached me & I told her if that woman didn't like the fact that this was a dine~in cinema she could go 2 a regular theater (as she's still chowin' down on her popcorn like nothing happened~crocodile tears dried) & that we were in no way being loud or disruptive (unlike her).  We were told not 2 talk 2 her & that \"she said she'd apologize 2 us after the movie.\"  We're thinking, What?? So ur not going 2 take care of the problem that the entire theater was having 2 deal w\/ & then tell US not 2 talk 2 her when nothing warranted this HARASSMENT of US & some1 trying 2 ruin things 4 others?  Sorry, that's NOT good enough!! \n\n   The PROBLEM should have been REMOVED\/had 2 LEAVE especially since the w8er confirmed what happened as the entire theater could.  It SHOULD have been CORRECTED even if it meant giving psycho lady off~her~meds a refund!!  Sad part is that doesn't even apply 2 her as everything was so blatantly intentional.  Part of HER PROBLEM trying 2 project on2 others seems 2 b she had an issue w\/ others ordering from the menu while she only had popcorn.  And if she wasn't such a nasty miserable being, we might have actually paid anonymously 4 her 2 select something 4 herself.  \n\n   Shame on that so~called \"manager\", thus the 4 instead of 5* rating!!  The only apology we got was from our server (we didn't care 2 hear from the wierdo lady who should b gr8ful we're the people we r instead of following her 2 her car or residence) but replied \"unfortun8ly we can't control the actions\/behavior of others but something can b done when these situ8ions\/nuisances present themselves & SOMETHING should have been!\"  Then a couple following behind us on the way out of the theater said \"oh yeah that crazy lady was Horrible, WE almost left ~ Absolutely NO excuse 4 that!\"  Glad 2 know obviously we weren't the only 1s feeling that way...
