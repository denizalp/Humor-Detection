Not the nicest hotel, only because it is a bit dated, but other than that the place is great.\nIt is clean and has an old school charm reminiscent of an Old Route 66 higher-end motor lodge. Clean rooms and comfortable beds.....No bed bugs! (1\/15)\nOutdoor pool and hot tub area is great!\nFree breakfast is standard Quality Inn fare, but prepared with attention and care far exceeding most other Quality Inns. Breakfast host is as dedicated to her roll as every employee we met up to the general manager. Truly impressive team here providing over the top hospitality....I would praise them more if it wouldn't give the impression I was connected in some way to the hotel! I am not!!\nWe were in a desperate traffic travel situation and chose this hotel despite the 1 star Yelp rating. SO happy we opted for this hotel during our predicament. Could not have picked a place more conducive to reducing our stress! The Holiday Inn nearby would not have provided near the ambiance.\nOnly con is the noise level around 8 am, but that is to be expected at a traveler's hotel.\nWe would absolutely recommend this hotel to any friend or family.
