Stayed here for a couple nights on a trip to Cedar Point.\n\nIt is perfectly located between Cedar Point and Cleveland. The highway on\/off ramps around the hotel are goofy so be careful that you don't miss your exit!\n\nElyria is a desolate Ohio town that looks like it got hit hard by the recession. There is nothing left in the area but a few chain restaurants and empty strip malls.\n\nHotel Pros:\nThe room was very very clean! I was surprised.\nI got a fantastic rate by booking online with my AAA membership.\nThe staff were very friendly.\nMy wi-fi worked.\nVanity located on outside of bathroom.\n\nHotel Cons:\nThe breakfast was TERRIBLE. This is where they lost 2 stars. I'm not going to lie...I may have booked this hotel because it offered a breakfast in the morning. I knew I was going to spend a lot of money on this trip and quick and convenient free breakfast in the morning was a really nice perk.\nThere were absolutely no menu options but 3 cereals, mushy instant eggs, and sausage gravy. My friend and I did a once-over and left, in search of a breakfast place.\nI will probably never choose Best Western again because of this.
