In a word: WORTHLESS.\n\nI'm visiting from out of town and have had my stay unexpectedly extended. I am wearing my last clean clothes. I ring up Paris Laundry because they advertise same-day service. They inform me that if I have my laundry in by 9am, I can pick it up by 4pm that afternoon. I roll over there at 8:20. The girl separates my t-shirts (9 Ts) and shorts (1 pair)... those will be $24.41...and my socks and briefs? 5lbs @ $3\/lb = $15. Total? Over $40. Holy crap. INSANELY expensive. At home (you know, that super-cheap city: San Francisco) I pay $0.80 a pound...and that includes pickup and delivery! Ok...it is an emergency, so whatever. I double check with her that it will be done by 4pm, she says \"Yes, it will be\". So out the door I go.\n\nFlash forward to 5:30pm: \"Oh, I'm sorry, your laundry isn't done. You'll have to pick it up tomorrow.\"\n\nWhat?!?!? You charge the highest rate on laundy I have ever seen, and can't even get it done on time? I don't need each t-shirt on its own hanger, what I need are my clean clothes delivered as promised.\n\nTo top it off, the girl was actually short with me when I insisted that she go find my clothes and bring them to me in whatever condition they were in...you know, because I didn't feel like running around *naked* tomorrow or wearing dirty briefs. I'll launder them myself. Oh, but she was OH-SO-GRACIOUS and wouldn't charge me for the laundry they didn't launder. But please pay us $24.41 for the half we got done ok? Gee thanks.\n\nSo here I am, in a laundromat, writing a review for you.\n\nThank you for wasting my time and charging me for the pleasure. Fuck you. You're fired!
