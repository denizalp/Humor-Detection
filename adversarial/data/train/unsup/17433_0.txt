This Arby's is super strange. We only came here because we were hungry, on the road, and needed something fast. The food was as mediocre as Arby's ever is and the atmosphere was really bizarre. Couldn't understand a word that came out of the cashier's mouth. They were blaring some awful Fox News show on TV. The place was full of creepy dudes staring at each other and us. Ugh.
