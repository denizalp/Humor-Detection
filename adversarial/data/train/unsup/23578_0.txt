It was a boring Sunday, as I had nothing to do and no mood to go somewhere to hang out. I decided to cook something for breakfast and \"BANG\" absolutely no ideas. Then I called my friend for advice and to chat a little. After analyzing all the recipes my friend had another \"BANG\" idea and that was Greens and Proteins. She told me \"just go there\". We decided to go there together, as if I wouldn`t like that place then the whole responsibility will lay on her and she'd have to feed me and cheer me up.\n\n Finally we got there. SURPRISE! Healthy food! \nYou shouldn't count calories anymore as these guys had made it for you. You can even remove calorie calculator from your phone. Our order was greek scramble, BBQ chicken pizza on lavash, spinach with tofu fries and two watermelon and strawberry smoothies. While food was being prepared, I went to the internet to find out what lavash is. It is a very thin bread widely spread in Caucasus and motherland is Armenia. https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lavash , they don't use yeast to make it and this is good. We got our food after about 15 minutes. All I can say about it is that it's great. Smoothie was very refreshing. You feel how you just did something good for yourself, have a lot of energy and could go for a run at the gym. These guys really need to add a couple of treadmills.\n\n Service was good as well. Guys were attentive and helpful with wide smiles on their faces. Overall good place with good food, service and perfect as hell smoothies. \nWill definitely come back and try all of their smoothies. \n\nWhat an artistic review, I think I have revealed some writer skills in me.
