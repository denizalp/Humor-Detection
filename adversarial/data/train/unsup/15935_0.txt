I had a Slap & Tickle and my guy had a Jic-Up.  The drinks were amazing; each fusing unexpected elements in a way that elevated everything to liquid art.  Mine was tropical vacation meets back alley booze hound.  His was like a spicy, smoke-infused Jicama bomb went off on your taste buds.\n\nThe ambience was dark and sultry; set in the revamped 1924 Luhrs building, Phoenix's first 10 story skyrise.  The waitstaff is smooth and polished.  The process is efficient, checkout happens immediately at table side with tablet card readers.\n\nMy only hitch in the whole night was that apparently my eyesight, and his, has deteriorated to the point that their extensive drink menu, as beautiful and detailed as it is, was nearly unintelligible in the dark and sexy setting.  \nWe saw a couple of dorks using their cell phones like a NightSun 2000 to light up the menu, but we aren't that uncool.  Nope, instead we discreetly tipped the tabletop candle dangerously at an angle to pitifully aim the warbly little light source at the menu and ordered the only two drinks we could definitively read the names of.      \n\n(The real problem is that once you are old enough to have the extra disposable income to go out and really enjoy yourself you are too old to go out and really enjoy yourself.)
