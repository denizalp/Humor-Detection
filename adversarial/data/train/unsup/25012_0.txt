Federico's Scottsdale location has not been able to maintain the consistent quality since its original opening. The prices have also gone up twice since its opening. The first 6 months, I was ecstatic about having a quality faster-food Mexican place in Scottsdale, near Shea\/Raintree corridor. My March 2015 trip, I wondered whether to go back again. The quality of the ground beef was absolutely not there. I ordered a ground beef burrito and a ground beef enchilada plate. It looked great and tasted flavorless, over-cooked, too dry. My teen daughter didn't even help me eat the leftovers. That is a good test! Their re-fried beans are great!
