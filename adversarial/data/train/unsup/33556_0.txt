The hubby and I came here on Saturday because my shoes were definitely in need of replacing. I've been running for about 2 years but had not taken the time to invest $$ in a pair of shoes that were going to improve my run. A dear friend of mind had highly recommended a visit to Charlotte Running Company, I'm glad she did!! The staff took the time to put me into four different shoes and test my gate on the treadmill to see if I was over pronating and by how much compared to each shoe I had tried on. They finally helped me select a shoe that was able to provide the support and flexibility that I needed. Thank you Charlotte Running Company!
