The studio is beautiful and the teachers are great.  Marie, Sabrina, and Victoria are my favorites.  I'm hoping this is the first of many CorePowers in Charlotte, as the drive from Matthews is long, but it's still worth it.  \n\nI do wish that the schedule had more variety per timeslot.  7:30 am is my favorite class to attend, but it's Hot Power Fusion every day; it would be great if the time slot had at least one other type of class rotating through (i.e. Sculpt on Tues\/Thurs) so that you have more options if only one timeslot works for your schedule.  That would really improve the experience and make me come more often.
