I really wanted to like this place but I didn't. I went during opening weekend and waited in line for about an hour before I got my drinks. It wasn't so much the line that made me give them 2 starts, it was the service, price, and quality of my drink.\n\nThe Service: although it was opening weekend, I really thought they would've train their staff better. The staff member that was in the line was very informational and provided menus to make the process faster. However, when I ordered with the cashier, the cashier needed much help from the other associates to complete my transaction. \n\nI got a split cup with Peach Blossom w\/ boba and Cucumber Lime w\/ boba. The peach blossom was mildly flavored and the cucumber lime taste like an agua de fresca from the hispanic market's but double the price!  I really felt that I could've skipped the line and got a better Peach tea else where. The idea of a split cup though is cool, but with the amount of ice they put in it, you'll finish it with 5 sips. \n\nPrice: I paid over $6.00 for my cup! This was PRICY! As I mentioned before, the cashier really confused me. When I was asked if I wanted boba I told him yes. BUT he did NOT tell me that it'll cost me $0.50 per SIDE! So I paid an additional $1.00 for just boba! They probably should've made it clear.\n\nI really wanted to like this place but I really won't be coming back.
