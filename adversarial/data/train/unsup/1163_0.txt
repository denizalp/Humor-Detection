What's not to love about a tower of beer the size of me? Throw in a couple of fried-grilled-baked-appetizers along with some good company and you have yourself a fantastic time. I can't wait for the temperature to warm up a bit and I'm going to this Happy Hour spot for Tuesday Karaoke Fight Night. \n\nThe owner Jayson is actually very personable which makes my review even more biased because I only ate 2 items on their menu. Chicken wings and Satay were delicious! But any joint where the owner puts their sweat and soul into the food (minus real sweat) is a good joint for me. I really hope this spot will be busier than Firefly because I love both in this plaza. \n\nNext visit :\nsit on patio, order everything on happy menu,  and beer tower.
