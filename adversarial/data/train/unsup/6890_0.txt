The food here is excellent. The value is questionable and the ambiance is very, very loud.\n\nThe good:\n- The sausages are outstanding\n- The kraut is very good\n- The duck fat fries are outstanding\n- The regular fries are good\n- There is a very very large beer selection\n\nThe bad:\n- The beer selection is vast but much too expensive. $9 Stiegl? No thanks.  There are a few local beers that were reasonably priced at $6.5\/$7 but generally the beer prices were exorbitant. \n- The beer selection is vast but there weren't TOO many things I was actually interested in on the list.\n- The large portion of fries\/duck fries for $5.5\/$6.5 were small compared to the price (but excellent).\n- We tried 4 dips with our two orders of fries (maple rosemary, wvrst, chipolte and garam masala) and no one liked any of them (actually, 1\/4 people liked the wvrst and 1\/4 liked the chipolte).\n- The order process was confusing.  I'm unclear if you can get beer from the sausage counter or not.  I got beer from the bar and food from the food counter and it was sort of a pain since the bar didn't really have any semblance of a line. \n- It is VERY loud; this is probably by design [in the style of open beer hall] but I wouldn't really count this as a positive - the night we were there there weren't any obnoxiously loud parties or people but if there had been, they would have carried throughout the entire open room and it would be very annoying.\n\nOverall, I would be happy to eat here again but I still think the prices for the fries and beer are too high.
