Carrabba's was the beneficiary of a gift certificate I received last Christmas. So I was in a mood to try a new place this past weekend. I managed to get past the packed parking lot next door and found a parking spot between two vehicles that were ready for the monster truck competition. I'm just glad they didn't crush my car when they left the lot.\n\nMy wife had made reservations and of course they tried to seat us near the kitchen, which we kindly asked for another seat. This restaurant was hot and apparently the A\/C wasn't turned on, I was about ready to leave but I decided to see this through for the sake of all the other Yelpers that may benefit from this review. Our server, which had a resemblance to Linda Barrett of \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\" put a smile to my face. So now I was in a much better mood than a few moments ago.\n\nThe drinks started coming out along with that piping hot yummy bread with olive oil. I ordered a bowl of soup instead of a cup, but received a cup instead. Our server rectified that and brought out a bowl of minestrone soup that could of feed a family. She charged us for a cup instead of a bowl. I guess I need to stop assuming things when dining out.\n\nI ordered a regular Chicken Paraseam which was 2 cutlets versus a lite version which was one cutlet. I loved the Chicken but the broccoli was way way (added emphasis) too garlicky for me. My wife's garlic mashed potatoes were excellent; she also ordered the Chicken Bryan which she enjoyed. I would definitely go back to Carrabbas, we spent about $37 before tip without any alcohol.
