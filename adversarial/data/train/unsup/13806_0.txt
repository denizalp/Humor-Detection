Le Reve, which is french for the dream, makes you literally feel like you're in a dream that you do not want to wake from. \n\nAs a huge fan of Cirque du soleil (seen KA, Zarkana, Love, Totem and Zumanity) I was excited for this show because it was created by the same director that made O and nothing Steve Wynn does is ever half hearted. First off, the theater is really small and intimate. Pretty much there are no bad seats in the house and we were satisfied with our 4th row seats right next to the aisle.\n\nThe production is just fantastic! At first, I had no idea what to expect. I thought it was going to be synchronized swimming. Boy was I wrong, this show is a vertical delight with crazy aeriel acrobats and performers jumping from high up and diving down into the water. The stage set up is breath taking, it just rearranges itself every time. The performers were really into the act and who would have thought break dancing and ball room dancing on water would have such a dazzling effect. The live music keeps you ramped up and the energy never lets down. Even the comedians were great because they blended magic and comedy together. I am oftentimes disappointed in comedy in the Cirque shows so this was a breath of fresh air!\n\nOverall, I would say this is in my top 3 Vegas shows alongside Love and Zumanity. Do not hesitate to watch this show, you will not be disappointed!
