The best egg rolls ever! Best Wok has some really good dishes like their sesame chicken,  & the wings are delicious, the fried rice is good too but the egg rolls are the reason to try!! Hands down the best egg rolls in the city! They also have a nice, high sanitation score & they're so sweet to customers. I didn't even know they were in that shopping center tucked away but I am so glad we found them! We've made it our new go to Chinese spot!
