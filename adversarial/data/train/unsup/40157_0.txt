This is the thing I miss the most about Pittsburgh. Salim's has the best gyros I have ever had. their cheese pies and meat pies are also delicious. They make everything in house. We ate at Salim's at least once a week and never had bad food or bad service. We were always greeted with a \"hello my friends' and left with a grateful \"thank you\". You are doing yoru self a disservice by not eating here.
