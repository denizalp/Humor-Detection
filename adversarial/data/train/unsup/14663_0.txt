This is a big Wal-Mart. It was built as a super center, not converted as others have been. There is a larger selection of items than most Wal-Marts. This one always seems busy and congested. \n\nIt's not in a good area though, and I always hesitate to go there. When I do go, I just keep my expectations low. Get in. Get what I need. Get out.
