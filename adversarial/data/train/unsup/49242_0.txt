I always struggle to find a place that can take care of my lashes and pay attention to my sensitive eyelids. And few of my experience at other places scars me for a long time, until I find this place. \nGina is very attentive and gentle on the touch, so for all the girls who has sensitive eyes and skins, she is the ONE. \nAnd you can book appointment the porcelain room website, which is another big thumbs up from me. For that group of people who don't like to pick the phone and make a call. \nHighly recommended, and will come back.
