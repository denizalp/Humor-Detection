This independently owned freestanding Day Spa has been thriving in the Valley for years yet I've never gone... Being too enthralled with the idea of going to a big resort for access to all the amenities. Well I waited too long. My girlfriend and I spent the day at Lamar for her birthday. The spa has all the amenities that you would have been a big resort. Actually, they have more than most. Steam AND sauna, great relaxation area, a private outdoor pool & hot tub...(co ed btw which I have been disappointed by at most spas I've been to). They serve hot tea,coffee,  iced tea, lemon water, fruits...\nThe skincare product to use have a essential oils in them which totally adds to the experience. Each of our therapist was completely professional and experienced & both of us agreed our treatments were excellent. The environment was perfect in every detail.
