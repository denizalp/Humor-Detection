RED FLAG: This McDonald's across from Banner Desert Hospital on Southern just west of Dobson does NOT open at the stated opening time! The door sign states that they open at 5am and twice in a couple of weeks I have gone there after 5:30am and the door is still locked and the external lights are still out. Both times there were employees in the store. When I tried the door (locked) the employees looked right at me but then turned and started doing something else rather than open the door. The first time there were about a dozen people standing around waiting for them to open. This time I was the only customer so other customers have probably given up.\nDoes this store NOT have a manager???
