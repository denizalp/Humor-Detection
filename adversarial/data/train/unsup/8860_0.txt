Located just a few minutes from Upper Canada Mall in Newmarket is Chez Talal. Chez Talal is a great place to get delicious shawarma at a good price. The owner here seems very nice and is quite talkative with his customers. \n\nI ordered a chicken shawarma wrap ($7). The ingredients were fresh and the food was delicious. I would love to order the chicken shawarma dinner the next time I'm here since it includes a pita and a drink for just $10. Or maybe I would try the falafel. Either way I'll be returning next time I'm in the area.
