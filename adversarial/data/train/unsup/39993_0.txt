WOW.\n\nI was so terribly disappointed with my experience at this bakery. \n\nI ordered a cake for my engagement party here and it was horrible. \nI paid $$$ for this cake and ended up with something that looked like I had baked it myself.\nEveryone at my party kept asking me if it was homemade.\n\nWhen I first arrived my cake topper was tipped over and smooched into the cake.  At first the girl at the counter fixed this by simply straightening the cake topper and stating \"there\" not doing anything about the messed up icing around it - or the holes in the buttercream. \n\nAfter stating how upset I was about the presentation she stated that there were no details written on my order form - even though I spend over half an hour describing to the associate exactly what I wanted the day I ordered it.  The girl behind the counter did make her best attempt to fix it after I expressed my opinion however she stated there were no managers available and that she had little experience with icing. it still looked like something I had created myself - but it was at least decent.\n\nWhen I got home I discovered that my cake topper was actually broken. Which is why it kept tipping over. The ceramic peg on the bottom was missing - it looked like it had been dropped. \n\nYet no one bothered to mention it to me. They also were suppose to use two different types of icing - vanilla on the outside and maple fudge on the inside - yet it was entirely vanilla. \n\nOther than dropping it, I'm not sure what else could have been more wrong.
