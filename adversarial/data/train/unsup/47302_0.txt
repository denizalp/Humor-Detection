The worse service ever. The meat was literally swimming in a pool of grease, cooks weren't wearing gloves when preparing the food, drink station was all torn apart and the salsa bar was a complete disaster. As we entered the front door there was a terrible odor like someone vomited all over the place. Outside garbage everywhere and even some cupcakes laying on the floor. Stood in line 10 minutes without being acknowledged. Will never step foot there again
