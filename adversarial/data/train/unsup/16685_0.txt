Sal si puedes. \n\nFrom a business trip perspective, this place was major fail.\n\nI was here for a conference, related to internet commerce. Hey, guess what didn't work? Give up? 'K, I'll tell you.  Internet. \n\nThe people at the check-in counter were happy to announce that the hotel had recently upgraded to wifi. Recently? This should have been done a long time ago, not last week. See my last review from two years ago, regarding no internet.\n\nIf it wants to host conferences, the Rio needs to be able to support the conference's needs.  I was refunded the $14\/day internet access fee, as were most other conference-goers who complained I'm sure, but it cost the guests much more than that. It cost them their business, as virtual meetings and skype calls, and even simple activities like checking email, could not be done. \n\nAnd for $200\/night to stay there? No. \n\nThere remain two redeeming features of the Rio.\n\n* Gaylord's Indian restaurant. Completely decent Indian food at completely decent prices, in a well-appointed space. Totally overlooked and underappreciated by most Rio guests as they surge  frantically towards the All-Murkin bar and grill.  And because so few people dine there, they don't have the staff to handle moderate traffic from the all-murkin bar and grill spillover at lunchtime. Poor guys. I say to them: Sal Si Puedes.\n\n* The second feature is the free shuttle, because it takes you *away* from the Rio. SAL SI PUEDES!
