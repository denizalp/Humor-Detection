I think Payard sings a siren song that beckons all who love sweet treats.  Seriously.  Every time I stay at Caesar's Palace, I make it a point to stop by Payard multiple times.  I just love looking at all of the sweet little pastries and yummy candies.\n\nOn my most recent excursion, I selected a box of the bourbon truffles as a gift.  I was informed that they were absolutely divine, melt in your mouth perfection.  Noted!\n\nI could not leave Payard without picking up a little something for myself.  I decided on the French Macarons.  OH MY GOODNESS!  I was officially a French Macaron fan after taking that first bite.  My favorite flavor was the Passion Fruit.  Delish!\n\nI also had the opportunity to partake in a little breakfast at the restaurant before we left for the airport.  I ordered the French Toast with fresh berries and whipped cream.  Decadent!  The toast was much crisper than any French Toast I've ever tasted, but it was quite good.  Of course, using brioche certainly helps matters.\n\nOh, and I also got to see Francois Payard himself at his restaurant!  If I would have had a copy of his cookbook, I would have marched right over there and asked ever so sweetly for an autograph.  Oh well.  That will have to wait until my next visit.  ;)
