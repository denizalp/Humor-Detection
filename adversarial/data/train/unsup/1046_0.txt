Tony's is a tricky spot for me. I always pick up a pizza, I live 10 minutes away, and I like my pizza piping hot. This requires some strategy. \n\nFirst, I have to find a parking spot close to Tony's (it's a big parking lot). Second, I have to decide if I should leave the doors unlocked for when I return with the pizza in my hands (every second counts). \n\nOn this night, I got the second spot closest to Tony's, left the doors unlocked, speed-walked back to the car with the pizza, and found a guy in the backseat of the car next to me smoking a blunt. He casually nodded to me as he exhaled a plume of smoke, then his eyes widened when he saw my pizza (you know how that goes). I needed to depart immediately, just in case he decided to make a move for my pie. \n\nIn order to get home while the pizza was still relatively hot, I took a shortcut, which is Kearns Rd. The only problem is that Kearns Rd. is a single-lane road and I was stuck behind some guy in a small, black Toyota Camry. \n\nThose are cool cars, but this dude drove like he owned the road and wouldn't let me pass, then he didn't signal until he was in the middle of his turn. Freaking Guy. It got to the point where I wouldn't signal because I thought if he knew where I was going, he would purposely go the same way because he knew I had a hot pizza. \n\nWhen I got home, the pizza was still hot, but sometimes the hottest things aren't the tastiest. Tony's used to be The Joint, now it's just \"a pizza joint.\" Maybe they had an off night, but it tasted a lot plainer than in the past. \n\nPlease don't get the wrong idea. It's still good NY pizza; this rating is based on Tony's standards, which leads me to an important life lesson....\n\nIf a pizza place is called \"NY Pizza\" or the name has anything with the word \"NY\" in it, it's going to let you down. The real NY pizza places have an Italian name: Tony's, DaVinci's, Vinny's, Dominic's, Malachi's (j\/k). \n\nI still recommend Tony's because it's better than most pizza, but I'm not in a hurry to go back.
