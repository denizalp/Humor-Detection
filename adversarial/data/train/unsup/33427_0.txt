Ridiculously overpriced. Luxury prices for average-at-best apartments\/facilities. Used to be great because you could live in an interesting part of town for cheap, but ever since Greystar took over they've jacked rent way up, force you to pay for parking when before it was optional ($10 extra out of your pocket), raised the prices on the laundry facility, installed cable\/internet no one wanted or asked for just so they can charge you an extra $60-$80\/mo. The plumbing still goes out at least once a month, at least, and always has for the entire 3-4 years I lived there. Rush hour is a nightmare. Next to public trans. so enjoy having your car broken into like mine was and homeless people digging through your garbage on the regular. Basically all they want to do is nickle-and-dime and otherwise milk as much money out of you as possible. Plenty of much, much nicer places with pools to live in Phoenix for more reasonable (in my case lower) prices (twice the square-footage, higher ceilings, quieter, less riff-raff, $100-$200 less). Keep looking, this place is so not worth it.
