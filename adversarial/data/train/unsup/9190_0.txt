Fantastic food. Great service. The only thing I didn't like.. your food comes in a bag and they don't give you a plate. Seriously? I do not want to eat off of the table. :( \n\nBeen back twice since initial review. Order the king crab, it's delicious. I changed my review to 5 stars because the staff is awesome. The owner really cares about his business and it shows. Besides, my only complaint is eating off of the table... Which I have not been required to do. The staff was kind enough to provide me with a basket each time.
