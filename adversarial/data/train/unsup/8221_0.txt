I had a BBQ craving & Famous Dave's isn't too far so we decided to order take out.  I ordered a smoked chicken breast sandwich & my husband got pulled pork.  The sauce was GREAT but that's about it.  The meat was dry as could be & this was around 6:30pm so I'm not sure why it would be so dry, almost as if it was from lunch, yuck.  We were starving so I choked most of down, drowning it in the sauce.  I'm always on the hunt for good BBQ but this was just bad.  Maybe it was an off night, I'm not sure but for the prices, I'm not sure if we will be rushing back anytime soon.
