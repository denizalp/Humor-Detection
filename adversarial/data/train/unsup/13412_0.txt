I visited Rosallie with some friends for a cheese and wine night they were having. The line could have been better organized we were just standing there shrugging our shoulders near the cash register wondering if someone was going to come over and charge us or if it was something you pay for at the end? After someone finally came over and rung us up we were handed plates to get some cheese. Good selection of cheeses offered here and the breads were good too. I came back recently for brunch with friends. Service started out good but then changed. When my order came I had a smaller drink than the menu described, I asked for a chocolate croissant and got a regular one, and there was no jam or butter on my plate as the menu stated comes with it. After saying something to the girl working I was quickly brought butter and jam but my croissant and drink didn't get corrected. The breads and jam were good I really liked that and the croissant was flaky and delicious. I do wish my order came as it was supposed to I had been looking forward to trying the much talked about chocolate croissant here for months. Guess I gotta keep waiting. Some others in our group had to wait a really long time for their orders which was just sandwiches and they did complain of the bread being hard. I guess the owner was out of town and of the only 2 people working... it turned out to be the girls first day. They could have said something when we first arrived since the brunch was planned in advance to just simply give us a heads up that they might have some hiccups. The menu has a bit of something for everyone but I have to admit I was surprised to not see a traditional croque monsieur or madame on the menu since pretty much that's what people would expect to find at a French cafe. Their take on it is the croque Rosallie and it is damn good tho.
