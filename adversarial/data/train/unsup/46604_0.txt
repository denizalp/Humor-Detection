I live south of Calgary and unfortunately can't help but drive all the way downtown just to get their subs.  if I don't have the time to go here, I don't bother anymore.  I've tried them all and I've yet to find a satay sub that I like as much as these.  My daughter won't even bother with a sub if they aren't from here.  I always get exactly what I want...   lots of fresh toppings, a generous amount of meat and the buns .... always fresh!\n\nEveryone else talks about satay subs but are they really satay subs?  I think not.  Have you ever googled what satay really is?  It's not soya sauce with a bit of seasoning .... it's a PEANUT BUTTER sauce that contains soya sauce and other seasonings.  So tell me, who uses a real satay sauce:  Trung Nguyen and ..... exactly, nobody else!!    \n\nIf you haven't tried these subs, you should. And yes, she can be abrupt at times.  So what?  there's likely 20 people coming in behind you.  She takes great care of her regulars and she's a hoot if you take the time to chat with her.  I only have to wave a 1 or 2 (for the # of subs I want) and I'm good to go.  I love this place and will remain a dedicated fan... satay beef & honey garlic chicken with extra cucumber\/no onions
