Yesterday, in Afghanistan the US dropped \"the mother of all bombs\" and after experiencing my first visit ever to Dave & Buster's, I can honestly say that the bomb made less noise than the loud, obnoxious, overbearing ear-piercing noise that was Dave & Buster's. While I knew in advance what the experience would become, I never thought I would ever enter a place that made me want to turn around and walk out quicker. Knowing also that it was not my demographic, I attended a corporate event that was held in a separate room that was far from sound-proof. The food that was served was unidentifiable. It was fried something, deeply battered and unrecognizable as edible. If you want to lose your hearing, taste buds and sanity, then Dave & Buster's is definitely for you.
