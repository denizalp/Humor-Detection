This place is a solid, good, and rather typical Mexican restaurant:  The margaritas are good, fair priced, and also come in pitchers, the decor is slightly tacky, when you are seated you get fresh chips and salsa, and everybody seems to be on 'island time'.  The one thing that really does it for me at Frank & Lupe's Old Mexico is the patio!  That is why I keep coming back.  I should also mention I think 'Frank and Lupe's' is a cool name and fun to say.  If you are in a hurry don't come here, but if you want to lounge on the patio and have a leisurely lunch with a margarita in Old Town, well then, Frank and Lupe's is your place!
