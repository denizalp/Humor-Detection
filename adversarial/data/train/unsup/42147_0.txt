I will never ever understand why no one ever built a nice, big supermarket on campus. This is one of 2 nearby options and is way overpriced and offers very little variety. Sure, it has the basics but not much more. Also one time I bought gluten free fresh pasta there and got home to make it and it was moldy. Gross.\n\n The one thing I always go there for is their sushi bar, it's delicious! It's also in a very convenient location and offers very nice hours to accommodate us college folk.\n\nOverall, a whole lotta meh.
