This is our 3rd attempt at this place. Each experience has progressively gotten worse.\n\nPizza pretty good on first attempt, but service was poor. Okay, I'll give them 'new' flexibility here.\n\nNext attempt, still extremely poor service, we sat on hold for almost 13 minutes. Tried the calzones - extremely flavorless. Just bland.\n\nThen there's tonight.\n\nOnline ordered at 5:50pm, estimated time for pick up was 6:20pm. We set a future order to be ready at 7:00pm so we could run to Smiths and grab a few things first.\n\nWe got to Pizza Factory at 6:48, waited a few minutes before going inside at 6:55.... I waited in the car with my 2 school aged kids  (who are in year round school and have class in the morning) and 1 toddler. 7:00 comes and goes, 7:10, 7:15, 7:20.... I finally go inside to check on my husband. It's STILL not ready.\n\nMy husband stated that he was skipped over in line by the cashier to pick up the order first of all, and then when asked about the delay he got a response of \"oh, well, we're kinda busy tonight\" - There we 2 families dining in, no one else picking up and the delivery driver was taking orders 1 at a time. - You're not busy. The owner is slumy and running you on minimal staff with poor training.\n\nSo my biggest issue is a toddler falling asleep in a car at 7pm means that said toddler will not go to bed until after midnight. Here I am with an overcooked pizza (cheese is hard and crust is gnawed on like a dog bone) and a toddler that will keep me up all night. I have work in the morning. Work required to pay for future pizza orders. So here's to my exhausted under productive day and crabby 16 month old who won't go to sleep until after midnight.\n\nWe WILL NOT be going back for a 4th attempt. They've shown me it only gets worse.
