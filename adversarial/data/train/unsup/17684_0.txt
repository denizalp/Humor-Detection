Saw Blueberry Hill on Diners Drive Ins and Dives and was kinda excited but once I found out they didn't have fresh blueberries I was pissed. I love giant locally growned blueberries, but their blueberries looked like they needed to be hooked up to an IV. This place was just too plain with all the life sucked out. I've had better breakfasts at Denny's.\n\nIf you get anything get the half Biscuits and Gravy comes with eggs and 2 sausage links, cheap and it will fill you up. Like too many other breakfast joints they're waffles are too sweet and pancakes too heavy.
