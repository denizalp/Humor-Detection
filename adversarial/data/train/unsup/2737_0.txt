So far I have to agree with all other patrons. I ordered a dirty martini, it tasted like olive water, and when I asked for an upgraded Gin and was willing to pay the difference I was told there was nothing we can do there are 50 cameras watching me. ATTENTION MANAGERS\/OWNERS you should allow your bartenders some flexibility here. It's a gaming establishment, don't you comp drinks all day long? I am not a 21 year old wanting to sample a bunch of liquor for free. \nOn the karaoke note - if you get here early you will get to sing.   Thanks to you karaoke DJ for making the night
