Four of us arrived a few minutes after the first 2 in our party of 6 were seated. There was no host\/hostess around when we walked in. Our drink orders were taken about 10 minutes after we sat down, and it was another 10-15 minutes before we began to receive them. They were brought a few at a time; the one non-alcoholic beverage was served after the appetizers were almost finished. The food was average, but was served more timely than the drinks. The calamari was cooked well, but the breading was very thin and fell off. The marinara sauce had no flavor. The house salad was little piles of cheese, lettuce, diced tomatoes, and 2 cuke slices on a plate. The main entrees were not bad, but nothing stood out as delicious. We were told by the manager on duty that our server was their most attentive, however, we had to get her attention or ask another server passing by for drink refills, a replacement of the empty ketchup bottle she brought us, and for our checks. We were there for over 2.5 hours. Thankfully were able to enjoy the company of those we were with in spite of the lack of attent service.
