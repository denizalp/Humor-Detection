8\/11\n\nAfter visiting Cerreta's candy factory, I thought I'd knock another eatery off my list of places I've wanted to visit for many years.  La Piazza joins the ranks of Matt's Big Breakfast and Pizzeria Bianco as being the only places, that I can recall, where there was a wait to get in!  No, correct that, THIS is the only place I can recall, in the US, where I've been to that there was a crowd waiting to get in before store hours began.  Correction, again: La Piazza and Todai (in Schaumburg, IL) are the only two places I've visited, here in the US, that I can recall that had a line of people waiting to get in, in my last 20 years of life thus far.  I can't claim that I've lined up at Matt's or at Pizzeria Bianco before they opened for business...\n\nWhat a cute place!  Really liked the atmosphere here (wine cabinet, murals, brick walls, etc.), and the staff seemed to enjoy their jobs.  Well, most of them did, anyway...  But why don't we just get straight to the food?!  Hmm?\n\nI ordered the La Piazza Bianco http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/-Dnh48f029YNugtMKkkI-Q?select=Oadu8QvsrHJU-4PMfLTjYw#Oadu8QvsrHJU-4PMfLTjYw, which is comprised of ricotta, fresh mozzarella and basil, garlic, and garlic butter sauce.  The cheeses looked so beautiful and exquisite (!), but the pizza came out charred in so many places.  Unfortunately, there wasn't a hint of crispiness to its crust ANYWHERE, and this is no exaggeration.http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/-Dnh48f029YNugtMKkkI-Q?select=fV3E74fisRXUvjU85CalOQ#fV3E74fisRXUvjU85CalOQ  The pizzaiolo's excuses for the lack of crispiness were that the fresh garlic sauce and homemade cheeses caused the crust to be more soggy than his other pizza varieties, and bec. the restaurant just opened, so that the brick oven was not hot enough.  His mother offered to have another pizza done, as she didn't want to see anyone dissatisfied.  I asked if perhaps rolling the crust a little thinner would be possible.  The second pizza was clearly much better... http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/-Dnh48f029YNugtMKkkI-Q?select=sbGKg7yJwLmX4wlhWsEJRQ#sbGKg7yJwLmX4wlhWsEJRQ  Loved the thinner crust, and the crust's edges on this one were crispy!  (The butter garlic sauce caused the main areas to be soggy, but at least there were crispy areas.)   I wish I could've videotaped handling the slice of pizza of the first one... it folded without the slightest crunch or flakiness.  If you're a crispy thin-crust lover, I suggest you specify this before ordering from here.  While my beef was due to the sogginess of the pizza crust (I didn't even mention the burnt areas- I didn't think there was any need to!), the ingredients, however, were of high quality!  I was so disappointed that the matriarch took the remaining slices away- I only had about one and half slices' worth of toppings to enjoy :'(  Most places I've been to that offered to correct grievances left the original items on the table, gratis.  She did, however, offer complimentary dessert.  Their cheesecake is fantastic!  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/-Dnh48f029YNugtMKkkI-Q?select=dUlITiNdAY5kue075cevJQ#dUlITiNdAY5kue075cevJQ
