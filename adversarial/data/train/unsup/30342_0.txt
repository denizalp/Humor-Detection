My only complaint is that they need to also add one of these stores downtown and\/or the east side!\n\nTrader Joe's has a great selection and the prices are so much more reasonable than other health food stores in the area. The Willy Street coop is a second best. \n\nI love that most products are free of artificial colors and flavors!\n\nThe staff is helpful and friendly!!!\n\nDid I mention they need another location on the east side?!
