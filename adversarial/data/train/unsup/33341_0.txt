I was totally surprised by this place. \n\nIt's in the middle of a run-down strip mall and it's not a whole lot to look at. \n\nI was in the area for lunch and my photographer suggested we go here. He said \"you gotta try the Jade Red Chicken.\" I'm always up for something a little different. So when he said t's an Asian-Mexican fusion type of place, I was curious. \n\nInside, the decor is very weird looking. But it's been my experience that places that aren't too fancy looking often have the best food. \n\nI go up to the counter and I was surprised they look you sample some of the dishes. I knew I was going to order the Jade Red Chicken, but I wanted to give it a whirl first. I was blown away! The jerk fried rice was also freaking good! To top it off, they give you a moist snicker doodle cookie?!\n\nI am totally going to go out of my way to come here again. The next thing I've been told I need to try is the Jade Red Chicken quesadilla.
