For Mother's Day, I purchased a bouquet of chocolate dipped strawberries in a red vase, because my mother's favorite color is red. In the online photo, it looked beautiful, and it was a no-brainer that it would be perfect for my mom. However, the bouquet (made at this Edible Arrangements location) arrived in a tacky white vase with red hearts on it, and didn't look nearly as delicious as the photo (of course, nothing ever does). \n\nI sent a note to their Customer Service Dept., explaining my displeasure. The next day, a representative from this location (Katherine) called me and said they would send out the correct arrangement that day. It was a very abrupt conversation...no 'we're sorry', no explanation. I said that I appreciated their efforts in correcting this problem, then went ahead to let my mom know a new one would be coming, to which she got very excited.\n\nThe replacement arrangement never arrived, much to my and my mother's displeasure. I called Katherine back, explained the problem, and again there was no apology or explanation why this happened. She was extremely flippant about the whole ordeal, and appeared quite scatterbrained and like she didn't care one way or the other. She again said they would right the error. \n\nToday my mom called and told me that she was just delivered an EMPTY vase. This is the vase that the arrangement should have been delivered in the first time, but it was EMPTY. Katherine indicated to me on 5\/10\/13 that an entirely new arrangement would be delivered to my mother on that day to correct their error, including new strawberries. Totally CLASSLESS. \n\nIt's safe to say I won't be ordering from this location ever again.
