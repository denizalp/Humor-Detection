This place is amazinggggg!!! and too bad I only came in for carry out!\nI came in by recommendation of the Aloft hotel. I was startving, didn't want to walk as my feet were achy,\nI only came to the bar where a lovely bartender showed me the real menu...not the little menu.\n\nI ordered a gin and tonic thinking I had to wait over 20 mins for my seafood risotto. The bartender was undertanding, got my order in no time!  She told me about the place and local area. Too bad I was only in Charlotte for a few days. But I will definitely go back just to have some more of that seafood risotto. You should had seen the size of the scallops...the shrimp, the mussles, even squid. Sooooo tastyyyyyyyyy. Can you FEDEX an order!!!! Please consider...
