I specifically ordered no onions on my salad, and of course, it came with a tons of onions.  Also, the menu stated that my salad came with fries and there were no fries on my salad.  I ordered takeout so going back to the restaurant wasn't an option for me.  \n\nWhen I was standing at the counter, one of the cooks in the back got loud with someone I assume was the manager and said \"Get off my back Maryann.  I don't need to wear gloves every time I make a salad.\"  Very concerning.  Not happy with this experience at all.
