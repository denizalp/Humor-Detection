I enjoy the multitudes of meat at a Brazilian steakhouse as much as the next guy, but personally prefer other options to Via Brasil. The pricing is reasonable for what is offered, and I appreciate that salad bar-only ($26) is an option (and it includes a few hot dishes), but the main choices are Prime ($40) or Sterling ($50, +$10 for 7 additional meats). Assorted sides are included but dessert and drinks are extra for each package, a la carte available with HH at the bar\/lounge. Management and servers were very nice and came by frequently to check on us. Interior is dark and upscale, with a large private area available for groups; gameplay discount menu available ($20 min).\n\nWe opted for the Sterling dinner. Salad bar was okay, with chicken marsala and marinara mussels available in addition to cold items and soup. The meats were all fairly good, but I was somewhat annoyed that we had to specifically request some of the additional featured meats for our category. We were able to try the NY steak, grilled shrimp, and rib eye but had to request others like the lamb chops. I would have tried the lamb leg and salmon if they'd been offered but the menu outlining our selection was not on the table and frankly that should be handled by the server not my memory. Meat quality was fairly good, with the garlic steak and bacon-wrapped filet being standouts. but most options were on the tougher side. Sides of asparagus and fried yucca were solid. \n\nTIP: Sign up for their mailing list for the occasional $25 discount coupon.
