The three stars is probably unfair because I'm not vegan. But I got a pad thai with tofu and I like tofu, lots of yummy veggies, noodles okay. My boys ordered pizza, some sort of cheese substitute I almost gaged when I tried it, the cheese was gross and the sauce sugary sweet. That was just inedible. My husband got a fake beef dish and that was actually the best out of them all. But if you are vegan why bother with fake beef? I don't get it.  I ordered an oatmeal cream pie it was like biting into a block of sugar. My kids loved it. Never again.
