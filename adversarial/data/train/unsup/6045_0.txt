Very dirty restaurant. DO NOT!! Sit on their couches!! I got a rash from sitting on their couch. I got the jerk chicken. It was dry. The beef patty was old and hard. Customer service is horrible I told them my beef patty was hard and she sucked her teeth at me and brought me a microwaved beef patty. OVERPRICED!! You can get way better jerk though out the GTA for a more reasonable price. The only good thing about this place is the outside appearance of the restaurant but do not be fooled once inside it's all downhill from there.
