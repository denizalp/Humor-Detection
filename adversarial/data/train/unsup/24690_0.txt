MAN THIS PLACE SUCKS BALLSACK\n\nCame here on a whim while passing by and decided to give the Oreo Milk bubbletea with tapioca a try. Upon ordering, the waitress let me know it was buy one, get one free but seeing as I was by myself I politely declined the offer since I would just look like a damn pig walking down the streets of Yonge with 2 bubble tea's in my hand right? How selfish can I be? LOL\n\nAnd to be honest, I waited quiiiiiiite a bit of time just for a SMALL.... I had a phone conversation for almost TEN MINUTES - I kid you not so let me say that again - TEN MINUTES! Like what the hell was this guy doing?! Using a toothpick to smash the oreo's!?! - and literally there were only 2 other tables who had customers already enjoying their treats while one was already on the way out so CAHM ONNNN!\n\nI paid $5.65 for the small and as I was about to leave when I finally picked up my order after taking an hour nap lol, the waitress came running after me to tell me they forgot to put tapioca in my drink *DERPINA* Surprised, I didn't even realize the mistake until she pointed it out so I obviously had to go back and get the tapioca *facepalm & smdh*\n\nNeedless to say no one else had an order so I wasn't too sure as to why it was a.) taking light years to make a small drink... and b.) couldn't the bubble tea maker take that time it took to make my drink to make it right and remember what the hell I ordered since it's simply written on the receipt paper?! GAWD DAYUM PPLZ IT AINT THAT HARD *that's what she said...*\n\nUpon drinking it, the tapioca had a strange taste - I assume they use some weird ass syrup to soak the tapioca in that makes me feel like what I'm eating tastes like what flowers smell like.. oh geeze lol sounds delicious right? *barf* I also noticed it was still mid-day and they were out of certain macarons and during closer inspection, you could tell most of the shells were a bit cracked. Definitely won't be coming back nor suggesting this business.
