I live right across the street from this place, tried it a few times but never go there. The pizzas are okay, but they don't serve wings. Also the salads are bland and not good at all. I go to Oregano's or zipps in this neighbourhood. I predict this place will close within the next year. There are too many fantastic places serving similar but better food close by. Can't make it in Arizona with below average food.
