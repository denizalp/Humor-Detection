I was told by my GP that I needed to consult an Endocrinologist.   I am very picky about doctors so I didn't go with the one she recommended because a Google search showed me reviews that I wasn't comfortable with.  After further online research, Dr. Nguyen popped up with multiple reviews and high ratings.  When I initially called the office the first available appointment was about 45 days out.  I took it but still asked for some recommendations from friends and his name popped up again.  When I arrived at the office I was surprised at how small the waiting area is.  There were maybe six chairs and then additional seating in the hallway.  It's very deceiving because once you are called back the area is very large.  Dr. Nguyen had a student with him, which I suppose if you are not a fan of you can just let him know.  Dr. Nguyen is very personable and takes the time to explain everything and is conservative in his treatment approach.  It doesn't hurt that he was also named one of the Top Docs in the Feb\/March Vegas Seven magazine.
