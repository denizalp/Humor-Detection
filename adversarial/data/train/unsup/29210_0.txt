They catered a community event this week and it was make your own tacos. I have got to go back! The chicken tacos were very simple just tortillas, chicken, three choices of salsa, cilantro, and lime. First of all they were amazingly simple but flavorful. Second of all the marinade the chicken was in was spicy but did not burn my tongue at all. My lips however, were close to on fire. That was the general consensus. It was unusually hot for mexican food, but totally delicious and I will be going to their restaurant.
