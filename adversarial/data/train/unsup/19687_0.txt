TSA just ignore when I had a question and told me to ask someone else....wow really\n\nI want to know where I can mail out a postcard and this card just push me aside.  Now the trip is ending and I am over the fact that yes i am a freak of nature cause im asian...yea thats how i felt and i said it.  So all i want is to get an answer on where i can mail out a postcard, no harm no foul no bad intent.\n\nOther than that...this airport is a little dull, I have to admit that there are some very nice people but I just felt overall, this airport is a bit racist...
