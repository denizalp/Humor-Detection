Absolutely fabulous service, food ambiance and music. My husband and I had a wonderful brunch yesterday and will definitely be back to experience their dinner menu. We're Old Town Scottsdale locals and are always looking for restaurants that tick all the boxes for us. We also met and was served by Carlos, one of the owners, he was so pleasant and did not rush us in the least. Can't wait to go back!!!!
