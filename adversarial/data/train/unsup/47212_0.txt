Came back here today for lunch. We ordered ginger beef, beef fried rice and wonton soup.\n\nBig portion, good taste and friendly service. The server catered to our request to put Chinese broccoli instead of green onion in the ginger beef dish.\n\nOnly wish they turned up the heat as the restaurant felt like an ice box today. Other than that, no complaints. Still a good place to get Hakka food.
