Very positive experience with this place :)\n\nMy mom and I tried the Manager's special for $20\/40 mins and were quite pleased with the service. We were both in the same private room together. \n\nPlace is clean and people were friendly. \n\nBest part.. They don't hassle you or have signs posting tip expectations!\n\nWe will both definitely return :)
