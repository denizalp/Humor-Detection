I'll be the first to admit that I'm not a huge donut fan, but I've popped by Carl's a few times to try them. Oddly, their non-donut options seem to be their best products. The pistachio morning roll and strawberry tart were both extremely well made and well prortioned (though price\/value is debatable at ~$5\/ea), and had coworkers requesting more. I somehow seem to keep missing the Brookie.\n\nBut their donuts are solidly of the classic variety and hit or miss. The classic pink-sprinkle donut had a strange fruity flavor to it that was both unexpected and off putting. The \"fan favorite\" fritters were dense with minimal fruit and an overwhelming artificial flavor. In a boxed dozen, nothing really stood out.\n\nLocation is clean and cute, and well-placed by a large park and popular coffee shop, if you don't mind breaking your morning into multiple stops. Beverages are available here but priced high- Stumptown is an exclusive roast and a small cold brew will set you back over $5 with similar hot chocolate and juice prices.
