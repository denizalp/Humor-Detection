I  only have eaten here once,but was impressed.the pizza was excellent and the side salad that you can add on is one of the best ive ever had.also,being italian and from the east coast i have had some of the best italian food in the country, and i think la piazza al forno ranks right up there.(especially since arizona has the worst italian food\/pizza in the country.(inmy opinion,and many others too.)\nthe lasagne was out of this world.it reminded me of what mom used to make.Excellent marinara sauce as well.\nthe service was average.nothing special.\nBeing a server mysel,f i like that they won\"t split checks or seat groups until they have all arrived.Hello........it's a small restaraunt.they can't \"hold a table for your party and miss out on business just to wait for a group that may or may not show.\nalso sometimes splitting checks is a nightmare if the people are old, and keep switching seats,ordering in intervals,and changing thier drinks everytime they order a new one.its very time consuming to split checks when the guests do things like that.also, with the limited space they have ,i think it's a good business decision.\nusually people who are so concerned about splitting checks are cheap,don't tip well,use coupons,and order the cheapest thing on the menu and drink only water anyway.\nif people are that concerned,they should bring cash and do the simple first grade math to figure out what they owe.\nanyway i highly reccomend this place.
