The following pretty much sums up my experience at Zoe's:\n\nMe: \"Hi, I'd like the turkey pita please\"\n\nZoe(or sum other dumb bitch): \"So you'd like the feta with feta?, would you like something to drink, or maybe a side of feta?\"\n\nOne word..... Sick! (and I actually like feta... well, used to)\nI will not be back.\n\nOh, and some extremely old dood hit on me while I was waiting for my lunch. Now, while I don't exactly blame that on Miss Zoe, I am convinced that he wouldn't have been there if it weren't for all that feta.\n\nHow is there more than one of these shitholes in the valley?? Someone please explain. blech!\n2 stars because my Sun Chips hadn't been tampered with... at least to my knowledge.
