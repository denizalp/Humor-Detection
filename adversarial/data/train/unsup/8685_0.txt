Most critical fact: they have fernet branca. Se sirve fernet branca! Aguante Argentina!\n\nReview is tricky because depending on your checklist for a bar it's either three stars or five, thus the 4 star rating. More on that in the next paragraph but here's the second most critical fact: beer is ridiculously cheap and food portions are ridiculously large. Oh and third most critical point: the friendliest bartenders I've ever met work here, \n\nOk now the real review. You will give this place five stars if any of the following describes you:\n*you are a hipster\n*you enjoy motorcycles\n*you enjoy small bands live\n*you enjoy a good deal, regardless of atmosphere\n*portions matter more than the product served\n*you are looking for fernet (caution, the mix is strong)\n*service matters to you\n\nNow who would give it three stars?\n*People looking for the hip bar, this place is not very crowded\n*People looking for trendy or original mixed drinks\n*People looking for smaller portions with less grease\n*People looking for great food (it's good for a bar, but besides the portions, unremarkable)\n\nAll in all I had a solid experience and I will be back. A great place to start your evening. Maybe that would have just been the best way to write this review.
