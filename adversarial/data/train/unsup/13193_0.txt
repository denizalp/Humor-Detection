Skip this guy. My neighbors were getting their houses sprayed for their problems with ants & black widow spiders, & I didn't want them deciding to migrate my way after being kicked out of their current habitat. So I thought I'd have him spray our house too, just to be safe. Mind you, I did not have an issue with bugs. I was just making an attempt to prevent migration from the neighbors. I've lived in my house for over a year & not had a problem. I forked over the $31 (plus tip) anyway. He sprayed both in and outside. He said he set a couple of ant traps & was on his way. \nA couple of days later, I found a dozen or so ants in my kitchen pantry, and about 30 in my upstairs bathroom! -Neither location had EVER had ants or any other bug before in my time here. So I called him to explain the issue. He said he'd come back out, but not until late the next day. \nThe next day he came & 'set some traps' & left. \nA week later, I found HUNDREDS of ants in a brand new bag ($30) kitten food, & was furious! I had my (poor) husband call him this time. Again, he said he'd come at 1:30 the next day. I had to leave work to let him in for the third time, but I really needed the ants out of the pantry. I arrived home at 1:17, to find a note shoved through my front door that said he was \"sorry we cannot service your property, because nobody was home\". It was supposedly written at 1:15. \nFirst off, if it had really been written at 1:15, I would have seen him leaving through the gate as I entered. Secondly, the appointment HE set was for 1:30! So I gave up. I sprayed the pantry & haven't had any problems for nearly 2 weeks now.
