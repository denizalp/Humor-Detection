Tucked off Tenaya in Summerlin, this Pole Position doesn't get the love that the Flamingo\/Arville location does.  This place is dead and according to the staff, it's always dead here. But that is what makes this Pole Position, 5 stars in my book.  Once you try Pole Position, all other go-kart places just doesn't compare.  Pole Position is well organized, clean, fully AC'd, and has some of the fastest go-karts around.  Price is a bit steep at over $20 per head, but at least in this location, you get a local's discount.  I recommend Pole Position if you're in that need for speed, entertaining guest\/teens, or just looking to do something different in Las Vegas.
