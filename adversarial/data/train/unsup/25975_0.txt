I had my 40 year old diamond and yellow gold wedding ring cleaned and re-set.  I can't tell you how impressed I was with the work that Rod did!  The ring looks awesome!  I had had it cleaned\/re-set a number of times and it never looked this good or stayed looking this good for so long (it's been 4 months). I don't know what he did, but I can't say enough about how pleased I am. The diamond is absolutely dazzling!  I would highly recommend Farrar Jewelers for any repairs, cleaning, re-setting, etc.  I never dreamed my ring would look so great!
