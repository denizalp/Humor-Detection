Today was my first time at this nail shop. It was super busy as expected. The location is super clean and decor is very nice as well. The front desk associates are strictly there to attend to customers which IS EXTREMELY REFRESHING! They offer beverages and constantly ask if everything is ok which is great!! My full set was done decently. Once I hit home I saw the edges were well painted but no biggie. My pedicure was MAGICAL. Best pedicure I've had in years. \nOverall good experience
