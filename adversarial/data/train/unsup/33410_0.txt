Being such a foodie and recently moving to Stouffville, I had to find a local butcher that can meat all our BBQ needs.  Har har.\n\nClean, welcoming butcher on Main St, we were greeted instantly entering the store.  With two large fridges full of gorgeous looking meats, I wanted to try everything.  Most if not all of their fresh meat products are free range and\/or grass-fed\/grain-fed.\n\nWe decided to pick up a thick cut (1 inch) AAA NY Striploin that's been aged for 28 days.  We popped it on the grill 4-5 minutes per side, slightly seasoned with salt & pepper, it was a perfect Medium Rare.  Melt in your mouth goodness.  With such a lean cut compared to Prime Rib\/TBone, it was tender and full of flavour--no chewiness at all.  Grass fed beef makes such a big difference!\n\nOn special, we also picked up a few Free Range Chicken Leg Quarters.  Looking at the raw skin and comparing it to grocery store bought chicken, you can already see a difference--thicker yellowy skin and darker pink meat.  Taste, a lot \"meatier\" than usual chicken, with great texture.\n\nYou can also order special products like Turkeys\/Bison\/Buffalo, etc. during certain time of the year.\n\nGreat first visit to The Meat Merchant and I know I'll be calling them my local butcher from now on.
