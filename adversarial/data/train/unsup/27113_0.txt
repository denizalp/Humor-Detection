Most of this review can be attributed to the pasteries.  The cheesecake is to die for!  As for the pastrami, I would say its just average.  Everytime I have ordered a bagel, it has been rock hard.  Coffee is nice and strong.  What really brings down the rating is the service.  The waiters just dont seem to care.  We have been seated at tables much too small for our party several times.  Any special orders or add ons never come with the meal, we always have to remind the server.  Avoid Sundays unless you want to wait for at least an hour.
