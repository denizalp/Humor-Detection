We booked this place through the United site since it gave us a good price, but the site neglected to mention the $75 non refundable pet fee!  So when we pulled in after a 10 hour drive I was a little irritated and mentioned it to the woman who checked us in.  \n\nI said that the fee should be mentioned in the fine print and that I had compared 3 other locations and she rebuts my comment with:\n \nHer: well, people usually call to inquire about the pet policy\n\nMe: In this day and age of internet, you expect every client to call when your site says your facility is PET FRIENDLY?\n\nHer: Well, it's a cleaning fee, every resort is going to impose a fee.\n\nMe: I'm not saying there shouldn't be a fee, but I AM saying that it should be disclosed b\/c someone could really cause a ruckus if they wanted to\n\nHer: Well, if people don't like it, then they don't have to check in.  \n\nI look her straight in the eye and say slowly: Oh really?  \n\nB\/c I'm thinking hotels need guests so that people work right?  \n\nBy this time she realizes that she said something brilliantly STUPID.  and I say, Look, we've both had long days and I don't really care to discuss this any longer, so why don't you just check me in. \n\nShe then tells me where the room is located and that its a double. \n\nI then say, I reserved a KING.  \n\nHer: You can indicate your preference... \n\nI sigh and roll my eyes b\/c I'm so tired of her shit at this point and the she says, But wait, let me check, maybe there is one available.  \n\nShe upgrades us to a \"suite\" but nonetheless, the rooms are dated \nand could use a real face lift.  \n\nThe resort itself has a cute exterior, looks like little adobes, but the interior could use some serious updates, the carpet is old and the TVs are also dated, i will say the beds are quite comfy though... although, it could also be the 10 hour drive...  \n\nso anyway, I would have given it 1 star for that stellar service, but since she tried to fix it with an upgrade, I'll adjust it to two.
