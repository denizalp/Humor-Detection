Went here for dinner on Friday night as this new spot is right down the street from our house. There's something missing from the overall vibe of this place.. I can't quite put my finger on it but here's some pros and cons-\n\nPros-\nService- you can tell they are trying reallllly hard to impress customers and deliver a good experience \nPatio\/ bar area- great place to sit and have a bottle of wine and app, can see this place getting busy during the spring for patio season.\n\nCons-\nWay over priced- I have a hard time paying 20 bucks for a pizza that's just \"ok\" when I can drive over to LGO and get one cheaper that's way better.\nFood- nothing on the menu we ate was stellar or even worth going back for. Very bland and just overall not good.
