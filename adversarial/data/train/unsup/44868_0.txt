I love this place.\nIt was fun, it was fast, and it was tasty.\nDelicious for both kids and adults and they ask you if you want a glass of milk with you cookies!  How cute is that?  \n\nMy oatmeal, dark chocolate walnut cookie was awesome.  My friend wanted to go back for a second cookie after we left the store.\n\nI would drive back out to Bloor West Village in a second for some Sweet Flour Bake Shop Cookies
