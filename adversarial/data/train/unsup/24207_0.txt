Ok, Slade, here it is...\n\nMaybe the fact that the place is 39.5 miles from my house in Chandler, and yet I have the address memorized tells you something. Slade loved yelpers. The first time I went a few friends and the hubski ordered pastries- maybe $25 worth. Slade came back to the shop, saw a yelper having a tasty good time with his scrumptious confections and sent out a plate- probably doubling our previous bounty.\n\nHighlights? Red velvet cupcake, chocolate muffin (\"sugar is not a flavor\"), the cheesecake was outstanding, the brownies were chewy and decadent.\n\nI have since been back with various out- of- town visitors- any chance  get. When hubski and I went with his parents, Slade was working hard on a new delightful delicacy- the new tequila lime tart. Lame- you might say. The tequila would cook off you might say. Slade has the enviable talent of making a liquor baked good that still hits you. More like a slow burn down the back of your throat following the tangy sweet flavor sensation of the lime. \n\nIt was a sensual experience.\n\nBack to the red velvets... I am a fan of red velvet in general, but its easy to make the cake dry and the icing too sweet. Slade has it nailed. There is just something about eating a cupcake that makes you feel warm and fuzzy- a sense of accomplishment. Slade helps this along with a mini red v. option.\n\nHighly recommended.\n\nSlade should also be patted on the back for his plan to go kosher- the recipes won't change, don't worry. The product will be available to more people in the Phoenix area.
