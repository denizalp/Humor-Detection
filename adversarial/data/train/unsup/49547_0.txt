Even one star is too high a rating for this group.\n\nTo make a long story short--they installed a new thermostat in my house on Friday.  After Jason left, I noted that it was not working properly.  I called and spoke to Tim.  They came back on Monday to fix the issue with the thermostat and left me with a thermostat that was not working at all.  MY DISABLED SON AND I WERE LEFT IN A HOME WITHOUT ANY HEAT.  They DID NOT ANSWER PHONE CALLS OR VOICEMAILS LEFT NOR DID THEY RESPOND TO MY TEXT MESSAGE.  \n\nThe temperature went down to 24 degrees the last couple of nights and we had no heat until I got someone to install a new working thermostat today.  \n\nIn spite of everything, they had the nerve to put a charge of $261.00 through on my credit card.\n\nWell, Tim, I am looking for a full refund.  A coupon for a free furnace checkup is not going to remedy this situation.  You have a 100% Satisfaction Guarantee on your invoice--now is the time to honor it.
