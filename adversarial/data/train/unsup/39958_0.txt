This place is awesome. Not just because of the cartoon ice cream drawings on the wall or because of the plushie Pusheen holding a little ice cream cone behind the counter but because of its amazing assortment of unique flavors. \n\nWe got there late at night and all crowded around the display of ice cream options available. The staff there was super nice about all our questions and generous with samples. I think we all tried about 3 or 4 flavors each before deciding on what to get. We decided to go for three scoops in a cup: hojicha (roasted green tea), earl grey and black sesame, which was then topped with a piece of a waffle cone on top so it looks like an upside down ice cream cone. \n\nThe black sesame almost tasted like peanut butter, very rich compared to the earl grey and hojicha which were a lot lighter. The flavors worked really well together and it was a nice late night treat. \n\nThey also have vegan options as well. If I'm ever in the area again I'm definitely going to stop by for another scoop...maybe the raspberry.
