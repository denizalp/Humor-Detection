This salon is nice, and the people there are nice. And I'm sure they are good at cuts and color... But whoa, NEVER go there for a perm!!! I've been getting them for 10 years and this was my first experience at this salon. Wow, let's just say, she basically permed the few inches from my roots, but somehow like chemically straightened the last 6-8 inches. It looks AWFUL!! It was hard to notice it when she first did it, bc your hair always looks a little strange after its first permed... But once I soaked it and realized... I was HORRIFIED!  What a waste of time and money. Now I have to go somewhere else and get another one- and pray my hair doesn't all fall out due to all those chemicals. I work in the area and will be sure to warn everyone to just steer clear from that place. Major disappointment and very frustrating.
