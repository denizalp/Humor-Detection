I'm a lover of bolognese. Anytime I get Italian food, it's typically the same order: Caesar salad and bolognese pasta and bread. Wish this place had that. Maybe I just didn't see it. \n\nIt's my dudes birthday and his fave food is Italian. Being the good wife that I am I decided to bring Italy to him. \n\nThe dudes at the store today were extremely helpful. They told me about the deal where you can get fresh pasta, a container of sauce, a bag of salad, and bread, all for $20! That's what's up! And I dont even have to tip AND I'll have leftovers! That's what's up! \n\nI got the rosemary pasta, pomodoro sauce with meatballs, herb foccacio bread, and decided to get a bottle of red wine. \n\nThe food was AWESOME SAUCE! Literally. The sauce was seasoned well and the meatballs were tender. The pasta itself was so fresh and tasty. \n\nI'd definitely go back. Maybe for some hot food next time.
