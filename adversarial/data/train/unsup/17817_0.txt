I WILL NEVER STEP FOOT INSIDE THIS JOINT AGAIN! We made advanced reservations for 8. When we arrived we were told they overbooked and we'd have to wait. The receptionist was very unprofessional and rude, telling us tables weren't available when we could clearly see empty tables from the waiting room. She even said that we could leave if we didn't want to wait. After she was told by my wife, son and daughter who made 3 separate status requests, we left. Maybe our money wasn't green enough, OR IS IT THEY DONT SERVE BLACK PEOPLE! Somebody needs to tell them the year is 2013...not the 1950's
