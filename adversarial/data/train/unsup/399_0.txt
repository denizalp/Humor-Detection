Great Wash\n\nI was planning on selling my car however,  I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a detail, so I decided to get the Ultra Wash and I'm sure glad that I did. \n\nMy nephew and his friends  had been riding in my car and there were spilled cherry icees, french fry grease stains and numerous other stains that I thought would never come out. The folks at Superstar took such great care and attention to detail. When I got my car back, it was beautiful and looked just like it did when I first bought my car. \n\nI was extremely pleased and surprised. It was obvious Superstar takes pride in their work. Even the dealership mentioned how great my car looked when I went to trade it in.  I'm definitely coming back to Superstar with my new vehicle.
