This place is more of a sushi fusion place than what you would consider a sushi bar. I did not see anyone Japanese making sushi here. I was very disappointed in the quality of the food. I came here after a show at the Q, around 7pm on a Saturday night. It's a small place with a handful of tables, so I was glad they were not busy when my date and I got there. Several people came in while we were there, but it definitely wasn't the hot spot and I can see (taste) why.  First of all, we were served a spicy tuna roll that was inedible. It was bad, as in spoiled. I took a bite and had to spit it out. It was part of the spicy sushi box so we just ate the other two rolls and left the tuna behind. \nWe also shared three other rolls. The sushi 86 roll, very unremarkable and not presented very well. The spicy scallop, it was decent. And the Philli roll which was pretty good, but, it was smoked salmon and not raw sushi. I came to the conclusion that this place is okay for cooked sushi but definitely not for raw sushi.  Another disappointment was the ginger house salad! We each ordered one, and it was just mixed greens with soy sauce on it! I was expecting the delicious creamy ginger dressing that is typical of most sushi places. I guess I should have read the menu more carefully as it did say \"soy ginger\" but still, soy on lettuce just didn't go together. \nOur waiter was really nice. The service was very slow, but it wasn't his fault and he apologized when we were paying. Oh, another thing to note is that you pay up front by the door.
