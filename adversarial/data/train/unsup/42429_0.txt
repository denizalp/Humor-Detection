Dr. Roach, his team, and his practice are all exceptional!!! From the minute you walk in, you know you're in the best hands. Not only are the vet and his team incredibly warm and friendly and the fees super reasonable - and the services provided white glove in their delivery and care - but West Russell is also the best place to board an animal. \n\nRegarding boarding - the dog runs are clean, big and welcoming! (They have several options re: size and with or without watch-at-home cameras.) Our Whippet has stayed here several times for long weekends and she always seems happy and rested when we pick her up. Plus, her tail wags as she runs in to the place every time we come to drop her off. Stop by, take a tour, meet the team - you'll know this is the best vet practice possible!
