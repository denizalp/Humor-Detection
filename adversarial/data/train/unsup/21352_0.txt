Dinner w\/ Angela H is always a blast, but the Q just will get a \"meh\" out of me. \n\nGranted, I didn't get the namesake ribs, but the pulled pork sammy was just okay. It was soft enough, but it came with sweet sauce already on it and I wasn't getting too much of a smoke taste. The sammy comes with a choice of side ($8.99) and I got fried okra which was pretty good and crispy. Sweet tea was just the right amount of sweet. \n\nI didn't notice that my dinnermate was charged wrong and that isn't cool specially since at ordering she cleared up that she wanted the links \"sandwich\" with one side and not the \"combo\" with two sides when the waitress asked her for two side choices. \n\nI'm open to trying the ribs and more okra since the BF and I have a restaurant. com certificate, but for pulled pork this isn't my spot.
