Ok, so what do you do if you have girls in a group and they like to shop for Prado and LV and random lipsticks that have 1 color only, yet takes 45 minutes to get that lipstick....well you get a brew here at the Palm Restaurant in the The Forum Shops in Caesars Palace. (just kidding ladies)\n\nYah, definitely it kills the time to have a nice cold Sam Adams or any other choice for that matter. Great ambiance too. It's a dark bar here, no purses, or shoes or lipsticks on sale here. Just food and drink.\n\nIt's a little pricey, about $9 a pint, but hey, I would rather pay the $9 pint so I can sit down and not think...really...not think for a bit. I mean there might be random distractions in the restaurant but nothing to swerve you from your non-thinking.\n\nI also like the random caricatures on the walls. Not sure what it means, maybe if you eat here long enough, you do get a caricature of yourself there as well. Who knows, but it did provide me the entertainment during my non-thinking moments.
