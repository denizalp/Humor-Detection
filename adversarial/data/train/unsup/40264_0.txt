This location is nice compared to some other ones within the Milestones franchise.\nIt's always empty, which is good if you like a quite place, but it's also nice to se some crowd some times.\nFood quality is in line with other locations, but the service is a hit and miss here.\nI've been here few times and service is sometimes over the top, and very disappointing on other visits.\n\nThe bar area is pretty cool, with butcher slab tables with high stools, big screen TVs, new shiny beer tabs..\n\nMy most favourite dish in there (or was at least as I think it just got discontinued) is the Harrisa chicken, where you got grilled chicken with moroccan couscous and Harrisa sauce, pretty good!\nAnother favourite appetizer is the asian chicken bites.\n\nAll in all, a decent restaurant, good food, okay service.
