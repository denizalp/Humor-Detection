I think I found my new favorite place. The food is reasonably priced and good! I love the casual atmosphere and the ice cream is really yummy! The people there are very friendly and helpful, they offered me free taste samples of the ice cream while I waited for my food. \n\nI can't wait to make this place my regular go to place.
