My first time staying at the Bellagio and now my last.\n\nTook over 10 minutes to get the attention of a bell hop and over 30 minutes to get bags from the bell hop up to our room...would never happen at the Venetian.\n\nIce machine broke after not even filling one bucket with ice...would never happen at the Venetian.\n\nThey wanted to charge us $20\/day to have a refrigerator placed into our $1000\/night suite...would never happen at the Venetian.\n\nThey wanted to charge us $2.50 for every shot glass extra over 6 for our $1000\/night suite...would never happen at the Venetian.\n\nThey would only let us take 2 waters at a time out of the VIP lounge (which is tap water bottled in Ontario, California)...would never happen at the Venetian.\n\nThey refused to give us late checkout on a Sunday...would never happen at the Venetian.\n\nMacCellan 18 is considered a comp...would never happen at the Venetian.\n\nNever again!  Bellagio can keep relying on its fame to keep tourists coming, but I've had much better experiences at Venetian and even Wynn.  Service was poor for such a highly rated establishment.  I shared my preference for Venetian with one of the staff workers as I was leaving and she agreed with me that Venetian was awesome!  High rollers will enjoy Wynn better and younger crowd will enjoy Venetian better.  And to cap it off, I never, ever win when I'm at Bellagio :(\n\nBut 1 star for the steam shower.  I haven't seen that at Venetian or Wynn.  Very nice.
