This review is about the customer service I watched while waiting for our food. Which took almost 30 minutes for nachos, a po boy and a kids burger. Now our server Jade, seemed like she didn't really want to be here to work, which i completely understand. But we watched 2 tables walk out on her shift. There were no, sorry I'm running behind, etc etc. just completely ignored them and just shrugged her shoulders after they both went to the hostess to complain. Being in the customer service industry, I know we work for our tips. I guess she could care less.
