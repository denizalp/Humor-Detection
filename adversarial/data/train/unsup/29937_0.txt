On my last day of Vegas I decided to give the store a try after getting recommendations. Great vintage and stylish clothing, and they have clothing from tons of different brand. \n\nGreat customer service. Mason, the cashier there, was super friendly and reccomended places for me to go in Las Vegas. \n\nWhat I got: an Adidas and Nike shirt, purple camoflauge longsleeve, camo jeans, and a pair of yeezy season 3 joggers for my mom lol\n\nKinda small but super cool store thats definitly worth checking out if your in the area.
