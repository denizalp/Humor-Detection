We ate here on a recent bachelorette trip to Vegas. The reason we picked Tao was because it was so hyped and all the celebs went there. It totally and completely sucked! \nFirst thing is that we made reservations for 9:15pm and had to wait 45 minutes after our reserved time to be seated!!! That was absolutely ridiculous, to be so hungry and have to wait like that. horrible. Finally we ordered an appezitzer of ahi tuna, which we did not even get until we were seated at the table. \n\nOur tuna appetizer ended up being the best thing I ate all night. It was very good. I got the pad thai as my entree which was $30 and nothing special. You can get better pad thai in Atlanta. The martinis which were $14 were not very good or very creative they just have fancy names and taste like alcohol mixed with fruit juice. We refused to get dessert. I tried some of my friend's orange chicken and the chicken was good but the bok choy that came on the side was the worst I have ever had, and I love bok choy. I tried some other food from my other friends and it was all so blah that I can't even remember what they got. Another thing is the music downstairs is so loud you hae to shout to your fried across the table to be heard. \n\nNext we went upstairs to the club I refused to buy a drink, and givethat place any more of my money. The dance floors were too crowded, and the girls in the bathtubs, and well as in the glass looked miserable and faking it. Needless to say we left the horrible place within 30 min, and went to Tryst in the Wynn which was awesome! \n\nOn another note, Tao is the worst place in Vegas I went to and I will never go there again. Kim Kardashian is an idiot for promoting it, though I can see why she goes there because it's pretty much the only club in Vegas where all the black guys go to party.
