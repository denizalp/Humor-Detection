Stopped by Barrio for lunch with the wife. Prior to our visit, I had only tasted Barrio tacos out of their food truck. Since I love tacos, this place was high on my 'to try' list. We were promptly seated and our tattooed waitress took our drink orders. We shared a pitcher of sangria, which we both loved, and some chips and salsa.\n\nFirst, I ordered a build-your-own chicken taco on a Green Goddess tortilla. I topped it with tomatoes, onions, cilantro, and salsa verde.  Then I ordered two additional tacos from the menu, the El Jefe and the El Puerco. A little while later, the tacos were delivered. They were larger than I expected and I knew I probably would have a hard time finishing all three, plus chips and salsa.\n\nI ate my custom built taco first and it wasn't very good. Actually, it was cold and bad. It was very watery from the veggies and it was gushing onto my other tacos. The cold salsa verde was my least favorite topping. It really lacked flavor and had weird texture. I was really disappointed with my taco. However, the other two were actually very tasty. So if you don't know the flavors, go with a taco from the menu!\n\nI would give these tacos props for being big, filling, and of great quality, but they're definitely not the best tasting tacos I've eaten. I want to stop back and try some more just to be sure though.\n\nService was very good and the atmosphere was very nice in an old house. Can't wait to go back!
