Frequent 407 user.  First-time 407 reviewer.\n\n407 Express Toll Route extends from Milton(West) through Durham(East).\n\nI fall under the Light Vehicle, Mon-Fri before & after work usage category.\nTransponder($3.00\/mth) equipped of course. Not insane to pay the added rate.\nI did go without a transponder before as a seldom user but $3.00+ extra! per trip, meh.\n\nAs Regular Commuter, I'm one of the fortunate ones that haven't encountered\nBilling Issues.  At least not since awhile back but still make sure you keep a careful\nglance over your statement.  We already pay for usage, we shouldn't be paying\nTIPS on top.\n\nConvenience is a big selling point especially for people frustrated with Hwy 401.\nMy entrance\/exit points on the Hwy 401 is poorly designed and accident-prone.\nWhile Hwy 401 has both predictable\/unpredictable rush traffic, 407 is usually good.\n\nAnother advantage is the 140km\/h+ speeds.  Enough said!\nVery rarely can you go those speeds within the GTA boundaries. Outside the\nMidnight drives on the Express Lanes of course.  The reason behind the \nallowance of the speed is due to Low Traffic, 5+ Lanes and Smooth Roads.\n\nOn the rare occasion there will be accidents, but Traffic still moves consistenly.\nLike this one time...  A Pickup Truck towed a Yacht 5x it's size, maybe more.\nObviously the back gave way and the Yacht tilted blocking four Lanes.\nThat still gives one wide Lane to pass. It was quite orderly and pleasant.\n\nMy theory is that 407 Drivers has less Stressful drivers therefore more Satisfaction.\nIt's nice to drive beside Happy, Relaxed, Calm people, great for me bad for others.\n\nI know there's controversy and it has impacted the citizen such as myself.\nIn a positive way in terms of getting more value back from miscellaneous issues.\nThey issued an ETR Rewards Program awhile back and although not amazing in\nitself, it does save you some Gas cost along with some free usages depending\non your previous Monthly Usage.  Let's just say it's better than nothing.
