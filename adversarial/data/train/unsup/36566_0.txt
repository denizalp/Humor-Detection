No stars for this company.  I've had a contract with these people for 8 YEARS since I purchased my home and they came with the sale.  In the past 8 years their service was good, never any problems. I had service at my house at the end of November.  I had my monthly payment scheduled for the 26th of each month.  When I didn't see it deducted for 26 December I called the office.  In the past when my contact was to be renewed I would receive a new contact and promptly would renew the contract.  When I called on the 29 of December I spoke to an agent who had to have been the rudest individual that I've spoken too.  She informed me that my contract was cancelled and that it COULD NOT BE RENEWED without me sending in a letter.  I asked why it could not be renewed and was told that she could not \/ would not give me this information.  She then suggested that I find another CONTRACTOR for my home.  I was speechless, what kind of business treats a customer who's been with them for 8 YEARS?  I fumed about this because here I thought that my house was under a warranty for the month of December and only to find out that it was not.  I called back and spoke to Rachel and she told me everything the first idiot told me, also suggested I find another contractor.  I sent a letter to them telling them my feelings and also telling them that in the past 8 years I've read plenty of bad reviews but since I never was treated bad I disregarded. In my letter I explained how I would be more than happy to find another contractor and would now put in a bad review.  I did a lot of research and found another company who was rated in Las Vegas as one of the top 10 company's and set up a new contract.  Best part same service a lot cheaper per year and a lot cheaper per visit.  I would highly recommend that NO ONE use this company.  With an office staff like that they deserve to be put out of business.
