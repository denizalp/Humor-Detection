I moved to Tempe in July for school and instantly fell in love with the West 6th apartments. Beautiful apartments, lots of room, I LOVE the facilities that come with it (gym, pool, Jacuzzi, bbqs, printer\/scanner\/study room, game room ect.) The management is friendly and they try very hard to make your experience living here as home-y as possible. After reading the other reviews I have to be honest and say yes, the elevators are a bit shotty at times but I never had an issue getting to my floor or too long of a wait; but other than that I have not experienced anything horrendous or even bad (*knocks on wood*)\n\nThe location is perfect! Lots of restaurants, bars and life around. Right next to the most comfortable movie theater I've been to on the west coast. Also, if you're an introvert (like myself) who doesn't really enjoy too much public \/ group activity I would highly recommend this building for you for this reason.. the balcony and its magnificent view of the sunset. \n\nOverall; I would say I am very happy living here.
