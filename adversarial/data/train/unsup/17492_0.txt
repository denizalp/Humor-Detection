My brother just joined LA Fitness and as a part of a first time membership he was given a 3 day complimentary pass to give out to friends or relatives. To make a long story short I called to inquire about using the 3 day complimentary pass and was shocked at how the front desk person (Jill) handled the situation. Jill said the pass was only for guest who's interested in signing up for a membership. Well I'm just visiting  for the holiday and a membership didn't make sense to me so I asked what exactly complimentary meant and she had no legit answers to give me , hhmm. Jill  then proceeded to tell me that I needed an in state I.D upon arrival in order to workout. I offered to bring my passport and military I.D and Jill denied both identification.. This place has the worst customer service skills, after fighting for 9 months in Afghanistan I'm being denied to workout with a legit complimentary pass. Thank God for places like 24 HOUR Fitness. I'm not sure if it's just a Scottsdale thing but this is the worst treatment I've ever gotten from a gym staff.. LA Fitness doesn't even have a steam room and yet they act like the place is made of gold. And to the trainer (Travis Stone) who gave us the pass , please be more accurate and detailed whenever you hand out guest passes.. Let people know of the hassle they may encounter when dealing with guest passes.. This place is definitely not the place to workout.. 24 HOUR FITNESS is definitely a class on it's own..
