It's not very often you can find a place to  do laundry that you can bear to hang out in, but I finally have! Not only is this business absolutely affordable, it's so clean! They're full service too, which is cool. Free WiFi is awesome, nice vending machines, and their AC actually works! I did feel safe in here at night, which us also tough to find here on the east side. I'm sold. This is my new laundry spot!
