Healthy or Happy. \nI have had both sides of the menu and happy to me is always better. :) The first time I came here I was trying to eat healthy and order sweet potato fries and eggs. They just weren't very filling or tasty. I came again to try a bowl. I got the smoke in a bowl. It comes chicken, peppers, pineapple, rice, and beans. It was OK. It wasn't very flavorful and just didn't fill me. I really love the black cheery soda they have tho. So tasty! Also they have lemon and cucumber water for guest. The last time I came with some friends and ordered from the Happy side. I did get a salad, but I got the Hot Chix. OMG, bleu cheese party in my mouth. It comes with buffalo chicken, avocado, pico, fried jalapeno strips, bleu cheese and buffalo ranch. It was so good! So much great flavor and it was so filling! My friend got the spicy cauliflower and said it was so hott. She also got some kind of chicken sammich and said it was very plain and also not filling. Honestly, I need to stick to the Happy side because it makes me happy! I always see they special on Facebook and I think i need to try their cookies and sundaes. They look amazing!!! Until the next time SkinnyFATS!
