My parents contacted me telling me about this bargain airline known as Allegiant.  So, I went on-line and sure enough, their prices were less than half the cost of other airlines for the same route.  So, I bought my dad a ticket.  \n\nHowever, at checkout I got the real surprise.  The extra fees were 200% of the advertised cost!  Unbelievable!   \n\nSo, there were \"Segment Fees\", \"911 Fees\", \"Seat Selection Fees\" (which didn't give you the option of not paying this fee; i.e. very much a hidden fee), a \"Convenience Fee\" (no idea what this was), and some others.  The only reason I bought the ticket is that the flight went directly to where my father needed to go.  If that was not the case, I wouldn't have even considered the flight.\n\nBottom line, I will NEVER use this airline again regardless of the advertised prices.  There is no telling about what the end cost will be.  I get some taxes and fees, but 200%!!!!??  Give me a break.  Great job, Allegiant.  Rest assured, you will be another memory in the lineup of failed airlines with business behavior like this.
