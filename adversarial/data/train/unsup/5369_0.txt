A little disappointed with GameWorks. Granted I haven't had any alcohol or food there yet, so they might still be able to earn a star, but.. \n\nIt was pretty big for where it was located. There is a bar, restaurant, bowling lanes, a computer game room, and a tiny, tiny counter in front of the prize area. Not to mention a pretty large area of general games. \n\nOpening was fun. They had a little deal going on for $12 that was pretty sweet. \nNow, I know that a lot of little kiddies come to TS to play and such, but the kind of games that were there...it was a little disappointing. I expected way better games and a better variety. Of course, some games were closed because they weren't giving out prizes or tickets at opening, but that was to be expected given the foot traffic they got. Though, I thought they would at least have a small raffle or something~! \n\nSome of the best things that were there were the shooting games, racing games, the virtual reality roller coaster pod, and the 4D Haunted House game!
