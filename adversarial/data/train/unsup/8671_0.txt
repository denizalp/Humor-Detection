Went today for lunch on the my friend and I's Burger Tour of Phoenix.  I actually regret it.  The food was not great.  I got the Q Burger which comes with green chili and swiss.  I thought it sounded good but NOPE.  The green chili was really dry and unflavorful.  The onions overpowered the green chili which was a major problem.  The fries tasted like they were frozen in a bag then fried.  \n\nFor just drinks maybe you can go here on a budget and I guess have fun but I would say you would have to be a redneck to do that.  They have dead animals all over and on tv there was tractor pulls on.
