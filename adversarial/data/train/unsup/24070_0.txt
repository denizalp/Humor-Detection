This place reminds me of the Irvine Spectrum.  I like it a lot.  Here's why:\n\n+ It's an outdoor mall.  I like walking around in the sun.  When it gets hot, there are tons of misters to keep you cool.\n\n+ Easy parking.  There's plenty of parking around the mall.\n\n+ Easy access to freeways.  The 101 & 202 freeways are very close.\n\n+ Great selection of stores, food court, and restaurants.\n\n+ The nightlife is pretty cool.  There are a few bars\/restaurants where people hang out and party.\n\nOverall, it's a fun place with a great vibe.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%
