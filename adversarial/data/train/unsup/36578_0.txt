Steve Richardson is fantastic!  I called him in the evening regarding repair of a rental property alarm system and an appointment was scheduled for the following day.  He called to indicate time of arrival, did indeed arrive on time, and assessed the issues swiftly.  Fairly priced, professional, and friendly...what more could I ask of anyone!
