Came here for my friends 26th birthday! It was a group of 7.\nAs soon as you get there they put you in the mood of the Medieval Times!\nWe were told to come early (615pm) but show started at 730pm. There were a tone of people who pre paid for their tickets online which I do recommend so you get seats together.\n\nAfter we got into the bar\/waiting area there was a mini show put on while we waited to go in. It was ok. They called out birthday parties and any special events happening. Everyone got HUGE beers and stood around.\nThere were TONES of souvenirs and stuff for u to buy while you waited to go into the arena. PRICEY! \n\nWe finally got in and the place wasn't as big as it looks on t.v ..\nWe were squished together on these  chairs and could barley move!\nThe server was VERY NICE!\nThe food- huge portions!!\nVery good show!\nVery fun!\nI would definitely go back!\nOnce the show begins you forget how squished you are because they really interact and  involve the crowd!
