Pal:  Hey, what do you want to drink?\nMe:  I dunno. Something yummy. The classic milk tea?\n\nAll of a sudden, the homie shows up with four drinks.  Four!  It was only the two of us!  \n\nWhile the drinks looked lovely with all their vibrant colors, I knew we were in for trouble when I saw the dinky little straws they gave us.  Those balls weren't going to pass through the straws.  So what happened?  I'm just chugging away, a boba gets stuck, I suck at my straw like my life depended on it, and the boba ball flies down the back of my throat before I could even register what happened.  Why were there no boba straws at a boba place?  Why!?  My friend had said those were the straws they had given him so maybe they just gave him the wrong straws because it would suck if they expected people to drink boba with skinny little straws.  At least the balls were firm and chewy... TWSS.  We ended up just drinking the milk tea from the drinks and throwing away the boba.  What a waste.  They also use the snap-on lids here instead of plastic seal tops so you can't shake the teas for that authentic bubble tea experience.\n\nWe got a wide assortment of drinks.  We had a watermelon fruit tea, taro milk tea, matcha milk tea, and a classic milk tea.  All the milk teas were pretty watery and the watermelon tea tasted like majority syrup.  The matcha was also very light in flavor.  Overall, I was on a sugar high majority of the night and I would say their drinks are a three-star for me.\n\nThey have egg waffles that I really want to go back and try though so here's my drink review for now.  I think this place has potential:  Use less sugar and\/or let the customer decide on the sugar level and get some legit boba straws.  \n\nPal:  Nice little place.\nMe:  Take some pics!\nPal:  No.  That's your job.\n\nI get no respect, I tell ya! :P
