Living in both Texas and Las Vegas, we were excited to see Los Cucos open in Las Vegas. We have eaten many times at the restaurants in Texas. While not the greatest Tex-Mex, it is certainly not the worst (at least in Texas). We decided to try the new location off Arroyo Crossing. The restaurant is nice and clean and the service is fast. My wife and I had a sampler plate which contained fairly typical Tex-Mex offerings. Overall, we were quite disappointed. It has little resemblance to the restaurants in the same chain in Texas. The enchilada was without any flavor whatsoever. The refried beans had an unusual texture and taste and were somewhat overdone. The rice was anything but Tex-Mex. The beef fajita meat was actually pretty good. The tortillas were fair. The price though was considerably higher than the same restaurant plates in Texas. While we were hoping for a true Tex-Mex restaurant in Las Vegas, this one missed the mark. The lack of flavor and seasoning were disappointing-- akin to a Mexican TV dinner. Unfortunately, we will not try Los Cucos in Las Vegas again and continue to hope some true Tex-Mex restaurant eventually opens in Las Vegas.
