I just moved to Vegas and looking to purchase a home.  I was assured that it will not be a problem even though I was told by the other brokerage firm that I need a full time position in Vegas for at least a month before I can qualify for a home when I checked into it last year.  They assured us that it was not a problem.  I didn't want another hard credit ding on my credit score.  I got a hard ding with no loan.
