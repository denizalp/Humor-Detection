EEEEHEEEHEHEHHNDHAHAHSJKASKD\n\nThe G*Nug is my new favorite spot in Downtown Vegas. At 50 bucks a night we could afford to stay two nights longer than we planned.\n\nThe pool was awesome, the video poker bars kept the drinks flowin', and our room was way more than 50 bucks could ever get you on the strip.\n\nOnly downside- for some reason the water in the ENTIRE FRIGGIN HOTEL smells like someone pulled out my colon, soaked it in sulfur, and hung in to dry on a humid Florida day.\n\nBring your own water and then party on!
