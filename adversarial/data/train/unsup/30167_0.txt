The decor and patio are so adorable! I ordered one of the specialty cocktails, which was delicious and reasonably priced. The food was beautiful but was sort of lacking. Brussels sprouts could have been crispier and the lobster rangoon had little to no filling. Overall, if I ordered one of the main entrees, I think I would have been much happier. I would still go back, especially to try brunch!
