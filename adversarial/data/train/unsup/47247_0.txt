Wine list was great, however I would say service was absent.  I figure the food would make up for the service considering other yelp reviews but again was disappointing.  Prices are a bit high for the quality of food, I felt the dishes are a bit amature.  Bruschetta seemed like it was made with toast and pana cotta was comparable to a store bought mix from a box.  If you are looking for old world Itallian food I suggest going else where.
