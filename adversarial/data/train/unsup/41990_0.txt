I was  in Chandler for an appointment and thought I'd take advantage of all the Asian restaurant options. \nAfter way to much deliberation I decided on Tott's.  It's close to a friends house and I'd been curious for s while. \n\nPretty darn good! I haven't found many great Chinese restaurants since moving to AZ back in 2000 but I enjoyed this. Orange chicken with noodles and egg drop soup. Both where big portions and flavorful. \n\nFood is made too order and very fast. Love the smell of the wok cooking! \n\nThanks for the ordering guidance
