Old, worn, and tired outlet mall. The only redeeming factor was that the majority was indoors. If you're looking to wander around, beat the heat, and specifically shop outlets, then this is your place. If, however, you shop best in a more updated space, then look elsewhere. \n\nThe customer service ranges from lacking in some stores to aggressive in others, but that can be found anywhere, I suppose. For instance, my friends and I were waiting at the Pandora kiosk with exactly what we wanted in view and the woman never acknowledged us and still was doing opening duties 30 minutes after it should have been opened. Needless to say, she lost an automatic sale. \n\nThere are staple outlet stores (Adidas, Gap, Banana Republic) and some premium like Kate Spade, Coach. The parking is ample. It's location is just south of the strip. If you need a quick supply of clothes or shoes, this will fit the bill.
