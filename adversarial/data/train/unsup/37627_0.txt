I liked the flexibility of the classes and how you could take them at your own pace.  Yes, the instructors are reading through notes, but they have to cover the info that's on the state and Federal exams, and this is how they are sure to cover everything, so this method works for me.  I paced the classes to get them done in 7 weeks, which was a good pace for me.  I spent 2 full days studying for the school exam and passed, spent another full day studying more for the State and Federal tests and passed.   Staff were all nice.
