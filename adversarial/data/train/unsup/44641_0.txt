I would skip this go to the State Fair instead your money would be much better spent.... a total waste of time and money.This event had huge lines to get in!! huge lines to get to tacos!!! no place to wash your hands!!! no place to sit down!!! and it was expensive and a $3.50 surcharge to order tickets online, and a minimum of $10 in tokens!!! not to mention most of the tacos were microscopic for the $2 tacos!!
