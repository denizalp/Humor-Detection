I really wanted to like this poke bowl place.  It has a good location and although the restaurant space and employees are nice the bowl was a miss for me.  Compared to other poke bowls I've had,  the scoops were comparably smaller (they're literally served from a small ice cream scoop), and they're wasn't enough salad in the large size.  It ended up being mostly rice.  For me, it just wasn't a good enough value...
