I feel like every time I come here my experience gets worse and worse with customer service. Last time I was here I was skipped over by the meat person until I stepped up and said actually I'm next. Today the same thing happened but I wasn't as blunt and was still skipped over. They need to figure out a line or a number system because when I have to wait 5-15 minutes for meat and people keep coming up to get meat while cutting other people. There has to be a better system. Also the last time I was here I was waiting to get checked out and the lines were long. It was finally my turn and this customer came to ask for help looking for something. So I ended up waiting an additional 10 minutes for them to help this lady...so my last few visits have been . \n\nTheir products haven't changed since the Amazon take over but their customer service stinks. I wish I had another one that was on the way home from work because I like my Mac and cheese, meat, macarons and fruits from Whole Foods
