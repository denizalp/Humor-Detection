Glad to report, this is still one of the best breakfast spots in Southend.\n\nThe pancakes are ENORMOUS you will only need one (trust me). The biscuits have true southern experience behind them --- topped with a bit of gravy... MUAH! So good, so traditional, and prices were very low compared to these self-pegged brunch spots around the area - so many other places overcompensate for these traditional southern recipes to look \"fancy\" just so they can sell you 4 $8 mimosas with your meal. This place have been doing breakfast here for since before I could remember (Charlotte native here). My wife, \"They know how to cook eggs here.\" Her grits were on point too (I tried them myself). \n\nMy wife and I came in here for breakfast. I hadn't been into this family restaurant in about 4 years back we moved to another side of town for a little while.... When I saw the inside was revamped I was nervous the food may have changed with it. Much to our surprise it was the same old delicious breakfast that I remember from 3+ years ago. \n\nIt looks good - more like a bar\/hangout spot than a breakfast joint \/ restaurant. It did not smell like a bar though -- which is important when searching for a hangover breakfast spot. We will prob come back at night sometime to experience the bar feel one day. They have a cool little outdoor area that they're working on now, looking forward to seeing the finished product. Lots of local beers on tap.\n\nTammy was our server and she was extremely nice. I used to come in here and eat breakfast all the time b\/c they knew good breakfast. And as long as the food stays good and priced well -- I'll keep coming back.
