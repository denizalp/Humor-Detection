Went to four bridal salons and this one had the cleanest sample dresses of all. Not only is the store chic & stylish but it is also clean & welcoming. Spacious, private try on rooms with walls & doors (no curtains here) & comfortable place for family to wait and see the dresses. On top of everything else, the staff is AMAZING. Ultimately I bought my dress elsewhere but came back to buy accessories here because all of the ladies are so sweet & knowledgable. Staff includes former bridal salon owners who know the business inside and out. They complimented photos of the dress I bought & were nothing but helpful and supportive!! For wonderful gown selection, a warm and welcoming environment & friendly and educated staff, be certain to add Brilliant Bridal to your gown shopping list.
