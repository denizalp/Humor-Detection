Love love love their food!! So fresh and cheap. Feeling healthy after eating it lol. The spicy sauce add so much favors and it tastes so good. I got the shrimp avocado roll all the time and will definitely go back when I can. But there is only one lady working in the food court so be ready to wait more than 30mins if you go at lunch time.
