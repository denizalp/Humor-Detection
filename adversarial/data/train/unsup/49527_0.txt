Food was fantastic. Went on a Saturday and almost didn't find parking so I'm not the only one to think this. The brisket I had melted in my mouth, best I've ever had.  Place was a little loud due to the open style seating, and it looked like a long wait but well worth it. I sat at the bar and got service right away.
