I've been here quite a few times, first for a Yelp Elite event and then for several of the Reality Bytes 90s music nights on random Saturdays.\n\nPros:\n-Nice decor\n-No cover\n-Really cheap drinks\n-Lots of seating\n-Not too crowded\n\nCons:\n-Staff always clear my drinks before I finish them. Keep a close eye out!\n-Sound system is shitty\n-Too empty sometimes (lets party!)
