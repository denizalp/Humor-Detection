first time here and i was MINDBLOWN. u legit have to try this place at least once.  okay all the meats are fantastic but my two favs were the boneless beef ribs which were super tender and then the prime rib infused with cheddar cheese like WTF. meat with cheese, yes please! honestly i would pay to just go back n be served just the cheese meat lol because it is soooo good!\n\nenough about the meat let me get to the carbs. The cheesebread and cornbread muffins! don't get me wrong, i love my meats but the cornbread was DIVINE. it comes out hot and fresh and is for sure the best ive ever had. i was thinking about it for days after lol. The cheesebread, there's two.  One in the buffet area and it's infused with a thick layer of cheese  right in the middle. MY. GOD.  The other one comes out hot and fresh. It's like a cheese ball puff, really good as well.  \n\nThe buffet area has quite the variety of salads and random cold dishes.  There's also lasagna, mac and cheese, rice, shrimp, mash potatoes.  I probably had about a whole plate of their mango salad.  finally, the dinner finishes with the grilled pineapple.  the BEST PART of the whole experience and I would save the most room for this.  It's grilled with cinnamon and sugar i think and is just absolute HEAVEN. i had no shame asking for the most slices. I would come back and even do the vegetarian option and not eat any meat just so i can eat the carbs and pineapple.
