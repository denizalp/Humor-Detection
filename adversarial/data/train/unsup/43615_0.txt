I would like to thank all the employees for being so helpful and informative during the whole service process with my vehicle. I was treated with excellent customer service from start to finish. I didn't feel like I was being rushed or ignored whenever I had questions regarding the service work that would be done that day on my vehicle.The employee also offered if I would like to view the work that was done and he explained the best of his ability in order for me to comprehend. One last part I wanted to mention was that I didn't feel like I was getting taken advantage of. These employees are knowledgeable, trustworthy, and most importantly honest.
