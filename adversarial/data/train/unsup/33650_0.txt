I used to love love love this restaurant. It was my go-to sushi place, delicious, friendly service. The decor was awesome, I loved their booths and how private they were. They practically knew us on a first name basis. When I got pregnant and I couldn't eat sushi, I still came with my boyfriend and ate tempura and vegetarian sushi. Shortly after my daughter was born (06\/14)  their service began to change.. They were still as friendly as ever but the food itself was getting lower and lower on the scale. They would have either over cooked or under cooked tempura, or sometimes it tasted like they hadn't changed the oil in their fryer in months. Sashimi portions used to be average sized, sometimes they would be huge but now they're small, paper thin and limp. Their meat would be over cooked and their sushi rolls were very small. I haven't been back in a couple months, because I found another place with average portions and delicious tempura. I really want to like this place, but the little things added up and I just can't go back.
