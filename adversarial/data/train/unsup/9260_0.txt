Yes, be prepared to spend a lot of money. I was warned beforehand by a couple of friends but it still doesn't minimize the damage to my wallet. But be prepared to also have your stomach wow'd by the variety of delicious and creative dishes they serve. It's tapas style, little portions that can be shared and the more people you have, the more you can try. \n\nLet's talk about the famous atmosphere. I've never been to a restaurant that was so loud. But in such a good way. The servers really pump you up about what you're eating and they make you feel excited just to be there. \n\nThen onto the food itself, simply wonderful. From their sashimi to their fried foods to their udon, everything is really great. Sitting at the bar, I was able to watch them prepare everything with great enthusiasm. That Fried Brie Cheese is something else. So interesting and so good. Their cocktails are pretty great too. I had the Red Dragon which was some sort of alcohol mixed with watermelon juice. Perfect for a summer's day. I did see some other people get some sort of drink served in a piece of bamboo which looked really awesome. \n\nOverall, this was a little piece of authentic Japanese food and atmosphere in downtown Toronto. I absolutely loved my experience and would recommend going there 100%. Just be prepared to be around some yelling and cheering: over you, around you, at you. It's all in good fun though :)
