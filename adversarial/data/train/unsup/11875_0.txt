DO NOT USE HORNE!  They are HORRIBLE!  NO customer service!  We have a 2 year old unit under warranty.  They could care less about fixing it.  No A\/C for a WEEK (with a 6 month pregnant woman in the house)  Then when you have an appointment, they LIE about the times.  We were told AM appointment and waited all day for them to show up at 6pm.  Totally unacceptable customer service!  Use another HVAC company and save yourself the hassle!!!
