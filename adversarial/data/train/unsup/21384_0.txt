I just attempted to eat breakfast at Somer's. It was awful. The paper thin breakfast potatoes were both burnt and undercooked. My cheese omelette had mysterious crunchy brown things in it. The coffee was weaker than a bargain trash bag. \n\nWhen the server returned to remove my plate, she didn't ask why I left more than half of my food behind. \n\nWhen we we went to pay for our plates of sadness, I noticed a handwritten sign taped on the wall in the back room. It read that employees will be charged if they use a styrofoam cup. That's when it all clicked. This place is trying to cut so many corners it might as well be a circle.
