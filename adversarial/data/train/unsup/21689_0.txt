Lemon Falls is the cutest ever. Even just walking in, it feels warm and inviting. Like you're at your Aunt's cozy house in the country, and she also just happens to be a really good cook. I challenge someone to tell me there is a better caf√©\/breakfast\/lunch spot in Chagrin Falls. Really, let's duel.\n\nLemon Falls is located right on the corner of North Main Street. The exterior has this cute, almost vintage garden vibe happening. Shortly around the corner, you'll find some metered parking which is usually free.\n\nI LOVE this place for several reasons...\n\n+ Atmosphere. The vibe is distinctly warm, creative, and just somewhat inspiring with a charming personality. Sit here and eat lunch with your Mom, or grab a coffee and do some work\/homework.\n\n+ Food. The lobster roll was incredible. While many places will skimp on their portions of lobster, Lemon Falls is well worth the price. Served on an open face brioche roll, you would think it was poached fresh off a coastline.\n\n+ Gifts. From everything from teas and coffees, to handmade dog treats and antique snacks, you can find a small, \"make-you-smile\" gift in a heartbeat.\n\n+ Patio. Lemon Falls has the sweetest bistro-style patio, where dogs are welcome.\n\nAlso, everyone who works there is just genuinely nice and welcoming. That's rare in itself. Bookmark them now! If you don't love it, call me up for that dual.
