My new favorite theater.  In general, I try and avoid theaters that are attached to a mall. This is remote enough that the crowd is not too crazy.  Super friendly staff. Neat facilities. Plenty of space to lounge if you happen to get there too early for your movie.  You can get extra plush seating for a bit more, and have a beer and above norm theater food too. Yes, pricey but still nice to have that option. If you happen to just go with regular theater seating, it's still better than your norm. Leather(ette, possibly) seating, nice back support and ample give. And the screen, super clear and digital. I will definitely be back, next time going for Star (similar to Cine Capri).\n\nTip, wanna just try it out?  Go early. $5 a movie for a regular digital is an awesome deal.
