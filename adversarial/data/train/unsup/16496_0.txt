Wow. This place is unbelievable. I was turned away after waiting for FIVE hours to start the process. I was turned away because of a surgery I had in January. It was nothing that would affect me donating but they still turned me away. It made me so mad because I'm healthy, I have never drank or smoked once in my life. The waiting room reeked of people who smoked or hadn't showered for days yet they were able to donate. Freaking joke. Don't try to donate unless you smoke weed, chain smoke or don't shower. Those must be the only requirements for donating plasma.
