Separate rooms for poorly and well children is a stroke of genius! A little bit of a wait, but that's no problem when weighed against the service you receive. Very modern facility with knowledgeable staff, and the administrator was just awesome. Having the ability to come back and get  shots for just $15 instead of paying another appointment fee was just a god send......glad I bought my children here. Now a loyal customer until someone tells me other places are free and give away candy to adults who sign up..... :p
