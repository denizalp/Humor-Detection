Wow, Light is my new favorite club in Vegas!!! Sorry XS... you're still awesome but nothing can beat this.\n\nLight just opened four months ago and is located within Mandalay Bay (which is that farrrr side of the strip opposite of Encore in case you were wondering).\n\nMy group of ladies came here on a Friday night and were escorted in by our promoter friend for free who also set us up with drinks at a table (thank you Zach!). Once inside it took me a few minutes to just take in the scene around me. The interior's open space is GIGANTIC and multilayered. Although there isn't a huge area for dancing, I never once felt claustrophobic in the crowd. The DJ was great at keeping the masses energized. The music took more of the techno\/electronic\/house route (or as I like to call it the drugged-out \"mindtrance\" route) but it made me want to dance till the sun came up so it was a total success.\n\nSo forget the interior and the millions of dollars probably put into building the light effects for this space, the reason why I love Light so much is because of the live entertainment. Pole dancers as far as the eye can see, trapeze artists, aerialists dangling inches above the main floor, men dancing perpendicularly onto the wall, Cirque du Soleil performers decked out in full costumed attire seductively crossing the stage as if in a show... it was the most amazing, visual stimulating experience I have ever had while in a club. My only with this club is that they do not allow anyone else other than the performers to play on the poles. Oh well, I still LOVED every other aspect of Light and there was never a dull moment.\n\n\nI think y'all got that I loved this club. I'm done now. Go and experience Light for yourself!
