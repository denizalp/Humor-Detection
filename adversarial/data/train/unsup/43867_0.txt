I've been a member for years. I have had to use the roadside assistance a few times, and the battery replacement once, and it's always been first-rate. Quick service, professional assistance. \n\nThat being said, the prices keep going up, and I have begun to wonder how much better they are than insurance add ons from USAA or Progressive which are 1\/3 the price. All I've ever needed is flat tires and jump starts, which  aren't rocket science. \n\nAs an annoying sidelight, they are often out of maps when I ask. It's irritating to pay $120\/yr and find that maps for Phoenix and nearby cities such as LA or adjacent states like Utah and Colorado are back ordered from the printer and no date for delivery is available. It's not like I'm asking for Utica or Savannah.
