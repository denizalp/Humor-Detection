Chef D. Thank you for your hospitality. I enjoyed your delicious gelato and friendly conversation.  \n\nMy favorite was the hazelnut and the dark chocolate.  What refined and carefully crafted flavors you created!\n\nI will have to come back to have the guava sorbet and the coconut sorbet.  I sampled them and know they are great flavors as well.  \n\nUntil the next time!\n\nProps to Nelson Q for Yelping true.
