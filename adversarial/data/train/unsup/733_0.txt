It's not a waste of time visiting here, but the overall experience is fair, mediocre at best!  We arrived to a fairly empty restaurant on a midday Saturday, with two great desires - my salivating over getting good down home BBQ, and finding another location in the area I can come back to regularly.  But we were not impressed, it does not seem like I will return considering so many BBQ joints in the area to try.  We lunched there in a typical BBQ-style ambience... very plain, simple and non-descript d√©cor.  Our meal consisted of Pete's Pick of baby back ribs (with little meat and on the dry side) with mashed taters & green beans.  Also had their Make it a Meal of spare ribs, pulled pork, sausage & brisket with corn on the cobb, collards (pretty good) & biscuit (dry), giving us a try of their overall menu selection.  It's totally unpretentious vibe and atmosphere, with no fantastic service or attention, it's a counter-service style, and last, but not least, a limited selection of BBQ dishes dismayed my desire to return. So much on the menu appeared mouthwatering, yet short on taste and\/or legitimacy!  Being a Brisket lover, I was thoroughly disappointed with their offering!  Now don't get me wrong, it was a decent lunch, but nothing to write home about!  With so many other BBQ joints in the Valley, many others are better.
