Pieology vs Fired Pie. A lot people seem to be wondering this.\n\nWHY NOT BOTH!? Here's some things I love about Pieology that Fired Pie kind of lacks in.\n\n1. Supportive, yet perfectly thin, crispy yet tender crusts! Pieology wins here in that the crust perfectly supported the generous amount toppings I had on my Buffalo Chicken pizza (which was bomb, see photo attached). The crusts at Fired Pie are consistently pretty soggy in the middle, and tends to fall apart, considering all of toppings I like to request on my 'zas. By the way, when I asked for a lot of mushrooms at Pieology, they offered me A LOT of mushrooms. They went out of their way to make sure I had enough! Sparse topping hiccups are definitely gone, seems like.\n\n2. Larger store, more seating, more space to yourself! Fired Pie at the 101 tends to feel pretty claustrophobic since it's soooo small and is typically packed. It's kind of like being crammed in someone's living room with 50 other people. Sometimes I don't want to eat right next to a gaggle of screaming kids, and Pieology's large layout allows me to head to a corner and inhale my food in peace.\n\n3. HERB BUTTER OLIVE OIL BASE:  Just go ahead and drown me in this. So buttery, so good. Add the gorgonzola too, it's ridiculously good.\n\nThere are some toppings and sauces that Fired Pie has that Pieology doesn't. And I'll be going back there occasionally when I'm in that area (especially if it's not currently jam packed with tiny screaming people) but I'm SO glad Pieology opened, because they are just as great and in a few ways better, so the real question is... WHY NOT BOTH?!
