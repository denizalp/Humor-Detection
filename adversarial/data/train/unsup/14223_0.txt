DO NOT GET KEYS MADE HERE!\n\nI am so annoyed with this Ace. I moved into a new place and needed to get keys made. The cashier paged someone and after waiting about 15 minutes I headed toward the exit, then he finally arrived. I had 5 keys made, 2 didn't fit.  Went back to have the 2 fixed, 1 still didn't work. Ugh!\n\nFast forward a year later and keep in mind my deteriorating memory, I once again had to get keys made and returned to this location. I got 5 made, 2 didn't work (sound familiar). When I went  back to get the keys fixed the woman who helped me told me it is not usually the fault of the people cutting the keys, but the calibration of the machine. She assured me the machine was just calibrated so we should have no issues. \n\nAnd guess what? One of the keys STILL doesn't fit.
