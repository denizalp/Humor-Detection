Wolfgang Puck doesn't disappoint! And you can have access to his deliciousness up until 6 AM. Open all night long!\n\nIt's past midnight and there's still a 30-minute wait, so we walk around to kill time. By the time we're seated, we're excited to see whether the hype is true. And it's definitely worth it for good food at this hour. So...what to order?\n\nFOOD:\n---------\nWe started with the **Mesquite Grilled Steak Skewers**, which was much larger than one would expect for an appetizer. 5 divine skewers! The meat was so tender it melted in my mouth, and the savory flavors burst forth. What a pleasant surprise! \n\nI'm a total carnivore, but the **Vegetable Pizza** really hit the spot. You can't go wrong with oven roasted tomatoes, basil pesto, mozzarella, and Nicoise olives. Sometimes pesto is a nice change.\n\nAnd finally, there's no way we could resist the **Three Cheese \"Mac 'n Cheese\" **. I thought the price was a little high at $12, but when that sucker showed itself I understood everything. Even the meaning of life. We were again pleasantly surprised by a fairly-sized portion that helped induce food comas all around.\n\nAlthough prices are higher than the super casual cafe around the corner, the quality of food at this hour is really quite impressive.\n\nSERVICE\/AMBIANCE:\n---------------------------\nCrowd is mixed; you'll see people of all ages here. Most are stopping by after a long night in either casual or fancy attire, depending where they came from or where they're headed. So you'll see business suits, skimpy club attire, grungy gym clothes, and even hipsters. You should never be surprised in Vegas.\n\nMy only issue is with the service. The hosts were polite, but our server took forever to take our order. We must have waited 15-20 minutes in our seats before ordering, and this is after we had already waited 30 minutes outside. He provided great recommendations and our food arrived in a reasonable amount of time, but he NEVER came back to check on us. When we wanted to pay our bill he was socializing with one of the other servers, so I had to go ask him for it. I'm sure the other staff there are not as negligent as he is. At least I hope not!\n\nTIP: Overall this place is great for late night and I definitely recommend it when you're staying at the MGM Grand.\n\nDATE TIP: Ohhh yeah, open til 6 AM. Perfect for your Vegas late night date night schedule!
