My heater went out. I have an old Ruud HVAC unit. Tech Andre Blake from Las Vegas Air conditioning came out to check it out. He opened up the unit and after only 5 minutes of looking, was able to determine the heat exchanger was cracked and I need to buy a new unit for $7,000 from them. He also stated he needed to condemn my unit. He even showed me a text message from his boss saying that is a dangerous unit and replacement is the only option. After declining his offer, he stated he would waive the trip charge, since no work was completed if i left him a good review on google. So I did just that. I signed a waiver stating I was operating a dangerous unit and they would not be liable. I ended up calling APC (Appliance Parts Center) on Eastern and Bonanza. The technician, Mariah showed up less than an hour after my call. He found the issue to be faulty wiring and rewired it for $175. He fixed the heater in 10 minutes and its now running like a champ. Mariah said it is rare that heat exchangers crack on those type of units and if they did, they can be fixed. APC caters to do it your selfers, but  they also have their own techs that will come help if needed. Before you call any big AC companies that just want to sell units, Call APC (Appliance Parts Center). Truly honest people. As for Las Vegas air conditioning goes, Zero integrity!!!!!
