Not only clean and huge variety, but service was top-notch all around. Being from Chicago, we googled 'where to buy meat?' - Google was right! Meat selection was superb and the customer service was amazing! Meat supervisor walked us around and explained the meat cuts and brands - she was wonderful. Then they took our carts and walked out groceries out and packed them for us. I'd love to see one of these in Chicago, 60641 please!
