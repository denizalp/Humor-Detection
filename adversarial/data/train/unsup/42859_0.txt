I had my sewing machine looked at and fixed here and I'm really impressed with the results!  I couldn't figure out why my machine was jamming up all the time.  There were a few things that needed to be replaced and fixed on it.  They did an amazing job because the machine runs like a dream now and they even warranty the repair for a year.  Great customer service and a fair price for the work.
