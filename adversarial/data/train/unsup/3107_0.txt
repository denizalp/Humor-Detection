No one deserves to be hounded because the stylist cancels .\n\nToday I was suppose to go in for a Brazilian blowout . A little after 8am, the manager\/front desk Paulsen texts me saying Erika is sick and he went ahead and booked a later appointment with another stylist . \nFirst off , ASK. Do not assume I want to go to a different stylist at a different time . I texted back, no thanks- and that time would not work with my schedule and I didn't know the substitute's work. And texting that early on a personal number is unprofessional.\n\nHe persisted on texting and calling me and trying to convince me the time and stylist is what I needed.\n\nThen Erika texted  me saying I should go to the substitute . \n\nThen more phone calls from salon. Then a text reminder I scheduled the appointment today . ( I didn't sign up at that time why am I getting text reminders?!? ) Then a voicemail from the owner asking if I was coming in.\n\nI do not understand why such the confusion & persistence when it was clear I said no thanks . I am at work and I thought no thanks means no appointment ( I can't keep looking at my phone for calls and texts ) \n\nA simple - \"okay no problem , call us to reschedule \" would of been ideal .\n\nLast visit I was very pleased on my hair , I even talked to Erica and the owner what my needs were for a Brazilian blowout for awhile. Erika had my trust she was going to do a great Brazilian blow out in future. \n\nI even sent my good friend in to get her hair done this week . Erika was booked, Charlie was her stylist . My friend enjoyed her services, but noticed salon was pushy to book next appointment . \n\nThis salon needs to take a chill pill and respect no is no . I will not be returning even thou Erika did a nice job on my first visit . Shame on them for giving me such high anxiety & interrupting my work day -- I need a drink lol. \n\nI should post all the missed calls and texts for humor purposes.
