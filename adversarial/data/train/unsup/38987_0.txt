So I love Bomberos. I like the fire pit, and the trees, and the decor. But the thing I love the most is the atun escabeche(sp). Salty, sweet, and delicious. \n As a side note, my 7 year old daughter loves to come here to hang out and read, apparently Junie B. Jones books fit in really well with the ham and cheese sandwich.\n I highly recommend it.
