I love Big Daddies and have given them 5 stars despite the fact that they don't play Cajun music (come on guys, please play it once in a while!) I've taken many people to Big Daddy's for dinner and to share apps. \n\nThe Oysters are a great starter and come with an assortment of hot sauces. The Voodoo Hours are a great way to try a few things if you have a couple of people and don't want to commit to a full menu item. The servers are always very nice, professional & knowledgeable.\n\n**Pop by for a nibble and a drink before the theatre, the service pretty is quick**
