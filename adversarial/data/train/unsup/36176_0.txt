Good Brunch spot on Mill Ave! Fairly quick service. The setup is easy, an Order Here and sit anywhere flow. I have only been a couple of times, but the bellinis and mimosas are delicious. As well as the breakfast eggs, toast and grilled potatoes combo.  Parking is metered with a parking lot located directly across the street. Extremely close access to the light rail.
