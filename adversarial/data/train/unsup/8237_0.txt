I can't think of restaurant that I've been to that is as poorly ran as this place.  First it takes over 10 minutes for a server to even recognize your existence - and this is at a high top with about 15 people sitting at it.  Then your food to comes out before your drink which is scary that they can \"make\" fajitas faster than they can open a corona.   After the food I decided I had some time to kill still and wanted another drink and chips and salsa.  Drink came reasonably quick that time chips and salsa took 17 minutes.  And no they weren't freshly made.  This place deserves to be out of business
