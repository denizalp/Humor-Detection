These guys are a joke. I bought a mod from then and 5 months later it starting to get glitches so I went back in to see what was up and they told me I was pressing the button wrong and to use my finger nail instead of my finger. What kinda shit is that? Pushing a button is pushing a button. So basically they didn't help at all but instead fed me some bullshit. I'll never support them again and I got all of my friends away from this place too. I've recent been going to Puff Vapors and that place is legit. I bought wicks from them awhile back and the pack had a couple bad ones so they gave me a whole brand new pack and some free juice. That's what I call Customer service. Go to Puff, don't waste your time at this spot.
