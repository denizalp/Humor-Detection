Buffet at the Bellagio...Oh yeah!\nDid you know the hungry kitten considers herself a connoisseur of buffet foods? \nFrom the average Chinese super buffet to the grand buffets of Vegas!\nHonestly I felt like I had died and gone to heaven.\nIn fact if I do die, I'm coming back as a stray animal and eating out of the buffet leftovers in Las Vegas.\nOut of all the buffets in the world, this one is probably the best. No I'm not even stretching the imagination here. This buffet offers everything the heart could desire.\nYou want miso soup, a slice of pizza, scrambled eggs, chocolate torte and champagne for breakfast? All on the same plate? Sure thing!  Only in Vegas baby.\n\nP.s be sure to go on the weekends also as the selection is greater and you get free champagne!\n\nFree champagne woohoo! Mimosas for everyone!
