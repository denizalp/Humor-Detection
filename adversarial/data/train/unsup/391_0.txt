Let me start off as saying if t here were such things as NO STARS, I'd find that more appropriate. I left The Plaza wondering if I had just accidently stayed & checked out of Section 8 of Las Vegas. A friend had accidently booked the room there and we figured it couldn't be that. Bright eyed and full of optimism I arrived and to my surprise was bitch slapped that same night with by own assumptions. \n\nThe first night there while trying desperately to find an outlet to recharge my phone I aimed for the closest one between my bed and the other. Just my luck I pulled my bed forward and THERE! There is was staring back at me. A dirty, used condom. Disastrous! Yes, I know. BUT, Friends it doesn't stop there. Horrified I then found a piece of of nasty hair on my pillow. Jokingly, my friend handed me his pillow....Only then did I find some prostitues fire engine red hair clumped in the center. I'm too scared to actually think that what I later found on the blankets was jizz. \n\n\nHorrible Horrible Horrible. Horrible maid service. Horrrible Hotel serice. Horrrible Hotel. Smack dab in the center of the ghetto of Vegas. I never want to return and I'd advise anyone NOT to go. Get a better deal at a retired filled casino. At least that'd be more sanitary.
