I always IN for sweet and staying out late on a Saturday night! \n\nAfter having Japanese sushi, we looking for a place for a night Cap and my date suggested going to Sicilian Sidewalk Cafe for some crepes! She really knows how I roll! \n\nSicilian Sidewalk Cafe is not one of those girly Cafe... Nothing Girly with Leaf's Game showing on TV (aside from the Leaf's being girly and they suck big time..?? that's a different story!) \n\nFreshly made Crepes\/Waffles seems to be the most popular thing on the menu... So we decided to share a ice cream crepes... that was so yummy... but the tiramisu was one of the worst  and the driest one I ever have! \n\nSKIP the cake!! Order anything else but that!!\n\nI have to give credit for Sicilian Sidewalk Cafe to stay open till 3 AM on Friday and Saturday night... What's better to have one of those crepes after a whole night of drinking?
