I haven't stayed at this hotel in over a decade so I was hoping lots would change for the better. For the most part, it has, with many more options for dining and shopping. I also loved that I was able to check in early without having to wait until 3 pm. \n\nI got up to my room and the place is beautiful and very spacious. I got the luxury suite and it was more than enough for everything. However, I went to go and plug my phone charger behind the night stand and saw condom wrappers and other things under the nightstand that the cleaning people never cleaned out. It was gross and that made me second guess everything else in the room. \n\nIf you want a view of the Mirage fire show and with the noise of drunken people below, you can pay an additional $40 per night. I love how these vegas hotels are making you pay more for view, without also mentioning that the noise would be much worse.
