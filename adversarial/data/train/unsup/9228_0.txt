Had lunch there today while I was on that side of town working, sat at the bar and was helped promptly by a girl \"Mackenzie\". Awesome server, fast polite and friendly...\nPlace was super clean and food was fantastic..I will go there again and hope too get the same server, as she was one of the best I have ever had ..
