I go to this CVS pretty often because of how close it is to where I live and because it's got overall pretty decent prices when it comes to beer and champagne and what have ya.  I'm not sure where their prices stand on their hard liquor but usually anything outside of a liquor store is pretty outrageous.\n\nAlso, if I have the beer munchies, I can get a frozen pizza.  Hooray!\n\nI have a serious issue with this place in the morning, man.  Sometimes on my way to work, I like to stop here, buy a bottle of water and a Red Bull but sitting out in back, where I like to lock up my bike, are these intensely aggressive tweekers\/bums.  If I have money or change, I give it to the homeless when I can.  These guys, though.  I won't do it.  I won't give these guys shit.  One time I was locking up my bike and this chick who looked like she'd been eating meth for breakfast since she was knee-high to a grasshopper whistled at me and stared at me with these cold, dead eyes.  Around the corner, this guy appeared, all gangly and filthy.  Then they start demanding I give them money.... not asking, demanding.\n\nFuck that noise, Jack.  I took off.\n\nSo, this morning I come by and there they are, sittin' there.  I shit you not these guys are about as close to being zombies as you can get.  Not exaggerating:  I rode by and the chick reached out and said, \"You got money?\"\n\nI circled around to the front entrance, locked up my bike and the front door had a sign that said to go in through the back.  Through the back?  Where those stinky, demanding tweekers can accost me?  \n\nIf there's a quiet bum sitting out in front, whatever, a little trashy but what's a bum to do?  Two or three tweekers that say, \"Gimme money,\" and whistle at you?  Chase 'em off with a broom!
