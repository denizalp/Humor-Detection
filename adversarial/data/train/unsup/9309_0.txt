Great wine list.  Good expensive food.  Probably less pretentious than you assume it is going to be.\n\nBut still pretentious enough to feel shiny.   A menu full of hipster bait like \"schmaltz\" and \"rutabaga\".  Fashionable people pecking at tiny dishes like birds in the night.   Beautiful eyes behind cool spectacles peering into progressively empty souls.  \n\nA particularly nice wine list.  Especially for finding randomly curated bottles that you want to display to impress your wine-friends with.  Surprisingly well priced. It's almost as if they came from your own cellar, you savvy cat you.   Embrace.  \n\nLet's be honest though.  I really hate when places charge for bread.  When you're already dropping several hundred dollars for food and wine it just feels silly to have line-items devoted to 'bread' on the bill.   \n\nAn interesting excursion.  Definitely worth coming to.  But you should dress a little hip.  And bring your own bread.
