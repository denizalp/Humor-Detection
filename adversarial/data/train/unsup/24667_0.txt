During the entire winter, whenever we went for a walk downtown, we had to finish the evening with hot fresh mint tea! And of course, being foodies, we order a wrap and desserts alongside our tea as a real midnight treat! Their wraps are baked in a stone oven, the outside being crispy whilst the inside just melts in your mouth! When you're done with it, you literally crave for your next visit to have that experience again!\n\nTheir desserts are of a high quality, homemade traditional arabic delights such as kunefe and baklava, prepared with love and passion. Before serving, they drizzle a homemade honey syrup over the dessert which is amazing!! \n\nThe interior is basic - cosy and warm but they need to step up their heating system. It is a great place for takeaways especially desserts which they are popular for. \nThe staff are always welcoming and at your service.
