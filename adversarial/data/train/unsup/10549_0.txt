Missing California, it was almost instantaneous that In N Out would curb the homesickness. \n\nCame here for a late dinner and got a hamburger, grilled onions, protein style and a drink. This is a my go-to order, upon eating I noticed that the burger had animal sauce which I think is weird because typically if you get a burger protein style you would leave out the animal sauce as a given. The sauce pretty much defeats the purpose of getting it protein style, so that kind of bugged me. I guess I'll just ask them specifically for no sauce next time. I like that they keep the spicy peppers for self-serving next to the ketchup dispensers.\n\nOther than that, food came out quickly, service was quick, though it was pretty packed in the place for a late afternoon on a weekday.
