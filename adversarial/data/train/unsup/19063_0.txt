I needed to do some last minute shopping on Christmas Eve and was in search of Pokemon toys for my kid brother. The Toy Box was like a shining beacon and proved to be the solution to my procrastination. Not only did I find Pokemon toys, but they were on sale for 25% off! We grabbed some Pokemon cards tucked away behind the counter for $3.99 as well. The prices at The Toy Box seem fairly comparable to any major retailer. Even better is that this store offers a 15% off check-in offer! \n\nBesides the trendy toy selection for kiddos, there was also an abundance of really cool collectibles and board games at The Toy Box. The Arnold Schwarzenegger and Predator action figures locked away in the glass cabinets were nifty, but packed a punch with the price tag of $200+. I enjoyed looking at their selection of Marvel toys, too. It's safe to say The Toy Box offers something for your average kid AND the serious collector.        \n\nI was more than happy to spend my money here rather than say, Walmart or Toys \"R\" Us. Come support your local toy store and check out The Toy Box.\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #271
