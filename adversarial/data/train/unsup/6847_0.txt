This little restaurant just opened up in the plaza full of yummy shops, Japanese tapas and sushi. The service has been 10\/10 each time I come eat here and so is the music! Haha. The interior is quite nice too, I mean it's perfect to eat and talk stories with your friends, the ambience is just dark and loud music. \nNow the food, I ordered a hachi salad and it was made with rice crackers and that was pretty delicious if you ask me, a little too saucy for a salad but it was still good.\nI also ordered hamaguri clams, 2.50 for a clam. They were a little hard\/chewy and the sauce for the clam was a little salty. \nAll the other stuff I ordered was up to par though! Like the salmon sashimi, the salmon rolls, sukiyaki ($15 for a bowl good for up to 2 people) chicken skewers, and the desserts. The oysters are okay not the best I've ever had. But if I had to really recommend anything my absolute favorites to order is the sukiyaki, the fish, and all the cheap little tapas. surprising they fill you up! That's probably my favorite thing about this restaurant, all the tapas are very good priced and the quality is pretty on point too with most of the stuff and the variety of stuff to choose from, but all still in the Japanese category. Oh and I would definitely recommend dessert, the matcha panna cotta is my absolute fav!! It has little red beans at the bottom and the honey toast is a little sweet and really honey but it's good for a group of friends and it's HUGE. My overall experience was 5 stars
