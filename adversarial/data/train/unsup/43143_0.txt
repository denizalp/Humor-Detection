One word, amazing! You just do not see this good if customer service on a daily basis anymore. \n\nI had been searching online for a place to ship my wedding dress to in Vegas so that it could be steamed. (It's pretty big, so I didn't want to take it through the airport.) I found Creative Bridal and let me tell you, they will put your mind at ease. I shipped my wedding dress, (now) husband's suit, shirt and tie. They called me when they received the package. (Talk about putting your mind at ease!) They also deliver it straight to your hotel,  and called me when it was delivered to my hotel, which it arrived right at the time they said it would. They are quick and easy to get ahold of, I used both email and phone. My items looked amazing when I received them. \n\nThis is the definitely the place to go for this service as we didn't have an ounce of stress with it.
