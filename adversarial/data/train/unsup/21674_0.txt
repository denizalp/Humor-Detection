I admit it.... I'm a book junky!\nNo seriously, I love books.\nI never get time to read all the books I buy.\nOld books, new books, character books, business, self-help.\nMaybe I need a book on how to read all the books I have?!\n\nOk, back on point.\nThis is a gem in the awesome community of Kensington.\nAre you a bookworm\/bibliophile\/book-lover??\nIf so then this is the place for you.\n\nA wickedly charming space on two floors.\nBooks you won't find at a big-box retailer nor is there a SB in the store.\nSpeaking of which, you can buy a book or ten here and then pop across the street to Higher Ground for a real coffee and a cookie and support yet another local business.\n\nThis place smells like a book store should it is THAT authentic!\nThe floors creak for extra character too - lol\n\nLiterary genius is evident in every book you pick up.\nKids books, cook books, novels, technical books, business - they have it all.\nPerhaps 2 or 3 copies at most. But who cares!! The selection is small and magical!\n\nThe staff are knowledgeable and so generous with their time to help you.\n\nNotebooks!! I love all the unique notebooks they have - which is the reason I went in to the store in the first place. What a great find. \nI'll be back over and over ---- and you should be too.\n\nSupport local - we never want to lose this gem!
