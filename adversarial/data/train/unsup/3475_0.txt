After moving from Bloomfield, and leaving behind my beloved Thai Cuisine, I finally found a place to get my fix. I went here with my bf and I have to say that it was pretty good.  The restaurant was busy, but we were seated right away.  It was a little hot due to lack of central air, but they had fans going, so that helped. There was only one server, but I was impressed on how he handled a busy restaurant.  My water glass was never empty.\nWhenever I try a new place I always order Pad Thai....if they have a good Pad Thai, then they're worth my next visit. LOL.  It was good.  I got a level 8 spicey and enjoyed it.  My bf got a currie & brown rice which was pretty good.  We split and order of spring rolls.  The food came out quick and was timed very well after our spring rolls.\n\nI enjoyed  Thai Spoon and I'm definitely going to hit it up again.
