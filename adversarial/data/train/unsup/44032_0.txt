Unlike as stated by others, my move out experience was ok.  I was upset that for a facility of this size, they only had TWO moving carts.  At the same time I got there, both were being used by the same group.  The clerk walked over and we both politely asked to borrow one of them.  While it worked out ok; what if they said No?  Why not have more on hand, why not limit one cart per group?  They had two lockers, but still needs to be fair. Was I expected to wait hours, all day for them to finish.  I made two trips to empty the small locker and they were still there. Cheap owners for not providing more carts; why not spend a few hundred dollars and get 4\/5 more carts.  These carts last forever!\n\nMy move in experience on the other hand was a complete and total cluster!  At one point I just tore up the contract and was ready to walk out.  I made a reservation online and expected a smooth move it.  Then when we got there, the clerk\/manager(?) insisted that we need to buy insurance from them to cover our storage.  She printed off all the docs and was forcing my daughter to sign everything.  I said that I refuse to accept the insurance.  She insisted that its a must!  I said absolutely not and no where on the agreement nor the website does it state that.  I said that customers can assume full responsibility for their items and sign a waiver.  I also stated that our insurance covers it anyway.  The whole ordeal was extremely rude and infuriating; as we had a lot of things to accomplish that day and starting off with the BS was not a good way to do it.  Even though she denied it, I suspect they get a kick back from the insurance company and are forced to push the insurance on customers by the owners of this location.  We ended up waiving it, but were still charged for it, as she said that it was the only way to lock in the unit.  She said that she then had to put through a cancellation and we would get a refund; which we did, but what a f'n pain in the rear.
