So it's that's time where it's hot and the bugs start to come out and I hate bugs so who better to call than \"what's buggin you\" lol.  Especially with a pool I have to make sure I stay on top of getting my property sprayed in this desert. I found this company by searching yelp as well as Groupon and decided to take the deal since it's such a bargain. Right now they offer yelp members $30 off which was to good to pass up.\nSo I called to set a appointment and the owner answered and asked me a few questions to understand what I was hoping to accomplish which I thought was excellent and a great way to build customer loyalty. After setting the appointment he sent me a text message to confirm the appointment as well as followed up with me the day before the appointment so I knew for sure he was going to be on time which he was!\nSo when he arrived he took the time to explain exactly what his spray will and won't kill and then took the time to educate me on the best way to minimize bugs around the water. I really appreciate his attention to detail as well as educating me the customer. When it's time to spray my house I will definitely be a return customer :)
