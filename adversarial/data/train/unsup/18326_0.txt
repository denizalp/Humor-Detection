Brand new club located in Newmarket, Yonge and Davis intersection. It is your standard goodlife has everything you need and a unique rope climbing simulation machine? Either way its 24\/4 so its open when I need it which is better than the local LA fitness. I think their staff are a bit new so they are getting used to running things, not like they are required for much anyway.
