I like this place, but I'm pretty up and down with it! People don't realize that this place was pretty hard to find--vegan and gluten free! If you're not used to eating vegan or gluten free, you have to be open. But luckily, this is one of the better places that I've been to! \n\nAmbiance: 4 - I actually love the cafe area. It's basically hidden almost at the bottom of the stairs. When you sit in the inner area, it's secluded and private, just like a real cafe. You almost don't realize you're at a mall! However, I wish the seats were more comfortable because they are not fun sitting in after walking around for hours! \n\nService: 5 - The service was really great. The workers were helpful and always asking if we needed any questions answered or wanted some more drinks. They brought the food to our table, which I thought was really sweet since the place is so small, they really didn't have to! \n\nFood: 4 - Quality vegan and gluten-free foods are really hard to find anywhere really. I was really surprised by the quality of their vegan red velvet! Wasn't really a fan of the icing, but it was pretty good. The chocolate cake was really good and tasty. The cakes were a little too sweet for my tastes, but they pulled it off really well regardless. Notttt a fan of the drinks though. I might have to try more to see if they have better ones, but currently not a fan! \n\nFor now, I suggest bakery only! I'm getting ready to try the food next time; I heard it was pretty good and now I'm curious!!!
