TERRIBLE. If you want to wait more than 40 minutes to get your food because there's only 1 person doing all the work then go try this place. If you want to be disrespected to your time then go here. I would give 0 stars if I could. \n\nThink of it like this at subway- you go in and you have to wait for someone to make the bread. Then you only have 1 person putting the sandwich together. But then you have 10 people in line and you are the 11th person in line and there are people jumping into the queue because the line is so messed up. \n\nI ordered the shawarma laffa but soon noticed that the line was not moving at all. After about 30 minutes of waiting in a line that was moving very slowly, our laffa finally arrived. This is when the problem started. Some guy that had ordered after us decides to cut us off in line and claimed that he was in the line first. So what do they do? They serve to the cheater first. Sure it would be no big deal if we weren't already waiting over 30 minutes and we don't have to wait another decade for another laffa to come out of the oven. \n\nIf you're business is based on making fresh laffas, make sure you have enough laffas coming out of your oven. And the most important thing is make sure the line is moving. They have 1 guy doing everything. It seemed like he was the only guy doing everything. We complained about how they let people cut in line- and what do they do? Roll his eyes together with the guy that cheated in line. Yes they support cheating in lines. Dumb cashier lady at the front kept saying \"its ok don't worry it's not a big deal\". Really? It's okay to cheat in line eh? If you're gonna wait in line here just cheat and roll your eyes through the line. It really works here.\n\nI don't know any food court line that makes you wait more than 10 minutes to get your food. This place is just ridiculous.
