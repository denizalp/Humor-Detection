Mesa East Bowl is what a bowling alley should be.  You shouldn't expect excellent service or great food.  Bowling is a vintage sport that should take place in a vintage style bowling alley.  This is exactly what East Mesa Bowl serves.  Prices for bowling are something like $2.50 before 5PM and 3.50 after 5 pm.  If you are renting shoes, it will set you back an additional 3.25.  The wait was not unpleasant.  We went on a saturday night at 7:00 and waited 25 minutes.  There is a bar with pool tables, a juke box and a dart board to keep you entertained so long as you don't have youngsters with you.. If so, there are some arcade games and a snack bar that may keep you entertained long enough before you lane opens up.  Bathrooms could be cleaner, but don't forget, you ARE at a bowling alley.. Appreciate it for what it is!
