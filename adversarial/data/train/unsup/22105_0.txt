Do I want a green yard? Yes. Do I want working sprinklers? Yes. Do I want to pay through the nose to have them fixed? NO! And finally, Do I know how to repair them myself? No, but give me a DIY website and I can just about fix anything! \n\nIt seems that my house has issues with water. Bathtub not draining - Fixed myself. Discovered that its best to NOT put orange rinds down the disposal - Hubby fixed. Busted bubbler valve on sprinkler - We fixed (capped it off). 3 of 5 sprinklers not working and anti-siphon valve leaking - Might need to call in the calvery. \n\nSo I called Discount Sprinkler (called a few other contractors who were lic\/bond\/ins. Discount is NOT Lic\/bond\/insured). Discount was the second company to show up - 1hr late. Possible Red Flag. Drove up in old beater van and practically parked in the street. Possible Red Flag. \n\nThe first estimate - $150.00 (anti-siphon valve and 3 new heads) Hmm... $150.00?  Let's keep talking.  After that quote, I asked him about the solenoid valves below the ground. I wanted them gone and to have the system manual. \n\nHe went for a shovel, and started digging out around the valves. Then he started messing with them, taking some of them apart and then turning on the sprinklers multiple times by cranking the (already ready for the dump, but not completely broken) anti-siphon valve. Yeah dude, I really wanted a shower\/mud bath right now. Thanks. \n\nAfter he was done screwing around, the anti-siphon valve was completely shot. It was not just leaking when turned on now, but producing a steady stream of water when in the off position. \n\nNew estimate - $325.00 (new manifold and anti-siphon valve) \nThe next thing out of his mouth, \"So when do you want me to start the work?\" I looked at J and he said to the guy we'd call him in 24-48 hours. \n\nJ and I proceed to go inside the house. I was PISSED! Do I think that guy purposely broke the valve to try to get the job? Hell Yes! Does J think the guy broke it on purpose? No. Does he think the guy was careless? Yes. \n\nSo, I did some research on the internet and called my uncle to ask for help..... \n\nTrip to ACE Hardware - $2.50 in gas \n3ft thick wall PVC pipe and PVC parts - $15.00 \nLabor - maybe 1hr 30minutes (total between 2 days) \n\nWorking sprinklers in the front yard that was a DIY project - Priceless!
