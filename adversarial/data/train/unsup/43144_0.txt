One word \"EXCELLENT\"! We saw this restaurant while watching the food network. The reviews were so good we decided to see for ourselves. The restaurant is chic, but relaxing. When you first walk in there's a bar area, a couple of sofas and a few tables. The lights were dimmed low which immediately softened the mood. As you walk to the dining area, the lighting is brighter and there's a projector flashing old pictures on the wall. \n\nAppetizer - We tried the fried green tomato BLT. I'm a Mississippi girl so you know I've had my share of fried green tomatoes. This appetizer definitely had its own twist. It was smoked pork belly, tomato jam, frisée, pimento cheese with pickled lemon vinaigrette. That was a unique mixture, but I truly enjoyed this appetizer. \n\nBeverage - The Southern Peach cocktail was befitting with the comfort foods. It contained Old Forester 86, Aperol, fresh lemon & thyme with white peach purée and sweet tea. To top it off it was served in a mason jar with a 1 1\/4 block of ice. This just took me right back to my hometown. \n\nEntree - The shrimp and grits had roasted tomatoes, Virginia ham, nora mill grits in a chicken base gravy. Spoon licking good! \n\nDessert - We did not have room for dessert, but we tried the butterscotch cake anyway. Talking about hurting yourself. This cake had bacon frosting, butterscotch sauce, toasted pecans and bourbon ice cream. The sweet and salty was a perfect combination. \n\nYardbird, you're alright with me!
