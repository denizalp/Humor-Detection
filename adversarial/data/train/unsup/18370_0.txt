Came here for date night. The line was rather long out the door but I expected that since it was Friday night. We wanted something small so we order one scoop of whiskey almond ice cream with toasted fluff on top. I like the homemade marshmallow fluff. It wasn't too sweet and they gave a generous amount so I felt that every bite of ice cream had some fluff with it. The whiskey almond ice cream had a predominantly sweet whiskey flavor with slivers of almonds in it. I liked the texture the slivers gave it. I'm glad I ordered this flavor of ice cream to try it but I'm not sure I would ever order it ever again. I probably should have just tried a sample of it and ordered something a little more to my liking such as the Vietnamese coffee or Venetian vanilla. There was no seating so we ended up going back to our truck in the parking lot and sitting on the tail gate. I actually had fun eating it there.
