An average review for an average Walgreen's. They have the same stock you'd expect from most convenience store\/pharmacy outfits, down to the discount umbrellas and cheap toy aisle. The staff isn't unpleasant, but neither are they overly engaging and sometimes they'll just pass on by when someone's looking confused or searching for something.\nThey're always willing to help when you ask, or whenever you manage to find someone to query, but they don't take the initiative in their customer service and that's what would set this location apart from others.
