We have been to Tuscany many times to stay and play since they opened.\n\nOf course we had to try every restaurant here as well. \n\nOver the years this was one of our favorite Mexican restaurants and have come in just to eat here.\n\nWhen you are seated to start they bring you salsa and bean dip with chips, these both have to be the best in town, and they never mind refilling them for you and believe me you can make a meal just out of these! \n\nI always love the Chicken fajitas. They are so good here.Just the taste and flavor are better than other places we have tried.  My husband gets the beef burritos. He loves how big they are and always gets extra sauce on his. \nWhen our Son has been with us he orders the fish tacos they are really good .\n\nService has always been pretty good. Always seated right away and food is consistent.\nWe did have a favorite waiter who was always on top of everything but he went to another casino further away. The margaritas are good too.\n\nWorth checking out if your looking for not only a good Mexican restaurant and not bad on prices but you get your moneys worth.
