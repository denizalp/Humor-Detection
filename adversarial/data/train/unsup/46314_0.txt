If you're looking for a cheap chinese food fix for lunch, this place should do the trick. The menu is fairly simple, you pick a protein, sauce and a side (wings or egg roll). The food comes out quickly and again, it's a cheap fix so don't expect anything mind blowing but you will get a quick, cheap and solid meal.
