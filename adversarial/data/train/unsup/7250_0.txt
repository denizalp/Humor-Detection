Regal Downtown Summerlin is one of my favorite places to watch a movie in comfort.  Back in the day, like 4 years ago, only the Galaxy Theaters had the luxury reclining seats. Now, there's multiple theaters in Las Vegas with the comfort of these seats. What makes Summerlin's regal great is the convenience of being located in Downtown Summerlin, the huge reserved seating, and the ability to purchase your ticket online.  The theater is also proudly serves Starbucks and alcohol. Expect to pay a little more to watch a movie here, but it's worth it.
