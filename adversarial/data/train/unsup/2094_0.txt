That's it.  Finally, I'm done counting: 4371 hues of browns, greens, greys.  If you get a different number, please IM me.  ;-)  Just a few miles west of Summerlin (and past the Red Rock Hotel), you will enter into something so non-Vegas -- a bona-fide breathtaking place.  Upon arrival, Kodak moments are in your future.\n\nIt's the place I miss most from when I lived in Vegas.  In just minutes, you can easily get away from all the big lights and noise...and be transcended into a place of serenity and beauty, with an overwhelming sense of enormity and awe.  Does that sound like something you're not going to go to?\n\nIn the summer months, it's often 5-10 degrees cooler than the strip...and in the winter, it gets a good amount of snow to cap off (and sometimes more), making it look like the Switzerland alps (okay, slight exaggeration!).\n\nHighly recommend this 13 miles of driving, or biking, or for places to hike or climb -- there are tons of trails.  There is a small fee when entering into the park (per vehicle)...and annual passes are also available.
