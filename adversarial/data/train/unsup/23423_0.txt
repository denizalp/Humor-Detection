I gotta grab me some Culver's whenever I have a chance. It reminds me of Wisconsin...and growing up there. Having a treat at Culver's was a big deal.\n\nI stopped at this location on my way back to San Diego. Not a bad location. Near an off ramp.\n\nThe day that we stopped in the grill was not working so no butter burgers to be had. I wasn't too upset. After all, I was able to have my vanilla custard turtle sundae.\n\nThis is not your typical sundae made with vanilla ice cream, it is made with rich frozen custard. After eating one, you could simply die happy and in a food coma.\n\nThis location was also pretty clean, to the point that it felt like the floor had been just waxed and a bit slipe n slide like.
