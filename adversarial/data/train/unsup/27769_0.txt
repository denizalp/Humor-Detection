My boyfriend and I went to sit down and enjoy a dessert but it wasn't until after we had ordered everything that she said they were about to close..so we had to eat it outside on a cold day. Not cool.\n\nI got chocolate chip cookies which were okay but more buttery than I'd have liked. He got a raspberry crumble-ish tart that was pretty good. The croissants are supposed to be amazing, but I didn't have the best first experience, so I'll try Thobor's next time.
