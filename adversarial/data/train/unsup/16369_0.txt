OK time for an update, because I gave them one more chance.  Here is what they did this time:\n\n1) I paid extra to have them change the oil. They overfilled the oil past the full mark on the dipstick, I took it back to show them, they told me it was normal. Really? So Toyota dealers always overfill your oil past the full mark?\n\n2) They claimed to have rotated the tires. I checked and they did not rotate the tires. I took it back, they said sometimes they look at the tires and find they don't need to be rotated. yet...on the service invoice they clearly note that they rotated the tires.\n\n3) They claim to have done a \"Toyota multipoint inspection\", which includes a fluid level check. Yet, soon after my car displayed a windshield wiper fluid level low warning and I had to fill it up.\n\nShaking my head...
