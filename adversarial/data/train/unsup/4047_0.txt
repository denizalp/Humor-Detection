I was totally new to the ecig world, and the owners of Butt Out went to great lengths to make sure I had the right equipment and knew exactly how to use it. The environment of the shop is very inviting and they always encourage you to hang out. I haven't had any experience with other ecig stores, but it's not hard to see that these guys are doing it right and really care about the customers.
