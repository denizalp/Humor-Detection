The worst customer service ever! The worst manager on duty! The food was good and staff were very nice. We had a reservation at 9:30, we went for 9:30, they asked us to have a sit in their lounge for another 30 minutes. Everything was awful! McDonald has better management! The guy on duty was the worst manager, his name was Jeremy! AwFUL!
