We had a major restoration project in store after a slow leak was discovered in our bathroom, with water seeping into surrounding rooms. The water damage was pretty extensive. We initially got a quote from another company, but they were extremely pushy about filing an insurance claim. I had my reasons not to file one, but they weren't listening.\n\nEventually, I started looking for other quotes. ASAP responded within five minutes, and the owner Josh called me. The contrast between him and the other company was night and day. He was very straightforward and honest with me, and was very willing to work with me. Within an hour, he had someone out to do an estimate (at 10:30 PM). The next morning, a crew was out at my house removing the water and mold, and they moved quickly and efficiently. The drywall crew that followed was incredible. They had a pretty big project on their hands, but handled it with ease, and went above and beyond to make sure our house was in top shape. \n\nFrom start to finish, the whole process was very smooth, communication was top notch, and the cost was affordable. Dan, who was overseeing the project, was awesome. He came out multiple times to check on the job and was very communicative and straightforward. I highly recommend these guys and will certainly use them again if I have another problem in the future.
