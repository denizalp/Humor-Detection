I checked this place out based on a FaceBook friends suggestion.\n\nTOTAL PRICE (before tip) = $20.54\nWHAT I ORDERED: Large Jerk Chicken Plate... which includes... (1) breast (1) leg (1) thigh (1) plantain + cabbage and carrots + Ginger Beer + (1) Beef Patty\n\nThe place is small and cheap looking. This was my first time going here. There was an old Jamaican dude sitting by the front door wearing a chef's apron so I assumed he was one of the cooks. Now, usually when I enter a restaurant I am greeted with a hello and a smile, but this guy just gave me a mean mugg with that \"What the hell is this white boy doing here?\" look. It's a good thing people like that don't discourage me from eating.\n\nI was finally greeted by a Jamaican female that runs the place (I guess) and she was much nicer.\n\nThe tables have that super cheap plastic place mat that has that old plastic smell just like my grandma had in the 80s\/90s LOL.\n\nThe food was decent but to be TOTALLY honest, not only have I had better Jamaican food elsewhere, I've actually MADE better Jamaican food myself. The chicken was somewhat dry and the jerk sauce wasn't anything to write home about. The cabbage was barely cooked and I was expecting super soft buttery texture cabbage. The plantain was surprisingly good\n\nI originally wanted a \"champagne cola\" after seeing it here on yelp but they were out of it... disappointed... so I ordered a ginger beer... although the ginger beer was the original ginger beer from Jamaica, I've had REED'S ginger beer and it's better.\n\nI think that's the MAIN POINT HERE. Although everything is authentic Jamaican, you can get better tasting Jamaican food elsewhere (including the grocery store) and it would be much cheaper.
