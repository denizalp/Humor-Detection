Easy Choice for Quick Chinese\n\nDropped in due to proximity to Banner Estrella.  Good little place for fast Chinese food.  It's not the authentic stuff Ma cooks, but still good.  There are the usual compromises between Asian and North American pallets-- more oil, less cooking with spicy peppers, and the light seasonings are lost in the salt and sugar.  \n\nStaff is quick with the takeout orders and very nice.  Affordable lunch specials, too.  I would go again.
