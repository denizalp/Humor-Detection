They are the best. We were moving across the country and needed to board our cat until we arrived in Las Vegas.  Everything was handled over the phone and the staff went out of their way to accommodate us.  Sarah even sent pictures of our cat! Made me feel so relieved. Very kind, caring and warm staff :)
