Ok... They changed there name... Ok we all liked the old name. \nBut really 1-2 stars for Eos Fitness? and 3 Stars for Golds Gym? Its the same gym, same personnel and same problems here. \nWhen I joined in December last year it wasn't really busy, now its getting busier, they do need to address some of their equipment issues.\nThe service is ok.\nI need to exercise, its close to my house, the price is right, so I keep on coming here!
