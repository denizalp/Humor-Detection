So my wife and I go in because of the reviews and we like to support local business. Sadly the gentleman behind the counter was an asshole and did not have to treat us the way he did. Wife comes in and asks to mail out some gifts for Xmas and he puts them in a box rings her up for a ridiculously high price so she asks him if he can buy the boxes instead and he proceeds to dump out all the gifts on the counter and tells her no! I mean what kind of customer service is that? A simple no would have sufficed but to toss my gifts on the counter (some were fragile) and to treat us in such a manner? It's ok karma comes around my friend thank you and hope all who think about coming here think twice. Would give him a zero if I could.
