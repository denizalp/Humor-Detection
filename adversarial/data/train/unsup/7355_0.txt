there is hope for club goers who want to check out Marquee and dont have a vegas promoter contact and are too late in buying pre-sale tix! \n\nme and justin b. were in this exact predicament over the weekend since we decided last minute to join our other friends at Marquee that evening. we strolled by Marquee in the afternoon and there was a kiosk at the DayClub check-in area with discount flyers (legit ones from the club itself). talked to some of the DayClub bouncers who were working who also verified that they were valid. showed up to the club at 930pm which is the same exact time my friends were told to show up to meet their promoter contact...with the flyer i got in for free (general admission for ladies was $20) and Justin B. got in for $45 (discounted from $50). no hassle, no fuss, no stupid lines and no planning ahead was necessary for a good time at Marquee haha
