This was always my \"go-to\" when I used to work around the mall eons ago. So it was a no brainer to choose Fit for Life -- I love a fast lunch that's still healthy yet fresh. Opted for the Pepper Steak on Basmati Rice Signature Box but when the lone lady at the counter had to turn around to glance at the sign to check and recheck what goes in the dish, I started to worry about my choice of establishment.\n\nAll in all it was a pretty satisfying meal except for the fact that it WASN'T fluffy Basmati Rice but some other type of white long grain rice that looked par boiled. If not for that major oversight, I'd have given it 4 stars. Oh yeah, and the fact that the lady only greeted me with barely an audible \"hello\" AFTER I greeted her first.
