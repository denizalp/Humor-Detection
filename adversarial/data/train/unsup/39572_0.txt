The worst thing about this place is that I didn't discover it sooner! There are SOOOOO many awesome options that it's hard to choose. BEWARE! the portions are huge.\nI've personally LOVED the:\nChorizo potato (9\/10)\n -I had to add a little Sriracha, I like it hot!\nMom's meatloaf (10\/10)\n -I can't say enough, this thing is AMAZING\nPurple Parma (8\/10)\n -I would liked to have seen more eggplant in this one.\nI had one with kielbasa and saurkraut, I believe it was a special of the month that was fantastic.\nI highly recommend going here, unless you're on a diet or lactose intolerant.\nIf you are, I still recommend you go, just to soak in the smells, sights and temptation!
