Huge screw in my tire, made a loud clacking noise when I drove. I called ahead to see if they were busy, and was told it would be a 30 minute wait. After I arrived they had my tire patched and me out the door in 45 minutes. Large waiting room, comfortable chairs, free coffee and wifi. Good solid patch, no leaks from the tire.
