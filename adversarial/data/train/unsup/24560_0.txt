Giovanni Mauro is a man with passion for his pizza, and you know Las Vegas is very fortunate to have him when he has followers from New York, Philly, and California wishing that he was closer to them....If you read the other reviews, I'm just the second Yelp Las Vegas reviewer....\n\nI am pretty sure many of you have already tasted Chef Gio's cooking already but don't even know it...Does\nNora's\/Nora's Wine Bar ring a bell??? Yes, Chef Gio is Nora's son, and we were very surprised he recognized us from our few visits to Nora's(Crazy Alfredo....YUM!!!!)\n\nYou can get Pasta, Salads. Paninis and Appetizers here, but  to come here and not order a pizza is a crime!\n\nHis pizzas come in 3 sizes-Large(14\"), XL(18\"), and OMG!(24\") He has a few speciality pizzas, or you can customize your own. We got a  half classic combo, and half pork rules pizza(see pictures of menu items ) which was absolutely delicious! You can even chat with Gio as he makes your pizza right in front of you. He makes his pizzas the old school way by not using any commercial yeast in his dough,( it's better for you, easier to digest, and you don't feel bloated after eating his pizzas) and it goes through a 36-hour natural leavening process before it is ready. When he's out, he's out, and you have to come back another time.\n\nAnother thing to save room for is his desserts. Cannolis($1.99 each or 3 for $5)\nCrisp, light , delicate, and the ricotta filling has the perfect sweetness.(\"better than my mom's\", Gio says) he also makes gelato when he has the time, and we couldn't have come at a better time. His flavor of the day? Nutella :) at $.75\/ounce or $1.90 a scoop, it was definitely worth the calories! Unfortunately, they ran out of tiramisu, but\nthat's a good reason for a return visit!\n\nBefore you go:\n\nOld School Pizzeria is located acroos the Cannery Casino, next to the Metro PCS Store, cross streets are Craig and Lawrence\n\nCash Only....\n\nThank you Gio and Diego, we will definitely be back....ALOHA!!!\n\n\nYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(116\/365) \"Old School Pie\"
