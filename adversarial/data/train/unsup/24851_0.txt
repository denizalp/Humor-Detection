My friend and I stopped by Botero for dinner one night after weeks of listening to our friends rave about the food and service here. Not really expecting the experience to be as good as they claimed, we were actually amazed by the quality of the food. After stepping one foot in the door, we immediately became entranced with the stunning array of sculptures, paintings, and leather chairs. \nJuicy steaks with an awesome flavor top my list of must-haves, but I have to make a point to tell you to also try the truffle mac and cheese. \nOut of this world!
