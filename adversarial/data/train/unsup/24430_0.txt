This is for BlueGreen Vacations Timeshare Sales Presentation Offers, I am NOT an owner with this company.\n\nExtremely Disappointed. I'm the type of person that expects what is described to me to be provided. And this is your usual \"say what I need to say to make a sale\" experience. In a nutshell, I was told \"Pay $150 and get 3 nights in Vegas and a 5 day cruise\", just listen to their sales presentation in return. Sweet! I paid the $150. Got $75 back in gift cards, so I'm only down $75 and off to Vegas we go! Seemed fair.\n\nWe picked to stay at the Tropicana: Room fees $150 for the weekend, so now I'm $225 in the hole.\n\nPresentation: they asked me to pay $53,000 for a vacation package! LMAO! Yeah right! Plus $3,600\/year in maintenance fees! I can't believe they mustered up the sack to ask me to invest $73,000 for 5 years of vacations, 2 weeks per year on their time!!! LMFAO!!!! I think I can probably do a better job finding deals on my own, Thank You! They went as low as asking for $795 for 5 days in Timbucktoo!\n\nThe \"Free\" Cruise: We received a voucher for 2 and our option is a 4 day Baja Mexico Cruise. I just got off the phone attempting to redeem this \"FREE\" cruise that will end up costing me a total of $685 for a room with a twin bed!!! Wheres the free part??? LOL! I understand paying port fees and taxes, but come on!!!\n\nWhile I was on the phone with the \"Travel Agent\" from \"Vacation Tour & Travel Agency\", I checked out Carnival Cruise lines rates online and found better all inclusive accommodations for a total of $685, port fees and taxes included!!! This is before I apply my personal discounts! What a joke!!!\n\nWhat a load of crap! I think I'll be contacting my credit card provider and asking for my fraud protection to kick in.\n\nThanks but no thanks BlueGreen. You shouldn't have your agents put down the Wyndham Organization when your company is doing \"THE SAME THING\" they are.\n\nShame on you.
