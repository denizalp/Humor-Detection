This Leslie's location is by far the best in town, ignore the reviews from years ago, they now have all new staff that are very knowledgeable and greatly courteous. The store manager Anthony seems too know everything you need to know about pools, he was extremely helpful and got my pool looking absolutely perfect with his chemical recommendations. I will tell anyone with a pool to go to this specific Leslie's location
