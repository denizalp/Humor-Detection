Picking a Vegas resort is a tricky business.  You want really nice (Bellagio\/Wynn) but you don't want to REALLY pay for it.  So you surf around for deals and such.\n\nIf you're new to Vegas, you might find the Monte Carlo awesome.   In isolation to itself.  I mean, compared to a Hampton Inn, it's absolutely big and beautiful, right?  \n\nBut compared to other similar casinos on the strip, it's merely another boomerang from above shaped three tower hotel.  The Mirage has dolphins and greenery, and Treasure Island has some kind of pirate\/slutty theme, but the Monte Carlo is just --\n\n-- the Monte Carlo.  \n\nIt lacks that WOW factor.  It lacks a Cirque show like its sister MGM properties.  It used to have Lance Burton, who I thought was a highway billboard joke until I finally saw his great show and realized he one of the few reasons left to make the Monte Carlo a destination.  And Lance is gone now.\n\nMy one night at the Monte Carlo was memorable enough to ensure I'd never return.  No nightmare, really, just two simple things that went really wrong:\n\n1.  The toilets are UNBELIEVABLY loud.  I don't care about that in my room so much, but early in the morning I heard every last toilet in the place flush.  Silly me, I wanted to sleep past 6 AM.  It was a God awful issue and something that never replicated in the Mirage and Caesars.  Little sleep = ruined vacation day.  Is it really worth saving $50 or so a night for that?\n\n2.  It took almost 40 minutes for the valet to retrieve our car.  And not just our car.  Everyone was standing around -- freezing to death -- waiting for their cars.  Why?\n\nAnd so, as always in Vegas, cheaper rates result in cheaper services.  When I walk through this hotel, I notice lots of cheap eats.  The good side is that you're not paying a fortune to eat.  The bad news is that it's McFood which you can eat anywhere... and so why come all the way to Vegas for a McRib?\n\nThe Monte Carlo -- in a nutshell --  is an affordable McResort.
