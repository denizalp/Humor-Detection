I've been sitting here for 45 minutes and I still don't have my food yet. Ordered the freshly squeezed orange juice, but it's totally Tropicana. Can't review the food yet since I haven't received my food. Atmosphere is nice and cozy. There are couches in the back. I guess this place would be better for a drink than brunch since the kitchen clearly can't keep up with the orders. Server assured us once that our food is coming....but it hasn't. We didn't make any substitutions to our order which would cause a delay. Perhaps they're still getting the chicken to hatch the eggs I ordered?
