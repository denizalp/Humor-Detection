TL;DR: Great food, great beer, and a party in the bathroom... Perfect night out!\n\nI've gone 4 times in the first two months of this unique joint and can't wait for #5. \n\nThe Doners are flavorful with great spices and a nice thick bread. Beats a shawarma any day of the week!\n\nThe beer is the perfect compliment to the german style meal and experience. Love how I can get a quick bite and brew in a fantastic neighbourhood at any time of day. \n\nOh... If you need a pick me up - check out the bathroom. Hit the button!!!
