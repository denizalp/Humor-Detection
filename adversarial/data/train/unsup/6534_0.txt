What is the tell tale sign of a good restaurant? When all of the cooks are hispanic. Now I'm not trying to be offensive or anything so my apologies. It's just from my experience, all of the great Asian restaurants back home on Ca had hispanic cooks! \n\nFor $6 and some change, you can get some great noodles. Fulfilling toppings and a great broth in which I usually slurp down like a 24oz Fat Tire. #1 comes with dumplings, shrimp and chicken. Now I'm not one to complain, but the chicken is always kinda stale and dry. You do get a lot though!\n\nService is always friendly, fast and accurate. Not only are they cheap, but the rice dishes can even be accompanied with a medley of veggies. Not that pick one veggie and sweet carrot business!
