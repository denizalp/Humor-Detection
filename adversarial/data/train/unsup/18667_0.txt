Murrieta's is and probably will always be one of my favorite restaurants. I had the privilege at my previous job to dine here quite often so I've been able to try pretty much their entire menu :)\n\nA few colleagues and I headed here for an early lunch on a sunny day and got to sit on their patio that overlooks Stephen Ave. I've actually never sat on the patio before so I was excited to people watch and enjoy some delicious food.\n\nI went with my favorite - Scallop and Prawn fettuccini without chorizo. The garlic butter sauce is sprinkled with fresh grated parmesan and red chilies to give it a nice kick. And the scallops and prawns are cooked perfectly as are the noodles.\n\nThe hustle and bustle of the lunch crowd down Stephen Ave is really fun to watch and being able to see from a different angle was awesome. Since the patio is narrow, you're sitting like you would at a bar so if it works well if you're with another person or two but it's probably not ideal for a big group. \n\nAnother tip - since you're sitting up higher and the railing doesn't provide much shielding so be careful if you're wearing a dress\/skirt or else you'll give the people below a glimpse of your underoos lol
