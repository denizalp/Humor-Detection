Dang.\n\nFresco's just made my heart smile. DOUBLE CRISPY. Just do it. Everything in life should be double crispy. Haddock is $10.95 and comes with chips but for just $2 more you can poutine that sh*t. Awww yeah.\n\nI did the lobster poboy- $7.95. I'm from New Orleans and a complete a**hole about poboys. If I was being my jerk self, I'd say... y'all, this isn't a poboy... it's not dressed correctly and the bread isn't authentic. If I was being real, I'd say that's one tasty sandwich. I could have handled a little more zip in the chipotle mayo though. Also, $8 for a lobster sandwich? That's a bargain right thurr.\n\nGreat service. Delicious food. Tasty to the max.
