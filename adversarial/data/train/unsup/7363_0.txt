I arrived at McCarran Airport for an early morning flight, and was drawn in by the amazing smell of this Cinnabon which is located in the gate area just after one gets off the monorail and comes up the escalators.\n\nWhile I'm usually a fan of Cinnabon (but not necessarily the calories or the sticky fingers that need to be washed immediately after eating them), I ordered the Cinnabon bites here and it seemed they may have been drying out under the heat lamps a bit too long, because rather than nice and chewy and gooey as they normally are, the bites I got here were rather dry and the outside edges of the dough was actually crunchy, which was something I'd never experienced before at any Cinnabon location.  \n\n6 mini buns and a bottle of milk priced out at $8.30.
