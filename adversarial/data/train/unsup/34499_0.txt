The Beatles Love - Cirque du Soleil in The Mirage is a must see and hear!  Enjoyed all of the performers.  Lots of different performances happening at the same time.  All of the Beatles songs rocked!\n\nHelpful info:  The theater is in the round.  Don't pay attention to the ceiling to floor net dividers they will go away in the first 30 seconds of the show.  There are no bad seats in the theater.
