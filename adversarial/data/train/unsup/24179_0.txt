The service and food was excellent. I would definitely come back here. \n\nI ordered the chasu ramen XL to share with my girl. I'm glad they don't charge extra for sharing. The broth was great but of course I added my ginger, garlic and pepper. The broth was great but of course here I go again in comparing my Santouka to Ramen Sora. OK stop that! \n\nNow for Ramen Sora it's not bad for Vegas but I actually like Monta better than Ramen Sora. Sorry Sora but their broth is better. You will be the place when Monta is packed or closed.
