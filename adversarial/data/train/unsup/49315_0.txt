Mori helped save me $$ by fabricating a new clip for my back power window. If I bought a new part it would have cost a couple Benjamin's. He rewired the old piece. I also asked him questions about what would be the best suv to buy next. Usually car guys don't like to answer questions but he was very helpful.  They even washed my car for me!! Will be back for more car service & advice. Thank you so much!
