At around $40 Dollars for Brunch, I was expecting a really great situation when it came to food quality. The Aria Buffet did not let me down. They had many different stations that included LATIN, and ASIAN and and AMERICAN.. haha.. and some Mediterranean style dishes and salads too. There was a fantastic salad station which had a Waldorf Sald when I visited .. I like Waldorf Salad.. and a really nice dessert bar that included a rotating Gelato bar. \n\nIn addition, since it was Brunch,. they had chicken and waffles, biscuits and gravy, pancakes to order..hashed potatoes and eggs.  I'm a sucker for Breakfast. I Brake for good brunch. I could have my chicken and waffles with eggs, Chinese-Style steamed buns and Mimosa! \n\nPretty excellent and I would go again if given the chance. In a sea of buffets and all you can eateries ..thie ARIA Buffet stands out for me! Happy Eating!
