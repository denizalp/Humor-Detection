I went to get pierced there at the end of the day with two of my friends. We were not necessarily expecting getting pierced that day and we wouldn't have minded coming another day if it was too late in the day. The piercer (the owner, Yan Del X) agreed to still take us. He was extremely rude and rushed us through the whole process, even though we were all pretty nervous, but we weren't acting obnoxious. \n\nAs soon as he agreed to pierce us he told us to hurry up and take off our shirts for the piercing. We felt kind of weird being rushed but understood because it was the end of the day. We did as he told us and hurried up. During the positioning of the piercing, he was complaining about how he was late to go meet his girlfriend for an event, and that now he had to pierce three girls. I thought that was extremely unprofessional and rude, especially since we made him a quick last minute 300$. Also, I now have a crooked nipple piercing, probably because he was too much of a hurry to give a damn.\n\nI will never go back to that place and neither will my friends. I guess he thought it was fine to be rude to us since we looked like young naive teenagers, but I feel like every customer should be valued and felt welcome, especially in a nerve-wracking situation.
