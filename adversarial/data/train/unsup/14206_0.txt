It was a very hungry Sunday Evening. We were on the look out for a very good Indian Restaurant to complete our Trip at the Vegas. I've been to this place multiple number of times every time I visit Vegas. This place is located on the strip in the same complex as Chili's. Finding this place could be very challenging since there are no proper direction boards when we look from the strip. You need to step inside the plaza and keep walking to the escalators to reach here. Parking is charged which can be waived of if we show the Bill. The outside of this place looks very dull and no proper lights. \n\nAs we reached this place we were greeted by a staff named \"Kumar\" whom I've seen for about 3 or 4 years at place now. The inside of the restaurant needs some more lights. The menu is quite good. We ordered for Samosa chat, Ashoka, Chicken kabab, Chicken Curry and a Lamb side and some Lime juice. They did not make us wait for the food for long. I must say that every single item tasted really good. The meat was perfectly cooked and well served. \n\nEven the lime juice was really good that we ordered for more. The Price of the dishes were a little on the higher side but we got a 10% discount for our Yelp check-in. Thank you Yelp :) \nTo summarize, I would say that this place is worth the visit since the restaurant did not disappoint us with the taste of their food. I will definitely visit the next time I visit Vegas.
