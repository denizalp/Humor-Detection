In my opinion, even the world's greatest food cannot offset terrible service. \n\nSo, imagine how I felt when terrible service is combined with pricey mediocre food.\n\nFrom the moment we walked through the door to the moment we left the restaurant, we were made to feel very unwelcome, almost as if we were being intrusive. And that feeling began even before I showed our server a gift certificate I got from a work raffle.\n\nOur server didn't bother doing a quality check for any of our dishes. Although for our mains, I saw that he thought about doing one, but then decided not to. We were not asked if we wanted to order any more drinks. Nobody said thank you when we left the restaurant.\n\nI hope that doesn't make me sound picky and whiny. I don't always expect above-and-beyond service whenever I dine out (although that would be nice), but I do expect standard service with a side of friendliness. We definitely did not receive that at PROP.\n\nFinally, given the name of the restaurant and the prices, I was very surprised that they didn't serve fresh pasta.
