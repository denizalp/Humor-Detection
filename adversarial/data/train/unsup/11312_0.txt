Le Reve is a phenomenal show!  \n\nThe performance blended aerial stunts with high diving with synchronized swimming with acrobatics.  There were performers coming up from under the water, down from the ceiling and up and down stairs and platforms.  \n\nEvery section has equal view, as all the seats circle around the stage, and the performers are on all sides.  However, two of the staff at Wynn, in separate conversations, had mentioned row G was the best, as you are in the middle of everything above and below you (that was where we ended up sitting, and it was perfect)\n\nThey sell this package deal where you can sit in recliners, and get champagne and truffles...but upon seeing the venue, it really didn't seem worth the extra money to sit in those seats.  They are all the way up, so you are looking down on the whole show, vs the feeling of submersion with the regular seats.
