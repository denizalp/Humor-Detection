I have lived in Charlotte 11 years now and yesterday was the first time I stopped by to see Vic. Friends have been raving about Chili Man for years so I am not sure what took me so long. I had a life changer and the frito pie dog, both were delicious. I have to make up for lost time so I am headed back today...
