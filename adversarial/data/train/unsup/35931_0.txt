LOVE this place! I purchased a groupon in August 2014 for full lash extensions, and I'm just now getting around to writing a review on my experience because I never forgot about it. It was my first time getting eyelash extensions done, so naturally I was a bit nervous. However, the girl who did my extensions (I forgot her name as it has been awhile) was so calm and professional and put me at ease right away. When I explained to her the look I wanted to achieve she communicated with me until we were both on the same page. I am getting around to writing this review now because I have never forgotten how beautiful my lashes looked from here! I moved out of the state of AZ and have had my lashes done again a couple times...and they've never compared to those that I had done at Beautiful Skin and Nails! Each time since then that I've had my lashes done they've looked good, but nothing like how they looked when I got them done here! Seriously, unbelievably beautiful! I received so many compliments and people couldn't tell that they were fake. They would say things like, \"wow! your eyes look so pretty!\" I live in Southern California now and seriously contemplate driving over to Phoenix just to have my lashes done again here because no other place has compared so far!! Thank you Beautiful Skin and Nails! Keep doing what you're doing!
