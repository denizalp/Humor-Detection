A cheap shit-hole in the middle of the strip with the shittiest customer service I have ever had.\n\nNow where should I begin?\n\nMade our reservations through tripres.com (first mistake... but that's another story)\nSo I get to the desk and they \"don't have any reservations under my name\"  I check my friends name and they \"go look in back\".  I was then informed that TripRes never sent over our reservation (They sure did take the money ahead of time though).\n\nSo basically I tell the lady to make a new reservation which was better because they gave me a rate of $34.95 per night rather than the $57 I paid through Trip Res.\n\nWell, I go to check out the next day and we asked for documentation that showed that Trip Res never sent over the reservation.  We were going to fight the charge that Trip Res already billed us for, and take the cheaper rate.  Apparently this was a major problem for the hotel.  They would not and \"could not\" provide us with this information.  We were also told that as of that moment, our Trip Res reservations were still lost and there was nothing we could do about it.\n\nWe asked to speak to a manager which was the biggest joke ever.  She proceeded to yell at us and wave papers in our face.  She told us that suddenly the reservations \"magically appeared\" and we now had to pay the full price.  We were PISSED.  What really happened is they canceled our room's cheaper rate and charged us for the higher rate.  They then refused to give us the cheaper rate.  We asked to speak to a higher manager who was \"in a meeting\".  \n\nAfter fighting with them for over 45 minutes, we left, obviously pissed off.  Haven't they ever heard of \"the customer is always right\"??  and to do something dirty like give us a room at almost half the rate, then go and re-charge us, after check out, the higher rate?!?!?!?\n\nWe called the \"higher manager\" later that day and she was just as big of an asshole as the first idiot lady.\n\nAt the end of the day, it was rude and horrible customer service.  How can you do that to a customer?  I have never experienced such shitty service in my life.\n\nIt wish it would have been a good experience so I could have a cheap place to staying the middle of the strip for future trips.\n\nThe highlight of the stay, my friend told the manager she was an idiot to her face.  She just looked at him and walked away.  Classic!
