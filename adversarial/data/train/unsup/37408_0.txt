Books, magazines, comic books, action figures and board games at a great price! A lot of the things they sell is used but still good. I can see myself buying many books from here in the near future. All paperbacks are half the publisher's price. This place reminds me of Strand in New York. I like it and will be coming back. I think I might start reading again thanks to this store. They also sell old school video games (mostly pc and handheld stuff), music and DVD's. Magazines are only a dollar if they are over a month old. Books average from $2 to $8 dollars.
