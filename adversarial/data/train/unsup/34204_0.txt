Oh Cosi.  Things used to be great between us.  It has been two years since I have eaten there.  In that time, the prices have completely skyrocketed.  The same flat bread that was a little over $6 in downtown Chicago has peaked to over $8 with tax.  That is disheartening.  Yes, I know this location can not help that but it felt dirty to pay that.  \n\nThe menu is right at the entrance so it gets REALLY congested when you do not know whether people are in line or just reading the menu.  The place is loud so it is hard to hear someone calling you down to their register.  The whole front area is really thrown together.  \n\nI appreciate their effort but the layout of this restaurant makes you feel tense and shoved in to a small place. Like a little sausage.  \n\nI do LOVE that the quality has not changed.  I ordered the chicken TBM (tomato basil mozzarella) and let me tell you, it was delicious.  Get it hot, otherwise your cheese does not melt.  I usually order the whole wheat bread and it is absolutely noteworthy.  It is hearthy without being too hard and since I am eating fresh mozz, well I like to pretend the whole wheat evens it out.  \n\nThey are generous with the mozzarella slices and the basil spread you get, wow.  YUM!  Beware, if you do not like basil.  Stay away.  Cosi has very rich flavors.  If you see something on the menu and think, oh it is just something small, I will pick it off.  Nope.  It is a taste explosion in your mouth.  Just avoid that flatbread.
