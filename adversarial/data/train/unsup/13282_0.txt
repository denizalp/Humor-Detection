I am SO glad I gave Sprinkles another chance.\nNot being wowed by their original Beverly Hills location  avoided them for the last few years but kept wanting to try their ice cream.\nA new addition to the Vegas Strip, The Linq, which reminds me a bit of LA anyways, had a Sprinkles location both for cupcakes AND ice cream!\nPerfect timing in the middle of the afternoon \n(though Vegas is always hot and you can eat ice cream any time of day)\nA few customers in the cupcake side, no one at the ice cream counter.\nTONS of flavors, most rotate daily, we had about 20 to chose from.\nSo many great sounding flavors, the usual pig in my would have wanted to sample them all.\nI went with a sample of the only sorbet, strawberry, and was SOLD!\nTHAT good, SO refreshing, simply perfect.\nI came for the red velvet waffle cone but wound up \"needing\" a cupcake sundae.\nChose a cupcake, they split and fill with ice cream.\nWent with the red velvet and was in love!\nSo fresh, soft, moist, everything a cupcake should be.\nThe cream cheese frosting had way too much sugar, not my fav, but I am now finally convinced that it is not just hype, Sprinkles really makes some great cupcakes and I will be back for more of that ice cream!
