So I found the most amazing tennis shoes here that I absolutely fell in love with.  New trendy neony colors, they were comfy and light and fun. I was ready for the gym...when suddenly the fabric started growing these funky little splinters which poked my ankle like something awful?!  WTH?\n\nTook them back and exhanged them with no problem for another pair...and of course the new pair started having the same problem...boo-hoo and sad me had to return them.  \n\nLuckily they offered wonderful service and were apologetic and as confused as I was for this defective product. \n\nI got a full refund and now I'm off looking for another pair of shoes...very sad and hopefully will find another pair somewhere!
