Ugh, okay...so after a few more times over and over my official rating is 3.5 stars. Customer service is always friendly and great, but I'm realizing while they are another option 4 stars was putting the pedestal and I have to apologize because while I still think their food as good...it is no longer that 4 star spark. It regressed back to the original rating and experience. However, I'd still recommend them as another option if you're sick of Robertos.
