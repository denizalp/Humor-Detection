This place has so much promise, I need to come back and try it again!  The chips and salsa are spectacular.  The service was quite slow, but the restaurant was also quite busy.  It still took an hour and 15min and all I ordered was a salad.  Don't get the Calamari Salad if it is on special.  I should have known better than to get that at a TexMex restaurant, but lesson learned.  The dressing was very good, but the calamari was over-fried and the cucumbers were mushy and disgusting.  \n\nLong story short, for lunch I had lettuce with good dressing and amazing chips and salsa for $15.  I saw plates of tacos go by that looked and smelled much better than what I was mulling through.  The waitress felt bad though, she could tell I was not enjoying my meal.  As a consolation prize I was hooked up with a delicious white chocolate tamale when I got my bill.  I will be back, I will choose more wisely, and hopefully things will be better!
