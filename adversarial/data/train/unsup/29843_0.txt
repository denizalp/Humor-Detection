The food and coffee were both good and that's half the battle for a breakfast spot! I had the green eggs and spam and I already can't wait to go back to try more. The layout of the restaurant is kind of odd -- the restaurant is small and it feels cramped while you are eating. The servers were both very nice but seemed to lack polish. Everyone has to start somewhere, though, right? Will be back.
