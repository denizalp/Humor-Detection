I went into Nutrishop today to get some protein. JT helped me find exactly what I wanted. He was very knowledgeable of the products and helped me in choosing the best kind of protein for my sensitive stomach. I told him I was getting sick of my BCAAs and he suggested I try a new flavor they just got in and gave me a sample to take home. I really appreciate that he took the time to help me even when there were tons of people in the store. I love coming here because the staff is always really nice and the prices are resonable. They even sell really cool tank tops and T-shirts!
