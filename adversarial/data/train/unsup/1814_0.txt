This ain't no Katz, buttttttt it's prettyy gooooodd. I ordered the Twin Bill with corned beef and pastrami, and they definitely did not skimp out on 'em protein. And I recommend grabbing some mayo and the spicy brown mustard and slather it on your sandwich! Sounds like a weird combo but it made the sandwich even more delicious!\n\nI wish I had the stomach space to try all their other goodies during my visit, but I will definitely be back to try more items if I am in the area! :)
