So, I went here for lunch.  Paid extra to have the large sub combo so I would have leftovers for dinner.  Didn't happen.\n\nI ordered the BLT meal, paid extra to have the larger sub, cost about 9 and a half bucks.  OK if I can make two meals out of it, which was my plan.  This did not happen.  Not too impressed.\n\nNow the bread, 5 stars on that.  Thick and soft, good flavor.  Sadly, that is where the compliments end.  There was three pieces of bacon on the sub.  Three.  9 and a half dollars.  Three pieces of bacon.  9 and a half bucks.  (I am trying to prove a point here)  I am not happy.  It was basically a lettuce sub.  Everyone else I went to lunch with had more meat in their sub than Ron Jeremy has in his pants.  Not mine.\n\nI threw away the second half of my lettuce sub because, well it was a lettuce sub.\n\nThe staff was friendly and service was quick.  Sadly, does not make up for screwing me out of the bacon content of my sub.  The slices of bacon that were evident were small, like the ones you get on a 99 cent menu fast food burger.  \n\nI was told to try something else by my friends if I go back there.  I don't think they will get the chance.\n\nBacon up the BLT.  Until then... Pass.
