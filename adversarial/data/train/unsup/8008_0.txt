Generally when I got to a deli, I expect sandwiches and most likely soup. Here, the sky's the limit with sandwiches, flatbreads, and now even pizzas. But the salads are all super-basic and the soups are limited to two a day, in bizarre flavors like cheese-bacon or boring standbys like chicken and rice. \n\nSandwiches are fine here, fresh with good sauces- I particularly like their fiesta chicken with a chipotle sauce, and give them props for having pesto on more than one single sandwich. \n\nService is friendly, location interior is much nicer than the run-down exterior would suggest- lived down the street for months before I realized it wasn't closed down!
