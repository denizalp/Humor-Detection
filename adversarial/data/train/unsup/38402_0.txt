This was my first time trying an açaí bowl so maybe I just don't know any better, but I assume the smoothie part is supposed to taste like fruit and not just ice? I got the P-bee bowl and the toppings were tasty enough but the overall impact was like eating slightly sweet, slightly crunchy snow slush. (My friends who got berry bowls agreed.) Not necessarily a bad thing except that it cost $9.25. Açaí's aside, this place is cozy and clean, and there are many other tempting options on the menu. Perhaps I'll try again some other time.
