- Although the rather large sign on the window states walk-ins are welcome, a walk-in will be given an appointment and asked to return at a later hour. (Word to the wise: when there is a similar business within a quarter of a mile, you don't let customers walk out the door!)\n- The staff are nice, but they should introduce themselves. I shouldn't have to ask.\n- Not once did someone\/anyone try to tell me about the additional services available.  When I inquired about the cubicles behind the register, I was told what they were and that was it. They didn't ask if I was interested or even the cost of a personal nail kit. \n- People like me go to unwind by enjoying the massage chairs while getting a pedicure. ALL of the chair controls for the massage were removed from the first two sections of the salon.\n- I had an appointment,  yet I sat soaking my feet while my technician did someone's eyebrows.\n- Some of the polishes are either inferior or stretched beyond their usefulness. If I pick a color I like, the tech polishes my nails with it then has to remove it to start over because it's uneven and lumpy. I don't have time for that.\n- Components on several of the chairs were glued permanently in place, so it could not be removed. As a customer,  I shouldn't have heard internal issues. As a customer I'm glad I did because I know gets removed to clean the basin properly.\n\nAll this leads me to find a new shop. I hope an owner reads and investigates this because no matter how the cute the place appears, there are many issues there that impact the customer's experience. Good luck!
