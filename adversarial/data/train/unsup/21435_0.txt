Southwest truly boasts some of the best customer service I have ever experienced.\n\nI recently flew round trip from LAS to MDW this past fall, and the service on the ground as well as in the air was polite, friendly, and efficient.\n\nNOTES:\n\n1.  No hidden fees.  No baggage fees.  \n\n2.  Open seating.\n\n3.  Zone boarding.  \n\n4.  Beverages served on the flight.\n\nmore NOTES:  The check in process at both LAS and MDW was quick and efficient.  We merely presented our IDs to the attendant, he tagged our luggage, printed our boarding passes, and sent us on our way to the security check point and gate.\n\nThe boarding process, much like checking-in, was efficient and organized.  The staff provided passengers with clear instructions on how to proceed, and allowed ample time to line up for their designated zones.  On the plane, the fight attendants were attentive in directing passengers to open seats as well as assisting others with stowing their luggage in the overhead compartments,\n\nBEST:  For me personally, the absolute best part about the entire flight (to MDW) was the humorous flight attended conducting the announcements.  As an example, he provided comical and witty explanation of the safety features and equipment, going as far as to compare the life jackets as a fashion statement and the illuminated lights on the walkway as the \"runway.\"  In any case, my attempt at describing the comic relief does no justice to his actual speeches, but I can honestly say most passengers elicited chuckles whenever he spoke.\n\nBOTTOM LINE:  A memorable and positive experience flying with Southwest Airlines.
