Just wanted to update my review, this place since my last review hasn't changed. Still quality food, amazing service and still looks as clean as the day it opened! Favorite is definitely the buffalo chicken tender sandwich. The buffalo sauce is delicious not to mention the chicken itself is nice and juicy!
