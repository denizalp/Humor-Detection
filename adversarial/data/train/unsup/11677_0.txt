OH MY MY MY. The smell of dessert just lingers all around you.\n\nWhere have you been my whole life, fruit palace!? They really are a palace of fruit. All of their signatures have fruit in or served with the meal. They've got chamangos (which are a must try) and elotes, they also have fruit platters, and crepes. Lots of different drink options for sure. I really am a big fan of crepes and trust me when I say, they have mastered the crepe here (it's soft and delicious). It's ONLY $5.99! What a STEAL! Comes with your choice of two different fruit toppings, and they have nutella or cinnamon. But seriously, this is an excellent place to go to for dessert. I just wish I knew about them before. It's definitely a small mom and pop shop that's a hidden gem but that's what I love most about it.\n\nIt will really make your mouth water!
