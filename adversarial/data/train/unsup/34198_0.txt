The food is always good, the service was good too, the thing that I didn't like about it is that I saw that my appetizer was ready, and 3 waitress saw that and they didn't care abut it, because it wasn't for their table, until they saw one of the cooks that was going to bring us our appetizer one of the waitress decide to bring us our appetizer, we had the spinach dip, by the time we got our appetizer, the appetizer was cold. My husband order a salad and he had his salad after he got his meal, and we had our bread after they brought our meal too. Our server was busy, we understand that, but what we didn't like was that the other waitresses had the time to bring our staff because they were talking to each other and  didn't care about giving good service.
