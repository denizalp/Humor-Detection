First of all it is not a joke. It's been a long time but I still want to tell you how I feel regarding Bell Honda. In July 2013, I visited Bell Honda for a Honda Civic 2013 ( basic model). My budget was 20K. They asked me for 25K for a civic which is definitely not acceptable while the offer Earnhardt gave me was 21K only. ( I finally bought my civic with 20K) My husband and I just left. Here is the funny part: the manager followed us and yelled at us \"hey you answer my question, if you are not coming to buy a car, why you are wasting our time!\" He even stood behind our car while my husband was backing up!!!! Hey are you are the person wasting my time bargaining for a civic and asked for 25K! I am not stupid! Who will buy a basic civic with 25K!!! Honda Accord only takes 22-23K okay? How can Bell Honda hire such an aggressive manager who stopped customers from leaving!!
