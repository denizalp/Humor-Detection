We came here for dessert tonight, after our meal nearby. We walked in, took a menu and sat down to decide what we wanted to order.  My kids decided on Mango, Blueberry and Green Tea Bingsus.  We all ordered the small size because we'd just had dinner and because we've never tried Bingsu before, and didn't quite know what to expect. \n\nYou go up to the counter to order and pay and then they give you a buzzer, to let you know when your order is ready to collect.  Our order took nearly 20 minutes to prepare.  When we got them we were really underwhelmed.  The sizes are quite small and because the ice is so fine, it's mainly air that you're paying for.  My son polished his off in a few minutes.  My girls took longer to eat their desserts.  The ice itself was plain and tasteless, like eating snow (other reviewers were talking about milk flavour).  For the price you pay, it's nothing spectacular and sizes aren't that big.  \n\nSeating is limited here and they will have a problem during busy times.  We were there for an hour, from deciding our orders, to ordering, paying, waiting for our desserts and eating.  Some people had finished eating, when we arrived but continued to sit there.  Other people shared a small dessert and took up too much space.  So good luck to people looking for a table to sit down, during busier times.  There are 2 other dessert places nearby that I would choose to go to, over this place.  But my kids loved the sensation of eating 'fluffy snow' .
