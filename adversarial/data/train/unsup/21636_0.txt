Pretzel croissant.\nBlueberry pudding danish.\nYogurt cake.\n(Curry ketchup?)\n\nIt may sound like some crazy German-fusion patisserie, but it's straight-up Bavarian breads and desserts. I'm a fan of the Summerlin location, and didn't even know that they had expanded to Henderson until I was driving down Eastern and saw a sign twirler with \"German Bakery\" advertised in a familiar font. I had to stop in and see what's new.\n\nThe store is both a bakery and a market for German groceries. They bake a nice assortment of hearty breads and rolls, including the best marble rye and loaves full of seeds and grains. Strudels, crumb cakes, fruit danish, almond bear claws, coffee cakes... A new item for me was their pretzel croissant, pretzel dough rolled into a small croissant shape and topped with seeds. It tasted buttery and had a lighter texture than the usual pretzel and you should probably order a dozen.\n\nYou're going to be stuck in traffic on Eastern, anyway... why not make it less painful with some pretzel rolls or poppy seed danish?
