I know this joint has a ton of reviews, but after dining here so many times over the last few years, they deserve another 5 stars. \n\nThis place is the best up North. THE BEST! We love us some good sushi and there are quite a few places to go to in town. If you're up in the NW corner, try this place out.\nIt's great for lunch, dinner and late night. \n\nWe come here pretty regularly when we want sushi and it has yet to disappoint us. \n\nThey want their customers to know that they have fresh fish flown in 3 times a week and more if needed. They even bring out eel, fish and whatever to show the clients how fresh their meal is going to be. Honestly, I could do without. But it's still pretty cool for some people, I suppose. \n\nWe LOVE getting the Kobe roll here. That's very American, but good god...it's amazing. \nAlso, the yellowtail here is always amazing. \n\nEverything we've had there, we've loved. \n\nThe service is always great and the sushi chefs are super friendly and always very helpful. If you give them an idea of what you like, they're always happy to make a creation for you. \n\nLOVE this place!
