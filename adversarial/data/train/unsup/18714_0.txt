3.5 stars\n\nIt was to be the day I lost $630 cash in a PNC envelope, but it turned out to be the day I found the best Bun (vermicelli noodle) salad in town. (And it eventually turned out to be the day before a kind Samaritan found and returned my money--after the cops told me that no one would be that honest--hooray for decent Clevelanders!)\n\nOK, got that? People are surprisingly good sometimes, and Saigon Grille has amazing Bun, adorned with nice fat shrimp and juicy bits of barbecued pork (though I would get it without the egg rolls, which tasted strangely sour and stale to me--bad oil perhaps?). \n\nThis same barbecued pork also comes stuffed into SG's Banh Mi, which is a super steal at only $3.75.  You can also get grilled chicken in the sandwich, but it's not as succulent, in my opinion. \n\nAll this being said, I went back the other day, forewarned about their lackluster Pho, and found it to be truly meh and the Summer Rolls very dry. Nevertheless, there are a number of good dishes to be had at SG--just be a little selective.\n\n*One interesting quirk about SG is that it seems to attract a lot of single diners. Two lone women, sitting at different tables, were there when I went to nurse my wounds after losing my cash, and by the time I had finished my meal, a couple of guys had come in.  Hmm? Maybe this restaurant also has some romantic potential (wink, wink).
