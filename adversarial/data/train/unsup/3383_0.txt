No. Just no.\n\nIf you're considering partying here, that's the only advice I can give to you.\n\nThe rooftop club was so crowded, but hardly anyone was dancing. The music was almost deafening and to make matters worse, the mix\/variety of music wasn't that great. The crowd here was very young...many of them look like they purchased their club clothes from Rainbow or Gussini and their makeup from the beauty supply store. I can only imagine how many 21st birthdays were being celebrated that night.\n\nIt was like navigating a labyrinth of humanity just to find a place to stand. To make matters worse, security comes around to tell you where you can sit\/stand.\n\n What the hell?!! I was \"moved\" twice in 5 minutes by security (and it's not like there is a plethora of places to go) and after that I'd had enough. I was more than ready to go. Because of the maze-like, and at times narrow, shape of this place it's impossible to people-watch, much less do anything else. I decided to cut my losses before I had to give those bouncers more than just a piece of my mind.\n\nEven shots couldn't salvage my trip to this place. I got out of there as fast as my pumps could carry me.
