Normally I try to stay away from anywhere that has the words \"seafood\" and \"buffet\" in the same sentence.\n\nHowever, when we walked in my head fucking exploded.\n\nSushi?  Yes.\nCrazy amounts of different seafood?  Yes.\nRice?  Of course.\nOther food items for the seafood squeamish?  Yes.\nDESSERT TABLE?  Yes.\nSweet staff?  Yes.\n\nI don't understand how the pacific northwest doesn't have a place like this anywhere b\/c it is definitely needed!  \n\nThe food is fresh, quick, and delicious and the place itself is bustling and chock full of all kinds, all enjoying a fantastic buffet of goodness!\n\nDo yourself a favour and stop by this gem to get your buffet on.  I'll see you in line, suckers!
