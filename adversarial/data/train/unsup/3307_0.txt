This place feels like it's where other bars go to die. While some bars can be charmingly dive-y but have secret 1ups like amazing food, or a crazy bartender that yells a lot, but is secretly a teddy bear; I don't know what Watchman's has going for it, really. I used to work across the street and I think I ate at every place within walking distance *except* Watchman's. Last month, my suspicions of \"ew, gross, sketch bar\" were confirmed. \n\nI stayed longer than I wanted to, because my friends and I were trapped in a booth between drunk birthday revelers, and I guess none of us wanted to be the party ruiners that showed up late and left early. The waitress was efficient enough, and was apologetic when my drink unexpectedly came with a cherry in it (which I am deathly allergic to - asphyxiation). The menu had nothing vegan on it, except possibly the \"Asian Vegetarian Spring Rolls\"  - which, yeah, wouldn't consider to order since there's nothing else \"Asian\" on the menu. \n\nTL;DR - This place doesn't feel welcoming, and the menu and limited drink options certainly aren't welcoming either.
