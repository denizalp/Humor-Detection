I've eaten at FOTB a couple times now and haven't been disappointed yet. They're a short walk from where I work and are located on a convenient corner in the downtown area.\n\nMust-try items:\nCatfish Po Boy\nShrimp Sammie\nCole Slaw\/Fries\n\nThe catfish was cooked well and tasted delicious. The bun and sauce compliment all other flavours. Portions are fairly generous, though a meal can get pricey rather quickly. The dining area can only seat 10-12 patrons, but the service is fast. This is definitely a go-to spot every once in a while. I need to try everything on the menu at least once.
