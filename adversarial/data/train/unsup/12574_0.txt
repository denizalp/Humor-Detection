I have only been to Smashburger 3 times.  The first two times were meh, but my most recent visit was disgusting.  I ordered the Sin City Chicken, no bun.  My supposedly 'grilled chicken breast' was gray in color and tasted like paste.  It was so disgusting I could not eat it.  Luckily my friend ordered the veggie frites  (carrots and green beans, flash fried) so I snagged a few of those.  When an employee came to take our plates, she asked if I wanted a box.  I advised that the chicken did not look or taste right.  She said she had heard that a couple of times today but offered nothing.  Who knows if they had a bad batch of chicken or if it's always like that.  My pictures really don't really depict the true grayness of this chicken.
