I waited 15 or 20 minutes to be seated to then be told breakfast ended as soon as I am seated at 9:55 am. Hostess was extremely rude. Instead she proceeds to tell me there's other places you can get breakfast from. There's a limited amount of places to eat here at the airport. I would think turning customers away isn't ideal for any business.
