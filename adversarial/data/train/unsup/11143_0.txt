They get an extra star for having vegan ice cream (not advertised on the menu, just tell the cashier) and having clearly marked vegan toppings. Is it the best ice cream I've ever had? Nah. Is the super-long line worth it? Not really. Do I think 7 bucks is a bit much for gimmicky ice cream? Yah. But it's in my hood and dairy-free, so they've got my biz!\n\nThe employees there all seem to enjoy their work, and it's kind of fun to watch the process of rolling the ice cream. The shop itself is TINY and parking in that area of Lawrenceville, esp. on a Friday or Saturday night, can be rough.\n\nIt's a little bit hipster nonsense, but when my pocket's feelin' fat, I'll stop by for some cruelty-free frozen treats.
