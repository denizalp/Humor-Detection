Amazing experience all around! Went last night as it was open late and within walking distance from our hotel. 3 Adults & an 11 year old. Upscale with indoor and outdoor seating. Elena was our server and she was very conscientious and extremely knowledgeable about the wines and dishes we ordered. \nIt is a wine bar with a limited menu and beer list, but everything we ordered was impeccable. We mostly ordered off the Lighter menu. It's a bit of a different concept as they are tapas but served family style. For example the pork meatballs with a parmesan sauce we ordered had 6 mini meatballs which were divine. We also ordered 2 shrimp & calamari, and 2 ceasar salads, which was shared by all. All of our dishes were not run of the mill, they each had their unique and flavorful twist. \nElana brought my cabernet sauvignon but also brought 3 other wines for tasting. She was extremely knowledgeable and took the time to educate us on each of the wines she brought us. \nAn excellent experience. Will be back again!
