I have used Camp Wagging Tails (CWT) many many times over the past 2 years to board my dog. The people are incredibly nice and the facilities are way above average, probably the best in the Charlotte area. \nHowever, recently I have steered away from CWT due to their limited pickup times, expensive daycare, and increasing overnight prices. To be specific, overnight pickup ends at 10am or 11am. Very rarely are you back in town this early, regardless of whether you are flying or driving into town. Therefore, you usually have to pick up later in the afternoon, and in doing so, you are charged the daycare price of $26. However, if you dropped your dog off at 5pm, the $40 overnight price isn't adjusted even though he\/she wasn't there during the day, you are charged in full. As an example, let's say you are going to spend the weekend at the beach. You get off work on Friday and drop your dog off at 4pm ($40). You enjoy Saturday ($40), and you get back into town between 12-2pm, and pick up your dog as soon as possible ($26). You just dropped $106 (before tax) and your dog wasn't even boarded for 48 hours. You could put your dog up in a Holiday Inn Express at this rate. \nLocal competitors charge less for overnight boarding, have just as much playtime, the facilities are almost as good, but they don't charge extra for pickup into the late afternoon. For example, at Barkin' Buddies in Denver, NC (10 miles to the west), this same weekend would only cost $64. At Camp Bow Wow in Concord, NC, this weekend would only cost $76. My dog loves Camp Wagging Tails, but he also loves Barkin' Buddies and Camp  Bow Wow (Concord, NC) just the same and both places offer the same playtime, accommodations, but are cheaper and have more flexible pickup options. \nWould I recommend CWT? Yes, but only as a 3rd option unless they adjust their pricing.
