Wanted to follow up \/ expand on my initial review to say that we LOVE the food at Tom's - the BBQ is delish and it's definitely an easy stop off to grab a bite.  They have a really large selection of food items, both at the counter and throughout the store (there are even some organic \/ local items in the back fridge door - check 'em out!).  \n\nThe gas statement made in the first review was only in comparison to the area we live in, which is cheaper than most of the Phoenix central and Scottsdale areas since we are close-ish to Cave Creek gas prices in general seem to be cheaper in that area.  (Thanks Scott D. for pointing out any confusion that may have caused!)\n\nOverall, their gas prices for N. Scottsdale are in the middle.  The Chevron around the corner is about $0.09 cheaper for a gallon at this moment, but let me tell you it's worth the extra $1.00 in gas to be able to get good food in a clean and friendly place!  I do fill up at this location on occassion when I am headed home and don't have enough gas to get there (I totally run the car down to \"E\" and live on the edge) and I'll always go in for snacks, candy or a drink.\n\nOverall: gonna upgrade to an A-\nThe food is good.  Staff is friendly.  Gas is overpriced ONLY when compared to my home area - not in comparison to the surrounding area and it's worth the few extra cents to get some yummy food!
