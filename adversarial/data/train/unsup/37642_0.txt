A Southern member of our party said the Fried chicken was as good as his mom used to make - that should be enough said, but everything else was perfection: The owner set down at our table an complimentary order of the Fried Green Tomato 'BLT'; and the Mac and Cheese, Okra, Buttermilk biscuits, Florida Heirloom Tomato Salad - all vegetarian options were wonderful. Another veg option - the Thyme and Rosemary Fennel Bulb entree, while decent, did not meet expectations. If you're a vegetarian, stick with the abundant offerings of sides.\n\nAlso most important was the gracious staff, and the owner who was present and engaging. Our wonderful friends who took us there (and treated us to this fabulous meal!) were familiar with the Miami Beach location, and Yardbird will definitely be on our places-to-eat list next time we return to Vegas (or Miami Beach).
