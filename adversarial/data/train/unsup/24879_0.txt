Pre-warning: This is a review written by someone who has never watched a single thing by Penn and Teller. My sister and I chose them based on reviews, as we were interested in seeing a magic show in Vegas, and this show sounded both fun and smart.\n\nThoughts:\n-All of the magic tricks were awesome, shocking, with a lot of \"wtf\" moments. \n-I really did not care for the libertarian rants. That's some peoples bag, but not mine. Yeah I get that's their thing. I came for the magic.\n-Penn talks way too much. I fell asleep while he talked.\n-Teller is insanely talented and had the best tricks.\n-The theater is really, really cold. I know all of LV is basically air-conditioned, but this theater seemed to have the most AC. Bring a cardigan.\n-Penn & Teller will wait in the lobby and sign and take photos with EVERYONE. It's pretty neat.\n\nOverall I don't think it's worth the price. I would try to find discounted tickets. However, the magic, which is what I am trying to review, is the best. Also my sister loved it a lot so it was worth seeing her reaction.
