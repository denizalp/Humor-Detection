I have a love hate relationship with this location. I love the food but hate the service!  Well I can't say I totally hate them, there are a few that have done excellent customer service and then there's the few that are young and don't understand the value of customer service.  I hope one day this place surprises me and actually hire people who want to work here or actually like there job,\nSo onto the food, is straight up awesome! Can't go wrong with Salmon tacos or carne asada!  Cafe Rio just has yummy food to choose from period, which makes me turn the other cheek to there not so awesome crew!  My favorite is the house dressing- it's so good I can literally drown any type of food and it's okay. My second favorite part of the food is the homemade tortillas bomb.com!  \nSo if your looking for good food that will fill you up and your tummy head to Cafe Rio!  But if your tired and don't feel like seeing employees who obviously didn't want to come into work or don't feel the need to wear a hair net- then just go to Chipotle
