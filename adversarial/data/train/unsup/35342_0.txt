Work beside this place so I always order take out for lunch. The owner Irena is super sweet and very friendly, however 8\/10 times that I've ordered every time I get to my desk I would notice something was missing. Whether it be the rolls, the rice, salad. Something was always missing! Good for dine in - but be careful when it comes to take out.
