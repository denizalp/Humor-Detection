My experience here started out good, but went downhill. It had a cool vibe inside and was packed with people, which I took as a good sign. When we took a look at the drink menus, I was happy to see a good selection of wine and at good prices too (a 6 oz glass of Beringer cab was only $6.50). But that's where my good review ends.\n\nAs the night went on, we realized how loud it was inside and we had to practically shout to talk to each other - my throat was actually sore by the end of the 2.5 hours we were there! The food wasn't anything special. Most of the people at my table ordered a different kind of flammekueche so that we could all try each others. My friend's Manhattan was probably my favourite, but it probably isn't something I would order again. \n\nMy biggest complaint was the service. Our server didn't refill our water once while we were there and we had a hard time chasing him down to order more drinks and get our bills. Also when I asked him if the molten chocolate cake was safe for my nut allergies he just said \"I don't know\" and didn't bother offering to check with the kitchen.  Well, I'm not going to bother to eat here again.
