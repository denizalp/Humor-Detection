My review is based on the food AND customer service. As a long time fan of the food I have a love\/hate relationship of this place because food is great but service is not very friendly or welcoming....reminds me of an old ex- boyfriend that treats you bad but you can't help but to wanna go back haha. The food alone gets 4-5 stars. The rotisserie chicken is great, food is seasoned just right, and I love their rice. I almost alway order the Montanero platter...yum! BUT the service gets 2 stars.... the servers always look unhappy and miserable, like they don't want you there. Kinda ruins the experience!  I'm waiting for the day another similar place opens so I can cut my ties for good. Until now, I will continue this abusive relationship because the food is that good lol.
