Lee Schenk was very welcoming, warm, casual and got me at ease when we first met! He explained to me in very specific details all my options, one by one, for my first time buying a property! I couldn't thanks more my real estate agent, Elizabeth McManus, for introducing me to Lee has my load agent! I highly recommend Lee to anybody looking to buy but don't know a thing about the all process! Lee will make it as easy as one plus one! Regards, Julien
