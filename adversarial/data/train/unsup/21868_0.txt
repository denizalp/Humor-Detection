I just love their breakfast!  Their pancakes and french toast is just great!  Only thing about their breakfast is I find inconsistancies.  Sometimes I get strawberries, sometimes I don't. They do offer kids portions, but do notice that the amount I get varies as well.  Food is really good there, their wait staff could be a bit friendlier though.  I did go their for lunch once and got a great stirfry.  I haven't tried dinner yet, but they do have specials for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  BP did need a fresh place for people to go to!
