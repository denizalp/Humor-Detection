This review is meant for the Keg on King street. \n\nFirst off let me say, if I had a choice between here and Jacobs steakhouse next door, I would choose the keg. Reason being is because I think Jacobs is way over priced for what you are getting.\n\nThe Keg had a beautiful decor and atmosphere and the staff was on it! \n\nAs for the food: \nAppetizers: the Caesar salad we had was really nothing special. The salad seemed like it had been tossed awhile ago and the dressing and flavor was not anything but average.  Shrimp cocktail, were ok, the shrimp tasted fine, but they had a fishy smell to them which slightly turned us off. We usually like extra horseradish and they brought us some but it was the creamy type not the fresh kind. \n\nThe main dishes we had were-\nFilet mignon with the baked potato , this was delicious! The meat was perfectly cooked to our desire and the baked potato fully loaded was so delicious. I wished the potato was bigger bc it was just so good! The baked salmon, another amazing dish we ordered. It was moist and delicious. The only complaint I had was that the rice pilaf that came with the salmon seemed a bit undercooked (meaning a bit hard). \nWe got a couple sides: \n\nMushrooms - these were ok, I have had better, but I'm a big fan of mushrooms so they were still tasty! \n\nBrussels sprouts- these were delicious ! Loved these! They were packed with flavor, I just wished their sides were bigger \n\nDessert: we got the warm brownie! This was delicious! They knocked it out the park with this one. I usually like lava cake when I go to restaurants, but they didn't offer it, but this was definitely a good alternative. \n\nHope this helps!
