I had high hopes for Metro after longing to visit after my last dinner which had left a good impression on me . Despite some positive press review, I found Metro to be terribly disappointing this time around and lacking substance or lacking for a better word.\n\nService started off great and then went aloof from there as if we did not exist. The breakfast was nothing reminiscent of a French bistro or brasserie whatsoever. What happened to the wonderful croissants and pains au chocolat ? Borrowing from another review, service was indeed ridiculously slow and indifferent.\n\nI really wanted to see you succeed Metro, but I kinda lost faith. I hope you put a little bit more work in the service delivery and decoration of your awfully cold and depressing dining room.
