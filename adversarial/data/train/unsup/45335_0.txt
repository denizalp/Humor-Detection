I have been using Business of Baskets for 11 years and have used Deb exclusively with my gift giving needs.  The reason I keep coming back is that she takes the time to listen about my clients and tailors a gift around that person and their interests.  There is no better feeling when I am told that the gift I gave was so thoughtfully given.  Deb is an A++ in customer service and always get the order in on time.  Wouldn't use anyone else!
