After 2 days away I came home to my entire home flooded from the toilet supply line busting.  OMG! 9pm Sunday night Copper State sent Richard out. He couldn't of been more professional and hard working! He was knowledgeable and understanding. I was a mess! Definitely a great company to work with. Thank YOU Copper State for getting me thru that mess!!
