Wow. The hype is real and you better believe it. Let this place transport you to a different world as it abducts you to a nightclub scene that's out of this world. From the moving LED chandelier that almost resembles a spaceship, posh decor, and relatively easy to navigate layout (especially in comparison to its sister club Hakkansan...), I was definitely impressed by what this can offer to the always growing nightlife of Vegas.\n\nThey do have guestlist so feel free to check with your promoters, but I'd still recommend just buying the presale ticket so you can take your time and not have to rush to get there around 9-10. With a ticket, you can pre-party all you want and enter in at around 11-midnight without any problem. That money you save by getting in with guestlist will just be used up when you need to get your drinks on in the club so it really cancels out in the end!\n\nIf you're ballin' hard enough, each table gets an amazing view of the main room. They definitely designed this place to make sure everyone got an unobstructed view of the morphing chandelier! Luckily, I got to get a good view at a table RIGHT behind the DJ. Martin Garrix definitely lived up to his hype!\n\nThe Hip-hop room also gets preeeetty packed, but the crowd is definitely poppin. If you want some space or breathing room, definitely venture upstairs to the balcony terrace area where you get an even closer view of the spaceship... er I mean chandelier! I can't wait to come back next time! Or perhaps it's other location in San Diego within the Gaslamp Quarters :)
