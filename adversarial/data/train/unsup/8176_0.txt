Had a wonderful experience!\nWent in for lunch on a Saturday. The restaurant is beautifully decorated with a clean and open design. I really like the living art on the wall...\nWe sat on the patio and our service was wonderful.\nThey have happy hour from 11-6 everyday! I had the traditional and watermelon mojitos and they were amazing for only $5!\nNow on to the food...We ordered three rolls (see picture) and a Teriyaki Chicken bento box (see picture). Everything was presented beautifully. The bento box was good, I really like the octopus\/squid salad that comes with it. The miso soup was really good as well. The real stars here are the special rolls. The first one we had was the Tiger. It was more of a standard roll, good but nothing too exciting. The second was the Truffle Steak. OMG, this was delicious its topped with rare beef, truffle aioli and fried onions. My absolute favorite was the Spicy Chandler. Spicy tuna, spicy crab, avocado, masago, romaine lettuce, wrapped in soy paper with spicy aioli and it was ridiculously good! It is a must order when you eat here.\n\nI am a huge fan of this place and I cannot wait to go back!!!
