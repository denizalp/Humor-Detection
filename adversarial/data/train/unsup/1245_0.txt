I wish I could give BlueChip NEGATIVE stars!  This company is nothing but trouble.  They hook you with a seemingly decent deal on Living Social and then you are in for it!   I called over a month in advance to redeem my Living Social voucher which was $329 for a 2 night weekend stay including an alcohol package and some club passes.  The girl I spoke to verified the dates and specifically asked me if I had purchased the weekend voucher which I confirmed (why can they not tell this?).  Upon arrival on Friday 1\/25, I was informed by the staff at the Signature that Bluechip had booked our room for the incorrect dates (2\/25-2\/27 which is a Monday and Tuesday instead of 1\/25-1\/27).   I contacted Bluechip immediately and was \"handled\" by Brittany.  She informed me it would take up to 2 hours to make the correction and also that I would have to PAY an additional $10.80 because I was charged the wrong amount for taxes. She was indifferent and unapologetic. She called back about an hour later and said it was taken care of.  When I went to check in at the front desk, I was informed Bluechip had booked the reservation for the wrong dates (2\/25-2\/27) AGAIN and we had to wait another 45 minutes to get into a room.  Are MONKEYS working here!?  Nope... they wouldn've gotten it right the second time around... \n\nWhen we got to the room, the phone and television were not working and the Alcohol\/party package that came with the deal were not present - shocker!  I called Bluechip again and was informed it could take an additional 2 hours to get the package and have the items fixed.  I asked if it could be faster because we had plans and were trying to get going and Crystal (who claimed to have no boss and be the OWNER of Bluechip when I asked for a manager) told me she wasn't gonna have her crew \"stop what they were doing and run to my room\" because they were cleaning other rooms.  I told her I was going to dispute the charge on my credit card and she said \"Fine, I'll wait for that dispute\".  They were rude and condascending and ruined an entire day\/night of our only 2 day trip.  \n\nAll in all, with taxes and fees I ended up paying over $500 for this \"DEAL\".  It would have been less expensive to book directly with The Signature for that weekend.  \n\nThis is in no way directed at the Signature MGM.  It is a fantastic facility with beautiful suites and we have stayed here many times but PLEASE do yourself a favor and book directly with the hotel.\n\nI have NEVER experienced this type of treatment, ESPECIALLY in the hotel industry and I travel quite a bit.  This \"company\" is a disgrace and I can't believe they're still in business.  Charge DISPUTED.  PEACE OUT BLUECHIP!
