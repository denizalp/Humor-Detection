Management sucks balls here! That manager Jack must hate people.He hung up on us. We went down to the front desk and he walked away from us and didn't care to deal with us and told all his employees not to speak to us or help us. Wow! Unprofessional! We filed a complaint because its not fair the kind of treatment that he provided. We can't believe he works as a manager. He should be fired. They just don't know customer service and when you complain it's like we are bothering them. Their job is accommodate people. Every time we call its a pain. We were truly loyal customer until recent, we come here a lot and always stayed at the Luxor and we bet big here and we aren't even consider close to value clients. T.V. is always not functioning, we ask for non smoking room and always get a room that smells like cigarettes, always something failing. Like really? Don't come here if you want to be treated like a nobody and not a value client. Very sad. Its been going downhill for awhile and I think a change is what we need.
