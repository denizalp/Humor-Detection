You're just so darned cute, Bumpy's! You're hip, you're happening, you keep up with the cool kids, and yet I still want to introduce you to my grandma. You're fun and funky and still so down-home adorable.\n\nYour staff are bubbly and wonderful all the time! They're so nice, I feel like I need to be on my best behavior at all times. Sometime I visit you in the morning and I make sure to thank them on the way out after I've had my coffee and can finally interact with them like the real human being that I am post-coffee.\n\nYou can be kind of hard to get around in and when you're busy I wind up bumping into everyone sitting down... bump bump bump...wait a minute... Did I just figure it out your name? Its ok by me though, your narrow in the middle design makes it difficult to pass by people, but I think it just adds to your quirky charm.\n\nLast visit I had some borderline life-changing cream of mushroom soup. Nothing different, nothing unexpected, just really really good cream of mushroom soup - flavourful broth with impressive full slices of mushroom everywhere. It's a good thing I was meeting someone, or I would have had my face buried in that bowl with soup up to my ears! \n\nHome-made and heavenly.
