LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL! After experiencing this festival, this is how you will feel. It's better than any artificial high you can buy. A magical gathering of people infused with a plethora of art, culinary delights, learning, and live music. \n\nI've been to several music festivals: big and small. Life Is Beautiful is my all-time favorite. Imagine a 3-day festival in the heart of historic downtown Las Vegas. It makes navigating the space a cake walk because it's set up on a grid. The two main stages were on opposite sides of the grounds; each with a separate culinary village attached.\n\nI'm not really sure what the parking nightmare was like, thankfully my sister works downtown and let me borrow her parking pass at a structure near downtown; although Saturday night I was camped in the garage for 2 hours. Since this festival is in the heart of downtown, my group of friends grabbed some beers (and I a lemonade) at Park on Fremont and see-sawed for a bit.\n\nBeing that this Festival is still in it's infancy, being only it's second year there are still kinks that need to be worked out. The motivational speakers were crammed into this small space. Lining up for 30 minutes prior to a session and not being able to get in was beyond frustrating; however, I got over it quickly. My best festival memories come from getting lost in the experience rather than rushing to catch a certain set. \n\nMy favorite memory was the ferris wheel ride on night 3. We were the first loading on, as soon as we made a full 360, Foo Fighter started. One of those, what is life moments. I love taking in the views from on the top of the solo ride. Overlooking the entire festival. Seeing all the people there, all experiencing the same thing, you can't help but feel connected to your fellow ladies and gents. I'm still smiling from my memories made there.\n\nCan't wait to go back!
