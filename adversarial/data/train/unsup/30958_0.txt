I became familiar with Citi Trends in Texas. I went looking for scrubs for work and a couple of cute tops for the club. Not only did I find inexpensive scrubs, but I found super cute and stylish clothes for church and the club!, They had Baby Phat and Apple Bottom to name a few. So happy they made it west! For us folks on a budget, they are a blessing!
