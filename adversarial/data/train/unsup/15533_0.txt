I work in the cocktail industry and am super impressed by the new spots downtown, it's a real scene and not just another area trying to grab tourist dollars.  \n\nThat being said, I like this bar, the vibe, the music, and the fact they are trying to make proper cocktails.  However, it has \"cocktail\" right there in the name.  Do you see it?  That means cocktails should be pretty extraordinary.\n\nUnfortunately, it's still missing something.  Most of the drinks are over-sweet (probably a side-effect of a town that gives you a big helping of sugar and rum inside of a large plastic yard),   Most of the drinks come off as poorly balanced with one of the ingredients sticking out way too far.\n\nThe real deal-breaker is the fact that they won't list their ingredients on their cocktails.  When I asked why this was, I was told it was because they didn't want their drinks stolen.  \n\nThe humor comes from the fact that the drinks on the menu are mostly fairly well known (such as The Last Word).  \n\nI have an idea, how about you create new drinks and continue to innovate rather than come up with a few cocktails and keep them secret so you can ride the menu for the next two years?  \n\nA true master is not measured on how many students he has, but by how many masters he has created.  Sharing recipes makes everyone better and keeps you innovating.  \n\nThis place is not good enough at drinks (yet) to be this high-and-mighty about their menu.  I look forward to coming back when they're a little more enlightened.
