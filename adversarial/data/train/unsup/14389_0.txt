Ah, the stone peacock.\n\nPerhaps the ugliest building on campus, Robarts is desperately need in some renovations inside (hard to change the exterior looks), and fortunately it is getting it. \n\nWhile the stacks (all zillion floors of them) used to be primary colours, they will soon be calming neutrals and have new tables and chairs. I kid you not that this library is divided into three coloured sections on each floor, red, yellow, and blue. It is a visual nightmare. \n\nThe bathrooms used to be just as bad, but they are also scheduled for renovations. If you head to one of the newer ones (the main floors), they are actually quite nice and high end looking. \n\nUndeniably, Robarts has a great selection of books - but what else would you expect form a library that massive? They don't just have textbooks, but lots of popular fiction and non-fiction as well. \n\nIt is also the only (in my knowledge) 24\/hr a day library (study space only) on campus. This means that it is absolutely PACKED during exams, but it's the best place to park yourself for an overnight study session. \n\nThis is also a less \"intense\" library, if you will. People are more tolerant of chatting (though not much), but they will tell you to keep it down eventually. This could be because the more open space in the study areas means that it isn't as obvious where the voices are coming from? \n\nPeacock Facts:\n\n- It was once on an episode of Friends, where it was \"the hospital\"\n- When it was built, they were planning it for graduate students only\n- They thought they would install a state of the art book grabbing \/ returning system for the stacks, if you go up there they still have the tracks for it installed\n- It's the third largest library in North America (or was last time I checked Wiki)\n- I wonder how many people thought these facts would actually be about peacocks? (Note: the female peacock is called a peahen).
