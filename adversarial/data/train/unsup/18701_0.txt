Best cheap burritos ever. \n\nPROS:\n\n-- cheap everything. A box of fake Cheez-Its for $1. A six-pack of good bagels for $1.29. Crazy, big-ass packs of ground beef for less than half of what you'd pay at Giant Ego.\n\n-- quick. I've never waited more than five minutes in line here. The cashiers (who get to sit down) are faster than Superman on laundry day.\n\nCONS:\n\n-- produce looks kinda iffy\n\n-- none of your precious hippie free-trade organic stuff here\n\n-- every time I go here, there's some woman having a really loud conversation on her cell phone which invariably involves the phrase \"Shit, I told that bitch to fuck off.\" Jeez, lady, your kids are right there.
