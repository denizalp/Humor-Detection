Two words: FOOD COMA.\n\nHow anyone spends the entire time here is beyond my comprehension?  We tried to hit all the hot spots where a line was expected (Kai, Hana, etc) early to avoid some waiting.  And we did a really good job to where we really only waited if we had a question for the chef. \n\nWe gorged...and gorged...and gorged...until we pretty much felt sick.  And my stomach was carrying a 6-month food baby. (Thank god I planned ahead and wore loose clothing!)  We focused on food and actually didn't drink...strategic plan to save tummy room for grub.\n\nThe event was well organized between the Art Museum, SAACA, and Local First.  Plenty of security, and no \"bros\" to deal with, at least while we were there.\n\nLooking forward to next year! But plan ahead - GA tickets sold out months in advance!
