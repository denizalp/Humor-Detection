Another concert venue for Vegas! Woohoo! Yay! Errrssseeerrrrmmm!!! Let's have bands! YASS! Let's sell merchandise! YASS! Let's have sculptures outside! YASS! Let's have beer and food! YASS!Let's have an arena that can fit thousands of people! YASS! \n\nI think that was the extent of the design and planning committee. They totally forgot a tiny insignificant detail: PARKING!!! Like WTF? To get to the parking structure, you have to cause traffic on Tropicana and the 15, wait for an hour, pay $20 for event parking, look for parking for another hour...and if you're lucky, your band that you came here to see hasn't left the building yet.\n\nI enjoyed my 1-hour Coldplay concert. Then, it was time to deal with the dreaded parking cluster f@ck all over again. The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars is because I wasn't the one driving. If I were the one responsible for driving and finding a spot to park - I would have given this venue 1 star...in jail.
