My review for Jollibee was months in the making. Somehow words were escaping me on how to best describe my experience here. I struggled on not turning this into a fecal focused review about the place. as you can see I failed miserably. Well.....\n\nHoly Crap Batman, that is what I was thinking a few hours after visiting this fine restaurant. Now I am not one to be crude, but their food is not exactly easy on the bowels if you know what I mean. I give it two stars just because of the twisted names of some of their menu items,. I had the Aloha burger and it does mean hello and goodbye!
