$9 Thai Tea with boba that tastes like milk with a slight tea after taste, yeah, no thanks. If you're going to have the audacity to charge almost ten bucks for a Thai tea, it should at least taste like Thai tea, if not the best Thai tea ever. I didn't try the food stalls, but if it's anything like the overpriced drinks that taste like nothing than watered downed milk, I would say avoid this place; there are so much better places in walking distance that's worth your money.
