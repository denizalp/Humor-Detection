I just can't give anything less than 3-stars to Flavor Flav handing out a free 2-liter of Root Beer, taking and delivering drink orders and serving up hugs. I had the rare pleasure of randomly showing up at Flavor Flav's when he happened to be in the house, and he saved the entire experience from being a complete cluster-cluck. He is downright charming. \n\nBut, outside of Mr. Flav, it was indeed a misadventure of sorts primarily because it took at least 40 minutes for us to get our order of a 2-piece dinner. Yes, it does warn you that they prepare everything fresh to order, but even with that disclaimer, the wait was obscenely long. I think they do a large takeout business because it is intended to be just that: a takeout spot. You are probably best served if you call ahead and:\n\na. Ask if Flavor is there, boooiiiiiiiiii!\nb. Order your chicken in advance\n\nThe flavor and execution of the chicken was good, not amazing, but it is overpriced. As for the sides, we had mac and cheese and cole slaw, and neither hit me with homemade genius. However, the big glass of sweet iced tea was everything a Southerner dreams of.\n\nFor a one time experience when Flavor Flav is in the house, it is worth it, but for an everyday meal or a fast bite to eat, you better just roll on over to KFC and skip FFC.
