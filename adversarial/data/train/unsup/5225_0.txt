I love to get poked at Modern Acupuncture! I have the worse allergies, neck pain and headaches. Not only can I get traditional acupuncture to help alleviate these issues, I can get cosmetic acupuncture to make me younger looking and that gives me a glow too?! Sign me up! \n\nYes, I'm now a member and I have already been referring this place to any friend or co worker who has given me a compliment on my look. \n\nI love it. You will too. Trust me.
