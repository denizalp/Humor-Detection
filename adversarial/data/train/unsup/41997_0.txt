We decided to try out this buffet during our last visit to Las Vegas. The wait was not too long - maybe 20 minutes? the cost was about $45 for dinner. Overall they had a good variety of food and desserts. However, I would say all of the food was average. Next time I would prefer to spend the additional $10 to go to Wicked Spoon.
