Want to get away, want to relax from the everyday grind then welcome to 100 acres of freedom. There are so many parks in Charlotte but Freedom Park is the gold standard for all others. Here you have 4 baseball fields, 4 baseball fields with batting cages, 12 tennis courts, 4 soccer fields, a 7 acre lake with 5 outdoor shelters with grills. My family and I come here for the walking trails and just the relaxation of the scenery with the lake. You can spend all day here and not have another care in the world. \n\nThis park is great for couples, families, or just walking the dog by yourself. I sometimes find food vendors near the park but I haven't tried any of them. Somethings you have to keep in mind is parking can be difficult to find but it's out there like an elusive Golden Goose, speaking of goose or rather geese, there are goose droppings everywhere and some people don't pick up after their dogs but other than that, I can't find any other faults with Freedom Park. So, don't hesitate and don't skip out on Freedom Park because I personally will pass at least 6 other parks just to get to this one. Freedom Park is a true gem in Charlotte!
