SWIG MEETS LAS VEGAS!!!\n\nI am so excited to see traditional soda fountain-type establishments coming to the Las Vegas Valley. Pops, like Splash (in Fabulous Freddy's on Grand Montecito), provides customers with customized sodas. For example, you can order a Diet Coke with coconut creamer and freshly squeezed limes or a Root Beer with cream and vanilla. They also sell cookies--the frosting on the snickerdoodles is amazing!\n\nThe prices are right and the employees are kind and helpful. In fact, when I ordered the wrong drink, they replaced it with what I really wanted without complaint or cost. This is great customer service and I will definitely go back!\n\nBest of all (like Splash), they have a \"drive-through.\" You drive to one of the designate spaces and an employee comes to your car to take and then deliver your order to your car. It feels a bit like an old-time Sonic (roller skates not included).
