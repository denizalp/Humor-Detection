Yesterday, after having gone through a laser back procedure, my husband and I stopped by the Red Robin's Gourmet Burgers restaurant near our home to get lunch to go.  When we got home, we were ready to eat.  The Onion Rings we'd ordered were good and my husband's Black & Blue burger was good.  I had order the Pig Out Burger as I really like burgers with bacon.  When ordering, I requested that the sauces be to the side (little cup type containers) and no cheese.  The burger I received had nothing but the hamburger patty - NO bacon, tomatoes, lettuce or anything else! (3\/4 of my burger is sitting in the frig.)  We had never been to any Red Robin Restaurant before but had purchased a gift card in Dec. for a Christmas Gift to send to my eldest brother.  I sure hope that he is able to find a more reliable establishment in Alabama than this one.
