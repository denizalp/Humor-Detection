By far the best return on investment in Vegas! I loved this place and it will be a frequent stop anytime we are headed that way through the desert. Games from the 1930s to concept Pinball machines to the ones I grew up playing at my local pizza joint, everything was super fun! There's a change machine at the front and most games are between $0.25 to a $1.00 a play. No one talked to us the entire time we were there which was a-okay with me as I was generally busy sucking at the Elvira game of my youth. We spent a good hour and a half here making the rounds through all the options.
