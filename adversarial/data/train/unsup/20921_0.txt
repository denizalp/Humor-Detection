It's interesting how the restaurant world works, isn't it? A few years ago all the hype was burgers, burgers, burgers... And so the fast casual Smashburger, Five Guys, Burger 21 (since closed), Elevation Burger, Shake Shack, Freddy's and on and on we're born. Before that it was the Burrito and now the restaurant fortune tellers have spoken and have decided that \"create your own personal Pizza\" is the new rage. And so Fired Pie, Pieology, Blaze, PizzaRev, Pie Five, The Pizza Studio & MOD Pizza and others have jumped into the pizza pool together.\nThis location is situated in a mini restaurant row. Burgers, bakery, burritos & sandwiches are all located in the same center. Great if you're with a group & not everyone is feeling the craving for pizza.\nC & I decided to give MOD a try. The first thing that struck me was the background music. It was loud. We told our \"assembler\" we had never been to MOD before. He didn't seem interested. Since we've been to the \"other\" build your own pie joints it didn't take but a nano second to figure out our game plan.\nC ordered the Mad Dog ($7.47). This pie had Mozzarella, Pepperoni, Sausage, crumbled Meatballs & red sauce. The crust was thin of course and cooked nicely. A few burnt spots but that is to be expected. All in all a decent little pizza BUT nothing special. Nothing that C said would make him choose this place over any other.\nI had the MOD salad ($7.47). Basically the \"create your own\" salad here. Fresh Romaine with some yummy toppings. Everything was good but again, nothing special.\nIf we're in the neighborhood & looking for a decent personal pie &\/or salad, we'll come back.\nAverage pizza, average salad, loud music, fair prices, ?
