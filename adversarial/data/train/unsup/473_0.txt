This review is certainly one that can be considered \"a long time coming\" as I have been a patron of BJ's since about 1996 and have seen the restaurant change a bit over the years but still, for the most part, stay true to its character and atmosphere offering great micro Brewed beer and root beer and cream soda and a hearty selection of deep dish pizzas and other delicious bar food. \n\nHaving said that, after over 16 years of enjoying a classic proprietary sandwich, I was VERY saddened to see my favorite menu item removed from the menu a couple years back. For well over a decade, they offered a wonderful item called the Cobb Sandwich that was basically a Cobb salad in sandwich form. Shaved turkey, spiced mayo, avocado, bacon, and blue cheese crumbles. It was an absolutely delicious sandwich that I enjoyed for 15 years. Not any more :-(\n\nIn an effort to modernize and appeal to the modern hipsters and foodies, BJ's revamped their menu a few times over the years and now offers things like small plates, thin crust flat bread pizzas, and a wider array of appetizers. Also, they now offer free refills on their homemade Cream Soda and Root Beer. \n\nThough I continue to love BJ's as a nostalgic and fun place to go with or without the kids, the removal of that classic sandwich and some other Day 1 menu items resulted in this review garnering a 4\/5. \n\nBJ's is a great micro brew upscale pizza place and bar that I still strongly recommend to all. Just wish they would bring back some of their classics.
