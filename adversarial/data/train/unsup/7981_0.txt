My first time doing anything like this before and I had a great experience. I am a naturist so I had no issues walking in the nude. And it was a last minute decision on going there so I didn't have a bathing suit on me. Not that I would have worn one! ha! there were about 6-8 other women in the spa\/water area. Some topless some not. \n\nYou have a robe and 2 towels plus flip-flops to wear. As a plus size lady the robe was too small and I asked the attendant if they had larger sizes. She did bring me a plus size robe and it was nicer than the skinny people's robes!!! haha!\n\nI really enjoyed the different types of water features, the steam room and the sauna. The sauna could have been hotter for my liking. The hot water tub was a little too hot for me so I knelt on the ledge to keep cool. The cold tub was FREEZING I went to my stomach once but the second time I only made it to my knees! haha!! I liked the jets in the main hot tub which isn't a tub because it is so huge! But I moved my back around on the jet as a massage feature which really helped my back. \n\nA girl was there and I thought she was a patron just letting ladies know about a face mask. She offered my friend and I some and I asked her: do you work here? She said yes: she does the spa services. The mask was very nice and effective as my skin is now reflecting the impurities coming up! ha! \n\nMy friend and I plan on going back next week and we are going to try out their massage as well.
