I'm really sad because this used to be one of my go-to lunch places, however I've noticed service and quality have been lacking the last few times I've been gone, and I think after todays experience, it will be my last.\n\n1- Service: Always friendly, but there are certain servers who can't handle more than a few tables at a time. Our server today didn't put our order through, even though it was clear that many tables after us had been served their food. It was another server (not ours) that noticed we still hadn't gotten our food and followed up. No cutlery was given for a dish that required it, and I could not find my server to get any.\n\nI try not to be too much of a nuisance, and had asked if it wasn't too much trouble for none of the sauce to be put on my taco as I don't like spice. Taco arrived with the jalapeno sauce, which he \"promised me\" wasn't spicy. One bite disproved this, and I had to send it back.\n\n2- Food. Quality seems to have lowered in the past few times. My friend had a fly in her taco, and the delicious chips have been replaced with stale store bought chips. There also always seems to be fruit flies when I'm here, which doesn't help. \n\nI want to love this place but all of the above has kind of ruined it for me\n\nYou will get some good tacos here but expect service delays and the occasional fly
