$9 Chimi and $2.50 coke, plus tax and tip... where am I eating at right now?  This isn't exactly the high rent district out here on Indian School road halfway between the 101 and Dysart Rd.  \n\nChips were rather dry and resembled the generic brand ones that come in a bag modestly labeled 'chips' that my in-laws buy.  Salsa was fresh (good onion & tomato), but the Chimi, beans, rice, and service were just average.  I'm not sure why the other reviewers found the price to be just right.  I fear that this place enjoys inflated review scores because it's down in the Avondale\/Goodyear area with so little decent competition.
