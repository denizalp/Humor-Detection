Working in a building connected to the underground city, I will sometimes take the metro during my lunch and come to Alexis Nihon Plaza mall when I need a change from the food that I can get from the downtown core.\n\nWhen I was a lot younger, I used to go to Alexis Nihon a lot more often as I had check-up appointments at the Montreal Children's hospital and the school that I went to was somewhat close to Alexis Nihon. The place is well maintained and has changed a lot over the years. I remember the days of Steinberg and Miracle Mart at this mall and now both of these stores (grocery store and big box store respectively no longer exists). I also remember that this place used to have a movie theatre as well as an arcade back in those days..\n\nThe places that I would normally go at Plaza Alexis Nihon today include IGA, Canadian Tire, Winners, Dollarama, and a few of their places to grab a bite to eat (Tim Hortons, McDonalds, etc.)
