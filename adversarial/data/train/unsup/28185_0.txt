Im not a big fan of sushi but this place changed my mind!!!! Wow the sweet potato roll was amazing and the cucumber avocado roll was the best I have ever had. If sushi always tasted like this I would have moved to japan!!! The outside appearance is not to great and inside isn't very fancy and parking is a bear but get past all that and its awsome I want to go back asap.
