This is a fun, nice looking place with good service but the food misses the mark. For brunch on Sunday we had an excellent bloody mary but that unfortunately was the best part of the experience. My Belgium waffle was dense and flavorless and the syrup that came with it was not much better. The side of bacon I ordered with it saved the day. Thick cut and crispy, it would have made a great sandwich.  My partner had the eggs benedict which was sub par as well. The eggs were actually cooked perfectly but the sauce didn't have the lemon \"bite\" she was used to and the muffin was not toasted enough. She used the word \"lackluster\" and was disappointed. The placed was packed with diners and  is a popular place but I doubt that this overpriced mediocre food is the draw.  I guess the location and bar might be.
