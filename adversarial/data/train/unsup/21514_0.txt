It sounded a little sad if I coming back to The Combine Eatery just for their hot sauces??!! But only if they have the XXX extra hot habanero... \n\nI don't know about you guys... but I found it a little boring to just eat Fish Taco here as there are so many different items offers in the menu. After twisting the arms of Vivek and Rafi I nicely convinced them to order Carne Asada (Beef) and Fried Shrimp Taco! And I have this special Jennifer K's Trio Combine Tacos ($14.95). \n\nFish - a little bland... I need to drown that in hot sauce... but it was fresh and if more seasonings would be added will make the taste more complex \n\nShrimp - has a great kick since it has sauces already.. a little sour, sweet and tangy... (thanks Vivek for sharing) \n\nBeef - really tender slow cooked in a tomato based... most filling of them all... (thanks Rafi for sharing) \n\nServices are excellent!! Separate bills?!! No automatic gratuities??! Accept All credit cards?! \n\nI want to be back and try out other food items on the menu..but I will probably skip their tacos.... \n\nI don't know why Tacos are so expensive in Toronto.. the Mexicans must be laughing and wondering why we paying so much for their street food...
