This is definitely an inner city hospital.  I'm used to the ones in the burbs. Security is tight, the emergency room is crowded, and you pay for parking. Not what I am used to, but I guess you probably shouldn't want to stay longer then you have too. The staff is great and doctors are awesome. The facility just needs a major facelift.
