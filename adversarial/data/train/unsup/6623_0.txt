I didn't even want to give them one star.  They ripped me off, charged me two times on my credit card and have yet to refund my money.\n\nThe technician forgot to turn on both units to activate the heat and then said the system was faulty.  In actuality it was just the inexperience of the technician.  Its difficult to get through and they rarely answer their phone.\n\nThis place is a scam and a ripoff.\n\nGive me back my money now!  Stay away.
