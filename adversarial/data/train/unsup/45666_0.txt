Fun and friendly little joint in Leslieville \/ Queen East.\nThe server was spot-on when she told us the wait for a table would be ten minutes, as we arrived around 11:30 am. No problems there :)\nAccommodated five adults plus a baby at the back booth.\nFood was served quite quickly and was hot and delicious.\nThey asked one of us what his choice of toast was, but did not ask me, which didn't strike me as odd until my plate showed up with white toast. No matter, just a small detail.\nAnother friend's dish had a broken poached egg, so upon serving it, the chef said he'd bring another egg, intact, in a minute :) Not necessary, but appreciated nonetheless.\nBottomless coffee and cute diner. For more loungy feel, I wonder if it would be best to go when they open, or at the tail end of brunch? Felt obligated to pay and get out after eating, as there were a few people waiting for a table.\nMost plates under $12. Will be back :)
