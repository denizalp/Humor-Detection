This place is a nightmare for anyone who has dietary restrictions. My company is in town for a trade show so I got dragged here. I was hopeful for a salad with no dairy (which they messed up) and a vegan pizza they promised to make gluten free which ended up literally being burnt crust a thin smear of red sauce and whole garlic gloves but none of the veggies the menu promised or hey any vegan \"cheese\" or toppings that most pizza chains in CA provide. All in all, I couldn't wait to leave and eat an actual dinner after I left the company dinner. \n\nI would recommend if you advertise a vegan friendly pizza you get \"cheese\" that is easily obtainable at any grocery store not made of dairy or soy and do more than a burnt shitty pizza. Pic to follow of the shame.
