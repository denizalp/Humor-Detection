Every time we walk by this place it is filled with Chinese people so we thought, hey, this must be the place to go... so we went.\n\nThere are so many choices... an Americanized menu and an \"authentic\" menu.\n\nWell, WATCH OUT if you order from the real Chinese menu. They are not kidding when they say spicy. I got the spicy chicken in pan -- check out the pictures for a view -- and it was so hot that I couldn't feel my mouth. Don't get me wrong, I love spicy, but living in Pittsburgh for so long, I was out of practice for this one. The best part of the dish was the flavor. I tasted so many actual spices, like parsley and garlic and pieces of what looked like all spice. It wasn't just a heap of soy sauce. My husband's dish was covered in delicious garlic and beautiful peppers--both green and hot.\n\nWe will definitely be back!
