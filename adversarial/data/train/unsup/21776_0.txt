The only thing this dental office is good for is a cleaning . I wish I could give 0 stars because that's what they deserve . I came in to get an old filling replaced because it broke . He said he could do it . Now when the day came to do the filling he had to take out the rest that was still in my tooth and drill a little to clean out the old filing layer . He instead drilled too deeply because he was partially distracted with the conversation he was having with his assistant and stopped when he saw blood, he showed this to me and said I would now need a root canal and crown - which he reassured me both procedures could be done by him in his office . How convenient!! Especially because I don't have insurance .\n\nHe put a temporary sedative filling and said I'd have to schedule the root canal and crown which I did . However , about three days later a big chunk of the sedative filling fell out ! Since there was no pain and the appointment was set for a few weeks away they didn't offer to refill it - even though I paid full price for it ! \n\nI couldn't afford the procedure and I vocally told them I was upset he drilled too deep .  Professionally when there is any risk during a procedure you are notified of it prior . There was none about possibly needing a root canal because the initial filling was too deep - because it wasn't ! Dr Quinn made a mistake but wouldn't own up to it . Beware of this dentist office . I am very disappointed in the service here .
