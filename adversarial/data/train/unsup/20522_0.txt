I brought the fam in today, chilling on the pisco's this time. No need getting trounced in front of the wife and kids. \nCeviche, steak and chicken dishes were fabulous and complimented the Modelo Dark, Inca colas and two lonely piscos. Or maybe it's the other way around, maybe the drinks complimented...oh whatever.\nAnd I can't forget the canchas.\nPeruvian corn nut like snacks, less crunchy and with a whole lot more flavor.\nGreat with pre-dinner drinks.\n\nThree flat screens hanging in the bar, all tuned to some kind of Peruvian TV were also very entertaining. Nothing like watching kickboxing during dinner, a loop of Machu Picchu on state run tv, and a latin soap opera. \n\nAlso, once more I got to practice my Spanish on the highly attentive and very friendly server, who was extremely patient with my Spanish tongue.\n\nDinner for six was $120 before tip. \nThe piscos are 12 bucks each, but you'll only need one for a great buzz. \nTwo will have the family screaming \"LOOOOOK  OUT\"  as you almost hit not one but two moving cars before winding your way through the parking lot and on out to Frank Lloyd Wright. \n\nDriving is such a fucking buzzkill.
