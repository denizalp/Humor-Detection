We recently moved from Cleveland to Tampa, FL.  We are extremely happy with our U-Pack experience.  They were reasonably priced and very punctual.  With text messages, they kept us informed as to pick up and delivery times.  We were able to track our cubes whereabouts via their website.  I highly recommend this service.  It was an awesome experience.
