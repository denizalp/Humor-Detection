Since we live only a few miles away, we wanted to try a local restaurant.   We should have left immediately when I noticed that only less than half of the tables were occupied at 7 pm on a Saturday night.  Word must have gotten around that Cafe 157 is overpriced and underwhelming.   The restaurant is positioning itself as an elegant dining experience based on the prices, but when the entr√©e arrived while we were still eating our salad, that was clue #1 that this was not to be an elegant dining experience. And the portion size is inadequate given the prices they are charging.  The food is average at best except for the dishes that are oversalted.  Stay away if you are looking for good food or value for  your dollar.
