I went to Vegas to do my annual jet-skiing and of course to spend a few days there as well.  I happened to come across this little restaurant.  Man, for such a quaint, cute, little place; it was big on service, cleanliness,and food.  The food was so yummy and very inexpensive.  This will be the only 2nd vietnamese restaurant that I will ever return when I am back to Vegas.  ^-^.
