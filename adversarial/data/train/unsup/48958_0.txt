As we sit here at the back of restaurant I can't help but think that every waitress in the place likes my behind. Every time one walks behind me, they say \"behind\". Imagine my flattery, up till the moment  My wife explained to me that they are announcing behind as we are seated at near the serving counter and didn't want another server backing into them. \n\nWell, I was feeling sexy for a moment!\n\nThis place rocks. Food is awesome and usually has live entertainment on the weekends.\n\nUpdate as of this date: This restaurant has gone to crap. Their Philly Cheese Fries used to be to die for. Today, they are literally about 50 cents per French fry. My wife and I have been ordering this side for years and have always been satisfied with the portion. Today the portion is likened to that of a order of fries from a kids happy meal. \n\nAs a twice a week customer (party of 6) we will not be back. \n\nUsed to be able to order a half order or a full order. Then they stopped the half order. As of today, their full order is half of their half order. Same price though as their full order. $13.00. \n\nBad management decision that lost a customer. Yes... i will post this review on every social media outlet I am affiliated with.
