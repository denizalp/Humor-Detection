The ranch is amazingly delicious. It has a great garlicky flavor and it's probably the best ranch I've ever had. \n\nI walked in 3\/3\/16 around 6:30 and placed a to-go order. I got a small calzone with pepperoni and fresh garlic, and an order of hot fingers and fries. I also got a couple extra sides of crack ranch, and my total was just about $22. The calzone was everything you could want from a 'zone. It was stuffed with ricotta, mozzarella, pepperoni and garlic and came with a side of \"sauce\" which is their marinara. It was hot and cheesy and delicious. I would definitely order this again, but next time I'd go easy on the garlic because I could have killed a vampire shortly after eating. \n\nAs for the fingers, you can see from my pix they half-assed the sauce and I basically ended up with plain fingers with a drizzle of hot. You can tell no fucks were given in the preparing of my fingers and although it's a fairly small issue, it's the principle of the matter. I spent $9.25 for fingers and fries and didn't even care to eat them after that.  Would I go back? Yes. That calzone was really good, but I will definitely check my order before I leave next time.
