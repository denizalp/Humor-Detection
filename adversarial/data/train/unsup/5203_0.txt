Could have put -5 stars if I could. \nSo I walk in and before asking for availability I say Hi and the answer I get is Im busy with other customer. Bye \n\nAre you kidding me !?? Couldn't you at least be kind enough to say I'll have opening in 1 hour, maybe tomorrow. Something nice , but no, then I said oh ok and how long would that take (I'm desperate for a massage right now) then she answers one hour. Meanwhile this lady comes in so she smiles and talK very nicely to her and took her inside. So I'm here like ok if she's busy with another client then where did the lady go ? Oh maybe cz I'm not from her country or I'm not her acquaintance so I shouldn't get the VIP treatment. I wouldn't recommend this place, going for a massage should be relaxing not frustrating.
