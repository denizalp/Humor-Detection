I finally had the pleasure of trying out McKoy's Smokehouse last night, after hearing from many people of the restaurant's awesome BBQ menu. \n\nMy wife and I got 20 wings to split, so that we could give multiple sauces a try (we're sauce people, don't judge). Side note: $.50 wing night on Thursdays during NFL games! Whoot whoot. We went with the buffalo, bar-balo, thai-chili & calypso.  Handsdown, my favorite was the Thai-chili, with bar-balo coming in as a close second. The wings were extremely tender, almost easily falling off the bone. They had a great smokey taste to them as well, which would be a little over-powering if you are expecting traditional wings where you just taste a sauce. Overall, these are some of the best grilled\/smoked wings I've ever had!\n\nSide wise, don't even waste your time with anything other than the Mac & Cheese. We made the mistake of ordering french fries, what a joke. $3.50 and they were about the size of a small order at a fast food joint. AND they weren't even that great to justify it. The mac & cheese, however, was a heaping mount of cheesy heaven.
