If you've ever driven past Camelview, seen a random line to the street and wondered why, then you should definitely stop in sometime and find out! Camelview is a movie theater that houses the hidden films that aren't necessarily true indie films, but unique enough they don't always make it to the major movie houses. Atonement is a movie that falls under this category. So is Midnight in Paris which is playing right now and I suggest you see it! The movies are funny, unique and typically award-winning but you won't find a Hangover II or Anchorman playing here. \n\nThis is the theater to choose for the movies are always a little quirky and ones you read about in the magazines but can never seem to find playing anywhere. The venue itself is an old school movie theater. There's nothing spectacular about it but there's nothing bad either. The seats are comfortable and the theaters are spacious. You can't find a bad seat in the theater and you'll never feel cramped or caged up. They serve the basic movie essentials and tickets are normal movie price. Camelview stands out for the types of movies they play and this is why you see the lines out the door.
