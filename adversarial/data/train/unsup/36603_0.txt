Had a terrible experience here the other day with an employee at the counter who seemed to care less and wouldn't even look up or communicate with me. I needed a new battery and he didn't know how to work the register when I asked him to run the card as a credit. Two young girls walked in and he jumped right up to help them even offered to put in their battery for them. I put my own in, in the parking lot and after I had black grease all over my hands, the manager said \"oh I should've offered you a pair of gloves.\" Not sure if that's a complementary service or if they charge for it, but I wasn't even offered. Called the corporate office and was told I would receive a call back and never did. Will never go here again!
