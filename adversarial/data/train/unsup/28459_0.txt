Even better than I remember! Parking was easy even on Friday night. Short wait to eat inside or we could have been seated immediately outside. We chose inside seating. The calamari was amazing and even the 9 and 6 year old ate some! We had the Puerto Penasco Carne Street Pie on thin crust and it was AWESOME. The kids ate their noodles with various toppings. The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating for our family of 5. It was great to come back to Phoenix and get enjoy one of our favorite places that's still rocking it!
