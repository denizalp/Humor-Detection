Great japanese inspired food! I was glad to see that their maki rolls werent drenched in mayonaise (like other americanized sushi restaurants). The crunchy kalbi beef roll was amazing! Im not sure how truly japanese it us, but the flavors were out of this world!\nA close second was the tempura shrimp, light citrus flavor and the shrimp was tender and delicious!\nWe will be back for more kalbi beef next time we are in Vegas!
