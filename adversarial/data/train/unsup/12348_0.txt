Ask me to get ramen and I'll probably say no. I usually have ramen twice a year. \n\nIt was about that time of the year and I decided on Jinya. This place may have changed the way I see ramen. \n\nI came here right when they opened. I noticed it started to fill up about the time we left, 4. \n\nI decided on the black ramen combo, which came with a salad and another side. I chose Chashu pork. The ramen broth was nice and light. I really enjoyed the thin noodles. This bowl was huge too. As I was eating, I felt like it kept refilling itself like in Harry potter. There was a good amount of meat, but not too much. The Chashu pork was also delicious! I absolutely loved the egg that came with it. The combo is definitely a bang for your buck kind of deal\n\n3-5 is when they have happy hour. I didn't actually get anything off the happy hour menu, but I'd be down to come back and try it sometime.\n\nThe service was pretty attentive. They made sure we were enjoying our food. When we were trying to decide what to get, the waiter brought over the sign for the new ramen they had, just so we could have an easier time deciding.
