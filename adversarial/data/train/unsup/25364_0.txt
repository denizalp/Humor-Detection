A new Chinese restaurant that recently opened. The menu is quite similar to other locations with the exception of some new dishes. The quality is also consistent with other locations as well. While the decoration looks nice but the structure seems to be like an open space with limited number of booth seats. It is a big restaurant with a lot of open seatings. While the service is decent, foods are delicious with generous portion at a reasonable price.  Highly recommended!
