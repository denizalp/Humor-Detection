If you are visiting vegas and tired of spending $20 on hotdog and fries at the hotels THEN this is the place you need to go so YOU CAN SAVE MONEY AND EAT GOOD!\n\nBest quesadilla ever!! So it's setup like chipotle were u can add your own toppings. \nAlso the quesadilla is HUGE!!!! You have ample choices of meat to choose from, veggies and rice and cheeses.\n\nThe food was muy bien...the price was right considering what Vegas was charging to eat at these other places. The service is quick, place is clean and ample drinks to choose from.\n\nBelieve me you wont be disappointed by eating here.
