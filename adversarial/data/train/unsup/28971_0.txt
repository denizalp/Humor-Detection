I like this location on my way to work.  I seldom order doughnuts here, but enjoy their healthy breakfast and lunch choices.  Their flatbreads and wraps are great.  Also, I'm not a coffee drinking, but love their iced tea.  Service has always been good, but is a bit better in the morning than it is later in the day.  Also is much busier in the morning.
