Select sandwich is located in my office building, so it's pretty convenient if you're looking for a quick, easy lunch. I've been told that they now carry gluten free bread, but since I am so paranoid about getting sick, I'd rather avoid the possibility of cross contamination and go for a salad. \nThe salads are not cheap, but they do give you a variety of lettuces to choose from (spring mix, spinach, iceberg and romaine) and there are a TON of toppings to choose from. The biggest issue I found was that the amount of toppings you get (I believe it's 3\/salad) is not really enough. I have concerns about meat from delis because they generally are processed with wheat so I stuck to kidney beans, chickpeas and tomatoes. The amount of beans was literally about a scoop and a half with a small plastic spoon. I requested more kidney beans and was charged an additional $0.50. I could buy a whole can for that price! \nI was worried about choosing a salad dressing where I couldn't read the ingredients, and the employee hauled out the massive bottle under the counter for me to read the ingredient list - that made me pretty happy! \n\nOverall, the salads are delicious, and in my non-gluten free days I remember their sandwiches as being pretty great too. They are expensive, but at least the food tastes good for what you're paying. I don't think I'd return unless I forgot my lunch again, but only because I don't like paying for something I can make at home for a fraction of the cost.
