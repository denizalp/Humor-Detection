The staff is extremely unprofessional and I am disgusted by the treatment I have received. I have consistently received an attitude from the office clerk April and she has caused me inconvenience on multiple occasions. I have tried to tolerate it for a while now and have found myself a new doctor shortly after my last visit. She turned me away after I drove all the way across town to make my appointment due to me not having one small piece of information that I know she could have easily looked up in the computer. Save your time and money!
