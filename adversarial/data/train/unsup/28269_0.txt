Got a flat tire couple of weeks ago and called them. I actually made a bad mistake and told them I wanted 19 inch tires over the phone, but I really needed 18 inch tires (measured the rim exterior instead of interior).\n\nAfter they realized my mistake, they were patient and still give me a good price on the 18 inch tires without charging me anything extra. I picked up my car a couple of days later and everything looked great!  The technician Anil was very good.\n\nWould definitely go back for future services!
