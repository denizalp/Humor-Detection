Yo! Dis place be needin' mo' couches, you know what I'm saaaaayin? I mean like its cool n all, but dayum these chairs be maaaaad uncomfy yo.\n\nHook me up with some comfy couches and I'm all over this joint. They got some mad good books up in here, like the biography of Danica Patrick - that dope NASCAR girl. Yeah man, this place tight.\n\nBut bring a cushion, cuz those chairs be hella no good. And don't bring a large group... they'll make you squish.
