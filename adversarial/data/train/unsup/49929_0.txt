I am sitting at MGM buffet right now having brunch at lunch hour. I think it is a disgrace to be compared to Hometown Buffet at quadruple their price. Tri tip was like rubber, and only seafood was dry roll with no fish and smoked salmon. Waste of money and time.  \n\nI am in a complete shock, as I was mistaken that a buffet on the strip cannot be THAT bad considering the name recognition and reputation of the hotel. Total disappointment.
