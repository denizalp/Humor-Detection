AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!\n\nThere should be an option for \"ZERO STARS.\"\n\nWant a new couch.  I call they beat best prices.. and local... sweet!\n\nI go in to a disorganized, unkemp store.  Greeted by Stephanie's (owner 1) daughter.  Very sweet, but unknowledgeable, \"sorry my Mom's on the phone.\" Literally 40 minutes later Stephanie comes out I tell her Chris (owner 2) told me on the phone they had a couch similar to the one I want to order to check out quality.  Turns out they didn't so I just wasted over an hour with drive and wait time (no apologies by the way). Then she just leaves me standing there to speak to another patron.\nOk, well I'm here and have 2 other bedrooms to fill, lets see what else is here.  Check out... everything is over priced compared to internet prices.  Go to \"clearance section.\"  I like this mirror, how much?  \"$500.\" Ok, well I found it here online for $298.\n\"Fine I'll match that [plus tax].\"  Ok, but this is a floor model, in the clearance section, with wear and glue stains. \"Oh they all come like that.\"  Ok, no  thanks, I'm out.\nSpeak with Chris again he can order couch I want and almost match best internet price and get it to me by next week (other internet seller waiting on more inventory, 4 weeks.)\nOk, Chris, deal.  I pay up front $2000, next week I get a call \"the one we had in stock has a tear, we have to order more be ready in 4 weeks.\"  Wow.. unlucky odds or bs sales technique???  Meanwhile I get a call from other seller who said he'd do $1900 free delivery and setup and said he would have before Boho b\/c he supplies other retailers.  I sadly decide to stick  with Boho since Chris seems like such a nice reliable guy. WORST PERSONALITY READ EVER.\n4 weeks later, nothing.  Multiple messages not returned.  5 weeks later... nothing. Finally Chris answers cell phone and tells me about being sick and he'll check \"and get right back to me.\"  Days go by... no call.\nI finally get someone to pick up phone in store.  Stephanie says she'll have Chris get back to me... excuse... she knows nothing about sale and Chris \"has been out sick.\"\nReally?  Was he in hospital? Because if not, an adut with the flu can pick up a phone!\n\nAfter leaving ~ 8 more messages, including \"if I do  not hear back I will be cancelling order and calling BBB... STILL TO THIS DAY NO ONE HAS CALLED ME BACK!!!\n\nWORST SALES EXPERIENCE EVER!!!  I WISH I HAD CHECKED REVIEWS, BUT IT'S A FURNITURE STORE, NOT A RESTAURANT, WHO COULD'VE EXPECTED SUCH AN AWFUL SERVICE?  HOW THEY STAY IN BUSINESS IS BEYOND ME!\n\n***I called LA furniture, they gave me best price and said I should have same couch in 2 weeks.
