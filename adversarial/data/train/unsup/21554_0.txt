This is a nice location near the house, easy to get into and out of with protected turn lanes and good lighting all around. Follows the basic store layout with produce, deli, bakery to the right and wine on your left. Then on to meats, dairy, juice, and other dairy. As you cross the store groceries progress toward wares becoming less edible until you end up in frozen foods. beer and seasonal goods up front as you head to check out.\nStore and grounds are clean and appear well kept. The staff I've met are generally younger and friendly. They are knowledgeable and helpful when responding to inquiries and requests for assistance.
