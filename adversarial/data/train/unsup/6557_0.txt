I read the review about this shop and decided to try it, called him on Sept.12, Mo told me to bring my vehicle on Tuesday (Sept.18), he also told me that it will take 2 hour to fix the problem (replacing a leaky power steering hose). I took half the day off from work, hoping the vehicle will be fixed in 2 hours as told by Mo.\nTook my vehicle to his shop as per my appointment, nobody was at the reception. Mo came after 15 minutes and asked me what I need, told him that I have an appointment about leaky hose. Obviously he never bothered to put me in his schedule (does not seem to keep one), told me he is busy and can't see it until 1:00 pm and even then wont be able to fix it by 4:00 pm \nThis shop is not organized and Mo has least concern for other people's time, they also don't accept customer supplied parts (I purchased the hose from NAPA), don't have any courtesy vehicle to drop\/pickup customers.\nFinally took my vehicle to CT and got the hose replaced within 2 hours.\nThis was my first and last experience with this shop, the job was a piece of cake yet he could not manage it. Imagine what would he do with a more complex problem.
