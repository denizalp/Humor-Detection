Went to the rainbow location. Eyes felt irritated while getting them on and the whole day..2 days later I couldn't even open my eyes. \nNever ever had pink eye in my life until now. \nThey need to be better about sanitation, I didn't see her once sanitizer her hands even after touching her cell phone then returning to my lash application. \nI've been out of work on and off for 2 weeks now. \nWorst 2 weeks of my life. Constant itching. \nWhen I called to notify them the girl said \"come in so we can take the lashes off\" anyone who works with eyes should know that people with pink eye are highly contagious and can't be anywhere near other people especially in an eye lash place!!! \nI can't begin to explain the annoyance of this. I just wanted to find someone who was good at lashes instead I got a disease from unsanitary application.\nWill not return cancelling my touch up not that there is anything to touch up. We have removed the rest of the lashes today& continuing my meds for my eye to hopefully get better. \nDo not go here.
