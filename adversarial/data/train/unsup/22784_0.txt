What a CHEAP club! There was one guy in a kilt who kept dancing next to us on the dance floor and being very obnoxious. The sad thing is that I didn't know he was wearing a kilt until I saw him at the parking lot when we were getting ready to leave. This was also the only club where I had to avoid eye contact with random guys because God forbid should you make eye contact with a guy, he will be on you like a lion on an innocent and defenseless little animal. =\/ Thank God we had guys around, but still, yikes!\n\nThe upside to this place:\nBartenders were fast and polite\nCool bouncer\nThe DJ played good songs including the ones a friend requested.
