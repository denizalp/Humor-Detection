Ordered the Avenger burger with fries for $16.99.\n\nThe Avenger comes with 2 beef patties, beef bacon, cheese, lettuce and tomato. It was a really great tasting burger with a lot of flavour. If you want a filling burger that  isn't just your average cheeseburger, than the Avenger is a must try.  The fries were also well seasoned and with a good portion given. \n\nThis Markham Road location is a bit bigger than their Lawrence franchise, but it's still relatively small in my opinion. It gets really busy during prime hours and after 8:00 as well. Don't expect them to make certain burgers (The Hurricane for example) that take them longer than normal to make when it's really busy. I wish that wasn't the case however, because if a customer is willing to pay and obviously wait longer  for the burger to be made, than I say their shouldn't be an issue. \n\nRegardless, I'm a fan of their food and i'll definitely be coming back to try their other burgers.
