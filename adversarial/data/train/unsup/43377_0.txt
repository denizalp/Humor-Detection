I was referred by my girlfriend to go meet Nathan about a piece I want to get done on my back. I showed him a family crest and some information and history about the piece I want done. Nathan answered all my questions and very responsive with txt as well. I'm ecstatic with the work when done. Very detail and clean. I'm definitely coming back again.
