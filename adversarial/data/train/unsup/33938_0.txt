I have to say I 'm not blown away at all. Appetizers aren't great. I have had better hummus at alladin's even if it's a chain. And honestly I usually don't respect places who charge for tahini and hot sauce. There main course is decent again not blown away at all but too overhyped. Only good thing about this place is the complimentary valet. Otherwise I would any day choose alladin's or taza. You would know these places if you are a Cleveland local!!
