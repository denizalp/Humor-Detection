Capstone to a disappointing night! My girlfriend and I barely got in before they locked the doors 3 hours early. They were out of soup and Mac & cheese, and I'm pretty sure the guy behind the counter was just being lazy. We took our sandwiches to-go, which was a bad idea, because once we unwrapped them, we found out that one of the sandwiches (the full montagu) was missing lettuce, tomato, and cheese (probably thought we wanted the half montagu, lol). The other sandwich (chipotle chicken avocado) barely had enough ingredients to make it worthy of a sandwich. We probably would have gotten our money's worth if we just ate our $13. Shame shame Earl. Never going back and will never recommend.
