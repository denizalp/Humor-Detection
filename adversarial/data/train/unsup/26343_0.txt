To start, a quick tip for first timers here, plan on spending some time here. Not because it's a massive store, or the wait for food takes forever, it's just that Defalco's is that popular and usually always packed. If you aren't happy about that, take it up with Guy Fieri. \n\nThat being said, I really do enjoy this nice Italian grocery. The food they put out is consistent which is pretty key, and it's just flat out delicious. It's traditional Italian food done traditional ways. This isn't Olive Garden. \n\nI usually get some ravioli or pasta for lunch here and afterwards buy some salami or sausage to take home along with some pasta. There are two really good traditional Italian grocery stores in Scottsdale, and this is one of them for sure. \n\nThe only downfall to this, is the previous mentioned popularity. It's not a big shop, it doesn't have a ton of seating and you feel a bit crammed while in line. There is definitely plenty of parking though. I would love to see them move to a bigger location and thrive more and be able to accommodate the crowds they usually accrue on any given afternoon. \n\nBottom line. Go here. Eat great food. Be happy.
