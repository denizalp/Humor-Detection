I love this place! You find everything and anything a nerd could ask for! Funkos, video games, 90's movies (VHS) Anime, movies, music, KPOP and all genres of music. Vinyls and actual vinyl music players. Nerdy gag gifts, supplies, from used to new items. Prices are reasonable, and you win loyalty as you buy stuffs! \n\nMy favorite is if you don't want a plastic bag, in exchange in the cost of a bag, they give you a puzzle piece to choose one of their 3 organizations you'd wish to donate to. Which is SO COOL! \n\nYou WIN!
