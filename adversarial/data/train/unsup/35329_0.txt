So this is the 2nd Chipotle restaurant I've been in.  I was shopping in the area and decided to stop here and give it another try.\n\nFirst plus, it was 2pm and it wasn't busy.  I hate standing in line. \n\n2nd plus...they have a list of popular menu option as you enter the door and then a large menu with large print above the prep station (wish Qdoba would take a lesson here).  \n\nSo I went with one of those popular menu choices - a fajita burrito.  I have to say, I was actually impressed with the flavors.  The hot salsa left my lips tingling which is a good thing with me.  The chicken, peppers and onions had great flavor mixed in with the guac and lettuce.\n\nI'm still not impressed with the decor of Chipotle - cheap looking tables and chairs with metal walls that make me think I'm in a metal shop somewhere.  But the food made a better impression on me this time around and I think I'd probably try Chipotle again.
