The Village Coffee Roaster (The Village) produces the most consistently fantastic coffee I've ever tasted.  If you chat up a barista I'm sure they'll tell you all about the precision that goes into their roasts -- it's amazing.  Coffee is truly done right here!  Be sure to try an espresso if you're passing by since their house blend is quite fantastic, but even if you're not an espresso fanatic their latte's, mocha's, etc. are all top notch.  You will not be disappointed!  \n\nAnd, Steve is totally correct, if they aren't sold out of Misty Valley it's a once-in-a-lifetime cup.  Very strong blueberry note as an espresso shot, with a rich finish like any good African single origin.  You'll be hard pressed to find anything like this anywhere else.
