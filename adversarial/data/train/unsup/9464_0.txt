I LOVE THIS PLACE. If you didn't notice me screaming this at the top of my lungs then yes, yes I did!  \n\nI love everything in it. My sister and I love coming up with new crafts and crazy fun thing we can come up with out of thin air.  We also like finding new ideas online then heading to Michaels, getting all the supplies and attempting to duplicate them at home. Sometimes they work and sometimes they go in the toy box for my daughter. \n\nEither way, we get our Starbucks, we grab a cart, we always have their great coupons and always have fun!
