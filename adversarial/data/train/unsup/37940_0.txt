I usually write my reviews after the meal but it's so good I have to write it while having the meal.\n\nLove this place and had every wrap except for veggie wrap. Who the heck eats that? Bunnies?\n\n#1 Steak with Brie Cheese wrap. the combination of cheese and steak cooked to perfection. So delicious. Get ready to get addicted!\n#2 Lamb wrap is a close second, it has mangoes in it! Crazy and delicious.\n#3 Pulled Pork - this is pretty good but the pork was a little dry. This is not bad but not amazing like the steak and the lamb.\n#4 Chicken - The chicken was flaky and had the same texture as the Pulled Pork but not as flavourful.\n\nOverall they are all good and this is the spot I am bragging to everyone about. Soups are really good as well.
