I was looking for a taquiera near my house and this was the first place on the list. All the reviews it had were 5 stars, so I had to try it. I got 3 Al Pastor and 3 Carne Asada mini tacos. I will say this place is legit! All the reviews are true! I will be definitely a regular. This place is really good!
