Not gonna lie, was sooo excited to possibly find a closer replacement for Katz's Deli but alas, I was left disappointed. I'll start with the good...I liked eating outside the deli in the fake Greenwich Village. Major props to the designer. So the BF ordered the pastrami reuben and when I took a bite, I immediately regretted not getting that instead. The gooey swiss cheese, sauerkraut, and pastrami was pure goodness sandwiched between two pieces of toasty marble rye bread. Why, why, why did I order a regular pastrami sandwich?! Without the swiss cheese and sauerkraut, the sandwich was pretty dry (even with mustard) and not nearly as big as it looks in pictures. Next time, I'm going for the reuben or beef and cheddar melt!
