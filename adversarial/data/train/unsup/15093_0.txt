This is a small bar and grill located in Old Town. I decided to order take out and seeing the 4.5 stars it made my decision up. The pictures of the food look great so let's do it! \nI went to the website but the menu page wasn't working so I had to search it down on fb. Most of the picture of food weren't on the menu.  I wouldn't have thought every pictures would be just the special of that particular day, but what do I know. \nI ordered the Coney and side salad with no onions. My husband ordered the Chipotle Bbq burger. They get less stars because:\n1. The menu had to be hunted down. \n2. I ordered my food without onions and instead, I got a smothering of them. Not only do I despise their crunch, but anything they touch, tastes like onions. \n3. My Coney had GOBS of mustard. It was disgusting and tried to scoop some of it off. \n\nThe burger was rated ok. Nothing bad, but nothing noteworthy. \n\nAlas, our search for pick up burgers continue...
