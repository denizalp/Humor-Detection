Do you remember when you didn't think El Torito was bad?  This was way back when it might not have been bad, before it was a big bad chain that had watered and fajitaed everything down to the lowest common gringo denominator--and yes, El Torito is Mexican food for gringos.  When's the last time you saw a Mexican family enjoying their dinner at El Torito, hm?\n\nGarcia's reminds me of Mexican food in the '80s.  No, it's not El Torito; it's actually much better and more authentic than El Torito, even early El Torito.  Everything here reminds me of childhood:  the food, the fresh chips, the darkness, the decor, the servers' outfits, my mother's insistence on ordering fajitas.\n\nI get the sense that there are various locations in Phoenix and that back in the day Garcia's might have been on the verge of expanding beyond Arizona and becoming the next El Torito.  Thankfully, it didn't.  Thankfully, nothing changed, ever.\n\nI was thirty-seven-years-old sitting across the tiled tabletop from my parents, but I might as well have been seven, and maybe my brother and sister were just in the bathroom or sitting with our cousins at another table.  No one sang \"Happy Birthday to You,\" but people--my parents?--did order margaritas, and there were Latino-looking families enjoying themselves here.\n\nMaybe it is watered and gringoed down.  But I don't think so.  It's more like a time machine that deposits you directly in 1984.
