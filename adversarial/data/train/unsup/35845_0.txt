There's alot more to Hoop City than the facility.  My son's been practicing and playing in leagues there since Spring 2016.  He came in a novice and has developed strong basketball skills, good sportsmanship, and now has a huge love for the sport - basketball is his life!  Jermaine is my go-to guy for scheduling, payments, and a good laugh.  He works around the clock, always with a smile and treats us like family.  The entire coaching staff has been great to work with.  They employ the tough love approach with the kids.  Constructive feedback will be given, but Coaches Kenny, Shay, Dedan, Imperial, and Trey genuinely care about each child.  They offer praise when hard work bears fruit. I've even seen them run out on the court and pick injured kids up.\n\nGame schedules have historically been sent last minute, but the Hoop City coaches have done a great job of improving communication.  They now post schedules online and set up group texts with all parents of team members.      \n\nYes, it's hot in the summer, but it's better than playing in the direct sunlight.  It feels great in all of the other seasons of the year!  They recently made some improvements in the restrooms by installing soap and paper towel dispensers.  \n\nDon't let the negative talk about the facility deter you from checking the  Hoop City basketball programs out.  If you're looking for a place to help a child improve their basketball skills and nurture a love for the game, this is the place to be!
