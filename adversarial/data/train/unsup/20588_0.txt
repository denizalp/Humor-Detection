This new location, OMG On The Park, makes my heart sing. Their usual sweet and savoury treats, along with coffee and all of the cute is a welcomed addition to the hood. Their peach bum bench sitting amongst the condos brings me so much joy. Seriously. Go to here. \n\nYesterday, I cleared this OMG location clean of their great, gooey pop tarts to surprise a non-profit office with breakfast. I'm sure glad I did. Their homemade pop tarts are delicious, and always make people smile. Need a smile? Like I said... Go to here.
