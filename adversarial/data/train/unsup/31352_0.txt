I don't have any problems with the doctors.  I see Dr. David Smith and Dr. Andy Tran.  They're fine, although especially with Dr. Smith, one never sees him even close to the appointed time.  The most frustrating thing about CVC is trying to contact them by phone for purposes of scheduling or re-scheduling an appointment, for example.  Good luck with that!  I've talked to them about the problem and no-one seems to care.  It's so bad that I have seriously considering never to go back.  Look at all the other reviews stating the same thing.  I'm not alone.
