Great food here. We were visiting from South Carolina and wish we had a place like this at home. I would drive back for the crispy rice tuna appetizer alone! I also tried the shishito peppers and the Chizu ramen which was very unique and tasty. The ramen bowls are large but they will pack any leftovers to go. Service was fast (appreciated since we had our four month old baby with us) and friendly. We also enjoyed being able to eat on the patio. Great spot!
