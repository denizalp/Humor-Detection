Oh so wanted a benny for breakfast and after reading the reviews and seeing the photos I decided to walk a mile and half to this place for breakfast. It's really cool and the waitstaff is super friendly. I felt like I had been time warped to a Vegas way before I was born and have expected to see a hung over Elvis dining there. The food was good and with the prices so outrageous on the strip this was more affordable. My benny wasn't the best I have ever had but I enjoyed the moment in a funky environment. The service was fantastic-and I wondered how is the waitress so perky this morning- I had too many champagne cocktails at Absinthe and Fizz the night before. Viva Las Vegas!
