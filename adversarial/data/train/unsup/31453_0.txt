All I want to say is: \"Lot of grains hot cakes\"\n\nOrder it. Eat it. You can thank me later. \n\nThis is literally a hot 'cake' - baked, fluffy, grainy, crispy in the edges, lightly sweetened, and topped with crunchy oatmeal. Oh man! My 3 year old foodie devoured this. And by that I mean she ate a third of it. She's only 3. The hubby, mom and I ate the rest because you don't just leave that wasting on the table. \n\nService was good. The food takes some time to make so order some coffee or drinks and be prepared to wait for a bit. \n\nThe coffee was a 2 on a scale of 1-10 (10 being the best). I would stick to their cocktails or water. \n\nI ordered soft scrambled eggs - they were made beautifully. Perfectly whipped and scrambled it was like eating soft butter. The hubby for the chilaquiles and it came with a delicious green salsa. My meal had a side of toast and this berry pur√©e that was so delicious my daughter ate it with a spoon.
