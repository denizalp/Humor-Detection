After 2 weeks of emailing trying to book a facility tour and get a few questions answered (and NO response), we decided to drop in and just do it on the spot.\n\nThe girl at the front desk was hurrying, trying to get us to go through everywhere without any real time to ask questions or actually enjoy the tour.\n\nAt the end she didn't even talk about prices until we asked and then she said she was still busy with a few other guests and to come back if we decide to join.\n\nI was extremely disappointed with the whole experience, so on our way home we stopped off at Yonge St. Fitness Center (Isabella and Yonge) afterwards, and joined on the spot (after our GREAT tour!)\n\nTOO BAD YMCA, YOU LOST OUT ON TWO MEMBERSHIPS!
