Wow! Amazing.  I found Mary Ann with a Groupon.  She was the best priced groupon in my area and had appointments available not too far out.  Let me tell you - never judge a book by its cover.   Don't let her age fool you into judging the talents of this hair artist.  She is sweet as can be and hair is her lifes passion.  Her prices are more than reasonable and you will feel as though you should have paid 3x or more what you were charged.  She has learned from the best - In conversation I found out she studied with a Bay Area renowned stylist that my mother used to hair model for.  She truly cares about her clients and her work is spot on.  I have grown my hair out from being shaved - it was boring and frumpy to me now.  I asked her for something trendy & edgy and boy did she deliver.  I LOVE the cut and the purple highlights she did are excellent.  I will ALWAYS come see Mary Ann moving forward and refer all my friends.  She truly is a master stylist and it was a blessing to have found her.  Look no further - she's the REAL DEAL.
