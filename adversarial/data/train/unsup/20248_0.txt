fantastic dumplings. got some type of steamed dumpling and i can't even remember the filling. i am sure they are all good. best to go with 4 people and split 3 orders of dumplings. 15 dumplings per order. i think it was like $8.50. \n\nthis place was packed. the weird thing was that it was 100% white people in the middle of chinatown. \n\nup there with the best thing we ate on the trip.
