Massive tooth ache on a Saturday evening at 7. Worst possible pain at the worst time. I did an organic search and found a referral to Brennan dental, called them, and they told me to get right over. Dr Nichols was on call and my attending dentist. He and his staff were able to slow me down(racing heart ) and give me the emergency attention I needed. After completing the procedure, I was given a comprehensive plan with him moving forward, and a referral to a specialist. My dentist is in Show low and this kind of home town attention from Brennan Dental gets five stars.
