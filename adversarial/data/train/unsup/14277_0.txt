The Good:  Who doesn't like A&W root beer.  Hey if you are anywhere near this joint there are not many food options so this might be a good choice.  Basic fast food, blah blah blah.  I went with a crispy chicken sandwich, okay, nothing fancy.  They do have a root beer tap and serve you your root beer in a frosted mug, this alone is worth going here.  Oh yeah, grab a root beer float too, you'll take me later :D\n\nThe Bad:  Slim pickings here.  If you don't go to a mom and pop place around here then I would say go here.\n\nThe Ben:  Sure the refills are free, just make sure you are close to a restroom.  Same rules apply here as to real beer, once you break the seal it's game over.
