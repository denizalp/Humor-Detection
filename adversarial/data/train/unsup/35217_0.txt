Their customizable noodle bowls are very popular, especially with the fish broth. Pretty large portions and they also come with HK-style drinks. The spicy broths are very good (Malay laksa or white pepper and ginkgo). The place is clean and efficient. Good for medium-sized crowds. Haven't tried any of their other dishes though, even though I've been here a few times. The only thing is that with the complimentary tea, the soup, and the accompanying drink, you'll definitely need to use the washroom right after eating, lol.
