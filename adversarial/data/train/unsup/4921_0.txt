The service was fantastic; friendly and attentive but we did not feel pressured to order. The coffee was really good. I got the chicken and waffle for brunch and it was okay. My chicken was a little over cooked and dry,but I was so hungry I didn't want to send it back. I also thought it had way too much powdered sugar! I would return to try something else because I like the atmosphere and I really liked the staff!
