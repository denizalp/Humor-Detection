Went back again believing my experience may have been different but turned out worse. The head manager there, Leona, is such a B*TCH! She has no respect for anybody but herself it seems and when I asked where an item was, she looked at me with disgust and rolled her eyes and then proceeded to ignore me. I'm going to make a complaint to the BBB because their customer service is horrendous. I'm just shocked at how rude these people are. I've never been to a store where everyone was rude and disrespectful. I'm never shopping here again.
