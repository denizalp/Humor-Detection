Oh Rhapsodielle, moving here from Los Angeles, I'm so glad you have locations here in Las Vegas.\n\nThis place is a good alternative to your typical Forever21, Wet Seal, Charlotte Russe, and even H&M. Prices here are way better. A white collared short sleeve button up cost $19.99 at H&M and I found a very similar one here for $10. \n\nI don't know how some of you girls say after 2 washes, the item falls apart. How do you girls wash your clothes!?! I've washed my items a couple times already and everything is still in tact (buttons, threads, zippers, colors etc). \n\nThis place is my go-to store for business attire. Many different styles and colors of blazers, different styles and colors on slacks. So far, everything I buy is true to size.\n\nAnd like what other reviews have said, this is a dressing room. Literally. No personal stalls...just one big room with mirrors all across. So if you're wearing some undergarments that cannot be seen in daylight by others, i suggest to come back and shop on a different day. Nothing like being embarrassed of \"girl week underwear\"....you know what I mean?! ;)
