Last night we ordered food for pick up. It was very busy that evening. But when I stood near the front podium where they seat people and the counter you pick up orders from I was ignored for ten minutes. After saying to manager that I'm just picking order up she walked away. and then when she  came back just didn't acknowledge me. The bartender I'm assuming who seemed to be in charge of bar and pick up counter also ignored me the whole time until i yelled excuse me I just need to pick. Up order I called in he turned looked at tickets and grabbed what he thought was my order handed it too me witch by the way the bag was sealed and sitting on counter the whole time I waited. I get home and the order was wrong. General chicken shouldn't have shrimp in it. So I brought it back. The manager whining noted me earlier goes thru the good and tells me it's correct order !!! No I feel like a dummy so I leave the testurant to bring food home. The same food I got the first time, we finally open the top of container it was see threw and yup that's shrimp and honey chicken. Not what we ordered so we call the restaurant they want to bring us the right order but by this time an hour has passed foods cold my wife whom is pregnant and about to have baby any day is starving as am I. So we told them we wanted refund witch they did give us. But what a hassle. Hence I will never go back to dragon wok again. Ohh and the sweet and sour chicken was right but they cover the chicken in the sauce instead of serving the sauce on the side with crunchy chicken you get soggy sauce drenched chicken. The part that pissed me off the most was while I was being ignored another waiter was asking where to bring drinks to and that bartender looked right at me eye contact and said no not him around the corner behind me. At that point I finally yelled for his attention!!!!'   Don't waist time or money here !!!!' Hot wok is better and cheaper and right down the street.....
