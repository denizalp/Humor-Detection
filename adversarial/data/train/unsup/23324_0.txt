This is a huge spa located in the Venetian hotel. I was there last June so this review is overdue - wanted to get it on my spa list.\n\nWhen I went, the \"main\" reception area, before you go further into the spa and enter the \"sub\" reception areas, was like grand central station - I do not exaggerate. In fact the whole place was pretty much that way, although they do have a lot of people working there and they keep things moving smoothly. \n\nI had just flown in very early that morning and I was ready for a several hour spa visit, starting with soaking and sauna and segue-ing into a 90 minute facial and brow wax. \n\nThe locker rooms are busy but clean, the robes nice and fluffy and the soft rubbery thongs felt good on the feet. The decor and atmosphere in the saunas and jacuzzis is brightly lit, stark white tile with a little blue here and there, feeling and looking more like a sports club or community center than a spa. Service is excellent and there's plenty of fresh cold water and fluffy towels.\n\nThe waiting area for the facial was slightly more relaxing, dimly lit with comfortable seating areas where you could relax and rest your body. However, the staff were gathered around the front desk gossiping and I found this super annoying (remember it was my first day and I hadn't relaxed yet). I just could not block them out. My aesthetician was great and I found a polite way to ask her if they had a break room, and she said they did but that it was very far away. \n\nThis is the classic error made by most modern hotels. They don't provide adequate facilities for their staff, so the service and guests ultimately suffer. I've seen this problem in the best hotels and it never ceases to befuddle me.This wouldn't prevent me from going back to Canyon Ranch. The services are really excellent. But it's a spa to go to for the services - NOT to relax.
