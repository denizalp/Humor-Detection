Sometimes Bell the company really pisses me off, but this Bell location has some of the best customer service I've experienced anywhere, let alone for a mobile provider. \n\nToday I went in to add another phone for a not-yet-Canadian to my plan. I was terrified this was going to be very tricky, and that some long-time-ago missed bill was going to keep this from being possible, and that it was going to be really expensive and painful. Hell, I even wondered if they were going to call immigration. (I can be a paranoid Polly, it's part of my charm.) \n\nWhat transpired was nothing like I pictured. For $0 we got a new phone, a bundled family plan and I didn't need to add a long contract to our phones. We were in and out in under 30 minutes, and we even got to choose his phone number. 416, yo. None of this 647 BS. \n\nBrenda, you're the best. You're a boss. You're our BFF for life.
