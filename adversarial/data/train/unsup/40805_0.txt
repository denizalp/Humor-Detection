I drove past this place for over a year not knowing what it was. I didn't even know it was a chicken tender place.  This has to be the worst name for a franchise. It doesn't portray what is being sold there. At one of the 51's games I received a $5 off coupon so decided to try it. The chicken tenders are absolutely amazing. Probably the best I've ever had. The chicken is moist and tender (never frozen) and they have a bunch of different dipping sauces that are great! The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because of the name of the place not being able to identify what is being sold there. The food and service are definitely five star. The employees are friendly, helpful and serve the food with a smile. Try this place out.
