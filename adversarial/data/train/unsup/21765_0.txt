This was my go-to dealer after dealing with the incompetent staff at VW North Scottsdale.  That is until I needed to have a major item replaced that is still covered under warranty.  I had hesitation to have such work performed on my vehicle, but was ensured that everything would be handled correctly.  Once I picked my vehicle up, I noticed that there were several trim pieces on the interior of my vehicle that were scratched, some even having deep gouges.  I immediately drove the car back into the service area to disclose my findings.  Both the service advisor and manager were speechless.  Not only did they incorrectly install the major component on my vehicle, they also neglected to replace some parts leaving holes exposed, and of course the scratches.  I was assured that they would fix the issues and that everything would be as good as new.  After contemplating legal action, I decided to have them fix their so-called work and take it from there.  The management staff at this dealership refuses to take responsibility for what they have done, instead they basically made me feel as though they did me a favor(!)  And then I received a phone call from \"management\" after the fact, where they stated to me that my vehicle may have already had those scratches prior to my bringing it to their dealership!  So not only was it a slap in the face for the damage they caused the first time around, but no to insinuate that I may have done the damage myself!  This is the kind of treatment this dealership believes in when dealing with a serious situation such as this.  I had no choice but to contact VW North America and speak to the office of the president.  Hopefully they will straighten out this mess and this dealership's holier than thou attitude.  I will NEVER bring my vehicle back to this dealership, or give any Chapman dealership my business.  I would rather return to VW of North Scottsdale then ever return here!
