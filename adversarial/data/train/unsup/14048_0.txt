No free item in exchange for my review (During their Grand Opening, free mini cone was given out in exchange for a post or review on Social Media)\n\nI love Matcha and was excited that this new Matcha Tea & Dessert opens at Commerce Gate. \n\nOn a Wednesday afternoon, this place was not busy. I was debating what to order, the friendly staff suggest the twist: Matcha and Red Bean. I wanted to get the mini size, but since I want that in a cup, he said only in regular size ($6). \n\nThe soft serve looks good for the photo. I do like the texture: heavy and denser compares to others and it took awhile to melt. What it is lacking though is taste. I know most Asian dessert of trying to make it not too sweet but the flavour profile was just off! Maybe Red Bean and Matcha does not work together? There was this smokey after taste of me just having a cigarette! \n\nThe staff was nice enough to ask me how was it. I did tell him the truth and he mentioned that they uses Taiwanese Black Sugar as sweetener. This might be the problem since this type of sugar though is a healthier option but has a more smokey-malt taste to it. And the different in texture is probably from the molasses of the sugar.\n\nHopefully, Matcha Tea & Dessert would work on a better tasting profile as personally I don't think that having a smokey after taste is the way to go for soft serve!
