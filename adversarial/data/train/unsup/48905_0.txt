Stopped in for a beverage at the bar, and was amazed at all the people having the Butcher's Board (charcuterie). It seemed to be more food than I wanted, so I opted for the Buffalo Shrimp appetizer with Bleu Cheese aioli. I couldn't have picked better. I gobbled it up, and was seriously tempted to lick the plate.\n\n5 stars for the appetizer, 0 stars for the fruit flies that seemed to be everywhere.\n\nStill, I will do it again next time.
