I was looking for a place that could hold a reservation for a group of 10 and this place was an excellent choice. For the first time, I have used yelp reservation online, it was quick, easy and super cool - few clicks and the place was reserved! The atmosphere inside is fun and friendly, it is a bit more noisy than your average restaurant\/bar, you hear sake bomb shout outs quite often. The tasting menu is great, you get to try different dishes which include meat, fish and greens too. If you add a big 1 liter mug of Sapporo beer to that meal and you're all set for a perfect evening with friends or colleagues.
