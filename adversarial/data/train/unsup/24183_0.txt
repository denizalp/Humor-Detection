We ordered the shrimp taco dinner and ground beef burrito for 30. \n\n- Nice atmosphere. Great jazz music. Cool tequila bar. But feels far from authentic Mexican.  \n- Cold chips with our first serving and crispy hot our second. inconsistent. \n- Only one salsa dip!? LOL. Salsa fail big time. \n- Server said shrimp taco was his favorite. Pretty average. Comes with Mango. Not something I'd pay $15 again for. \n- Corn tastes as if were canned or maybe frozen.\n- Optional: order burrito fried. cool. \n- Burrito is short and stubby. The ground beef reminds me of that in a Chinese egg roll. \n- Service was pleasant. Great with refills. Watch it though,..\"Any more boxes, LADIES\" WTF...\n- Spoiled with great Mexican eats in Los Angeles and San Diego, this place taste like an over-priced Baja Fresh. City Center Charlotte will sure disappoint you when it comes to Mexican food. Chevy's would be a better alternative. haha. ouch.
