We actually came here since Café de Cebu down the street ran out of Lechon Kawali (Filipino style fried crispy pork belly.) How dare they, right?! Our friend (Jeff V.) wanted to take us on a Filipino food tour and since Café de Cebu couldn't deliver - we gave this place a shot! It's an added bonus that they are open from 3PM until 4AM and serve food throughout their business hours - perfect for all of those late nights and early Vegas mornings.\n\nA family-run business; they quickly helped us feel right at home. Still basking in their grand opening a month ago, the waitress Crystal and owner Rocky were full of personality and really sweet. The ambiance here is like your typical legit Filipino spot - casual, dimly-lit and homey; almost like you're dining in someone's home but fitted with: hip music (top 40\/EDM\/Filipino hits), a dance floor, strobe lights and a full wall projector with speakers for all of your entertainment, dancing and Karaoke needs. Unfortunately no one in my party had the guts to sing, so we went straight to business and ordered a slew of authentic goodies!\n\nLechon Kawali (Filipino style fried crispy pork belly) $11 - This dish always seems to run out at great Filipino joints, so get it while you can! We ended up ordering 2 rounds! My whole party enjoyed the roasted, deep fried, extra crispy fried pig belly (it was slightly overcooked, so a little dry) but their house made vinegar sauce took this dish to another level! It helped add some moisture back to the pork belly and you will want to dip everything in that sauce! 4\/5\n\nOriginal Pork Sisig (Deep fried pork belly chopped with onions and jalapeno) $13 - Served on a sizzling platter, this dish stayed piping hot and delicious! I enjoyed the subtle acid of the vinegar which created a nice layer of flavor and the texture of the pork belly was extra crispy! I also liked the flavor that the jalapeno added to the dish! 5\/5\n\n\"Wet Pussy\" Creamy Garlic Mussels (Green half shell green mussels baked with garlic and cream, served on a sizzling platter.) $12 - It's pretty sad when none of your friends believe you when you tell them - that's the actual name of the dish written on the menu! LOL! Guys. I'm for real not making it up. We ended up having a lot of fun with it in restaurant though. :p It was bubbling hot, super creamy and garlicky! It's a nice variation of the classic Japanese version of baked mussels that most of us are use to. My party inhaled it even though we were all stuffed! 4\/5\n\nBihon Guisado Con Lechon (Bihon noodles stir-fried with garlic, vegetables, shrimp and lechon kawali (fried pork belly) $11 - This is my first time having Bihon noodles and it wasn't bad! Jeff V. really liked it and gave it his thumbs up. I honestly prefer the clear \"Pancit\" type of noodles - but the flavor of this dish was good. 3\/5\n\nGarlic Fried Rice (Jasmine rice fried with garlic and egg bits) $8 - The rice was lightly aromatic, but super moist. My party enjoyed eating the rice with the lechon kawali - great combination! Only a minor complaint is that I wish the garlic bits were fried a little more brown to offer more garlic flavor and it could definitely use more egg! 3\/5\n\nWe ended the evening with Halo Halo (traditional Filipino style dessert) $5 - Their version is not like a traditional halo halo topped with ice cream. It's served in a clear plastic cup and topped high so it was slightly difficult to get to the goods down below. Also my party all agreed that there was far too much ice; it was hard to enjoy the sweet flavor and texture of the toppings and we sure missed a nice scoop of creamy ice cream on top! 2\/5\n\nYou bet we stuffed our bellies to the max and we'll be back soon! The environment is a great spot to bring all of your foodie adventurers to dine family-style, sing, dance and laugh the night away!
