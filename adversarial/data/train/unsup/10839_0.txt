If you are a Yelper, chances are better than good that you appreciate cool kitchen stuff. Williams-Sonoma is the Disneyland of cool kitchen stuff, and the weekend before Xmas I went out in search of gifts like any good procrastinating guy. The store was bustling and busy, but the staff were great and very helpful. They had samples of this amazing hot chocolate that puts Starbucks to shame. My brother and I were arguing about what a weird little tool did, and we found an employee named Claudia, who was friendly, funny, and helpful. She explained what it was for, which sucked, because it meant my little brother was correct, which pains me to no end. Claudia had some great tips on cooking gadgets, and really made the shopping experience fun. Well done WS!
