This hotel is amazing! I was a little unsure about staying at a LaQuinta, but it's for a business trip for my boyfriend. This property is just over a year old. The rooms are huge and beautiful for the price. The staff is very friendly and the breakfast selection is huge! Free shuttle to the strip, town center, and airport are very helpful.
