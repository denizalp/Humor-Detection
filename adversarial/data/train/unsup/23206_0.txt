Gah this place makes you feel so healthy, like you could run eight miles carrying a baby elephant. It is confusing for new people, you have to order in the far back of the store, and pay back there as well. The part of the store where you have tables to eat isn't manned a lot, so in theory people could eat and run without paying :(.\nThis is a RAW food cafe, meaning that the food you get is NOT cooked. That's what raw means...so you've been informed. \nMy friend took us here to try it out, she got the Italian Sampler and I chose the 'Cheese' Burger. Everything is made with organic veggies and vegan almond cheese, along with live bread (which is NOT cooked, dur). The cheese was a little dry for my tastebuds, it kind of overpowered the flavor of the bean sprouts and excellent house made catsup and mustard. The bread was really tasty, and the fries are slices of avocado rolled in what looks like crumbs served with the catsup (SO GOOOOD!) Every plate comes with a garnish of bean sprouts and a slice of apple and orange to cleanse your palate. \nMy friend really liked the pasta she had, which was really zucchini, and the lasanga, but the toast with the tomato and cheese was overpowered by the cheese as well, but still very tasty.\nWe got boxes of fudge to go, which is nuts, oats, honey and carob chocolate squares, not at all dry but very moist and sweet. \nI want to go back and get a bowl of their soup and a smoothie sometime!
