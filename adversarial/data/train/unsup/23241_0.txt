This Review Brought to you by the Letter \"L\"\n\nBobby C's has become somewhat of a tradition for us on Light Rail Pub Crawls.  We found them by accident the first time when my friend shoved me off the train and I almost got left behind....\n\nThe first time we went in, they seemed excited to have our business and we were almost sad to go.\n\nThe second time they had live music playing, and they wanted to charge a cover.  Since we were only there for one drink, we were about to pass, when they offered us the VIP room.  Basically, they stuck us in a dining room that's not connected to the main bar.  But they brought us our own bartender and hooked us up. \n\nBased on the first 2 visits, my review should be higher, but then we went on Friday.  Ok, so a group of 20 already somewhat intoxicated people are somewhat daunting.  Plus - they waived cover if you had an active light rail pass.  Minus - they segregated us into the back room again.  \n\nWhat really gives them this ranking, is that we were drinking the alphabet and were on the letter \"L\" (bet you didn't see that one coming.)  So we ordered Lemondrops - see they start with the letter L - now it all becomes clear.\n\nOk, not sure what planet they got these \"lemons\" from - but my god they were terrible.  Ass drops was more like it.  I mean, horrible.  I can't even describe the taste.  We tried dumping sugar into them, no help.  Finally, we poured sprite into the drinks and by plugging our noses, were able to choke them down.  Well, I drank Brian's in addition to my own (I wasn't gonna waste the booze!)\n\nWe felt pressured to stay, but with no music, no entertainment at all and no decent drinks, we had to boogie back to the train.  \n\nWill Bobby C's stay on our rotation, possibly, as it's such a tradition now, I'm just glad we have stops before and after it!
