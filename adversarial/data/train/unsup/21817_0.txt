A good friend mentioned that San Antonio's had $1 margaritas on Thursday nights... we just had to find out if it was as good as it sounded.  \n\nI was running a bit late, but everyone had been seated at a table in the corner.  The restaurant wasn't busy at all and the server greeted me pretty quickly once I sat down.\n\nAfter munching on some chips and salsa, it was a little difficult to flag our waitress down since we were still waiting on a couple more people to join us.  I think she thought we were going to wait to order once everyone got there.\n\nI got the margarita with the extra shot, but it was accidentally given to one of my other friends.... no biggie, but the waitress looked a little confused with which margarita was which.  This didn't exactly give us confidence that she would get our food orders correct either.\n\nFor dinner, I had the red chili pepper salmon salad with habanero mango vinaigrette.  The size of the salad was gi-normous, but I managed to eat it all, including the highlight:  a half piece of buttery goodness corn bread.\n\nOverall the night was an enjoyable one.  Our server, wasn't the fastest... but she kept our glasses refilled.  The lighting bothered me just a bit since it felt almost cave-like.  I guess it would have been a nice setting for a romantic date, but it was just a big group of friends trying to find each others faces in the dark.
