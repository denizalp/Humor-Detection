I left this restaurant a few hours ago, and I don't think I'll ever come back.\n\nWe split a 10\" pizza, and it was the most bland, flavorless pizza we've ever had. I only had 1.5 slices and just left the restaurant. If I can't finish more than two slices of a pizza, there's definitely something wrong. It was beyond undercooked like you have no idea.\n\nThere was also an older guy singing Frank Sinatra songs - and it was just horrible. He couldn't sing, period.\n\nThere's so many great Italian restaurants out in Vegas. Even though our waiter was cheerful and friendly, don't waste your time with this place.
