I stayed at The Gramercy Residence over the weekend for my cousins birthday and I must say wow! What a beautiful property...clean, very well kept and great food options nearby. The pool area has a TV and lounge chairs inside the pool, the best thing about the pool was that is wasn't crowded like all the hotels on the strip are, I hate that! Ray (the manager) was great! Very nice, professional and knowledgeable. Only about 15 minutes from the strip so it's perfect! Our group had a blast, thank you Ray!
