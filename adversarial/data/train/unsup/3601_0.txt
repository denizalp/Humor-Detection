Quality breakfast had at Colados Coffee and Crepes. The service was great and the atmosphere was comfortable, even though it was very busy today.  The chocolate chip and white chocolate helados were tried as were the nutella and peach crepes.  Both helados were tasty and provided an added boost to the day.  The nutella crepe was super sweet and tasted great. Just make sure your sweet tooth is in full effect for this dish. The peach crepe was very good and the almonds really added a nice touch. Very impressed by how well this restaurant is run.
