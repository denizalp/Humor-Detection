I love the new and improved Frank and Albert's! Over the years, I've frequented Frank and Albert's and always enjoyed my meal and experience. It was always a solid good time. Just recently, they reopened their doors with a renovation, so I was eager to revisit to see if it was the same or better then it was before. The answer is...both the same and better!\n\nI'll first start with the decor. The new decor is nice. It's trendier and newer and not just your typical diner experience anymore. They created a sun room of sorts, so you can eat inside with the feel of outside but you won't have to worry about the weather since you're actually inside! The patio remains the same with new and improved patio furniture and the fire place (my favorite part) still remains! \n\nNow on to the food. The food is much like the original food, but has some new improvements. I went with the sandwich and holy moly bread. I think it was about a loaf of bread in one sandwich but no necessarily a bad way! A cone full of sweet potato fries accompanied the sandwich and were the perfect mix. The sandwich was too large to eat in one sitting but each bite was tastefully delightful! When I got my meal, they provided me with normal ketchup and Frank and Albert's house made ketchup. I gave the house made ketchup a chance just to see what it was like but unfortunately it didn't quite live up to Heinz expectations.
