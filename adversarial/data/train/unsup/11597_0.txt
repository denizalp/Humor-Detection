Meh, to say the least.\n\n1. I've heard good things about White Castle but can understand the reviews.\n2. Food is cheap but it's cheap because of the portions.\n3. Got a cheese slider and the patty was literally a slice of meat. The patty was super thin and the slider was really soft and mushy.\n4. Also had their cheesecake on a stick and this was super frozen. The cheesecake flavor and texture was there but it was tiny.\n5. Good place for snack, not meal.
