Finally tried Papa Johns tonight and I really, really wish there was more I could say. We ordered a large pepperoni, large spicy Italian and their buffalo wings. Pizza took about 35 minutes to deliver which is pretty average time. The delivery driver was friendly. The pizza was a bit dry for my liking, not enough sauce. I did like the crust which is not too soggy, but more on the doughy side and pretty good flavor. The wings were good and just the right amount of spicy, but very, very over sauced. So not enough sauce on the pizza but too much on the wings. My kids enjoyed the pizza, but there was a lot more leftover than normal. Not the worst pizza we've had, but not on my top five. I'll give this place another try eventually and update it then.
