Being the Asian xenophobe that I am (which is pretty ridiculous being that I am Asian!) Koreatown, Chinatown, J-town ethnic towns in general tend to unnerve me and sadly as such I don't get to take in the sights, sounds and tastes of Chinatown as often as I should.  Well Asian Legend has come to my xenophobic rescue with it's polished post modern trappings, ultra hygenic facilities and of course it's excellent Chinese food.\n\nMy Asian Legend cherry was popped this summer thanks to my sister's recommendation to dine here for her birthday.  Being the Leonine epicurean she is we ordered nearly EVERYTHING and happily it was all consistently delicious. It was a Chinese feast of Bacchanalian proportions with;\n\n- 3 types of steamed dumplings Pork, Shrimp shu mai and veggie, \n- Deluxe seafood soup\n- Moo Shu Chicken with pancakes\n- Assorted seafood with tofu\n- Peking Duck (Superb!!)with pancakes along with the duckmeat chopped up & sauteed with lettuce to wrap\n-Spicy Shredded beef\n-Sauteed King Mushroom with Snowpea Shoots\n-Sauteed Eggplant with House Sauce \n\nIt was all fantastic, delicious, and neither too salty or greasy.\n\nMy sister and her S.O. apparently have hollow legs as they effortlessly ate us all under the table.  Hubby was also very pleased and ravenously devoured his food with fork in one hand and chopsticks in the other.  I just shake my head at him as the old Chinese folks seated nearby look at him like he's a nutty gweilo. For dessert we ordered the smooth rich mango pudding mmmm :)   It was the perfect light yet still decadent way to finish off that epic meal.\n\nThe service is the usual Asian stoic, yet shotgun style which I'm used to but the pace can feel very go-go-go! with efficient servers dressed in white button down shirts incidentally with awesome creatively gel spiked hair changing up our hungrily emptied dishes with new hot entrees faster than you can say Dance Dance Revolution.\n\nMy one caveat was the uber-lame muzak piping in the background as I swear I must have heard a sterile instrumental version of Crystal Gayle's \"Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue\" about 5 times, had this been 1977 and we'd been at a Ponderosa in Georgia that may have sufficed but I'd sooner listen to Traditional Chinese folk music than to this aural pablum.  \n\nUpon going to use the facilities, I was hesitant to make my way down to the basement bathroom as I'd had some close encounters of the unhygenic kind in some China\/Korea town restos and feared the worst.  Well, Asian Legend's WCs are super slick and spotless to boot, housed next to a number of spacious and modern private dining rooms, I saw no gambling, no haggard masseuses,  just private diners having a ball singing a Chinese Karaoke version Single Ladies...oh oh oh....\n\nThank-you Asian Legend for dispelling my absurd and outdated misconceptions about dining in Chinatown...now if ony I can get hubby to stop harpooning his food with chopsticks &_&
