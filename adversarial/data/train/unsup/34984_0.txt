Very nice little place with pleasant decor and a small patio for dining outside in the shade. 6 stars for friendliness! The owners and their employees give new meaning to nice as they greet all as if they were old, dear friends.\nFood was solidly good if not great. I had the green eggs and ham and while good it had a bit too much green which drowned out any other flavors. Had a very nice biscuit  with a good crumbly texture and buttery flavor. Hashbrowns were well browned and of good quality. My wife had the bagel with eggs, spinach and Havarti and it was very tasty. My wife is a very good cook and her comment was that it was \"just like she would have made it herself\". High praise indeed. All in all a good place to which we will return.
