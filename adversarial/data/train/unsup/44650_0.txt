My boyfriend and I went to Bonterra for the first time this past Valentine's Day for dinner.  Bonterra is usually closed on Sundays but was told they open their doors for special holidays.  The downside was that we could only order off of their 4-course prix fixe menu.  For the entrees, I ordered the steak (which was cooked well), and my boyfriend ordered the chicken.  We enjoyed our meal but think we would have enjoyed it more if we were able to order from their regular dinner menu which has a lot more options.  Either way, Bonterra is great for a nicer dinner, and they have a large selection of wine ranging from inexpensive to expensive.
