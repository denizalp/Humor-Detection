1) Nancy did my nails.  She would \"remove\" my cuticle with that spinning thing instead of pushing my cuticles back.  My cuticles were bleeding and sore for a week.  I thought this was a fluke so I went back and she did the same thing.  In fact, she brags about this technique.  What is interesting is that she made my fingers bleed, but she did not so much as wipe the tools off.  With her technique she should autoclave.  They DO NOT autoclave!\n\n2) If you are getting the \"luxury\" treatment they offer you water.  They do not wash their hands (this I witnessed first hand) and I feel that they recycle the oranges they use in the water (I have no proof of this).  Ladies, if you don't eat the oranges, tear them apart so that they can't reuse them.\n\n3) The technician finished my pedicure.  In the middle of my manicure someone came in who I guess they felt was more important than me.  I was asked to sit in the waiting room so that they can start on the lady who just walked in the door.  They wanted to stop my mani in the middle of it!!!  I told them that if I walk out I am NEVER coming back.  I paid for LUXURY, yet I was asked to get up and let them work on another customer?!?  If this is LUXURY I would hate to experience the NON-LUXURY treatment.\n\nWell, the fact that they don't clean their instruments, they draw blood on purpose, they recycle oranges (I have no proof of this), they don't wash their hands when they prepare your water with oranges........I WILL NOT BE BACK REGARDLESS.\n\nThey better hope I don't call the FDA and Board of Cosmetology on them!!  They need to autoclave if they are going to draw blood and wash their hands if they are going to serve beverages and handle oranges for the beverages!  \n\nAids or hepatitis anyone?
