This place was TOTALLY worth the trek from our hotel. \n\nI had bookmarked this place to visit prior to arriving from Honolulu to Las Vegas and glad that I did not miss out.\n\nWhen you walk in the store, you are immediately greeted with various samples and explanations of each flavor and what actually goes into the ice cream. One of our favorites was the Lemon Poundcake. I got mine with a side scoop of the Pear and Gorgonzola gelato. \n\nMy cousin got the Lemon Poundcake and another flavor, coconut, I believe?  The two scoops in cups set us back about $6.00 each but it was money well spent! The flavors were bursting with...flavor? I can't even explain at this point...you just have to go there yourself!
