Wow, after a horrific accident at a water park how does this place not care about safety?  My son is 45\" and the girl checking height said \"oh who cares\" and gave my son the 48\" wristband. Seriously? Your going to slack on SAFETY of children!!! I spoke to Tommy the security manager and he could care less, I have never experienced such a incompetent staff. Cowabunga Bay cares about safety and that's where we will be getting passes next year. Maybe when a child gets injured or dies Wet and Wild  will train their staff that safety is very important.
