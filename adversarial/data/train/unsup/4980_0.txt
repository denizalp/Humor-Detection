One of the only times I've been led astray by Yelp.\n\nThis restaurant is quite poor. Maybe not the WORST food ever, but probably should cost about 1\/2 of what it does. \n\nCeasar salad entire contents: slimy dressing, a single crouton, iceberg lettuce ($5.75). Two bites and it was enough already.\n\nI asked if there a bowl of olives I could order for the table and the waiter suggested I order a Caprese salad (?) which had olives. So I did that. ($5.50) \n\nThe Caprese salad was: a sliced tomato, sliced jalape√±o peppers, some onions, and oil. No olives. I asked the waiter for some and he came out and poured them on to my plate from a bowl.\n\nHe offered pepper, which I obliged. After about 2 twists of that pepper mill I said \"Ok, that's good\" and he did it another 6 times. ...Interesting.\n\nI ordered spaghetti and meatballs for dinner (how mange cake, I know). There were two medium sized meat balls on either side of the plate, slightly over cooked spaghetti noodles, and one of the blander tomato sauces I've had in memory.\n\nI asked for pepper and again, he put on about 4-5x the amount I asked for. Had to ask him three times to stop putting pepper on it. Very strange.\n\nThe mains were in the range of $11 or so to about $18 and a half litre of not-great red is $19. Very overpriced wine. Very underwhelming food.
