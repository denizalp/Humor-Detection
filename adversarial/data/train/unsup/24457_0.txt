This is the best place to participate in a run and I've done so many times! It's really nice to see the beautiful Arizona government architecture surrounding you in the park while you get ready to run for a cause. I've done the P.F. Chang's Rock N' Roll Half Marathon, Susan G Komen (when it used to be here) and also the March for Babies. Each event is well organized and the plaza makes for a great starting and ending point. \n\nEven if they don't have a run going on, I still suggest stopping by and walking around to take in some Downtown Phoenix beauty!
