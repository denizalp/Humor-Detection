I visited Margaritas Grill yesterday for a happy hour snack. I ordered a Carne Asada Quesadilla, and I must say some of the most flavorful and delicious carne asada I ever had. The portion was just right and the wait staff was interested in where and why I was there. This is my second time visiting and they remembered me and some things we had talked about previously. The decor and atmosphere is delightful and exciting. Many of the paintings are from local artist and they provide and community feeling. Next time I visit I'm planing happy hour with the girls for some margaritas! I would suggest it to anyone who is looking for some great food and some time to relax.
