Extremely rude staff, careless and unwelcoming. Staff seems extremely unhappy to be here. Very unfortunate given its the only Coffee near our gate. \n\nThe iced coffee we received was extremely watered down and tasted terrible. I requested that the drinks were remade and the gentlemen smirked and didn't even reply with an \"I'm sorry\". \n\nTerrible Starbucks, and is hindering the name.
