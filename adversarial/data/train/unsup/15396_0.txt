Usually when I go for pho it's a normal experience but this was a little above average. Not enough for me to give them 4 stars but still not a bad place. A couple of my friends brought me here. The decor seemed really modern, contemporary - nice. \n\nAfter being seated, it took a while for the pho to get to the table but wow was the portion HUGE.\n\nThe noodles, the beef, everything tasted great and in addition to that, it wasn't expensive at all! Service wasn't great, the servers did not keep tabs on us at all and just hung around, which is why they don't get the 4 stars but when I say a little above average, the food tasted better than other places I've tried. \n\nIf you're in the mood for pho and are nearby yonge and Steeles, give this place a try!\n\n3\/5
