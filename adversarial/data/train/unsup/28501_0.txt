On our first visit, we were gladly helped by one of their geniuses. We went on a test drive, and he answered all questions we had about the X1. We were then passed on to one of the salesmen, and we couldn't be happier with Brandon Robinson. He worked so hard and patiently to find the perfect vehicle for us. I don't know what else to say, but we received exceptional service from everyone we've  encountered, especially Brandon. We got the car we came in for, in the price we wanted, and more. Thank you!
