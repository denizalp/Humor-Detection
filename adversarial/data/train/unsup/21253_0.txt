I've called this place home since 2003. I have gained so many memories, some good and some bad. In any case Vegas will always hit a warm spot in my soul. This is the place I met my husband. This is where I had my kids. It makes me sad to leave but I know it's what I need to do. \n\nThe \"Strip\" has provided me mayn't countless hours of entertainment. The clubs, the fine dining, the shopping, the tourist watching... All things that I don't think I could have experienced like I have here. I mean, I'm originally from NY and you can find all that there. The difference here is that you can find it all concentrated within a couple of miles. \n\nThis is truly the city that never sleeps. How the \"Big Apple\" got that term is beyond me but Vegas really does stay open 24 hours. You can find something to entertain you at any time of day or night.  I will miss this about Vegas. I will go to a place where restaurants close at 11pm, where last call at a bar might be at 1pm and where supermarkets aren't open 24 hours.\n\nI will come back to visit. I look forward to see the future growth.
