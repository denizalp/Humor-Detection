The best wood fire pizza I have ever eaten.  Good variety, indoor and outdoor seating.  Owner came by our table to ask about the meal.  Decent beer selection (local).  The charge of a couple bucks for tap water is something that the owner needs to reconsider, leaves a bad taste after a great meal.  Upcharge something else to make up for this.  Otherwise great pizza.
