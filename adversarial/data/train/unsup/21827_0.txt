Finally giving this place a try its was well over due\n\nI ordered ahi taco and steak salad (not their names )\n\n1 chocolate chip cookie ( not gluten free ) \n\nThey didn't have the calorie count for any of the food which kind of sucks because I count cals religiously \n\nAnd they couldn't tell me if the food was GMO FREE\n\nthe food was really good tho definitely would go back \n\nIn their menu they have a healthy side and the tasty side so that's pretty cool
