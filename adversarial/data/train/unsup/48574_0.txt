I went to Surrender with a few friends Sunday - Memorial Weekend.  We got a table outside with the pool right behind us.  Great view of the DJ on screen and the staff was flawless.  Our promoters, Kevin and Leo and hostess Kimmy, was amazing and all did an excellent job ensuring we were happy and comfortable.  Yes, I know that's their job but I couldn't have asked for better service.  Beautiful venue and had a great time!
