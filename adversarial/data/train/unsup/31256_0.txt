First time I went in I was apprehensive, but you need to realize that it's a school.  Those that are performing services are students.  They will make mistakes but they have an instructor right there to help them learn and make sure you are happy with the end result.  The girl that I had was awesome the only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because I was there for four hours, which I also expected  but was hoping it wouldn't be that long.  \n\nEvery person there is learning something and ask your stylist what they need to help them graduate, you will be happy you did because sometimes they give discounts out if the client add-on a service.  I added waxing to mine.  I have to say she did an awesome job on everything.  And with my husband and I we were excited to see our bill was what it would cost for a haircut at a regular salon.  \n\nThey use Paul Mitchell and Wella products.  I liked the Paul Mitchell color in my hair.
