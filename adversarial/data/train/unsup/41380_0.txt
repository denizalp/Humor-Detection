I went for lunch on a Friday at 11:30 am, wasn't packed or anything when I arrived.  Had 3 people with me.  We were seated immediately, offered drinks.  Jessica was our server.  She was pleasant, not super talkative, just pretty much all business, which is totally fine with me.  Larger tables are going to get less talking from the server.  Makes sense.  Ordered some appetizers, ceviche and guacamole, both excellent.  Jessica came back a little later to check on us and took our lunch orders.  Food came out, looked and tasted awesome.  Everyone had finished their food in about 10 minutes or so.  Table was bussed, dishes cleared and what not.   No Jessica.  10, 15, 20, 30 minutes later, no Jessica.  Where did she go?  Two of my guests had to go to another meeting so they left.  About 10 minutes later, Jessica appeared with the bill.  Weird right?  Usually, lunch time, you get in and you get out pretty close to when you finish eating.  3 stars for some slightly slow service, everything else was worth 5 stars.\n\nI'll be back for sure, maybe Jessica had an off day.  Full disclosure, I don't believe in tipping under for bad service, not that Jessica's service was bad, was just very very slow.  Jessica still got 20% which is really my minimum.\n\nI ended up leaving right after signing the bill roughly around 1:15 pm, again, arrived at 11:30 am finished eating around 12:15 pm.
