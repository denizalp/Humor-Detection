I was expecting something more \"diner\" with burgers and fried eggs. But that's not what John's is. John's is an entree restaurant. Steak tips and chicken parmesan and broiled flounder and liver & onions. I opted for one of the specials, a plate of baked ziti. It arrived freshly prepared after I'd enjoyed a house salad. A decent portion and very hot from the oven. The pasta inside was a bit overdone and mushy, but the sauce was great and there was a ton of cheese over the top.\n\nClearly, there's a crowd of seniors that love this place. It's definitely comfort food with a Southern accent. And that's okay!
