This place located in Downtown Summerlin features various cakes and Gelatos. We ordered a custom birthday cake for our little nephew and we weren't disappointed! The inside of the store is clean and presentable and the staff is hard at work in the back. I was greeted professionally and taken  care of right away. I will say that this is not your standard cheap ice cream place. You have to spend a little bit but you do get what you pay for. Our cake was incredible and was enjoyed by our whole party. We ordered Dr. Evil's mushroom cake. I recommend that if you do order one of their custom gelato cakes that you call ahead in advance at least 24 hours and that you bring a cooler and plenty of ice to keep it from melting. Spend a little and you won't be let down by the awesome quality of this store!
