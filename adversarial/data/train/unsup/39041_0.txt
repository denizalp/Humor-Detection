The food here is actually quite good. My husband stopped by to get a brisket sandwich and brought me home bagels and green onion\/bacon cream cheese. Both were excellent. However their service hours have been spotty (that's putting it nicely), they struggle to stick to their posted hours which is a nuisance.
