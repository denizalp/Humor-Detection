Writing this review really saddens me since there was a time when I though Archibald's was an awesome pub. I recently went here to have dinner after about a 2-3 year absence and it simply wasn't what I remember. \n\nFor dinner I ordered the chicken souvlaki pita with a side Greek salad. The pita was ok but nothing special, the chicken was nicely seasoned but a tad dry, the pita it was served on was store bought and the tzatziki was lacking the garlic kick. The side Greek salad was run of the mill, the only upside was that it was served with a big hunk of feta, being a fan of cheese I enjoyed this. \n\nThe bar does have a lot of taps but they are big name brands only, with the closest thing to a craft beer being Granville Island. When I inquired about their bottled beers the waitress said they had quite a few which got me excited. When I asked to see the list of bottled beers I was told there wasn't one, when I asked if they had anything from a local brewery I was told no, tisk tisk! (I did see a steam whistle sign while walking out which last time I checked was a local brewery, I hate being misinformed! However a bottle list would certainly go a long way)\/  \n\nThe place itself is an average bar with a few TV's, a pool table and a couple of video games, so one could kill some time here. The service was adequate but not overwhelming. I did notice that they had a couple of traditional British items on the menu (i.e. steak and kidney pie) and if I return I will give one of these a shot. Another positive is that they do have daily specials (wing night, nacho night etc). If you are in the area this maybe your best bet for a bar if you want to avoid a chain restaurant however I would not go out of my way to come here. \n\n*2.5 stars for Richmond Hill's first pub
