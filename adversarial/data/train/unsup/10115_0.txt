Just by entering this market, you know there's some funky stuff going on in here ...\n\nIt smells pretty bad, which most likely reflects the freshness of their produce and food. Lots of their items are questionable in terms of expiration. Originally came here for Vietnamese items on my grocery list and found them to be way over priced or lacking in quality\/freshness. Items are sticker tagged which isn't very efficient. Stock looks stagnant. Don't even get me started on the produce & meats\/fish. Customer service is nonexistent.\n\nLooking for Asian\/Oriental groceries, go elsewhere- ick.
