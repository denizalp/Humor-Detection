Mediocre, as far as Mediterranean in Vegas goes. BF picked up takeout here after a trip to the courthouse across the street. The gyro salad is fresh, but doesn't have much meat on it and the dressing is odd. The chicken shwarma plate was disappointing: dry meat, tzatziki is plain sour cream, pita is hard and clearly store-bought. The rice was nicely seasoned, though. Not at all worth a second visit.
