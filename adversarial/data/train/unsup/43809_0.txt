The king crab was split not cracked....hot clarified butter,,,,,awesome!!! \n\nThe shrimp- maybe 16-20s were peeled on ice and very good. Good cocktail sauce. \n\nSushi was freshly made and good. The spicy tuna roll was delicious and very spicy. The steak tartare on toast point seriously kicked butt.\n\nThe salmon with bbq maple glaze=good, beef bourguignon=very good, cous cous and tabouli= very good, aspargus=mmm.\n\nThe Kobe sirloin not was too tough to eat. I used to raise Wagyu cattle by the way. I have had a few (tons) of it for comparison.\n\nThe desserts were excellent especially the esspresso chocolate mousse thing shooter.\n\nSo far this is the best buffet I have had in Vegas and was a great deal for 32 bucks. I still have to try the Wynn and Wicked Spoon. \n\nOur server was also great.
