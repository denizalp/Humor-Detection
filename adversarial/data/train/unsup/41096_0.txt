I kinda laughed at the other reviews! :)\n\nThere is some truth to what I read based on my experience but I will say that if you are doing a remodel DB is worth every penny!  I saved over $25,000 (+\/- 25%) on my remodel and aside from having to wait 2.5 months for my GE Profile fridge I was very happy with my investment.\n\nOne thing that I did not like is that I could not have my wife, myself and my designer on my membership.  It only allows 2 people.  I was really upset that I had to decide between my wife or myself because I was certainly going to need my designer to have access.  That is why I took a star away.\n\nThere are too many people that make uneducated decisions (in my opinion) and I would say take the tour and decide for yourself.  They do a good job helping you know if you are the right kind of client for their service.  They even say that if you are an impulse buyer than they are not the right place for you.  I remember hearing that and laughing since they are clear that you will get a good deal on the price but you will need to wait for the items to come in... sometimes for a while.\n\nIn sales there are always 3 areas to consider but only 2 of them to choose from.\nPrice, Cost, Quality  (if you want it cheap and good quality it wont come fast; if you want it fast and good it wont be cheap, if you want it fast and cheap it wont be good)\n\nHappy shopping!
