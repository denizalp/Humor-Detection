I came here just last week and for the first time and thoroughly enjoyed every second of it.  The server was nice and knowledgeable about the menu and suggested some items for us to try as she said many others have enjoyed.  Service was prompt and the quality of everything was fantastic even late at night and the restaurant wasn't very busy.  I ordered a shrimp dish with crunchy shrimp chips alongside (sorry I don't remember the names), as well the spicy salmon salad bowl alongside a spicy ramen soup topped with bbq pork and half a perfectly boiled egg.  Everything was delicious down to last bite.  It was also the chef KU's birthday and he was greeted with some cake by his friends of which he shared with my girlfriend and I - it was so sweet of him!!  Overall that was a special night and I couldn't have asked for a better experience let alone satisfaction. . Definitely coming back with my friends for round two with the hot sake !!
