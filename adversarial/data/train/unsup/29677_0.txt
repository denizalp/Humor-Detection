Phoned Mr. Rooter Plumbing on Saturday at 9:45 AM.  I was asked when did I want a tech to come out.  I said between 11 - 1PM.  Then 30 minutes later I get call from a Raymond in dispatch letting me know that the techs are running behind and that it will now be between 2PM - 4PM. Meanwhile I had to cancel something I had for 3PM.  At 3:00 I get yet another call from a female dispatch telling me a tech finished early and can he come by even though I had a service call for 4PM.  I attempted to let them know that they are at fault as I never said 4PM.  It is now 4:08 and a tech has been on his way for over an hour.  I had two other plumbers I could have called and if I had they would have been come and gone hours ago.  Now my plans for early this evening will be cancelled as well.  Does the weekend staff have any brains or common sense.  Me thinks not.
