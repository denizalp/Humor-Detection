Thought we would try this new place, what a great surprise, we have been here before when it was another restaurant, this was a wonderful change, the young lady at the door greeted us with a big smile and explained about the new concept, the food was very good, we shared a carpaccio and the Foie gras, my girlfriend had a Chilean Sea Bass and I had a Tomahawk cut rib-eye (Rare) awesome! highly recommend it, our server Sergio was very charming and funny, he offered us a free bottle of wine with our dinner, great touch. After dinner we went to the bar for some cocktails and listen to some music, the singer had a very cool and smooth voice. It was a great change from that other place... We will come back soon. Thanks guys!!!
