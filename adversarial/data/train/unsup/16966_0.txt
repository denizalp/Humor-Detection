Oh my god. Was this a win or what? \n\nI enjoy spice and Indian food a lot, but I'm always nervous about cleanliness and getting an explosive asshole later in the evening. \n\nHowever, my experience at Tandoori Times 2 left me with no worries, a belly full of Lamb Boti Masala and Flying Horse beer. \n\nAs soon as we walked in I was addicted to the smell, curry permeated my clothes as I began to salivate. \nThe waitress was knowledgeable about the dishes and helped in my selection process. The side of rice for $2.50 was HUGE. It disappointed me that they didn't serve the rice with the dish, but it was worth the $2.50 \n\nWe had a free cup of chai tea to top of our meal! \n\nI will definitely be coming back. I'm addicted.
