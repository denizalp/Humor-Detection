2.5 I Suppose. I'll round up to 3. \n\nThis store is always busy. I understand most Giant Eagles are this way, but I wish that their cashiers could somehow work this out to have more than 3 lanes open at any given time. \n \nThe cashiers here late night are very very very slow.. and usually its the only lane open since self checkouts close early... (why?!) \n\nPharmacy is even slower. I'm talking like an hour for a prescription. I go to another pharmacy on jane & 23rd which is 100x better & faster.\n\nProduce selection is nice. its always worth checking out the sale ad that week. You can find good deals on coffee, cereal and produce.\n\nDont even bother with the bathrooms.. ever.
