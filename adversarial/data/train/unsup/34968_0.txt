Worst customer service ever!!! I contacted the school because I was trying to determine the date of the cooking class.  We booked the class months before. The school never sent out a conformation email or a receipt of payment with the class, date, and time. They were unable to look up by a students name. When they did finally call back I was informed we had missed the class. I asked if we could reschedule and the response was nope, you are out of luck. I have attended many cooking school and I have never received such poor customer service or an unwillingness to help. I had planned on signing my son up for their summer program, but to not even offer a make-up class is simply unacceptable.  If I could give a zero I most certainly would!!!!
