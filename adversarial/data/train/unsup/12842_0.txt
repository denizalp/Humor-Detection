We have purchased a new Fleetwood Bounder motor coach from La Mesa RV in Mesa Arizona and are trilled with the size, style, and color, of our new coach.\nThe real reason for this review is to commend La Mesa RV for putting together an organization thats makes it an enjoyable experience in shopping for a motor coach.  For example: our sales advisor was Don Pickering who provided all the information we needed.  He made us feel very comfortable; he was honest in his approach to financial limitations and worked hours and days (even on his day off) to help us reach our goal. Few employees make the effort that Don made to assure us of complete satisfaction. All of the La Mesa staff were very courteous and friendly, which speaks volumes for La Mesa's business philosophy.\n\nMr. Pickering introduced us to Larry Irvin, who acted as our financial advisor. Larry worked tirelessly to obtain the best interest rate he  could for us.  After several attempts he was successful in getting us a great interest rate.\n\nThere were so many staff members who helped during our visit, it would be difficult to mention them all, but Don Pickering is one we want to highlight as one of the most outstanding sales advisors we have met.\n\nWhat a marvelous group of people working at La Mesa RV.  From the time we entered the front door until we left in our new purchase, we were treated with exceptional courtesy and respect.
