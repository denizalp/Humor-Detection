Came in one weekday morning for Brunch, after searching for a place that would gve me eggs, bacon and a Caesar to help get rid of a hang over. Thankfully I staggered in just after 11 am and was able to get booze (stupid laws).\n\nSpeaking to the pleasant waitress with my head in my hands and eyes squeezed shut, i quickly asked for 3 runny eggs with pea-meal bacon and an extra strong Caesar with a whack load of Tabasco. Then I waited, fighting every impulse to lie down on the cool floor, wondering what the pretty chick on the next table would think. \n\nMercifully, food came before I started to slide out of my chair. One sip of that Caesar and.....WOW! i was back baby!\n\nWith my taste buds now primed, I dove into the eggs and bacon, most likely splattering the pretty chick with egg yolk in the process, but I didn't care. \n\nConsidering I ordered the safest things on the menu and considering they did not mess it up, I will give them 3 stars, with one extra star for a great Caesar. \n\nMaybe i'll come back one day for a more civilized meal
