I am not a coffee guy but i have some co-workers who love Starbucks so I have started to visit them on occasion for social reasons or easy to find meeting spots.  I think the beverage prices are crazy but I have to admit that the quality is always high and the service is always good - except for this spot.\n\nThe guy behind the register seemed to be offended that I was taking up his time telling him what I would like to order.  Either that or by the look on his face, he was experiencing cramps.  \n\nI ordered a macha green tea latte (cuz i don't drink coffee), a choco croissannt and a new breakfast item that they were featuring that was double smoked bacon, cheddar and an egg sandwich.  \n\nMy choco pastry was ready first and it was stale and hard at 7:30AM.  I know that they want to heat it up - but that wouldn't have disguised the lack of freshness.  The sandwich had a good smoke but little salt on the bacon (that may be the first time I have ever said that in my life), the cheddar was tasteless and the bread also didn't appear to be all that fresh. \n\nMy drink assemblers created a lovely looking Mocha latte and then knocked it over as I was telling them it was  green-tea macha.  They guy picked it up and tried to give it to me anyways - and I kind of insisted it was the wrong color for a green tea.  \n\nTo give the folks credit, they did make me a new one super fast.  But as I drank it, it just tasted like milk and most of the green tea flavoring was stuck to the bottom of my cup.\n\nI won't be back.
