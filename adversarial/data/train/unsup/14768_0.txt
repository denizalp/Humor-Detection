I was wasting time the other day nursing a hangover and complaining that only a burrito would nourish me back to health. A few minutes later, I received a tweet from Braddah's saying it was their soft opening and all burritos were free! What the what?!\n\nI looked the address and they are less than a half mile of my house. I hopped into my ride and cruised on over.\n\nThey are occupying the space that was a KFC forever, then the Mad Greek Cafe. Located just North of the Sahara and Rainbow intersection behind McDonalds. \n\nWhen I walked in, I was greeted by two ladies, who handed me a paper menu and informed me that EVERYTHING was free for the day. \n\nThere is a variety of options: SALAD, BURRITO, BOWLS, or TACOS.\nMEATS: Veggies, Fish, Kalua Pork, Chicken\nSeaweed rice\nBlack beans or pinto beans\nThen all toppings are free:\ngrilled veggies, fruit infused salsas, fresh jalapenos, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, guacamole, and a few others.\n\nI opted for a Kalua Pig Bowl. It was off the charts. Everything was loaded in my bowl and I mixed it all together. Perfectly seasoned. The meat was tender and juicy, the guacamole was fresh. Absolutely Aloha in a bowl. I loved it.\n\nI cannot wait to go back and spread the word on this locally owned and Ohana (family) based business. I will be back and will be for sure spreading the ALOHA!
