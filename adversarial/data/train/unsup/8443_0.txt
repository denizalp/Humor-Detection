Can you do two things at once?  I mean two that stand in direct contradiction?\n\n\"Help us help you!\"  sez the website.  Okay, great.  That's exactly what hospitality is, helping the customer.  Off to a good start, when...\n\n\"No Whining!\"  (Their double caps, not mine.)  So, if there's something wrong, am I whining when I ask for it to be fixed?  Because, well, there IS something wrong, here.\n\nFriday night.  Peak dining time, so we know there will be a wait.  Uh, can we sit at the bar and eat?  Sure!  Off to the bar, skipping the three-quarter hour wait.  Poifect.\n\nBeer, wine, all those things which act as social lubricant.  Bartender is a chatty fellow, and when told this was our first visit, very informative.  Ordered \"Porky Fries,,\" as an appetizer.  We had been warned both by the menu and previous Yelp reviews that everything is delivered to table at one time.  Bam.  You get it all, right now.  Take it or leave it.  See that line out the door?  It's not like we give one RCH if we lose you as a customer.\n\nShe ordered a salad, I ordered a \"Chilly Willy\" burger.  Both came out of the kitchen in about ten minutes, fresh and tasty.  Then, bar-boy asks, \"Hey, how would you like some fries with that?\"  Um.  We ordered fries.  Ten minutes ago.  'Member?\n\n\"Oh, uh...  the 'runner' dropped them on the kitchen floor.\"  Sure.  That's just what happened.  No way you forgot one third of our order, right?\n\nIt's early in the life-span of B Spot.  We'll try it again.  I wouldn't make special plans to return, or advise friends, or go out of my way.  When possible I avoid that whole retail wasteland strip-mall hell that is Strongsville.  And it sure feels the message was: we should just be thankful that they were willing to serve us at all.  That's not a good thing, in ANY business model.\n\n(P.S:  The bad reviews are kind of comical.  Five Guys?  Really?  Those two places are worlds apart.  Aside from a burger, they could be on different planets.  Stop with the employee reviews.  It doesn't wash.)
