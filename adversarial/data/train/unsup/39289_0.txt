We called this company in the evening due to a leak, they charged us $199 after we committed that we will not cancel the call. Then we spent a long night of chasing them by phone, it started by them answering the phone and telling us that they will come soon, but at some point they stopped even answering the phone. We spent the night waiting for them.\n\nDon't ever use this company, it is a scam.
