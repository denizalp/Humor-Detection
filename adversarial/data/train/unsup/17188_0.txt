Armed with a $125 food & beverage certificate courtesy of Bellagio received at the An Evening at Lago Gold Badge Yelp Elite Event, and this time with another couple in tow, Diane and I returned to Lago for a repeat performance.  And the dining experience was just as spectacular the second time around.\n\nOnce again we were seated on the restaurant patio, with an exceptional view of the dancing Bellagio Fountains and Paris' Eiffel Tower just across the way.  Service was impeccable from our omnipresent server Denise, and the food we ordered was sublime.  My party shared several small plates.\n\nI began with fresh complimentary Cranberry Buns, a hot bowl of Pasta Fagioli e Cozze with PEI Mussels and Tubetti Pasta, a high heap of delightful Salumi and Flatbread, and Cesare Salad with Baby Romaine, a Ciabatta Crouton, and a delicate Caesar Anchovy Dressing.  Tonno Crudo was ultra-fresh, and a Honey Bun adorned with Alla Ricotta e Mile sweet and enjoyable.  Salumi was fresh, nicely varied, and a fine starter.\n\nMore substantial fare included tasty Striped Bass Entero, yummy Cannelloni, excellent plump Gamberi, delicious Potato Gnocchi with Lobster Knuckles, and juicy Filet Mignon cooked medium and served with delectable Roasted Potatoes.  \n\nFor dessert we enjoyed delicate Tiramisu, Chocolate Hazelnut Mattonella, refreshing Chocolate Gelato, and for me great Decaf.  This was a great super-fine meal, and the excellent consistency in food, service, and ambiance between the two outings was noteworthy.  There is ample reason why acclaimed chef Julian Serrano's newest gem of a restaurant is currently one of the hottest dining spots in Las Vegas.
