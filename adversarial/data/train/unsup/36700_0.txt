They are the best company for junk pickup I have ever experienced! They gave me an amazing price and they were very nice! They got here exactly when they said they would. I had them take my fridge (which they donate and I love that) and the valve was broken so they went out of their way to go get me a new one! They came back and installed it for me!!! I had a little more junk then I expected and they were very nice about it! I was very impressed and very pleased! I highly recommend them to everyone. I also found out they go all over, even Phoenix! Go with them, you won't be disappointed! Very very happy!
