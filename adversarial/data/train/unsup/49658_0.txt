Stack'd is a small, quaint bar in somewhat of a pricy area, but believe it or not, their prices were very reasonable.  The burgers came out fast and were delicious (as were the fries) and we even got an order of Pierogi (which were also very good). Great selection of beer, and just a nice, casual place to hang out, have a beer and a great-tasting burger without breaking the bank.
