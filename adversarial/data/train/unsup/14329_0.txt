I'm not exactly sure what constitutes a \"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\" experience at an eye doctor, but Elite Eye Care gets my seal of approval.\n\nI've only been to two eye care shops in my life. For the most part, the choice has come down to location. Elite Eye Care just happens to be close to where I live now. Luckily for me, they also happen to be very friendly and great at what they do. The lobby area is nice with a good selection of designer frames. I can be pretty indecisive when it comes to picking a new pair, but the staff has always been very patient and helpful.\n\nAs for the eye exam, the only thing I can say against them is that the retina photo exam thingy costs extra. At my previous doctor, that was included. It's not a big deal. You can opt out and have Dr Gutierrez inspect your retinas manually. I'll be honest. This ain't a bad thing. The doctor is kinda hot! Yeah I said it.\n\nOh and one more thing. It's right next to Soyo! That alone could be worth five stars.
