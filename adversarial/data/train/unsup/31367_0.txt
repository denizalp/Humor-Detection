Great eating place. Authentic Punjabi Dhaba food. So hard to find something of this sort in the US. If you are in Cleveland area.. this is one stop take out place. You can always sit there and eat.. but the ambience is not that great. That doesn't bring those 5 stars down. Just go there and enjoy the Punjabi food. You will remember your mother\/home cooked food.
