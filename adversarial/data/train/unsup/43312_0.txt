I feel a little dumb writing this review. What can *I* say that hasn't already been said? Just echoing all the positive comments.\n\nWe must have gotten lucky. Arrived around 3'ish on a Friday and there was no line at all. Fortunately they hadn't sold out of their iconic brisket so we were able to experience it... and it IS an experience. Wow.\n\nThey offer \"fatty\", \"lean\" or \"mixed\". We chose the latter and it was unbelievable. When I sampled the BBQ sauce at the table I wasn't sure... but when you add it to the meat, synergy ensues.\n\nI also ate a turkey breast sandwich and it was epic.\n\nWorld class service. \n\nPro tip... you can call ahead and ask how long the line is ;-)
