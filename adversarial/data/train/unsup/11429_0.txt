I was ready to realllly not like this place...and, you know what, I liked it!  A lot.  Food was tasty and inexpensive, the scenery was gorgeous, and the service was just about spot-on.  I'd never been to a Cheesecake Factory restaurant before yesterday and certainly had no complaints about this one.\n\nThis restaurant, in SouthSide Works' beautiful Town Square, couldn't have scored a better location.  I doubt they're ever hurting for business!  Your parking garage or valet ticket, by the way, can be validated here.\n\nMy opinion is that The Cheesecake Factory is a place for burgers and sandwiches and salads and the obvious--cheesecake!  That being said, we stuck to inexpensive menu items and were very happy with our food.  I just don't see \"The Cheesecake Factory\" as a place where I'm merrily going to drop over $20 for a lunch or dinner entree.  That's silly to me; there are numerous delicious nearby places where one can enjoy a more lavish meal. \n\nMy mother, brother, and my brother's fiancee all seemed to love their yummy-looking food, but my boyfriend's \"Sonoma Burger\" (from the \"Glamburgers\" section of the restaurant's massive menu) was particularly delicious.  Super-juicy, maybe a bit too greasy, and topped with thin red onions, oven-roasted tomatoes, mushrooms, arugula, herbed goat cheese, and mayo.  I haven't had a burger in years, but this one made me reconsider my burger-eating frequency.  I also loved my \"Factory Chopped Salad,\" loaded with ingredients.  My only issue--and shame on the chef!--was that the bitter hard avocado used was days away from being ripe, yuck.  \n\nOur server John was kind, helpful, and attentive.  Nice guy.\n\nYou know, it does bother me that--and it's no secret--The Cheesecake Factory generally serves super-unhealthy dishes.  Yahoo.com is my computer home page, and each time a \"Top 10 Unhealthy Restaurant ____\" article is featured, Cheesecake Factory menu items are all over the list.  Sort of bums me out, but then again the place IS called \"The Cheesecake Factory,\" which doesn't particularly conjure thoughts of healthful eating.\n\nWhen dessert time rolled around yesterday we were stuffed and, thank goodness, avoided the featured red velvet cheesecake and its alternating layers of cheesecake and red velvet cake and cream cheese frosting glory.  It was very tempting though, as were basically all of the rich decadent cheesecakes this place has to offer.\n\nA perfectly pleasant lunch experience in pretty SouthSide Works!
