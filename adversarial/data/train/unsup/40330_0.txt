One of the FEW clubs in Vegas that still play hip hop! Drai's was surprisingly really fun- my friends and I came on a Sunday night. Guest list is open until 1am; after that it's $20 cover for ladies and $30 for men. They have a big dance floor area, and I love that part of the club is open air. They are also quite generous with their drink pours, so you don't have to worry about them skimping here. There are also some platform areas to sit at if you get tired, which is a nice change. Drai's wasn't as packed as some of the other clubs, but it had a good amount of people but there was still room to move around easily.
