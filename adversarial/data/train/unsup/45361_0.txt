The food here was so good and the service was amazing! I grabbed a seat at the bar and struck up a nice conversation with the bartender\/server. I ordered the fried Brussel sprouts and the Japanese fried chicken- both were amazing! The fried Brussel sprouts in particular were delicious, so crispy with a light, tangy flavor to it, it was awesome. The fried chicken was good too, super crispy with a good dipping sauce (I saw someone else eating it, so I ordered it, and then someone asked me what I was eating, so it must be a trend!). \n\nThe ramen was really good too, I liked that the broth wasn't too salty, and the noodles were the good, wavy noodles. The pecan smoked pork belly was delicious! They're a very professionally run restaurant- I ate my appetizers first, and it was nice not to have my ramen come out while I was eating my first course.\n\nTheir mango yuzu soft serve was delicious- refreshing, creamy and cool. It wasn't overly sweet or fake-fruit tasting but was a subtle, bright flavor mixed in. I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!
