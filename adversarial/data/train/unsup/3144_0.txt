I found Lylah and Michael and their dear nubian milk maids (i.e. the cutest, happiest, goats I ever saw) through Instagram, and when I finally decided my instastalking approached a new level of crazy, I attended a pie crust workshop cohosted by Rachel of Pistol Whipped (who happens to be a pastry guru\/charmer\/genius). At first I couldn't believe this little haven existed inside the city, but then I decided to appreciate how charming The Simple Farm is! \n\nIf the over saturated documentaries about food on Netflix don't have you keenly aware of the importance of knowing where your food comes from then you let your Netflix lapse. Well, at The Simple Farm, you not only know you're getting farm fresh like at the Phoenix area markets, you also can actually see the source of your food and walk around the beds from which your pretty kale and other Beatrix Potter-type veggies grow. \n\nI went back another week for their farmer's market and everything about this farm and their way of being in their business is special and lost in the current state of everyone's business. I fell in love with carrots that only looked cuter in Peter Cottontail's pockets, fruit trees decked out in flower buds and baby peaches, darling doelings who double as vaulting gymnasts, and an honor system coffee bar. Oh, yes, and there are more fresh produce, cheese, goat's milk, an epic hand made caramels alongside other artisan goodies and wares.
