Spinach Pie by the beach?  Yes, please.\n\nI love to come down here when the weather is nice.  We take the dogs for a walk, and stop in for the city's best spinach pie (I usually go the danforth location...I've also been to their Scarborough one)...One thing's for sure...spinach pie is good, the meat pie is good...and the cheese pie is good too.  You can't go wrong.  Plus this location is by the beach...\n\nA little piece of greek pastry heaven by the water.  It's tasty.
