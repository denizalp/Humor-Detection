Had the prix fixe lunch here with a friend, and enjoyed every bite from beginning to end. Started with the arugula salad (with pear & walnuts), had the margherita pizza as a main & the cappuccino gelato for dessert. As some of you may know, pizza is not one of my favourite foods but, from here, I'll gladly have it again. It was one of the best pizzas I've ever had: thin crust, cooked in a wood burning oven & made with fresh everything... it was delicious! Highly recommended!
