OK, I skipped the fries.  I'd rather eat two hotdogs.  I got the angry dog and a east coast dog.  I First thing I noticed was that the toppings were fresh.  Freshly diced and freshly made, not opened a can.  The kraut on the east coast was good and the pastrami had a good flavor and balanced nicely with the dog and the kraut.  The angry dog dog was good also, but I would have liked a little more seasoning on the spicy pork on top.  The fresh jalapeno was a nice touch but might have overpowered the pork and dog a little, which is the focus, still a overall good dog.  I would definitely be returning to try other dogs.
