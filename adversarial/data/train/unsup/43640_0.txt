What a cool place!!!  I love the concept of three restaurants in one place.  The view from the street when you're walking of \"Sienna Mercato\" is inviting.   I wasn't terribly hungry but wanted to check it out and have a little bite. Saturday night around dinner time.. it was crowed but not too much.    My friend and I found seats at the bar.   Emporio- a Meatball Joint:  I tried the \"Beef \"Meatballs with Arribiatta Sauce - spicy and little kick.  They were very tasty.  The menu items weren't overpriced.. I was pleasantly surprised.  The service at the bar was good and a good vibe overall.   I love the d√©cor of the restaurant and especially the ladies room.. so urban and hip!!   I look forward to going back.
