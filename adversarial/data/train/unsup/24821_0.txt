Refreshing and balanced meal. This restaurant is about eating well and caters well to vegan, gluten free and vegetarian - which are none of me but I appreciate the variety. Sister restaurant of sumo maya, local bistro and central bistro. \n\nNature colors of sand, green and white filled the ambience. Natural looking plates and bowls. \n\nJambalaya - brown rice, turkey sausage, black beans, bell peppers topped with scallions and piquante sauce. This was a pack of flavor and a pinch of spice for a filling dinner. $12\n\nKarma juice is available in bottles to go. Smoothies are also available. I would come back to try their other plates and bowls and hand helds, along with the other items on their menu for breakfast!
