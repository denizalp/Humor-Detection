I'm not sure why folks rate this store so poorly.  I came here to swap out some equipment.  I was in and out in about 10 minutes, if that.  My name was placed on a list by a friendly gentleman who met me at the door.  Then, a gentleman called my name, swapped out my damaged equipment and then he escorted me to the door and opened the door for me and sent me on my merry way.\n\nMy experience in this store was pleasant.
