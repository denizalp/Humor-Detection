Oh Yelp, you VERY RARELY let me down. How you have misguided me! This place has 4 stars!?!? In Arizona!? Bless their hearts, they tried. Beans tasted fake, salty, and microwaved to molten hot pocket lava status. Tortilla was disgusting, and far from authentic. I don't understand these reviews. IS THIS REAL LIFE?!? I am Hispanic, so I am critical of Mexican food, but still, don't tease me Yelp!!
