This review is a bit late, but better late than never - right?\n\nWe went for the Prix Fixed menu on Valentines Day, I know that sometimes those menus on holidays can have weaknesses. \nLike many other people, we couldn't figure out WHERE Mood was, not realizing it was right next to\/inside the bar area. \n\nOur waiter was a bit frazzled and it was packed in there, but the menu looked delicious with 5 course and well, almost everything containing alcohol.\n\nMy boyfriend literally waited 20 minutes for a fork to eat his salad (pears in a fig reduction with maytag bleu cheese) which was so light and tasty once we finally got to eat it.  The next course was a lobster bisque with TONS of lobster in it topped with a cognac foam, which could have been warmer. The thrird course was small frozen Pignot Noir, which was most likely sweetened on top of a  frozen mandarin orange slice and mint.\n\nThe main course was a 6 oz Filet and with some huge ravioli type thing and some overly salty sauteed mushrooms. My boyfriend's filet was over cooked and dry, and 3\/4 of mine was perfect and the other end was almost raw. My boyfriend loved his huge ravioli and I thought mine was gross.   Dessert was a white chocolate covered strawberry and a very tasty petite four and a glass of champagne. \n\nEvery course had some sort of alcohol infused in it, except the pears and with my glass of included champagne and my glass of wine I was nearly drunk by the time the check came.\n\nI would go eat there again on a non holiday, because the items that were good, were SO good. They were just overbooked and frazzled.  \nOne couple came and never had a waiter check on them and THEY LEFT - which I have never seen before, especially on Valentines Day.\n\nIt's worth going to for the experience.
