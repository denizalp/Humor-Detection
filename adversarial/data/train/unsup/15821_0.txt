The worst thing about this place is that it isn't close enough to me.  Why can't the Greek salad move in next door? We could be friends.  It could ask to borrow sugar, and I'd ask to borrow feta, lettuce, dressing, tomatoes, cucumbers, chicken, and yummmmmmm.\n\nSorry, where was I?\n\nSometimes, all you need a salad.  Sometimes all you need is a good salad place.  I'm okay if there's a chain of them, I'd visit them.  Bring one to the east side.
