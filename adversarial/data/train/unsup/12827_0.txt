Mama pajama!!!\n\nEnergy central!  This. Place. Is. Amazing!  We spent approximately 3 hours in this store and could've spent longer, it's like Disneyland for healers.\n\nThe amount of crystals, stones, and minerals is abundant here.  I mean PLETHORA! The variety is simply marvelous.  The staff is FANTASTIC and always willing to help answer questions.\n\nTumbled stones, raw stones, jewelry whatever form you want your rocks in, they've got it!  \n\nTheir prices are so reasonable too!  Just be prepared to come with the amount of money you're willing to spend...you could easily walk out of there spending more than you intended.  A large amount of their stones are charged by weight, so at the end when you leave it will be weighed.  This shouldn't be a deterrent because so many sizes are offered and you have choices.  This shouldn't be intimidating at all.\n\nMiguel, is so knowledgable and is a FANTASTIC healer.  He did an impromptu healing on my friend and you could feel the heat radiating off of him.  Truly authentic and a very helpful individual.\n\nI have officially put this store on my 'What I need to do in Vegas every time I go' list.  I *highly* recommend this place if you are a healer, you will not regret this experience!
