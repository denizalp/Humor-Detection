I used to like this place but after today I will never return.  I ordered the teriyaki chicken burger and it was straight up nasty.  I know I'm a picky eater so I try to get things that are hard to mess up.  This thing was an epic fail.  The entire bottom of the plate was wet making the fries and the bottom of the bun ruined.  It didn't matter the fries tasted strange and the bun although burnt from the grill on one side looked like it hadn't been baked long enough.  The chicken itself was dry as a bone and burnt as well.  When I think chicken burger I think a piece of breast meat, but I don't know what this was.  It was more like a clump of chicken sawed in half with a huge chunk of gristle down the middle of it.  Just yuck.  I think the worst part though was the cashier, when she asked how it was I told her, \"Well the service was good.\"  She kind of just shrugged and said nothing like she knows the food sucks.  So I ended up paying almost twenty bucks for this plate of shit and I had to stop and grab something quick to eat because this meal ended up in the garbage were it belonged.
