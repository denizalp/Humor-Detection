I think The CCF is a little too expensive for bar food, and I got the worst headache from my drink with what was supposed to be Grey Goose vodka. They need to check there bottles. I don't get headaches from top shelf liquor normallly. The lighting in this restaurant is horrible. My husband and I  could not even see our menus. OK if you are just hungry and want to spend a lot of money on chicken, burgers and pasta.  My advice is to go to Ruby Tuesday's or Apple Bee's, better value for your money.
