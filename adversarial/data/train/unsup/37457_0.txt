Our air conditioning went out yesterday, and there was no way in Hell i was gonna cook and add more heat to our house. So we decided on salads for supper.  Great salads!  I got the BBQ ranch with chicken added, my husband got the Caesar salad with chicken added.  Generous portions for the price.  Came to $15 and some change for my husband and I.  I like that the dressing comes on the side and not all over the salad as I don't like a lot of dressing.  Very friendly service, and it was fast too.  My only complaint was that my avocado on my salad was hard as a rock.  Definitely wasn't ripe yet.  So that got thrown away.  Made me sad.  Other than that, it was great and will be our new go-to for nights when cooking isn't an option.z
