We have been to a lot of breweries in the Pittsburgh area and I have to say we left impressed with Helicon.  We don't live close to this brewery so we made a special trip to come out here.  It wasn't' the easiest to find for us but we did find the brewery and I can't believe we drove right past it because it's so big!\n\n     They have their own private parking lot here so we parked and when we walked in through the front doors the bar is right in front of you.  We found a seat and sat down.  This brewery is in one big room\/warehouse.  You can see everything which I like about breweries.  One neat thing in one part of the brewery they have about 20 pinball machines if you like arcades.  It was very popular when we were here.  \n\n     The biggest thing here that we stumbled upon was their Happy Hour.  We got here around 430 and their happy hour is Tuesday - Friday 430 to 630 pm and 1230 - 230pm on the weekends.  All drafts are half off!  This is the best Happy hour I've seen at a brewery and it was great!  I really couldn't believe it but we were very happy about this.  It was a Happy few hours!  We were hungry and they usually have a food truck in their lot and this day they had Asado here.  We ordered some food and drank some beers and had a really nice time.\n\n     As for the beer I think it was really good craft beer.  I got their Pale Ale and I enjoyed it.  My wife liked her beer too.  I give them a sold 4 stars because of the good atmosphere at this brewery, very good beer, and their Happy Hour!
