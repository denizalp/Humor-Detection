I made an appointment the other day to have my car serviced here. I was greeted upon arrival with a sign saying \"Guns welcome. Good Marksmanship appreciated\" proudly displayed above the front desk. I turned around and walked out after explaining to the owner that he had lost my business. It's not ok to take a flippant attitude towards gun violence. It's highly unprofessional. I would never patronize this business. \nI instead took my car to All Pro West Mark Auto and they took me in without an appointment, were kind, honest, and professional, offered reasonable prices, did not try to upsell me at all, and did a terrific job on the repair.
