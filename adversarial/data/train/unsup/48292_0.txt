Amazing!! \nMy family was in town while attending some spring training games. A friend of ours suggested Vinatge 95 and we are thrilled to say we fell in love with the place. Outstanding decor invites you to your dinning table or casual dinning at one of their couches or fire-pits. The three of us sat at a table next to the wine room and we started off with a flatbread which was a great way to start off our meal. They have an extensive wine list and we all had a glass of what our personal preferences was that night. Axel was our server and not only was he attentive to our needs but he was extremely personable. We all dabbed in each others entrees and had nothing bad to say about any of them. Personal favorite was the burger, cooked to perfection! We closed the place down as we talked to the Sommelier and GM. Thanks to everyone at Vintage 95- we will be back again next year!
