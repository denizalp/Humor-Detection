I tried Dr. Linder after seeing her on Sonoran Living...SL is good for recommending outstanding doctors, and this is the 3rd one I've seen that I keep going to.\n\nAfter seeing a segment on SL about Dr. Linder's work with adult acne, I knew I had to try her. I am 61 years old and find myself breaking out with milia (whiteheads) to the point that I feel like I'm 15 again. Dr. Linder reminded me that this is not acne...LOL! You get milia (the little stinkers) because of all sorts of reasons. I found out today that if you use hairspray, that effectively puts a Saran-Wrap (TM) type covering over the skin and traps dirt and debris on your skin. The skin then grows over it and you can't get rid of it.\n\nI had the milia expunged...it hurt a little bit but getting rid of this mess was well worth it. I had one that was actually close to being a cyst. Dr. Linder was going to do the treatment but when she saw that I needed a lot of work done, she had her medical assistant perform the treatment (she's also an esthetician). \n\nA better type of cleansing product than I use now, was recommended and I used it when I got home. I purchased all the PCA Skin products (Creamy Cleanser, Hydrating Serum, and Collagen Hydrator) and will see how they compare to my products from Elemis which I have been using for ten years.\n\nI cannot recommend Dr. Linder and her office staff highly enough. It's true...when you walk into her office, you feel like you are checking into a spa. The colors on the walls are very calming and everything is very \"clean\" feeling. \n\n(I've never had to wait long to get an appointment.)
