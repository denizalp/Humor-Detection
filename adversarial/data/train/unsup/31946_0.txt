Really a bad experience In this store. I want to choose minus star to write this review. \nFirst, the service is very rude. That girl serve me seems like very unhappy and this store the red bean bubble tea and avocado tea are on sale  on Tuesday. When I asked her she said don't have red bean bubble tea. And I say can I order the avocado one. She said avocado is not ripe enough. \nAnd then I order the pineapple bubble tea. I told her I don't want ice. She said can not make bubble tea without ice. And asked me if I want bubble. Very ridiculous bubble tea can not without ice but can without bubble. \nAlso, I don't like the taste of their bubble tea. I don't think it's natural and healthy enough.
