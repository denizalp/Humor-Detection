Old school all the way. The first hotel on the Strip in Las Vegas. Built 1947. Only hotel in Vegas named after a bird with thin legs. Enjoyed seeing an audience in shorts and flip flops. Class, baby, class. The only people in jackets here are the car parkers. Extensive remodeling going on. New duct tape on the carpeting. I love this place.
