I give very few \"5 stars\" to my reviews but this one is totally worth it! We came here for this year's edition au \"MTL à Table\" and it was partly just luck as we tried to find one good table that was available the same night. As you might expect, a lot where fully booked but we manage to get the last table here... and for 5 people.\n\nThe place is small and hugely popular at lunch time, you'll only get here at that time with a reservation and you should reserve at night as well.\n\nWhat can you expect? A great bistro experience without the attitude. Our server was one of the co-owner (Audrey, I believe) and her service was perfect and on top of that, since she's an owner, is able to offer special wines not yet on the wine list (she told us that all their wines are by private importation).\n\nAmong out group of five was my 18 years old son who had an issue with the main courses offered on the set menu for \"MTL à table\" and it was the only menu available that night. The option was either a fish, scallops or beef tartare none of which he wanted to eat. Despite that, our server\/owner was able to negotiation with the chef and find a delicious ad-hoc replacement for our son.\n\nI don't usually eat cooked food but I made an exception for the scallops dish which were described as \"Roasted scallops - Browned butter butternut squash puree, speculoos, coffee infused veal jus, aragula salad\" and I don't regret trying. The mix was delicious and the plate very generous with a good count of large scallops. The only reserve that I have is that it was a bit generous on the \"fleur de sel\".\n\nThe ambiance of the restaurant is very relaxed and friendly which I believe mirror the personally of the owners. The choice of the \"antique multi filaments\" light bulbs just by itself create a relaxed and cozy setting. They also have a terrace outside for those days where Montreal's climate is not too brutal.\n\nThe warmth of the bistro and it's staff along with great food and reasonable prices makes for a winning combinaison and a place where you want to come back and bring some friend so they can experience it as well. No wonder the place have quickly became so popular!
