The fact that I have gone to Roselle more than 8 times in the last 5 weeks already tells you how awesome this place is. Tucked away from the business life of downtown Toronto, Roselle is located in Corktown. For a nice easy afternoon, Roselle provides a relaxing moment of peace with a great view that would rival patisseries in Paris.\n\nA small cafe, serving up some of the best Toronto has to offer! Ranging from their delicious cookies, soft rich cookies that leave you wanting more every time (i.e. the toffee coffee cookie is the bomb) to cakes and pavlovas. For Ice cream and tea fans, their house made Earl Grey Ice Cream is out  of this world. Make sure you get all the extra toppings and trust me you won't regret it! My personal favorite is the Pavlova. While most Pavlovas are overly sweet, this pavlova has the perfect texture. Crispy and crunchy exterior but a soft marshmallow feel! It sits on top of a vanilla custard and is garnished with freeze fried raspberries! Unfortunately they are only made from Saturday and Sunday night service and are made in limited quantity so get there early! \n\nNo matter what you get at Roselle, be it the soft delicious caramels, the cookies or cakes you'll always leave satisfied and slowly but surely it will become your addiction.
