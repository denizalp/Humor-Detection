This place wasn't worth the drive... Was promised iPad ICloud would be unlocked within 1-12 Hours and that I would be contacted when it was finished... Waited for a call the next day, No Call... I called and they said it wasn't complete and said it should be done by tomorrow and they'd call once it was completed... Next day comes, No call again... I called and they said the person working in my ipads were not working and that I had to call back on Monday when that person was working... I kindly asked if they could contact that person, and they said they can't get a hold of him... What a crock of sh@t!!! He's your manager and you can't get a hold of him??? What kind of business are you running?? So a week goes by and still I get no call from them... I call again, and they said they were waiting on manager to work on my ipads and he will call me once they are unlocked... So I wait until Thursday, today, and still no call... I called and FINALLY, they tell me the truth and say they can't perform their services... No Apologies when I pick them up... No explanations... No Customer Service whatsoever!!! Please do your research first b4 thinking about leaving your Cell Phone or iPad to this so called business...
