I finally decided to give this place a chance after walking by there everyday on my way home. From the outside, the decor looks modern and attractive.\nMaking a last-minute reservation on a Friday night was not very difficult. Used Opentable to book. It was simple as that. \nNow the experience.\nThe food is mediocre.  The pizza they breg about is really burnt black on the bottom. It doesn't look burnt on the top at all, but the bottom was...I know a few of the other reviews mentioned this, so this is not an isolated case.\nThe pasta was not so great either. All I could think while eating here is Pizza Rustica around the corner. LOL. That would have been a much better choice.\nOnly thing that was good from this place was the small amuse-bouche they give you in the beginning. Honestly, that was soooo delicious. But after that it hit rock bottom.\nThe service was bad. They are nice when they talk to you....if you have the honour of getting their attention. It took 30 mins for our server to bring us water and wine. This is when she finally took our food order. The place was not even that busy. I saw about two other servers just chatting for awhile and two other guys who may be managers\/owners (since they weren't attending to any tables) just standing arounding or leaning by a wall. Not impressed at all.\nIf you don't care for good food and just want a nice ambiance where you are not attended by the servers, then this might not be so bad.\nBut for me, I will never return here again.
