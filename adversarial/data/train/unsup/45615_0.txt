Most of the staff are super nice and helpful. However, twice now when I've been there at night (around 10-11pm) the guy that's checked me out has been extremely rude and sassy. If you ask a question he will likely treat you like you are an idiot, and always has a snide remark. Other than those negative experiences, staff is nice and products are well stocked and organized.
