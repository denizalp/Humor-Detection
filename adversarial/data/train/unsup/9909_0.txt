I just love Peoria Sports Complex. I wish there were more events held here. They recently remolded a bit. They put in a really nice, big splash pad and play ground for the kids to enjoy during spring training and summer days. They keep the ground very clean, even the bathrooms are always sparkling. I also love that they have complimentary sunscreen in the bathrooms, such a big help and nice to have in the AZ sun. The food is usually your typical ball park food. Most recently they have been throwing in something interesting in to the mix. \n\nPro\/cheap-ass tip: If you don't mind a little walking and you want to save yourself the $5 packing fee. Just park BEHIND the Target across the street. I've been doing it for years. \nAnother pro tip. You may not know if you aren't familiar with this part of town. There are plenty of bars that you can go to before and or after that are in walking distance. Salty's shares the same parking lot and they have great outdoor entertainment and cheap drinks. Cheaper than the ballpark. So we usually start there and mostly end up there after the Spring training gams as well.
