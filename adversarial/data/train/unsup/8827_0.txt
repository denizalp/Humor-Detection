Food: \nA'ight, I guess.  Dishes requested mild came out spicier than things requested medium.  Authenticity seems lacking.  If this place were a little larger, I would say that it's popularity combined with its generic-osity would garner it my new ubiquitous phrase, \"Touch of Thai is the WalMart of Thai food\".\n\nMenu:\nnice descriptions of items for those who may not be familiar.  decent selection\n\nDecor: \ncould be straight out of a place named \"Gramma's Diner\"\n\nName:\nAwkward.  First time I ever heard of this restaurant, it was by overhearing a coworker suggest to another that they should go \"touch a Thai\".  Perked my ears up, fo sho.  I gave myself a self-invite, but was not as satisfied after eating the food as I thought I would be after touching...nevermind.
