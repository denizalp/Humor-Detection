It's quite difficult finding meat jun in las Vegas. At Island Favorites, not only do they serve the most ono meat jun but they also have the vast assortment of, well.... island favorites!\n\nI was so excited when we discovered this hidden gem on urban spoon and yelp, that my husband and I drove down right away!  It did not disappoint either...many of the other reviews talked about it being a hole in the wall or a non attractive restaurant but on the contrary it is much nicer than many of the Korean restaurants in Hawaii. The atmosphere is quaint and slightly reminiscent of many local Hawaii establishments.\n\nThe menu had everything I wanted and the service was absolutely terrific!! My husband and I ordered the combo plates and were very pleased by the portions and price.\n\nOverall a top notch place with excellent food, service, and experience. You definitely receive Aloha treatment here and I would recommend it to anyone!
