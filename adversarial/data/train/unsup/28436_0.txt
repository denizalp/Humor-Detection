Went out to Rocky River Brewing Company for dinner with the family on a Friday night, great place to be. The wait was no long at all for a table, but the bar seemed pretty busy with very few spots left. When you walk in you see the brewing equipment which is always fun to look at. We ate inside but the patio they have is huge and has an outdoor bar as well.\n\nThe waitress was very nice and helpful, and came around often to make sure we were doing okay.  I order the pepperoni pizza, which comes with no sauce, but you can ask for sauce if you want, I would recommend trying it without the sauce because there is so much pepperoni on the pizza you won't even care if there is sauce or not.\n\nThe beer selection is limited to about 7 of the brewing company's beer on tap with about 4 \"Guest Beers.\" The brew is pretty decent. I order the Got Hop IPA and the Cooper's Gold, both were cold, smooth and great tasting. According to them they have won a couple of brewing awards.\n\nThe price at the end of the day was great. For four of us with about one to two beers each and a meal it was only around 60 bucks, which I add is a VERY good price. I would recommend this place to someone looking to have some local micro brew and good brewpub food.
