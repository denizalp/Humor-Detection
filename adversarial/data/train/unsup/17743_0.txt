I had The Prime bookmarked for the longest time.... I was curious what this little store front had in store. Here's what I found out- The food at the Prime was fine.....the prices and serving sizes were not. The husband tried their pineapple beef and I tried the chicken and eggplant hot pot and a cup of wonton soup. The broth was tasty, the wontons had whole shrimp in them (which I don't like personally, but I'm sure many people do). The pineapple beef was super tasty BUT so small! Like not enough for leftovers at all.... and it cost 14 ish dollars.... insanity. The chicken was just alright, a little on the smoky side and also a fairly small portion. Further, the service was super slow, it seemed there was only one person working both the front of house and the kitchen. So, was the food bad? No. It just wasn't worth the 40$ we spent. I would maybe give them another shot for lunch sometime.
