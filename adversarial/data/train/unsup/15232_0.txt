This place is HOT STUFF! \n\nLiterally.\n\nNo, their AC is not broken. It's their food that makes them so hot. You can order your food with a hotness level from 1-10. I usually order Medium at Thai restaurants, but I went with a 3 on this order because I was sharing with my non-spice loving wife. Man, that 3 was hotter than any Medium I've had anywhere. They don't mess around here!\n\nBesides their super hotness, I'm a fan of this place because they have a truly vegan\/vegetarian menu. I didn't need to quiz the server about the presence of fish or oyster sauce here. They even have vegan home-made vegan coconut ice cream.\n\nWe ordered the Vegetarian Pud Zee Euw (8.95; Stir fried flat rice noodles with broccoli and soy bean sauce w\/choice of American or Chinese broccoli) and the Vegetarian Dinner Special  #3 (10.95) which included an appetizer (Spring Roll),  soup (Mushroom Tom Kha) and  Vegetable Pad Thai for the main course. They were all very yummy (and spicy) and among the best Thai food I've had. \n\nNow that I know where this place is, I'll be back, but I have to say that it is not easy to find. It's in a large shopping center, and if you enter on the wrong side, you'll pass dozens of businesses before you find it. The best directions I can provide are: it's kind of in the middle of the commercial center, near a bar. \n\nPros:\nVery Veggie friendly with dedicated menu section\nGreat prices\nLots of parking\nReal spiciness\nFriendly service\nEntry way is filled with articles and awards (including a letter from Yelp!)\n\nCons:\nLocation is a little shady and kind of hard to find
