So I was in Vegas this past weekend. It was the last weekend of drunken debauchery for a buddy of mine. So myself and 29 other dudes roll in a stretch H2 to Scores. We get hooked up. No Cover, get the VIP section. We did have to do bottle service which was no prob. I mean 30 guys and buy one get one didn't cost too much.  So we get 2 bottles of i dunno what kind of vodka and we get 2 more free so that was sweet. So walking into this place is pretty nuts. For one, place is GInormous. 2 floors of loud music, darkness to hide the ugly chicks and all the no no stuff going down, tiggo bitties, butt floss and dudes. So we get up to the second floor VIP section and the drinks are flowing. I think I'm on my 8th or 12th cran\/vod and I'm toast. I'm asking why the waitress, who was hotter than all the strippers in the place, wasn't getting down with the lap dances. Yea she she was really flattered by my drunken dumbness...Alcohol, Wes and hot chicas don't mix....sometimes...anyways enough about that.\nThis chicks with the test tube shots were cool. Pay 10 bux, the chick puts the tube in the cleveland and you get to shoot it. Pretty simple and fun!\nSo the talent in this place wasn't that good. I mean you can look hot as hell but damn after 200 snaps, can a brotha get a boner? even just a tiny rush of blood to the other brain? cmon! this jack hammer pu$$y move thing that the strippers were doing just wasn't workin!!! Hmm maybe I was just too damn drunk to feel anything...aw well.
