This was our fourth trip during the past 2 1\/2 years that we have lived in this area.  The first was a disaster, but it underwent new management, and I must say that it has improved each time that we have been there.  We only go for dinner, so I don't know about the brunch.  The spinach artichoke dip was fantastic, as was the chicken contadina.  My husband ordered a ribeye, and I assume it was good because he didn't complain, and ate it all.  We had a great waitress who went above and beyond to make our evening with our three children enjoyable.
