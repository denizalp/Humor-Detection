4 months later and I'm still trying to figure out what all the hype was about.  Sure, the oxtail soup was good but I've had better.  I think the best thing about Market Street Cafe is the convenience.  It's located in the California Hotel and Casino where many locals from Hawaii stay and the food they serve is really familiar to us.  My personal preference is not to eat foods that remind me of home while on vacation.  However, so many of my friends and co-workers insisted that their oxtail soup is a must.  \n\nWe decided to go there late one night when we needed a break from the slot machines and gosh darn it, the line was ridiculously long.  It was about 3 am and the line wrapped around 3 times in the normal lobby\/waiting area.  They weren't exactly taking customers in the order they came in but in the order which it was most convenient to seat certain amounts of people in your party.  If a table for 4 opened up, they would take the next party in line that had 4 people and so forth.  \n\nWhen we finally got seated, we ordered the Oxtail soup and the Loco Moco.  Both portions were pretty huge, which was a plus but like I said, I've had better.  I wasn't completely blown away by the food and the service was alright, they didn't exceed my expectations or anything.  I might go back if I'm dying to eat a really big and satisfying meal at 3 am but it for sure wouldn't be my first choice.
