I'm pretty sure there is a Yelp conspiracy and my reviews keep getting deleted. Either that or I drink far too much and just forget which places I have reviewed and which I \"thought\" I reviewed.\n\nThis place deserves 5 stars partially because of their food, partially because of their great reverse happy hour and cheap lunch specials, and partially because of their service.\n\nService at Naked Fish always sticks out because of the extra mile attention to detail that each server gives. Most of them know our orders before we even make it and this is even after not eating there for 1-2 months.\n\nThe sushi here is always fresh and the rolls are creative and delicious. I used to have a problem with the way their sashimi was priced but they have since fixed that. If you are looking for cheap sushi you should definitely try their lunch specials where you can have 3 rolls for under $20 and this includes most of their most expensive rolls. They just included a lunch special where you get 21 pieces of sashimi for $21. Holy Sushi Coma!
