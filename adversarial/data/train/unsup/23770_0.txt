We went to the world famous Sterling Brunch to celebrate the New year 2017.  Thinking to reward myself and This brunch was always in my bucket list however I crossed it out with quite disappointment.  \n\nAfter passed 30+ mins our RSVP time, waiting for them to set up our table.  We finally got seated.  Our server was the star, he was very attending, professional and proper, since we have a big group (like 9 people),  he seemed like never left the table, keep the champagne flowing.  He reminded me a professional English butler. \n\nThe best part would be the dessert table.  But we didn't plan to pay $150 pp for some chocolate creme.\n\nSmall variety of food choices on the buffet table, majorly seafood, lobsters, oysters, crabs, crab legs, salad, caviar, etc..  I was expecting everything should be perfectly cooked since the VIP price.  However the lobster tails were overcooked, quite rubbery, not just one, but all of them.  The lobster bisque was quite salty, we couldn't drink it, ended up we used it as dipping sauce for the lobster tails since they were dry and rubbery.  And most of the seafood are on the over cooked side.   I'm absolutely disappointed.  Even the free flowing champagne couldn't make the over-cooked seafood taste better.  \n\nDefinitely not going back and will not recommend to my friends.  Go somewhere else order Ã  la carte, I'm so done with buffet.
