Char's Has the Blues... and, apparently, the Booze.  Of course, I was only drinking water by the time we'd arrived at this gem of a place!\n\nOn the suggestion of Lisa E. and chauffeured by Diane S., we trekked over to Char's.  We were all in the mood for dancing and Char's was the perfect place for this!\n\nGeorge Bowman and Baddboyz featuring Lucius Parr was the band of the night and they rocked the house.  They were actually really cool guys; I had the opportunity to briefly chat with George and Lucius while catching some air outside.\n\nThe pluses?  This place is really low key, but we were not at all out of place dressed to the nines.  The band was great.  The booze was cheap.  The clientele was very mixed in ages from twenties to seniors.  \n\nThe minuses?  Their enclosed \"indoor\/outdoor\" patio was SMOKY.  Sooooo smoky.  I cannot stand smoke and it was difficult to breathe.  Two days later, my asthmatic self was still using my inhaler and blowing ash out of my nose (I know - TMI).  The dance floor is a decent size, but the \"stage area\" spills over into it.  I felt bad that I was bumped into the band on a couple occasions.  They have a $6 cover on Friday and Saturday nights.  It was worth it to see such a cool band, but I hate paying a cover anywhere.  \n\nI really liked Char's and I would go back again to dance in a heartbeat.
