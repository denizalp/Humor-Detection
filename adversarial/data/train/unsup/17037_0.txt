First off the previous owner D. Roberts passed away & the business was bought by the current owner, Mr. Ragy Zaky. Mr. Zaky has been licensed in Ontario to make dentures since 2006. On his biz cards, the name is listed as RITE BITE DENTURE CLINIC!!!! Improperly made upper denture. From the time i rec'd it, 6 weeks after my inital visit, it caused pain in my upper mouth. Ragy is unprofessional & lacks integrity. His exam rooms altho they look clean, are not. The sink is full of previous patient's wax, no rinse cup offered and I even had to request at times for him to put of gloves, prior to touching my mouth. After receiving my dentures in mid-july, i had to return to his office approx 15x for painful, swollen red gums. He is inept, unqualified & very very unprofessional. He blamed the shape of my mouth for the poor fit, also that i had eaten spicy foods & then stated i was allergic to the material used. After countless visits and much pain & toothless days, on nov 22, bearing in mind this process started in mid-june, he stated he would make me a new denture and have it ready for sat morn nov 24. I arrived, denture was not ready. I waited for almost 2 hrs & when i put the alledged new upper in my mouth, it immediately caused me pain. I left his office. On Mon nov 26 I requested a refund, which i rec'd only after threatening to contact the college of denturist & BBB. On Wed nov 28, i saw another denturist who advised me the only thing wrong with my dentures was that they were ill-fitted, low quality and improperly fitted. Mr. Zaky is incompetent, unprofessional, lacks integrity and runs a very shady biz. BUYER BEWARE. Teeth & dentures are very important, pls do yourself a favor and do not, i repeat do not hire this man to make your dentures, it will only cause u grief, anguish & interfere with the quality of your life & not to mention the cost and time you will forfeit    BEWARE PLS
