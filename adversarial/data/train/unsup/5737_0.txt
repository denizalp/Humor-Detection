Change is always good when it comes to the seasons at Bellagio. They know exactly how to depict each season and make it enjoyable for all ages. They even have musical performances for the passersby. The best part about it is it's free!\n\nThe displays usually move around or even talk. Definitely a place to stop by if you have some time on your hands.
