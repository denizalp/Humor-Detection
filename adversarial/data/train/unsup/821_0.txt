Chicken and Waffles is just such a southern notion, and seeing it all the way up here in Canada is definitely exciting. First spotted on blogTO, and this is not my usual point of recommendation. I usually rely on good ol' Yelp! \n\nWalking in, I really appreciated the amount of seating that was set up - this contrasts a lot from next door Seven Lives. BF and I ordered the \"The Up North Trip\" (3Pc Bone-In, Waffle, Buttered Maple with Coleslaw or 'Tato Salad for $13)  and settled in for a 10 minute wait. The chicken was crispy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside. No complaints, only compliments for the chicken. The waffle, though, is where I failed to be impressed. The spots that the chicken had rested on was soggy, and it didn't hold up very well. Portion was decent for the price, and the salad was just fine.\n\nMy personal favourite was using the purse\/coat hooks that was readily available all over (or I should say, under) the seating area. Made the stool-style seats a lot easier to manage! \n\nJust be prepared for what happens 2 hours later. You'll need about 2 bottles of water to rehydrate!
