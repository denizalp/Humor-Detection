Wacked business hours \n\n7PM -12AM \n\nBut it really doesn't matter to them because the people who know, 'know this place is the shiz!!'\n\n\nThey don't even bother to setup the tables and chairs for dining in here because they are too busy handling the orders and preparing the stuff.  It was take out only when I went Thursday evening.\n\nI asked for a Durian pancake and tonight she said, it would be a 45mins wait time, O-M-G!  I'm not waiting that long for a fricken pancake. \n\nSo I went for my alternative the HOT  black sesame almond soup with dumplings ( dumplings filled with black sesame) The natural flavours come through, no over sugary taste tainting it. Taste is nothing like frozen or packaged. So if you want to taste how it should be done, come here.\n\nThis is by far the best tasting Chinese dessert place I've ever been to.\n\n\nP.S. I'm only minus(ed) 1 star because of the Soup Nazi experience. However the goods they deliver are 5\/5.
