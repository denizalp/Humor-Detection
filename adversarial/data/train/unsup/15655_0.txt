Jjanga is definitely added onto my go-to AYCE sushi spots in vegas! Very nice atmosphere and setting for this type of cuisine.  Servers are always on point with making sure you've ordered and making sure the food keeps coming out.\n\nI enjoyed their Jjanga burrito, Yellowtail w\/ Yuzu, salmon nigiri, as well as an array of appetizers like their bulgogi, crab ball & chicken wings. I love their \"Something Wrong 69 Roll\" which came with an amazing ponzu sauce. The \"Q Roll\" was amazing as well.\nFor dessert I got a scoop of their chocolate ice cream. Im not over exaggerating when I say their chocolate ice cream is THE BOMB! Try it and you'll taste why. \n\nI cant wait to try their new location on Sunset and 215!
