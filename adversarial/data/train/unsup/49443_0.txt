I live right around the corner from here. I've driven by many times but never stopped. I saw 32 Shea featured on FOX 10 AM this morning. The food looked so good I had to try it. I ordered the English Muffin Breakfast Sandwich. It was one of the best Breakfast Sandwiches I have ever eaten. It is also a cute and comfy place to sit and eat have coffee or drinks. I would totally go there again and again.
