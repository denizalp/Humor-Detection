We were very pleased with our service and food here at T.J.'s. Large portions and good presentation made our dinner worth the price. Las Vegas restaurants have increasing become expensive over the years and this steak house is no exception.\nThis place is old school. Pictures of  Las Vegas of yesteryear grace the wall, quiet atmosphere conducive to conversation - A nice change from the loud buffet and cafes
