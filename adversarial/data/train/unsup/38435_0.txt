Went with a friend for ladies weekend  out. She really wanted to go and I wasn't overly found of the idea. This show changed my mind. This was entertaining as heck defiantly cheesy but hey it was super fun and the greatest was when they would bring girls up and embarrass them. Yes the guys were hot not sure that they were that hot but they definitely put on a great show.
