Every now and then a girl has to treat herself.   A nice new pair of shoes, some pretty undies, a decadent spa treatment, etc....these are all things a lady will do for herself sometimes.  \n\nYesterday I decided my treat was to get some crabs.\n\nOk, Ok, get your mind out of the gutter, even if I am in \"Sin City\"  you know that is not where I am going with this. \n\nJoe's has a dark wood interior with a large patio and all the servers in their crisp black and whites, I felt a little underdressed in my no-makeup-tennis-shoe look.  This was not to stop me, however from getting my crabs.\n\nFor those that don't know, stone crab is only really in season for three months and usually comes from the Gulf in Florida.  It's a rare treat, these little claws of perfection, so you have to get them while the getting is good. \n\nI sat down and the server immediately came over. She was pleasant and helped me find an excellent medium bodied glass of white wine to complement my seafood. Throughout my whole meal she was attentive, polite, and personable.   \n\nI chose an appetizer for my lunch, but this was no mere starter - this was the \"2nd Mortgage\".  A stone crab claw, a jumbo shrimp, a small lobster tail and a small portion of shrimp\/scallop cerviche, all chilled with cocktail and mustard sauces for dipping.  This was a dish to relish so I took my time. All the seafood was cooked and chilled to perfection with that just caught fresh taste. I really wish I had just gotten a plate of the stone crab because that one claw was so good I am already having major cravings for more.\n\nAll in all a perfect dining experience - a girl has to treat herself and to borrow from a certain ad campanign - \"I'm worth it\"
