Where has this sandwich shop been all my life?! \n\nThe hubby and I were out on a Sunday afternoon and this place popped in my head for food cuz the hubby was getting the grumpies, lol. So I pulled out my handy dandy yelp app and found a location near us! And by George were we glad I did! Starting with the decor and the friendly greeting to the sandwiches everything was bomb diggity! The food so good I wish I got a bigger size! I got the Kali mist and the hubby got the dank sandwich. I was \"highly\" impressed and so was my husband with his choice. Right amount of spice with the chipotle mayo too. \n\nDefinitely glad we stopped in here today, will definitely be back in the future to try the other wonderful looking sandwiches! :)
