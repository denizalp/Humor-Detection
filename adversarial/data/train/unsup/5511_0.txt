Tried the buffet with the wife, the brother in law and his fiancee and I thought I was just so-so. \n\nThe omelettes that were made on the spot were too oily. The bacon was not crisp. The sausages were overdone. \n\nThe freshly squeezed orange juice and fluffy pancakes were good. Fruits and pastries were pedestrian. Service was ok.\n\nHowever I didn't find it good value. $72 plus tips. Thank god my brother in law picked up the bill. \n\nWILL NOT COME BACK.
