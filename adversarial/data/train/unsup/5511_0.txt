RW is my number one place for clothing in the mall. I think that because I'm a little bit of a bigger guy I never have problems finding clothing here in my size. Any time I look through the clearance racks I almost always find something. I buy almost all of my dress pants here as their pants just seem to fit better than anywhere else.\n\nI have to be a little careful with their shirts though. Dress shirts seem to be okay but t-shirts always seem to be a little short in the body.\n\nThis weekend when I was in I was presently surprised to find all of their clearance on sale with an extra 25% off. I was in the mall early so there wasn't any one in the store. The staff were really helpful by starting a dressing room for me and helping me find some things to match with what I had already picked out.
