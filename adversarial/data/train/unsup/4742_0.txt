Discovered this place on a recent trip to Pittsburgh. Our hosts used to live in Brussels and swore by this place so we marched in with high expectations. \n\nNestled in a residential neighbourhood, Point Brugge has a great vibe; the place was packed and bustling with giddy diners. We waited 45 minutes for a table but snagged a seat on patio as we waited. I would recommend the cheeseboard to share and the Red Curry Mussels. They were fantastic.\n\nObligatory Title Pun: Make a POINT of visiting this BRUGGE.\n\nMenu Readability: Simple and layout, but I'm not a huge fan of the headings' typeface.\n\nNeed to mention: The front door opens right up so in the summer even the inside feels like outside.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: I would do just about anything for mussels and fries.
