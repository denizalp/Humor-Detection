If you want a good thick piece of steak this is the place to go. The whole family got a different steak and all of them were so good and tasty. You didn't need any sauce to go with them because of the seasoning and juiciness of the steak was enough and perfect! I'm a steak type of gal and even though the place is a bit pricy it's worth every cent. We also got some seafood with our meals and the lobster is pretty big no little baby lobster tail it was a good amount for our entree. Oh and the twice baked potato is to die for!! I usually get fries with everything but here you have to try the twice baked potatoes. The only reason I didn't give them five stars is because the serves sucks! They are all friendly and when they do come around they do help you but they just take forever to come around. But overall great place that's hidden in the middle of nowhere.
