I only tried their donuts, but they do serve chicken and even ramen. It's an interesting mix, but a lot of people ordered the chicken.  \n\nI tried their original glaze, the hibiscus juniper and the apricot. The only one that stood out was the hibiscus juniper which I recommend getting. It's slightly tart and has a good berry flavor. The other ones were just okay, but the donut itself was fluffy and thick.
