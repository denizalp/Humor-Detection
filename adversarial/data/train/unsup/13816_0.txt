Haven't tried the coffee but their cookies are decent. Once I saw a fly buzzing around on the cookies I wanted, so I got a different one.\n\nI've been here about 3 times and have had the same experience with the service every time: absolutely abysmal. If it isn't running at a stoner snail's pace, it's impeccably rude. The guy today said--in the slower, extra loud, douche baggy tone we all know and love--\"IS IT FOR HERE OR TO GO.\" I actually said that it was to go with my order. Curt response: \"Well it's loud in here.\" Okey dokey then! As if I'm going to sit in your stuffy caf√© alone so I can get yelled at some more. He was sitting down the whole time (possibly with an espresso tamp up his bum, based on the attitude). I almost said to forget the order altogether because of his d-bag attitude but I wanted a cookie and decided to go with it still. The girl who got my cookie was much friendlier and very smiley. Why can't everyone there be that lovely?\n\nThe only reason I come here is because I'm in the 'hood and don't know where else nearby to get cookies. I wouldn't try the coffee here based on every other Yelper's review--especially since Aroma is across the street. Also, I'm going to try extra hard to find another cookie place that isn't run by jerks. I don't mind too much if the service is a bit slow but if it's rude then what the hell? You aren't all that, you're a coffee shop... A mediocre coffee shop at best... I don't see why all this attitude is necessary.\n\nSo for other Yelpers reading, if you know of some place to get cookies nearby, please let me know!\n\nAnd if you're trying to decide whether to go here or somewhere else... Somewhere else! If you're in the 'hood, try Aroma across the street. They have fast, friendly and efficient service and are considerably busier than these guys. And they give free chocolate with your coffee. Skip Green Beanery. 2 thumbs down.
