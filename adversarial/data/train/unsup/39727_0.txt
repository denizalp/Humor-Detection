I go to Green Eggplant almost every Sunday with a group of between 5-8 people usually.  We are always greeted warmly and the service is great every time.  It's always super busy, but we never have to wait more than 30 mins or so and if you call in advance they are pretty accurate with the wait time estimatations.  The food is amazing.  I highly recommend the Mediterranian Grilled Vegetable Chicken Salad, although I've tried several other things on the menu also - everything I try is excellent.
