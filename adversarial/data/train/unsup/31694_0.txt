I joined this gym on 5-7-14 & so far I'm happy with this place. It's clean, the staff are very friendly\/helpful, & they offer a variety of amenities that are included with membership. Did I mention the membership is $19.99\/month? So not bad at all for price compared to what all you get. \n\nI've noticed that there's never really a wait for any equipment ever & everybody seem to be pleasantly doing their excerises without any bothers from others... so that's really nice. ... no gym creepers.\n \nI also am thrilled that they offer free tanning with membership. I'm getting married in 3 months & I'm not waiting to look like a ghost so this amenity makes me very happy. My only bummer with the tanning rooms as they are dusty & really really really warm when you go in. Really wish they'd put some AC on in those rooms or add another fan,  but other than that they do the job. \n\nI recently went down on 5-30-14 for a free nutrition & health assessment. The gentleman that talked with me was Scott & was really nice & knowledgeable. He explained everything well & was upfront. I agreed to a personal training program & didn't think as much on my month expenses\/budget (wedding in 90 days ...paying cash for it...eek).Afterward, did some number crunching only to realize I bit off a Lil more than what I could chew. Reread my contract, saw that I could bow out. Called early today,  spoke to Scott again who was perfectly nice to me about it (canceling my training program membership)...I was concerned it wasn't going to go well as I've read some great but not great reviews. Scott really put my mind at ease & even asked if there was any other reason to cancel aside from what I told him. I felt that was really awesome of him to ask that & to care about what I said. Asked if my deposit would be refunded, was told in 3-5 business days & no other charges should come up. Gave them my written notice to terminate my program & I'll send a copy to their corporate office just to be sure\/safe. \n\nAll in all,  I'm pleased up to this point. I'm hopeful I'll have my deposit refunded in a timely manner & Scott was so nice about everything,  no pressure at all & just decent all around. \n\nIf any issues,  I'll update this post. :)
