TERRIBLE SERVICE! I ordered an item from Amazon on Saturday and paid for ONE DAY shipping. The next day I receive a text message from Amazon saying my package was on its way. Later that day I receive a message saying they attempted to deliver but I wasn't home so they would try again the next day. They lefty a door tag notice, too. I didn't know I needed to sign for a CD. Not to mention that I ordered it 1 day because it was intended as a gift for someone who was leaving on Monday. \n\nWell, in hopes that the package would arrive before we left to the airport, we waited home. I got another text message Monday morning saying the package was on its way. Later on, I receive another text message saying that \"the package is undeliverable\" and that I need to correct my address. Seriously? The address I have in my account to where all my packages from Amazon have been delivered is wrong?? No one has had a problem delivering my packages. Not even the ONTRAC driver who left the door tag the day before. \n\nI called ONTRAC and after being on hold for a long time, they told me that they will try again the next day since the driver was too far away at the time of my call. Also, they said that they can't prove that the driver was able to find the address the day before, because he failed to scan the door tag he left on my door. Additionally, the representative said that she ignores what type of training the drivers have and why they couldn't find the house. So, I give them specific instructions on how to find the house. \n\nNext day, Tuesday, I get another text message saying the package is undeliverable!! \n\nI had to contact Amazon on the issue. They will replace the package. Hopefully, they won't use ONTRAC this time! Unfortunately, now the package is too late and I will need to find a way to get it to the person who I bought it for.
