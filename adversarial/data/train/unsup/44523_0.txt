Came here on a Sunday during the holidays to try out the local brews on tap. A nice clean place with friendly service and sports on the big screen.  Only downside for me was how dead the place was but understanding it was day of Sabbath and during the holidays.  Will try this place again and order the large beer tasters on the beer menu fasho.
