What happened to Camelview is a goddamned heartbreak.  Camelview used to be the theater in town you could trust and you would know it would have all of the limited release movies you want to see.\n\nBut, now?  At its given price per ticket ($14 for a matinee on Saturday), I just can't afford to go anymore.  It's just a bummer.  I mean, there are places else to see these movies, but Camelview is the first place they go.  Everything else ends up getting them a week or two later.
