Quite possibly the worst Italian food I have ever had.\nI ordered the Bolognese...Total joke.\nThey chopped up a meatball and served it over tomato sauce.\nI was in shock.\nMy friend ordered the Cheese ravioli.It was store bought.It tasted like an angry meetingt of salt and garlic.The sauce was Broken,rubbery Alfredo.It was something a drunk frat boy would make after a night of beer bongs and high fives.\nThe calamari was soggy.The servers all seemed drunk.One of the waiters wafted a giant path of Marijuana smoke to our table...He had just gone outside and smoked weed and brought the cloud back to the table with him.\nThis place should close down.It is utterly disgusting.\nIts like they taught a cooking class in Prison and they hired all of the inmates to work at the Italian Grotto.\nZero Stars.
