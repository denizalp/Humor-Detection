The atmosphere was noisy and hectic.  We had to wait for our table even though we had reservations.  My brussel sprout caeser salad had tiny shreds of brussel sprout and huge hunks of bitter cabbage.  The only part that was really tasty was the warm peanut butter cup which was like warm PB mousse with chocolate gelato on top. Yum!  all of that being said, they appear to have amazing charcuterie, with many cheeses and meats available, but we didn't order it bc no one else at the table was interested.  Next time (if there is a next time) it will be charcuterie and dessrt for me!
