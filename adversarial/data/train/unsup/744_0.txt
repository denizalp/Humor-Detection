This diner is right opposite to Wimpy's yet I have never noticed them. I guess it's because they don't have flashy lights and a life size Betty Boop greeter.\n\nI ordered Salmon Benedict (picture below). Very delicious. Eggs made just right and covered in creamy hollandaise sauce. Slit it open and watch that egg yolk spilling. Salmon was tasty, sitting on a well toasted English muffin. Hash Browns were alright, nothing special though. My friend ordered the sausage & egg breakfast and it looked meh. I suggest that you stick to Benedict.\n\nSpacey, clean diner. Great service. All day breakfast, perfect for night owls. Check it out if you are in the area.
