AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME ! The place the locals go to eat and relax . Very casual, relaxed , atmosphere . The staff treats you like family. The food is fantastic. The prices are a bargain and the portions are huge.  The prime rib dinner is my favorite, but everything here is awesome . Try the Sunday special turkey dinner. Fantastic . I cannot say enough how much everyone here from the roulette wheel, to the  restaurant makes you feel comfortable. Boyd's hits a home run with this place
