Beer, liquor, chips, and one of the best Mediterranean take out restaurants in town?  It surprised me too, but I've been back twice in two days now.  Ask what's the best thing they have that day because it may not be on the menu and it'll probably be amazing.  If you like having your food put together by really nice men who take pride in what they make for you, I highly suggest this place.
