This place is the brand spankin'(ish) new place in the village.\n\nIt's the first on the strip to do AYCE sushi. The bears in the village are going to looooooooooooooooooooooooove this.\n\nBut I'm torn. Here's a list of what went down guyz. \n\nTrust me yo, it'z a ride.\n\nPRO'z\n\n1. The food presentation. I have never been to an AYCE joint that has put that much effor into presentation. It's a great effort. But let's get real, it just opened.\n\n2. They have some really imaginative makis. Definitely try the veggie blast. Who knew I could love veggies so much? (OMG I hope Val G doesn't see this)\n\n3. Super super friendly service.\n\n4. Ticket system, but it's kinda basic. You just write down the item number and how many pieces you'd like.\n\nCONz.\n\n1. Okay so first things first. We got in there for lunch. It looked nice. Until we sat down. There were really funky booths, but the seating was MAD RIPPED. Like. Did you find this booth at the dump? Come on guys. You just opened! Atleast reupholster that shiz.\n\n2. A lot of the grilled items we got tasted mad stale. The beef teriyaki was inedible. \n\n3. We went around 11.45 to the place for lunch, and it said it opened at 11.30. We waited a good 15 minutes outside because one of the staff asked us to wait. Then the owner came out looking really confused and sat us down. Not really a con, just a curiousity. I got a couple of smokes in, na biggz.\n\n\nHere's my final verdict about this place:\n\n\nI dunno if it's going to stick around that long. Try it out while it's there. They have a 10% off special going right now.\n\nDefinitely try all the fancy makis. Its worth it. \n\nOther than that, it's not the best. It's not the worst either.
