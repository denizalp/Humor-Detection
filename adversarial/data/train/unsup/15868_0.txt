Stayed with my wife's Grandmother's house in Spring Valley for 2-stays before staying for a couple of days on the strip.  Booked last minute tickets to a Vegas show and had tickets for the iHeartMusic festival so needed to print tickets out.  I don't think the wife's grandmother had a printer, so after lunch, decided to find the nearest printing shop.\n\nPretty straightforward to find, located in a strip mall, across from a huge Lowe's, WalMart complex, Tech Mail seems to be an independently-run printing, repair, mail place.  I called before coming and the employee was very friendly over the phone and told me they could provide me the services (computer, printer, etc.).  Looks like they offer reasonable rates for diagnostics and repair of everything from printers, computers, etc.  I think they even convert VHS to DVD and do passport photos.\n\nPrinted 3-pages and it cost me $3.50.  Only complaint is that I believe it is advertised at $0.30\/page (B&W which I did) plus computer time (which I swear I used 90 seconds top).  Somehow, I'm not sure how it comes to $3.50.  The employee never showed me a breakdown.  I wasn't going to fight over $3.50, but I wasn't wholly satisfied with what I thought was not a clear pricing structure.
