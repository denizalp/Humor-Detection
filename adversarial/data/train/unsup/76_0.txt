So this is my second time and not much has improved from the first time. The check in counter staff is sub par and probably half wits too. Not much changed from the last time where it took 30 minutes to check in one guest.\n\nSo I booked through hotels.com for a king size high floor room. That was how it was advertised. I get here and was told that my room is not available and that the rooms are reserved but you can't specify which type. Ok, then they need to talk to hotels.com because that is how they advertised it. \n\nOk, whatever I waited for 10 minutes to check in already and was not going to give this idiot anymore time. So after another 20 minutes of trying to figure out my reservation we go to the room and it definitely was not two queen beds but two beds that seemed to be over sized toddler beds. She did offer to switch me out but really? No one wants to do that. \n\nThe hotel seems to attract the weirdos too. There weren't that many last time I was here. There was a guy with a bloody forehead in the elevator with us. Nasty looking 17 year old justin bieber look alikes were out in full force. Not to mention the club scouts who approached anything that pranced around in high heels looking like they could barely walk as they tried to keep all their women parts in the three sizes too small dress\n\nThis is probably the last time I'll stay here. Sorry SLS, for trying to brand yourself, you are still really just made up Sahara. \n\nYour comps nights will do you no good. I'd rather spend money and be in a hotel that I know attracts less scumbags and has enough rooms to honor guests reservations. \n\nAND, resort fee? How can you charge as much as a Bellagio! You have nothing close to offer as \"resort-ish\". Stop kidding yourself.
