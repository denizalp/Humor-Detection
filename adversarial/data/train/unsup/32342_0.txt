Happy hour is terrific.  From 5-7 pm daily wine list selections discounted 33% and appetizers 50%. The food was delicious and beautifully presented. Service by Mario, Anthony & Jose was impeccable. Atmosphere was comfortable elegance with comfortable seating, tasteful background music with tablecloth covered table and proper glassware for both wine and cocktails. We are locals and we will be back.
