Who knew a place that can be so popular can be so disgusting.  I didn't know a beef bowl with vegetables could be made so bad.  The veggies were slimy because they were covered in some glop along with some thing disgusting beef that just smelled.  I've tried it in California also, and it tastes the same here.  I just don't get how it's so popular.
