Noisy. Crowded. Mediocre food.\n\nI also call their cleanliness into question. Upon attempting to use a mustard bottle at our patio table, a piece of dirt\/napkin\/dried-out-mustard had jammed the tip of the squeeze bottle. What I thought was just thick mustard exploded all over myself and my wife when whatever was clogging the end was forcibly ejected from squeezing it.\n\n+1 star because the waiter was kind enough to bring towels wet with soda-water for us to clean ourselves up.
