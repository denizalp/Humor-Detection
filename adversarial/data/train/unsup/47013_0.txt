Excellent yogurt; fresh toppings; clean shop!  Would definitely come back here again.\n\nI selected the coffee\/chocolate\/vanilla yogurt combination.  Very tasty!  I added strawberries, chocolate pieces, chocolate sauce and fresh whipped cream. Yum!\n\nThe checkout process was fast and easy. \n\nFun time for my four year old grandson !
