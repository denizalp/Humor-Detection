I like this joint.  I didn't realize it was a chain until after my first visit - had more of a locally-owned feel to it.  The value is pretty good considering what other joints charge for similar fare.  The burgers are charbroiled and tasty, the onion rings are above-average, and the very reasonably priced side salad was far more and better than I expected for its price.  Close to work and will definitely make my regular lunch rotation.
