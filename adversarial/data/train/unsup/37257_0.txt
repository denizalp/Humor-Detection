We love Juans! Juan-a know why!? Ever since we dropped in for happy hour a few weeks ago we have been back at least once and some weeks twice! The food is delicious and consistent, servers are very friendly. We've only sat in the bar and the only  thing disappointing for me is most times we've been there the patio is closed and that's where we always want to sit. I understand on windy days but not others,maybe it's staff issues because the service has been slower on the patio. So four stars due to closed patio. Food and drinks is a five.
