I have visited this spa, previously called Shizen Spa, just over a year ago and was quite happy with the service. My old review is here: https:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz\/shizen-spa-toronto-2. I was impressed with the quality of the massage I had that time and the customer service was good too. I also really liked the steam room and sauna. So, when I saw a Groupon for this spa for a massage\/mani\/pedi, I went for it. I am usually wary of spa with Groupons unless it is a business I'm already familiar with. So I was very disappointed that the spa, now The Village Spa, has really declined in service and the facilities. \n\nThe trouble started with booking an appointment. I called to book well in advance, as I know Groupons can sometimes make spas really busy and availability can be limited. I phoned, left a message. No answer for days. I emailed, nothing. I sent a message using their website form. Someone kindly phoned me back several days later and left me a message, apologizing for the delay, and saying there was availability for the day\/time I requested. I called back, but the person who had called me was not there that day. The woman on the phone said \"okay, we can't make your appointment right now. We will call you back.\" She hung up on me before I could ask a question. After the endless phone tag, I finally made an appointment but subsequent staff never apologized. I even provided them written feedback expressing my disappointment and frustration, and was never contacted to even acknowledge that...\n\nAs for the spa experience itself, I enjoy their \"rainforest zone\" but the steam room was not hot when I went there. I had to get it going which took a few minutes. It smelt kind of unpleasant too. More like a sweaty changeroom than a rainforest. My massage was decent, hence the 2 stars. Then I was sent to a waiting area for the mani\/pedi. I waited 45 mins. with no one checking up on me. I finally went to the desk to inquire. No apology, they just said \"uhhh hold on\". And a few minutes later, a flustered aesthetician arrived and simply said to me \"there was a screw up\". Great. They didn't have the best selection of nail colours and the whole salon area looked kind of old and worn. I found myself wishing I had just gone to my usual cheap Asian nail salon on Yonge St. instead. While doing my nails, the aesthetician told me how she was working 12 hours straight with no lunch break. While awkward to have staff complain to clients, if this is truly the case and that is how employees are treated, I don't want to support their business.\n\nI won't be back when there are so many better spas downtown. I think the management has changed and it's unfortunate, because this is nowhere near the standard of a nice hotel spa.
