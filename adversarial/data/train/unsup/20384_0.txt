This place is it.  It is IT, if you know what I mean.  But if you don't, read on and I will tell you why Byblos has rocked my world twice in a month and why I will be back.\n\nFirstly, the atmosphere is very cool and there is awesome interior design.  Both times I have been seated in the bottom level and been happy.  You can watch them prep your food and make your drinks behind the bar.\n\nI have tried 4 different cocktails from here and have to say the Gulad was a personal favourite, served in a julip metal cup.  So refreshing!  The Sultan's Apprentice (I think that was the name) was also delicious and the presentation was awesome: a giant square of ice that fit perfectly in the glass.  \n\nThe food is just amazing.  There are so many different layers of flavours.  I was so impressed.  Here's the good and the okay:\n\nORDER THESE:\n-Eggplant Kibbeh\n-Steak Tartare\n-Citrus Mixed Olives\n-Guernsey Girl Cheese\n-Yogurt Baked Fluke\n-Roasted Brussel Sprouts\n-Sweet Jeweled Basmati Rice\n\nThese were good but not as great as above:\n-Roasted Red Beets\n-Seared Cauliflower\n\nAnd these I won't be ordering again:\n-Crispy Hand Rolled Couscous (didn't like the texture, boring)\n-Dry Aged Ribeye (too dry for my liking, also boring)\n\nDessert - I've had the Turkish Delight tea, Barbary Coast and the mint....the mint is by far the best.  And for dessert I've tried the burnt honey ice cream (most delicious) and the apricot which was good but the flavour was very subtle.\n\nDelicious experiences both trips - highly recommend.
