After the Red Rock Bowling UYE, I was invited to have a late night bite to eat with Roger, Rhia and their family.  It was close to 2 a.m. and you'd think that they would be on the ball, as it wasn't that busy.  It took a while to seat us, which was alright, because there were 10 in our party.  We sat down and checked out the late night menu.  I just wanted potatoes, that's it! I had a taste for potatoes.  I know, late night starch and carbs.  But, I already have screwed up my diet for the week, so I didn't care.  They had a great late night special. 2 eggs, hash-browns and toast for $1.99.  What a deal!  Anyhow, we ordered drinks and for some reason the kitchen was backed up.  The night manager came to our table to let us know that.  So, the wait was about 1\/2 hour.  I didn't mind... I can be a bit of a night owl at times.  But, Roger and Rhia had their kids in tow, so I felt for them.  You could tell that the wait was getting long because Roger passed out.  The food eventually came out and it was good.. about what I could cook at home, but for 2 bucks it couldn't be beat.\n\n2 stars because the waitress was nice and the company was great.  Plus the little jelly jars were awesome.
