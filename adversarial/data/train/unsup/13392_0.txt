Can I possibly give 10 stars?!?!!!? Anyway I should have written this review 2 days ago but I was too busy loving my hair...my apologies. I contacted Katy though email last week expressing my interest in hair extensions I told her I had a crappy experience before with the micro cylinder and I was willing to give them another shot but was nervous. Well Katy was completely understanding and so sweet :). She made me feel completely comfortable and answered all of my questions and was honest!!! She is really quick at 1. getting you in the chair since I expressed an interest in hair extensions and then had them within a few days and 2. getting you back out of that chair, she is so quick and effective you won't waste your entire day even though you wouldn't mind anyway since she is so nice to talk to :). Well all of my doubts are gone since i washed my extensions for the first time today and they were soooo easy to style! I am hooked and am so happy I found Katy!
