After using them I looked at the reviews, should have done that before, since the amount of negatives outnumber any positives. I concur with the negative postings. We arrived and were told the car we requested via an outside vendor(they were blamed) did not have the seating capacity we needed. I have since looked that up and the claim is absolutely false, they lied. They offered an option of a Yukon XL at almost double the quoted price on pre-booking. We said no then suddenly the price came down a little. Then we protested and the agent did the ask the manager thing. It looked like a display for show where he ask for more and the manager said no, thought I was in the car sales room in the 60's and 70's. Finally we got to $190 dollars more than the original price and reluctantly accepted. I am very angry with myself for not looking at the seating capacity of the original booking more closely.\nHe then tried to upsell the insurance, the fuel tank fill, which is never a good deal, usual things done by most rental companies. He was aggressive in the sales pitch, selling the downside of my no's. I asked what the standard was for fill on the return, said within 2 miles, pointing out a station further than that away. In fact the car I received was not full, and all they did at return  was ask if it was full. \nThe bottom line is the misrepresentation of the booked car was a way to upsell and I paid too much. I will never use them again.\n\nOh,  the car was fine, low mileage and good condition
