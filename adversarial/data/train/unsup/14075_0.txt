I attended my first hockey game last week on a student rush ticket ($35 w fees), and it was my first visit to CONSOL.  I will say, the logistics to pick up student tickets is super confusing.  You enter the venue and go through a security check and then up a floor to pick up your ticket.  It feels weird to enter without a ticket, and my roommate and I had to ask a security person to finally figure it out.\n\nOnce you are in, it is pretty intuitive.  We had standing room tickets in section 212, which was right behind the goal.  This was great for watching the game and eating since we were both coming from work, but the ushers were SUPER annoying.  The guy in our section was really aggressive about letting standing room people sit down in empty seats, but we had people pushing and shoving to eat next to us in the standing room section since standing room has counters.  Sure, we all want to eat.  But if you are going to make it a standing room area, then don't make the people paying uncomfortable.  We would have happily stood the whole time if people did not keep bothering us.  We finally sneaked into seats in the center of a row because we were so sick of people standing too freaking close to us.  Otherwise, every seat seems to be a good seat.  I don't think there are any partial view seats here.\n\nThe food options were OK but nothing special.  I much prefer eating at PNC park because there is a better variety of options.  We were right by Burgatory, Fox's Pizza Den, and Dunkin' Doughnuts, and then there was your standard nachos, pizza, hot dogs, etc.\n\nAll in all, there is no reason to trip over yourself to come here, but it is a decent venue.
