Though this is a pizza joint, their salads and wings are surprisingly good, too. \nThe Greek salad comes in at under $10 for a huge portion of freshness and flavor, while the Detroit Red Wings are a crispy delight with a side of awesome sauce- literally. They come with a garlic-ranch dressing that must be made in-house because it was incredibly flavorful. In the words of Anthony Bourdain, I'd lick that off of a bicycle seat.*\n\nOther points of interest: they have plenty of beer specials, outdoor seating is available, and phone-in orders are ready fast. \n\n\n*Disclaimer: I have no idea if Anthony would agree with me about the sauce.
