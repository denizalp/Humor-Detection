Can I say no to fried chicken? No, I simply can't. Off we go on another Korean fried chicken adventure, this time to Kaboom on Queen East. It's a small venue with high ceilings and big windows. Not a great location for big groups, but we did anyway....we may have taken over a little. (Apologies. :D) \n\nWe ordered almost everything on the menu. Let start with the obvious, fried chicken! The chicken was hot and fresh. The cook was trying their best to keep up with our group plus their regular customers that were streaming in. Batter was crisp, but the real flavour came from the sauce. At least the sauce explains where the name of the restaurant came from! A burst of the sweet chilli sauce sent me into a coughing fit. Oops! Didn't expect that kind of kick! A little embarrassing, but I pulled through. I'm not a spicy gal, so this is not unusual. :P \n\nOur table ordered a bunch of side orders. The french fries that came with the chicken were not great. They didn't seem to be cooked enough, took thick. Taro chips were circulating our table; even those had a sprinkle of heat on them. Pretty good! The rice balls were good and cheesy, hard to share though, but that's not their fault! They come 2 per order.  I was also lucky enough to steal a piece of a bubble waffle and it was damn good. Everyone that ordered sandwiches said they were great too.  \n\nService was good, but a bit slow since it was so busy! That's not a bad thing! The chicken speaks for itself.
