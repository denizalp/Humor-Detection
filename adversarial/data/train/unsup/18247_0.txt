I spend my summers in Montreal, and without a doubt my summer would not be complete without my weekly trip to the market. \n\nThe first time I went here I was in awe of how big it was. It's big. It's really big. Do yourself a favor and get a map online before you get here. Lame, I know - I know the market backwards and forwards now, but it wasn't always that way. \n\nIt's hard to take a trip to the marche without stopping at the Havre aux Glaces (the ice cream shop). My friends have had to drag me from the fromagerie hamel a few times (with good reason!) The Marche' des Saveurs is also UNMISSABLE - a fantastic gourmet shop in the south east corner. If you're a donut person, you HAVE TO try the polish prune donuts. Sounds gross , but they're the reason I also pack on a few during the warmer months. I swear i'm going to be 3,000 pounds soon - but, alas, i'll be in a happy donut filled haze. \n\nIf you decide to go on a Saturday or Sunday, be sure to get there right at the stroke of dawn, unless you enjoy bumping into 5,289 strollers or have a firebolt on hand.
