We have been here before and found the experience delightful. Not this time.\n\nOn entering, we noted that the sound system was blasting music at an obnoxious volume--overpowering, even oppressive. Since it was clear that we'd be seated immediately, we said nothing to the hostess, instead waiting for our server, who arrived quickly. We asked if the music could be turned down. The response stunned us. We were informed in no uncertain terms that the loud music is \"part of who we (Postino) are.\"\n\nThe server's arrogance was palpable. On telling this person that we'd leave if the music were left at its mind-killing level, he replied that he could ask the bartender to \"turn the music down a notch or two,\" but that if \"someone complains, we'll have to turn it back up.\"\n\nNo apologies, just smugness.\n\nWe left, planning never to return.\n\nWe're not overly critical people. Bye-bye Postino East.
