The service is absolutely horrid. , passing plates over peoples heads instead of walking around. The food choices are crappy for a place this size. The food itself is not of a quality you would expect from a place in this location. Prices for quality and quantity are way out of the norm. Pushy and unprofessional service topped us to get the hell out...a party of 16 people...sad
