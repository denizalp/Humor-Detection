Stopped by for their soft opening tonight, because I gotta find a good tiki bar!\n\nThe decor is really well done! Perfect tiki vibe, and some great details like a full-wall shell fountain, jungle print couches, and the requisite paper lanterns. \n\nDrinks: their house specialties run $11, and generally have at least to shots in them. They have the standards like Hotel Nacional, Mai Tai, and a few more exciting selections involving coffee and cinnamon. Definitely looking forward to exploring their menu. \nI got the Painkiller, and was pleasantly surprised. High quality juice and a stiff pour of rum made for a beach drink that didn't make me feel like a 21 year old college girl at her first bar. \n\nThe music was a nice selection of beach classics, but nothing too strange like we hear late nights at the 'other' tiki bar on the Westside. \n\n The place was packed so it was a battle to get to the bar. The bar was well staffed, but each drink has every ingredient measured with a jigger, including the mixers! So the bartenders are just buried trying to put out these drinks. Might want to embrace the free pour and count to get things moving. \n\nLooking forward to coming back once they get settled in! I think this will be a local favorite. It's a really nice upgrade from the old Little Macau that formerly occupied the space.
