I would rate this establishment 0 stars if that was an option.\n\nI have stopped in here on a few separate occasions after seeing their advertisements on their store front, and then seeing they had high yelp reviews.  Both of the times I have walked in with hopes of buying something, yet I have walked out empty handed.\n\nHere is my problem with this place - it is advertising itself as a bakery\/cafe ... Typically when one goes to a privately owned moms & pops type establishment like this, you expect to be able to buy freshly baked goods to order, and you expect to be able to order freshly made food\/sandwiches\/burritos\/whatever customized to your liking.  Well, that is what a reasonable individual would expect.\n\nBoth of the times I stopped in here I wanted to modify food items that I wanted to try ... the last time it was a sandwich, and today I was interested in trying a breakfast burrito, since breakfast burritos are probably one of my favorite foods!!!\n\nGreat - they serve breakfast all day long ... Right?\n\n$3.50 - $4.00 sounds like a great price too ... Right?\n\nWRONG ... In a deceptive way these facts are true, but in reality it turns out that all the burritos are pre-made, and I suspect that they are most likely frozen burritos.  \n\nOn one burrito I asked if I could have mine made up without chili sauce because I don't like super spicy foods.  The person behind the counter told me that they couldn't do that ... My response: So you are telling me that I can't get this burrito without chilli sauce?  Okay ....... so how about this other burrito - I would like my scrambled eggs with eggs whites only.  The woman behind the counter,  No, we can't do that either.....\n\nMy response - so what your telling me is that these are pre-made and not cooked\/made fresh to order?  Two people from behind the counter then responded that the food is made in the morning, but the burrito is not put together until someone orders it.\n\nSo then why can you NOT put chilli sauce into this burrito if it's not already made up?  And your telling me that you don't offer egg whites in a cafe with an extensive breakfast menu?\n\nI really hate it when people engage in deceptive tactics regarding trivial matters ... Clearly the breakfast burritos here are most likely pre-made frozen store bought items, yet this dishonest establishment is trying to claim the food is not pre-made in advance... Despite admitting that they make everything in the morning????  If you tell me that you make your food in the morning, then your food isn't made fresh to-order .... DUH \n\nBottom line is do not lie to your potential patrons because it's very easy to claim to offer fresh food, but if you don't allow any substitutions or allow people to order food how they want it prepared... it is clear that there is something shady\/scheming going on here.\n\nI would never recommend a place like this to anyone, and I would recommend all to stay away from dishonest food establishments like this ... Selling people pre-made frozen breakfast burritos and misleadingly claiming that the ingredients\/food items were cooked in the morning is just deceiving and nasty.  When I go to a bakery\/cafe I expect fresh food made to order the way I want it ... I don't need or want to eat frozen pre-made foods.  Even if it was \"cooked\" in the morning - that is still unacceptable, and definitely not what I am looking for.... No thank you!
