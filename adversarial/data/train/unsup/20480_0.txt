The Cleveland Clinic is nothing less than fantastic! Yes, the heart doctors are world renowned experts in their field. I have known a couple of people who have had to deal with them directly due to heart issues and they always had amazing things to say. As for me, I saw a different kind of specialist at CC for a different thing and was completely pleased. The CC is a major employer and a source of pride. Why does Cleveland need LeBron? Oh yeah, they don't. Not that one impacts the other, but if it did and if I still lived in Cleveland, I'd trade LeBron any day to have world class health care when I need it. Cleveland still has a lot going for it and the heart of Cleveland is the Cleveland Clinic.
