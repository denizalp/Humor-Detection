if you want great Vietnamese noodle soup..this is the go to place...especially winter time. they are fast, good food (actually you will get runny nose too) the price is very reasonable. the only thing is that they dont smile. the owner is usually at the til. i will recommend this restaurant. you get thirsty a little bit, after having their pho. they dont put msg in their soup...i can tell.
