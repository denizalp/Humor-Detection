Nice venue and decor, decent choice of nail colours, unfortunately that's where the good stuff ends. I got a gel manicure but was disappointed by 2 things: the fact that after 2 days of wear, the gel starting chipping (something that never happens with Shellac) and that if you want any type of 'nail art' (gradient, design, half moon) you are charged extra for each. Which means a $50 gel manicure can end up costing you $85 if you want half moons on some nails and accent\/ gradient on other nails. Oh, and the best part? By day 5 the gel had completely peeled off my nails.
