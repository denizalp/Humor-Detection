Love Al Mike's! I love the daily specials that almost always include a fantastic salad and just the other day an authentic Cuban sandwich.  The decor is a mix between old school pub and cozy restaurant.  I've been here several times and seem to always get a salad because they normally do their salads with a spinach leaf base, throw in some pasta for good measure and top it off with fantastic grilled chicken.  \n\nIt's a little off the beaten path which can be a breath of fresh air from the places to eat lunch or dinner down Tryon Street.  It looks to be built from one of the renovated homes there in the neighborhood with a 'dollhouse' style exterior in my opinion.  Cool character for a restaurant.\n\nOne thing to note is that it's a bit dark in there because there isn't any overhead lighting or if there is, it's very minimal.  So if you sit back towards the back prepare to eat by candlelight (even at lunch).  The only windows are towards the front so that's why.
