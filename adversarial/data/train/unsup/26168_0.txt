It was my munchkin's second time bowling and the family wanted to go out and hit up the lanes. I really liked the openess of this place and the arcade was bigger than most bowling alleys I have been too. What got them extra points was that while we were there one of the employees took our order and even delivered it to out sitting area. I was very impressed!\n\nThey need to work on the toddler bowling ramps as they were pretty beat up and the balls never seemed to go the right way as the bottom of the ramp had large divots, but they were still somewhat usable.\n\nAll in all, great time, will return again!
