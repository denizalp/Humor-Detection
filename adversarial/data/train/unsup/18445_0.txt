The cocktails and desserts were decadent and visually appealing. The main course left much to be desired. It took over an hour for our food to arrive and when it did, it was stone cold.\n\nThe open-concept kitchen has poor ventilation and as a result, the entire restaurant was filled with smoke.\n\nOur server was professional and polite, but we found the hostesses to be unnecessarily pretentious and inappropriately dressed for an establishment that claims to be \"posh\".\n\nWe would not go back.
