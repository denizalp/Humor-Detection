Wow! Thank you Mayra for my gorgeous new look! I started going to glamour in April. I went in for hair extensions and color and Mayra attended to me. Mayra is very professional and does amazing job. I've been going to her ever since. Yesterday I went to cut my hair short and I was insecure about it , but Mayra encouraged me and made me feel good after. I love my new amazing look. thank you Mayra
