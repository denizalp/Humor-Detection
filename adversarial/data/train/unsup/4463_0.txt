WOW!  What took so long for this place to open up!  The theme doesn't match the season!!  LOL!!\n\nBefore I begin I heard there was a birthday burrito that was worthy of a Man vs Food challenge but didn't get to see it.  HOWEVER, I did enjoy an appetizer and an open bar!\n\nLocated conveniently within Town Square I was surprised that not a lot of advertising was put out about the grand opening of this place.  Not that I've heard of any but my friends who considers Millers Ale House his second home told me about it.  And what a surprise that he wanted to try something new so I took him up on his offer and what do I see when I get there?  Coconuts!  Being from Hawaii, coconut bras are a necessity if anything were to succeed and it pays homage to the King of Hawaii (not really but the table-side prepared Avocado's were theee bombbbbb).  \n\nCan't really recommend anything but on my next visit I'm trying the mahi mahi dish.\n\nShrimp tacos were good, wish I could have had them with corn tortillas.  But what I was really trying to do was find an entree that had coconuts in them.  I didn't find any!  But I did find tons of drinks!  I had a really chilled pina colada.  I got hammered on my friends drink, it was with pineapple I think but had blue in it (can't remember but it was similar to the Kryptonite shot\/drink), and we had more coming.  We had more but it was definitely good times.  Grand opening was Friday but we were there on the Thurs before?  \n\nAwesome atmosphere, great staff\/service, good food, and great drinks.  Fits the overall theme of Town Square.  And they may have some of the best\/crazy\/cocoNUTS bartenders in town!\n\nBut if you know where Lolita's was at, you'll be able to find this place easily.  Good luck to you CocoNUTS!  Businesses have been closing in Town Square so stay strong!\n\nI shall return sober!
