I brought in my Giant Mtn Bike and needed repairs on the grip shifter. They quoted me a great price and the grip shifter looks and works great!\n\nThe only downside was the length of time to fix it vs. what they quoted. They took a few days longer than they said originally.\n\nI wasn't in a hurry so it didn't really bother me much.\n\nI decided to return to have them take a look at my back brakes that were sticking. They adjusted them on the spot for me no charge.\nThey didn't have to do that but the guy said, \"Just keep coming back\"\nI definitely will.\n\nOverall, l recommend this place to anyone that isn't on a critical bike repair deadline but needs good work done at a fair price.\n\nAndrew Hamilton\nHamilton International Productions\nwww.hiproductions.com
