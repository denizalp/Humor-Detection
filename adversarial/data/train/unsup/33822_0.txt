LOVE this food truck,\nCan't really say that about many because I haven't really had them a lot LOL\n The thing I love is how they make it work and keep\nIn contact with you. \n I booked this truck for my daughters 13th bday and was not disappointed neither were her guest.\n  You can't go wrong here
