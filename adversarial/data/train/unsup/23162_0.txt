Why is the average rating 2 stars?  I mean, do these people who are rating 2 stars know what to expect from Circus Circus?  If you're expecting a Ritz Carlton, it's not going to happen.  I've never stayed here, but GET OVER IT.  Circus Circus is the best :)\n\nI actually just visited last night (Sunday) and it was perfect 'cause it wasn't as crowded as it usually is on Fridays and Saturdays.  On Saturday, we had purchased tickets for Le Reve (a Cirque Du Soleil show at Wynn) here for 20% off.  The Midway was fun as usual and I won myself a soft, squishy, stuffed, pink piggy.  It's so cute, haha.\n\nOnly problem is that I dressed too nicely to be at Circus Circus, which was my bad since I forgot to change clothes.  If you're visiting Circus Circus, you seriously don't have to be wearing anything nice.  No name brand or anything, or all the people there will stare at you and make you feel unsafe - as though they're plotting of ways to rob you.\n\nI honestly wouldn't recommend you stay here unless you really want to save money.  But to visit and have fun in Adventuredome and the Midway is totally worth it!
