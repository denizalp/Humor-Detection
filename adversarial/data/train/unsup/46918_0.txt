The Good:\n- The 5-cheese appetizer was delicious.\n- Our server refilled out water and sweet teas without prompting.\n- The food arrived quickly.\n\nThe Bad:\n- The Chimichanga had corn inside (it wasn't listed on the menu).\n- The soup one party member ordered was not delivered as an appetizer as requested, but instead was delivered with the rest of the entrees.\n- The prices recently went up (December, 2014) which means that two taco's now cost $12 (previously, they were $10). That 20% price increase is seen across the menu.
