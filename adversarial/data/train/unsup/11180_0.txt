Lizzy Hoeffer and her team at Guild Mortgage are excellent ... Andrea Pace was extremely helpful and reassuring while Lizzy went the extra mile to contact me after hours to ensure that all my questions were answered.  Her entire team provided us with wrap around care, which as first time home owners made the process less overwhelming and more fluid.  Communication was this key in our case as Lizzy's team made every effort to ensure this aspect was seamless.\n\nHighly recommended.  This company is a close knit family and it shows from the first time you interact with any one of them.
