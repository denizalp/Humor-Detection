I have eaten here a couple of times recently thanks to Behrouz's suggestion and I must say I'm very pleased.\nThe dough of the takeout slices I've had is the best I've tried so far in Toronto (and by far!) The toppings and range of the veggie slices also leaves you wandering why no one else offers such toppings! So far I have really enjoyed the spinach, ricotta, red pepper and the eggplant, goat cheese, sun-dried tomato pizzas. \nI also tried an Italian sausage, mushroom and onion for takeout which was also tasty but a bit too salty for my taste! \nOverall an excellent option for pizza and I can't wait to try their sandwiches!
