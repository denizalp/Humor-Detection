So unassuming on the outside, this place is adorable on the inside.  We went on a rainy and were promptly seated in the jam-packed dining area.  The dining room is small but well decorated with scenes painted on the walls (pagans? jesters?) and candles everywhere.  \n\nOur server was a lovely woman who, like everyone in Montreal, turned her French and English on and off with no issues.  She walked through the menu with us and gave us a delicious bruschetta while we chose our meals.  \nI went simple and had alfredo with shrimp, boy had manicotti.  Both were amazing.  Admittedly the manicotti was a wee bit better but I was not disappointed with my decision at all.  For dessert I opted for the chocolate rum mousse which was lightly sweet and majorly alcoholic.  There was a biscuit of some sort at the bottom the dish that was pure rum-soaked goodness.  Boy had tiramisu which was yummy too but I was honestly concentrating on getting drunk from mine.  \n\nUnlike most of the places we went the check arrived shortly after we finished.  I think that this place is so popular they want to turn the table over quickly.  I liked that as we sat waiting for uncomfortably long times at other places (reviews to follow).  I would say this is the best overall meal we had while in Montreal.  La Strega is affordable, friendly, quick and delicious.  You will not be disappointed spending your time and money here.
