I started off with a sangria on the menu and mac & cheese. The sangria was perfect, not too sweet and not too alcoholic in taste, it was just right. The mac and cheese were good enough. One thing I notice from the food, it was a little dry and it sticks on the plate. My coworker didn't finish her mussels, I took it from her and I ate the rest. The mussels were alright too. I think all mussels, regardless where it came from, it tastes the same everywhere. The only exception is when the mussels have gone bad, I haven't had the experience of tasting bad mussels yet, certainly not in this pub. The other order I had the pleasure of eating, it was the Plourde soup, a mixture of seafood cover in a creamy soup. This one is alright. I think I would like it if I was still very hungry. \n\nOverall, this restaurant gets 3 stars. The customer service was a lot better than the food itself.  Probably a couple of changes on the cooking will do this restaurant justice. The booze isn't so bad either.
