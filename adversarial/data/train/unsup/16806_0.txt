If you have to spend time in Vegas, this is the least offensive hotel I've seen. Read: still horrifying but the pool is a nice escape that is pleasingly low on the frat boy list of places to party. I expect that \"The Hotel\" is less offensive but then you're subject to the pool at Mandalay Bay and the Four Seasons is way off the main drag. Tip: When at the pool, order an extra shot of whatever booze you're aiming for. They are not afraid to charge you silly amounts of money for what basically amounts to a non-alcoholic beverage. On the bright side, the SW Steakhouse is an orgasmic experience....truly. I wanted to roll around in the fois gras and the steak brought a tear to my eye.  Best $500 I've ever spent on dinner for two (yup - that's right, but worth every penny).
