I've been here twice so far and LOVE it!  Although with self-serve you always run the risk of overindulging a bit, I really appreciate that there are several different sizes of bowls here.  You have to get the samples from an employee but that probably speeds things along, when  you think about it.  There are tons of yogurt flavors to choose from, including a few tart ones.  I tried the peanut butter and the oatmeal.  Both were excellent.  Tons of toppings and you pay by the ounce so you get to try a little of everything without breaking the bank.  I filled up the smallest bowl both times I went and paid about $3 and $3.50 which is not bad at all, considering I had two yogurt flavors and like 4 toppings in there.  The almond roca is one of my favorite toppings they have that you won't necessarily find elsewhere.  Don't forget to get a punch card.  I'm positive I'll be back 7 more times and get that free one someday soon!
