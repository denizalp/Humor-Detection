I did my bankruptcy through H&K and it was painless. The hardest part of course was putting my creditor list together, but I knew going in I would have to do this. They did all the speaking for me in court as I did have a creditor presence who was trying to collect money. They helped me after court to cease additional phone calls. '\n\nMy experience was fairly quick and they kept me completely informed along the way. I would recommend them. They are a little on the higher price side, but to me it was worth it.
