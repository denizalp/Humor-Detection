I was extremely disapointed with Lucky's. It is the sort of snooty place that makes no substitutions for any reason, even if that means you can't eat ANYTHING on the menu. The coffee is great. I have no problem with this place as a coffee shop, but if you are going to serve food, you have to be willing to accommodate the customer. I was extremely pleasant to the server, explaining why I wanted to make a change to my order. He took a firm stand, so I tried to make it easy for him because I was hungry. I asked what I was supposed to order then. His suggestions were all impossible for me to order, showing he was ignorant to my food alergy. That is fine, although surprising for a place that claims to be so forward thinking when it comes to healthy ingredients. When I settled on eggs, I politely asked for him to just not put the toast on my plate. I pointed out that isn't changing anything, it is just not wasting bread that no one was going to eat. This place is supposed to care about the environment, after all. \n\nSure enough, the plate comes out with the toast on top of my food, completely contaminating it. Now, who knows what goes on in kitchens, but I can't ignore it when it is right in front  of me. I thought he must have forgotten. NOPE, in his other hand was an empty plate. He smiled, explaining it was for me to put my toast on. He thought he was being soooo considerate, completely ignoring my needs and wants, and polite requests in the process. \n\nPeople with gluten or other food allergies do not need to eat at Lucky's. However, if we do wander in there with a group of people, and have already been seated, it would be nice that on this first encounter you would be at least human and serve us something we can eat. Just that one time, before we know it is the type of place that does not welcome people with dietary restrictions. We promise, we won't come back. We would just like to eat something that first time.
