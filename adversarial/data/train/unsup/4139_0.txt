This place is fine. It's open late so it'll scratch your itch for a late ramen run. The place isn't huge so do expect to wait a bit, especially if you're Asian and it's late at night because every other Asian is trying to do the same thing as you. \nI personally like garlicky things, so I do recommend the Cha Cha one. I also personally think this branch looks cooler than the one in Los Angeles (if anyone cares about that).
