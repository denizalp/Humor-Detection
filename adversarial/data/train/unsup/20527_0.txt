I'm shameless. I come to Chapters to soak up their A\/C and treat their magazine rack like my free personal library. I plop myself on the couch in their Starbuck's and flip through a shopping-basketful of my favorite titles. \n\nOn a recent excursion I browsed:\nFood & Wine\nSaveur\nGourmet\nCook's Illustrated\nReal Simple\nToronto Life\nNew York\nNew Yorker\n\nI didn't buy any of them. I know, I'm a terrible person. You should probably de-friend me.
