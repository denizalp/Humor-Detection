On the way into the hotel we were stopped by a promoter asking if we had any places to go, we told him we were thinking about the bank. So he told us he was a promoter and can get us into the club no wait in line needless to say it was a lie... They pulled us to the side of the casino ID'ed us and gave us wrist band. They so called promoter told the guy in charge I got 5 girls. So the guy marked him down for 5 girls as if his job was to just bring in girls to the club. weird. \nThan we were tAken to the so called line to get in with the wrist bands they gave us. The bouncer said the wrist bands don't mean anything. We had to \"stand in line\" ( which the line was just a mob of people around the door) \nWe went back to the promoter and asked him what's up with the lies you just told us about not waiting in line. Again he brought us back over to the same line and told us to wait here, he told the bouncer to let us in and he left before we got in. The bouncer still denied us access. \nWe waited ,..... standing there confused... As the bouncer let's girls in with the wrist bands.\nThe same promoter before brought girls to the same line this time they were denied as well. \nYet again the bouncer let more girls in and still denying us. It made no sense except for the fact that he let white girls in and not Asian. The group of girls that didn't get in also was black. \n\nThis is a place that judges you on your race, denying Asians and blacks to\nEnter into the club. they are racists\nThey have ppl running around the casino to get girls into the club and count the # of girls they get as a pay. Then they don't even let you into the club If you're non-white.
