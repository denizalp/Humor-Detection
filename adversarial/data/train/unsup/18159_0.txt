Def a fan. \n\nKeep in mind these donuts are very fresh and do not do what I did and leave a Strawberry Shortcake one out in the box on the counter overnight. \nIt will turn into a green fuzzy science experiment.\n\nHubby went at 8am one morning and when I woke up I woke up to a dozen vegan donuts...ummmmm no way we were going to eat all that madness. \n\nThis review is for the vegan donuts only.\n\nI found my fav was the green tea. Second fav was the creme brûlée.\n\nJust get what you are going to eat that day...they will hit the bin the next day if not :)
