We've been driving past this spot for years and always wanted to try it. A group of us went on Friday evening and it was a blast. \n\nFirst the food. If you've never had Filipino food before the buffet is a perfect introduction. Though I would avoid the fish, it is Talapia which isn't a very good fish. The Pork Belly is rich and buttery smooth with just a hint of spice. All the vegetable dishes were really tasty. The real star here is the barbecued skewers of pork and chicken that they cook fresh outside on the patio. \n\nThe service is fast and friendly though a little chaotic due to the crush of people on a Friday night. \n\nIf you have a large enough group and are feeling like a real party book the Budda's table which is a communal dinner of just about everything on the menu served on grape leaves and rice. It has to be seen to be believed.
