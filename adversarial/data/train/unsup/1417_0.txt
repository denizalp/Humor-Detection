I booked a room here for the Las Vegas Rock N' Roll Marathon weekend.  They had a special rate for us runners...$110 a night.  I didn't exactly search for other deals, so I hope that really was a good rate!  I chose this hotel since it was only about 1 mile away from the start of the race.  \n\nThere were 4 of us, so I got a room with 2 queen beds.  The beds were ok, but the pillows were a bit flat to me.  The bathroom was pretty spacious.  They only gave us 3 towels, but house keeping was very quick to respond to our phone call and bring us extra towels.\n\nThe rodeo was in town for the week, so there was some event happening outside, and it woke me up at 9am on Saturday morning!  They were also playing country music in the casino all weekend.  I have nothing against country music, but I really don't think I could gamble and listen to it all night long.  \n\nI was able to get a late checkout, so we were able to take our time and shower after our half marathon.  Overall, the service here was good, and the rooms are decent.  I would probably consider this hotel again if I decide to run the race again next year.
