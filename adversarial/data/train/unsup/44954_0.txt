Unpleasant experience before work was even done.  Their website to book appointments doesn't function. There's no indication of this on the website. What's the point of even having it? I made an appointment on September 9th for September 13th and I had to call and see if my appointment was valid. This is NOT a great first impression. Giving this experience 1 star is being generous.
