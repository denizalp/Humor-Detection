I ordered the chips & salsa with a house margarita & the grilled shrimp tacos for dinner.  Holy Toledo was it ever hot!  My mouth was on fire!!  I was so stuffed from drinking so much water I couldn't finish the tacos.  They were really good too.  The outside of my mouth even started to burn and I thought my throat was going to close shut.  They were so good!!!\n\nI love Chilis but I think I might be allergic to the peppers they use because I thought I was going to die!  \n\nBut they were really good............:-)
