I just love this hot dog place.   Its small and family run.  There are pick nick tables outside to sit at and a TV playing Telmundo at all times.   \n\nFor me, the only thing I have had on the menu is their signature Sonoran style dog.  Great fresh bread not regular store bought buns but good ones from a local bakery - with a bacon wrapped dog smothered in refried beans, guac, sour cream, mustard, cream, cheese, fresh tomatoes and amazing caramelized onions.  This place is awesome.  Anytime I am in the area, I try to stop by.  They are mostly open in the evening.   \n\nI gave it 5 stars because the dog is amazing and they used quality ingredients cooked just right.
