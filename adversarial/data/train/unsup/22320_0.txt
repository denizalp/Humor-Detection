Had a relatively nice stay here. At first, I was in the newly renovated Julius tower which was beautiful. The color palette was clean and airy. The renovations were so recent that the paint still smelled fresh. There was an issue with the climate control after a few hours in the room, so they gave me the Octavius tower on the 51st floor. The Octavius tower was very far removed from the casino, which could either be a pro or a con. It's very secluded and quiet. There's a side entrance on Flamingo that is closer to the Octavius elevators so make sure you tell the cab to drop you off at this side entrance. The octavius tower is more luxurious and the rooms have more square footage. The octavius room and bathroom was huge compared to the Julius room. The octavius bathroom featured an awesome jetted tub and amazing shower.  The room had a warm color palette with dark wood tones. The rooms had doorbells which I thought were super cute.
