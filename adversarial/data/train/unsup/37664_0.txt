Winterlicious 2013: One of the best experiences, period.\n\nExceptional Food (everything we ordered was delectable): \nEntree - Salade Havanese & Terrine de Campagne \nMain - Braised Beef Crecy & Confit de Canard\nDessert - Valrhona Chocolate Surprise & Poire Confit et son Sabayon \n(dessert was especially heavenly - both are fantastic choices!)\n\nHave to second Mochi's review (12\/30\/2012). \n\nWe were prolly the youngest, most casually-dressed (oops) patrons for the evening and despite that... service was courteous and on-point! \n\nIf you want to have French food done right at a reasonable price point, Didier is it. This is one of the few restos I'd return to (maybe for their year-round prix fixe?) after having sampled them at Winterlicious. \n\nDefinitely worth it!
