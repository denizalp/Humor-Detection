Nice little spot on St Laurent right in Chinatown. This isn't the greatest bowl of noodles I've ever had, but I'll give it 4 stars because this place has its heart in the right place. Doesn't look like much from the street, but when you climb the stairs you find a clean, modern, cozy little ramen-ya. \n\nThe noodles are fine, if not terribly exciting. Tasty soy-based broth and good selection of toppings. If I lived in Montreal, I'd stop by every now and then for a quick bite.
