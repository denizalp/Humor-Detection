This rating is purely for MORNING BUFFET!!!\n\nI would definately come back.  I very much enjoyed their morning food.  I think it was 15 dollars for the morning buffet.  They had some sushi, chinese, italian, and of course american food as well.  \n\nWould definately come back for their morning buffet.  I'm not sure about the lunch or dinner ones since I haven't tried any.
