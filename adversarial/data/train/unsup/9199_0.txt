The thought of this place made me so angry, but now...I LOVE IT!\n\n1. They have double coupon day, just like their friends Copps and Pick and Save.\n2. They have an amazing baking counter.\n3. Wine, wine, wine!\n4. Make your own six packs\n5. OR just buy a six pack, they have a great variety!\n6. Pulled pork or brisket sandwiches! They come with sides for $5 or $6\n7. OR buy the meat by the pound, buy the rolls separately and you will save a few dollars (but this is not a good option unless you are going home). \n8. A variety of international foods\n9. Products you can not get anywhere else (Can you say 5 kinds of yogurt covered raisins?)\n10. Rewards programs for their smoothies, gelato AND coffee. Buy ten, get the 11th free (they keep track on your fresh perks card).\n11. Amazing customer service.  A week ago, they really messed up my coffee. I could not wait for it to get redone. I filled out a survey about my experience and within two hours Amber, a member of their customer service team, was at my door! Wow! They brought me coffee, flowers and a gift card!  Who does that?!  Well they wontme over. \n12. A more in depth hot food counter. Need lunch?  They even have picnic tables out front.\n13. Creamer?  Tired of three options at your local store.  They had more than I could count.  I love coffee.\n14. Sample day?  Not  just cheese. I sampled ice cream.  Yes, you heard it.\n15. Affordable paper supplies\/school products. I paid 79 cents for a pack of note cards. WOW! They beat target on those!
