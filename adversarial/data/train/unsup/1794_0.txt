This place is run by a bunch of hacks. First off they don't allow bow cases. Really??? I asked and was told because they didn't want people tripping over them. So I looked for a place to set my things down. No place to do that. I looked at the counter. Couldn't do that because some hack had a bow in pieces all over it. Gee dont they have a shop area to work on bows. I wouldnt want them to work on my bow by bouncing it all over the counter. Apparently they don't want my business because I am not going to get ready to shoot in the parking lot before going in. And I am not gong to leave my tools for adjusting my bow in the car. That's why I have a bow case. Apparently I was spoiled bw the range I use to shoot at. They had room for cases and welcomed you with open arms and bent over backwards to help you. I will hang up my bow before shooting at this dump.
