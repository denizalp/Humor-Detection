Waiting in line for two hours contributed a lot to the hype for the food here at LMBBQ... but it lived up to the expectations. I got there a bit late so I wasn't able to get a full serving of the fat brisket, but to be honest the regular brisket is also freakishly delicious. If you're looking for a more balanced taste, I would recommend it instead. The pulled pork was also amazing. \n\nFor first timers: get a plate w\/ 2 sides. The pies are also a must-get. Sauces offered and restaurant exclusive but aren't necessary.
