This place sucks Parking Lot NOT Secured!!! Worst experience ever!! My friend's car back windshield got broken in In there parking lot and they stole over $3,000 in baseball bats & equipment. There were no cameras in the hotel parking lot to record this whatsoever and the hotel didn't care either!! Today He received a call from the Hilton hotel manager in Henderson and to add more fuel to the fire they only offered him a complementary night & advised that next time don't leave items in my car!! \nThieves been stealing from cars in that hotel already multiple times(an employee told us) \nhe told the manager that they should tell other guest that the parking lot is not secured!! Managers answer was that if they do that nobody would stay at the hotel! DO NOT STAY THERE!\nUnreal; \nShame on them
