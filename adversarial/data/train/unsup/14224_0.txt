Ok, I have to admit, I'm a Phantom freak! This is the fourth Phantom show I'd been and as much as they cut some of the scenes, they did so well that everything went so smoothly until I realized the show was over in less than 2 hours without intermission. By the time, I was about to leave the theater, I was still mesmerized on how they really staged everything, from the fake theater seating on the sides to the chandelier that supposedly got dropped to the audience.\n\nAt first I would love to sit on Orchestra seating below as I always do on every Broadway shows, however, on this night, I was so thankful to my friend, who got me a Mezzanine seating because you could see everything, especially when they dropped the chandelier and the appearance of Phantom in the middle of it. That was spectacular. I never saw that in every other Phantom I watched. This stage was clearly made specially for Phantom and I was seduced. \n\nThankfully I managed to catch this show before they stopped the running at Venetian, it's money well-worth and the small theater made it even more incredible with the singing plus the sound system.
