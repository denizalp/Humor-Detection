The tacos were damn good! The rice and beans were awesome too! I even loved their guacamole and I'm super picky!!!! The only thing that stopped me from giving 5 stars was that a \"side\" of chips was like 10 chips and we asked for 2 types of salsa that wasn't in the bag when we got home. If I could give 4.5 stars I would, so close!!!!
