We were here last week with a party of 4 and excited to try a highly rated Korean BBQ place in Las Vegas but the food was mediocre, the price was high, and the service was bad. \n\nPrice: Expensive. The \"large\" beef combo for \"3-4 people\" was $95 and severely lacking in quantity. You WILL leave hungry-- I guarantee it. With tax and tip, our total came out to $120+ for 4 people without any drinks. For that price we got two handfuls of brisket, a plate of marinated ribs, 4 pieces of shrimp, 4 pieces of steak sashimi, and bulgogi.\n\nFood: Mediocre. This place strives to be like Kang Hodong Baekjeong in Los Angeles except it's not. The meat was tough, the salad smelled bad, and the sauces were lacking.\n\nService: Awful. This is where it goes downhill. From the second the hostess heard we didn't have a reservation and her bad attitude to unfilled cups of water, missing food, slow refills, burnt meat because she wasn't attentive to the grill it went from bad to worse as the meal went on. We found ourselves making multiple requests for the same thing and getting dirty looks when we flipped the meat on the grill even though the server was not doing it for us. \n\nOverall, not recommended. Skip.
