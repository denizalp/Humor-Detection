I really enjoyed this place and places like it.\n\nI wont go over the concept as its covered in so many other reviews. I'll do a quick Pro\/Con then clue you in on some things you can ask for that you won't get unless you know to ask.\n\nPro:\nGreat place to celebrate. Its has a very nice atmosphere about it. I've been several times and its not the type of place someone is going to go and cause a ruckus.\n\nYou will not leave hungry!\n\nThe service is incredible! You feel 100% pampered at this place. You drink is always full. You will constantly have a new plate. They also constantly swap out your tables side dishes for fresh hot ones.\n\nCon:\nThey have very limited side dishes compared to their local competitor. This can be a good and bad thing. I guess really it should be about the meat but its also nice to have some variety and something to cut the fat of the endless meat your eating. This is really why they are getting a 4 verses a 4.5 or a 5 from me.\n\nThe cheese bread they serve is a bit dry. Their competitors is much better. Then again I think its hit or miss because I do recall liking it on a previous trip.\n\nThings To Know:\nYou *WANT* to try the beef rib. They do not come around with this you have to ask for it. It is very fatty but cooked so well and so long that instead of being really heavy it just melts. You will want more ;)\n\nThey have sauces that you also have to ask for:\nchimichurri\nmint sauce\ncreamed horseradish(not very hot)\nReally the meat is so good you wont need it. But if you find things getting overly heavy before your full these will help.\n\nThey also have I believe two other side dishes they will not bring unless requested.\n\nThings I Love:\nCostela (Beef Ribs)\n\nBeef Ancho (Rib Eye)\n\nFrango (Chicken) The legs are the best.. the bacon wrapped is also good but just way to heavy\/rich.\n\nLinguica (Sausage) With this be careful it is VERY fatty. Its the type of food that you *FEEL* the minute you eat it.\n\nFried Bananas (one of the standard sides)\n\nFlan: I have no idea what they do to this. It was the creamiest I have ever tasted and by far the best. Its almost like it was whipped with a soft cheese but thats not the case. You wont regret trying some.. well at least not until you see the scale.
