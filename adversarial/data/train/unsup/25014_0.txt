Two breakfast stops while in Vegas for a convention were completely necessary considering they served alcohol as soon as they opened. Their Bloody was ok but they couldn't keep the Irish coffee coming fast enough, day two.\n\nOutdoor bar seating was nice considering the weather and accompanied by an attentive barkeep who offered me a sample of something on tap I was looking at.\n\nThe eggs Benedict the first day was average; the ham being the most boring part of the \"sandwich\" while the sandwich the second day (my coworker got the first day) was very good and outrageously huge.\n\nConsidering it was right off the strip and opened at 7 am, I'd make this a pretty good option if I have (yes, have) to go back to Vegas again.
