Two stars for the blatant misrepresentation. Touting themselves as locally sourced, all natural (a meaningless marketing term anyway), and healthy, this \"new age-y\" eatery has many challenges. My biggest peve... their menu says, \"Our proteins are naturally raised... because happy food makes healthy food.\"\n\nMe to manager: Is the salmon farmed or wild caught?\"\n\nMr Manager: It's farmed.\nMe: How is this natural? How is a constrained fish a happy fish?\nMM: The fish are raised in their own environment. They are just restricted.\nMe: Seriously? Ok, now you're just spinning words. I'm sure the restricted salmon are not \"happy\" salmon.\n\nA note. The server asked if everything was ok. I showed her where it said \"naturally raised\". Her reply was word for word the same as the manager. Someone was coached.\n\nThe noise level was almost an intolerable cacophony. No sound-proofing materials on walls or ceilings.\n\nSo now the niceties. A lovely atmosphere visually with lots of pastels and artsie pieces. The patio is large and airy. The selection is varied.\n\nI would recomend a visit to make your own decision.
