Horrible disgusting dirty dark place with shady business practices. There was a rat under my bed and people loitering outside my room. The property was nearly empty and one of the employees harassed at me at the breakfast which was nothing more than stale toast. They charged me extra after I left and keep charging my credit card charges that are not mine. Beware do not stay at this place
