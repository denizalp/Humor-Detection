The sonic was not open for business \/ no one responded to me at the drive-thru at 620am. I waited until 633am and even knocked on their front door. The hours of operation state 6am-11pm ? The music was playing, but no one seemed to be there?! Very disappointed ! Apparently they don't want my money!
