The new joint is bigger and better than ever! I cannot tell you how much I love this place. I want to shove never ending $7 citrus marinated pork burritos in my mouth! I hate to say it, but it competes with Reyna's tacos for me. Sorry kids. There might be a new burrito ruling the mean streets of Pittsburgh!\n\nAND, now that their space is bigger, their menu is as well! Fried Avocado... may take the place of a fried pickle in my book. Delicious! Spicy gauc with yuca chips. Okay, pile on some more! They now even have bonafide entree items.\n\nIt doesn't get much better than this. But WAIT, it will... when they get their liquor license. I can imagine nights of margarita drinking on their patio (that I think they'll have down by their old location??). BYOB for now, so bring your mixers for their tasty bevvies. \n\nThis place is dangerous for me, as it's in my hood. But at least I don't have far to roll myself home!
