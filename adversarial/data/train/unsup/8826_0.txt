Never walk the Strip hungry. It's a contrary notion to make good decisions in Vegas, but really, there's so much good food here, it makes me want to flip over tables when I make a not-so-good choice.\n\nUsual deal with me: the service was great. Very friendly and attentive. \n\nThe decor is nice, but kind of felt psuedo-nice inside. They had a digitized drink menu on the table, which entertained my friend while we were there. And while I like the concept of [it] I couldn't help but think of the Outback Steakhouse in a small town I was in that had the same thing. She had a mojito and I had a beer.\n\nShe had eaten, and I was ravenous. They served 4 different kinds of cuisine for appetizers: Peruvian, Greek, French, and something else. This usually worries me but hunger wore me down.\n\nI ordered two apps so I could figure out what I wanted to eat. I had the chestnut soup with profiteroles and received GRAVY. Thanksgiving-style gravy. I am SO not kidding. Without a word, I had my friend taste it and asked her what she thought I was eating. Gravy ding ding ding! $12.gravy.\n\nThen came the octopus with potatoes ($18?) The octopus was fishy in taste and flavor and I was concerned if I would get a stomachache later. It was seasoned fine (maybe to mask the fishiness) but the potatoes were bland. I didn't even take a picture.\n\nThe waitperson came back to ask me what I wanted for dinner and I just shook my head. I was starving, but couldn't do it. Our bill was almost $60. What the holy heck? \n\nJust don't, guys.
