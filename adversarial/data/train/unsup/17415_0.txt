After I scheduled Dad & I's appointments for a couple of weeks from today, I will update my review on our particular visit, Dr. Martinez & services.\n\nFor now, I'd like to update you all whom don't have a dentist on what they offer.  Being that I have only seen my Dr. Brady in Iowa since I was in Kindergarten, I am scared to see another dentist.  I am looking for the right dentist to call my Dr. Brady so to speak, my regular dentist for as long as possible.  Trustworthy & that I'm excited to see, you know, least amount of pain & all good news lol cause I floss & take care of my teeth.\n\nThey do take Delta Dental so that's a plus for Dad & they take non-insured, a plus for me.  Right now they are offering an awesome deal, almost too good to be true cause in Iowa it is $75 & above, not including X-rays.  Dr. Martinez owns the dentistry so I feel slightly better that he'll be doing the exam.  However, it's still scary so will post an update our initial visit & on the dentist.  \n\nReceptionist & the lobby were inviting.  Conveniently located from us, we even found a shortcut leaving!  It takes you to Carnegie & Horizon Ridge w\/ in seconds.  A new great Starbucks is right there too.  Many places to walk to if you're killing time.
