I absolutely love when employees are complete bitches. Ok, no, I lied. I hate it. \nAs I was perusing a circular rack, one of their female employees decides to re-stack some clothes on my rack. Normally, I never mind that. But it became an issue when she would use all her super human strength to forcibly push all the clothes to give herself room, effectively shutting off all possibilities for me to see any of the clothes. Every time she did it, I very slightly, like 1\/2 inch, tried to move the clothes so I can see the individual items, and it became a game for her where she would intentionally, with a smirk on her face, part the red sea of clothes for herself again and give me no chance. WTF? Completely unprofessional and rude. On top of that, I had like 20 items in my arms and she did not offer to take them from me to the fitting room, like BE employees usually (should) do. This same employee \"assisted\" me at the dressing room area...the whole time, she never said ONE word. Counted my clothes, gave me a number, shooed me in. But she was definitely vociferous with her male co-workers, who she flirted with while completely ignoring customers. \n\nI've had similar experiences here in the past. I will definitely go to the Missouri Ave location from now on because as these asshole people are proving, Tempe is the devil!\n\nP.S. also, you are selling USED clothes. USED. That means you shouldn't price them more than I can find them NEW. Douchebags.
