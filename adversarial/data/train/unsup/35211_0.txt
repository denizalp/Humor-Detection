I came here for a Spanish Meetup event. First I must say that the staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. It might have been because the restaurant only recently opened up (but I'm not certain). Regardless, this staff was probably the most friendly and pleasant I have ever encountered and it doesn't sit well with me, although fair is fair, to give only three stars.\n\nI ordered the chicken with beans and rice with maduro as an extra accompaniment. While my chicken along with the sauce it was in (I forget what it was) was really tasty as was the maduro, I did not care much for the beans and rice, which to me is the staple of this cuisine. Do take into account I moved here from NJ where there are plenty of Cuban and other Latino restaurants that know how to make delicious beans and rice.\n\nThis place however has the perfect ingredients: a great location, a nice and roomy venue, and extremely nice staff. All they must do is perfect the beans and rice. The beans dish I really like usually has cilantro, sazon, and garlic and they are really soft. If they can improve in this area then they will easily get 5 stars.
