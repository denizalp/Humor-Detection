Stopped out to Stage Door the other night, and had a blast!\nService was outstanding, enough to earn an additional star.\nBrittany, the bar tender we had, is awesome.  Every time I've been in and she's been working, she's smiling.  I don't think I've ever not seen her smile.\n\n$4 shots of patron?  YES PLEASE.  The glass was salted, with a lime.  Delicious!\n\nGreat Job Stage Door! :)
