This place seriously needs more employees on the weekends.\n\nThe employees who work here are fine (in both ways - wink, wink), but they are just so overwhelmed with the weekend rush.\n\nThis last time, I waited more than 40 minutes to pick up my rental because there was a line out the door (and wrapped around inside).\n\nI try not to pick up or drop off on the weekends, but sometimes I am forced to rent a car and I have no choice.\n\nEnterprise is also far from the most economical choice.  Consider any other rental car company first.  If they're booked or someone else is paying, pick Enterprise.  They'll pick you up (use it)!\n\nNOTE: I picked Enterprise due to a body shop paying for my rental and got to drive a Dodge Charger with less than 500 miles on it.  Pretty sweet for a rental, hence the 3 stars instead of two.
