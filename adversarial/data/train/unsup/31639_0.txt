I really enjoy Japanese food and had heard how authentic Musashi was. Well, that is true. It is authentic and just as bland as some of the Japanese restaurants in Japan. The ingredients were fresh and my Nabeyaki Udon tasted good and was hot and savory. It just had no spice at all to it. Once I shook in a lot of the spice they brought with it, it became a decent meal. If this was available at pho prices, I would be back. However, with that dish costing $15+, I'd rather pick up some fresh bok choy and some Myojo Udon noodle packets and DIY udon at home.
