There is something really off about this place. I've been to other locations and they are always packed or there's a line out the door. This place - ALWAYS EMPTY.  I went in tonight for the first time. Thought I'd have a treat. There was a woman talking to the guy behind the counter. I didn't even have two foots in the door and the woman immediately told me to go ahead. What's the rush? Where are all of the people? I walked out immediately. There is something really odd about this location. I hope it closes down soon so something worthy of the Annex can go in there.
