Do not go here. Ever. I have a been a handful of times hoping it will be better and it is not. Tonight I went and after sitting in the drive thru line for a good 20 minutes, I finally ordered my 4 chocolate ice cream cones. Total was $12. $12! Get to the window, pay, and was handed a vanilla cone. I did not sit in line for over 30 minutes to pay $12 for ice cream cones I did not order. They made every single one vanilla. Thank you DQ for messing up my order once again while taking your sweet time making it.
