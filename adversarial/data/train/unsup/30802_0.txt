This show was hilarious! Great show for the whole family! Jeff Civillico comes out at the end of the show & signs autographs & takes pictures with everyone FREE! The show is conveniently in the afternoon @ 5:30pm & tickets are inexpensive! One of my favorite shows by far! I even got called on stage & it was so much fun! He is so funny! I would definitely see his show again! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Love his show & my whole family loved it too, from ages 1 to 70 years old! my youngest is 1 & she laughed & loved it & my grandmother is 70 & she loved the show as well! His stunts, jokes & tricks are AMAZING! How does he do it?!
