Heard about this special Starbucks, so I went and spent the afternoon there.  I liked how it's spacious and modern.  Lots of seatings with plug outlets for your gadgets.\nI ordered a nitro cold brew float for about $10.  It came in a decent size cup.  The coffee was smooth, rich and creamy with a hint of bitter.  In hind sight, I should have stirred in the overly sweet ice cream to neutralize the bitter taste.  \nI was enjoying my afternoon there and much to my delight, the servers came around periodically with samples of treats.  They were friendly and courteous.   What's not to like?!
