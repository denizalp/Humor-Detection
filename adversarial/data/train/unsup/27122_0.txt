I was looking forward to a wonderful dinner with my husband and became disappointed once we sat down.  The table was empty of decor except for a glass votive with a cheap oil light insert (maybe they could get more creative and hide the oil light insert).  The wall next to our table had food and stains on it.\nWe opted for the summer three course special and the first course was the first indication of the chef being out of town.  The food was not seasoned and the basil on the heirloom tomato salad was just large leaves thrown on top.  For fine dining have they not heard of chiffonade for garnishing?  The main courses were nice but also lacking seasoning.  By the time our main course came it became apparent the room was over  80 degrees.  The waiter told us the a\/c could not be turned down any further because the just opened the room we were seated in due to the dining room being full.  The dining room was only half full. There is nothing worse then getting dressed up and ending the dining experience sweaty and uncomfortable.
