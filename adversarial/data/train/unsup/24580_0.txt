Before going my bf told me to google \"Tom Hanks\" + \"Patty's Tacos\"\n\nI did...and umm...Tom loves Merry-Arts?  \n\nI've been to Merry-Arts plenty of times.  They have live music, lots of TVs (including some that are at your booth) and good beer\/drink specials.  \n\nWhat I'd never experienced before was a Patty's Taco.  The tacos are served up ONLY on Mondays and Thursdays by two stout ladies wielding paper plates and nary a smile on their face.  Doesn't matter though because the tacos are darned good.  For $1.75 each you get a choice of three sauces (note: the hot is NOT hot), heaps of lettuce, meat plus onion filler, sour cream, cheese and probably tomatoes though I don't necessarily remember them.  I think the clincher was the shell though...it was super deep fried which gave it a nice home-made feel.  \n\nSo was Tom right?  Are these worthy of mentioning on Letterman?  Eh...maybe not.  They still tasted like tacos and I've had some pretty darned good tacos for $1.00 in this town before.  Even still, washing them down with cheap pitchers and watching football (ahem, truth?  Actually...the Sing-Off) on the booth TVs was worth it.  \n\nOh, Oh,  and before I forget...I liked the Patty ladies.  When we left we had to find the stouter one and pay for our tacos.  I appreciate the trust, plus getting handed change in the back alley by an old lady smoking was kind of the cherry on top of the night.  Maybe that's me...but it was sweet.
