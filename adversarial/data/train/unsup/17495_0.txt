Mian looks like a divey spot, unusually spacious and a California based chain also located in Honolulu. The menu is beautifully photographed and reminds me of DTF. Initially I was so excited and hopeful since me and my group were craving a good bowl of soup after a night out!\n\nFavorites were the fungus and steamed egg i could eat both all day! \n\nThe potsticker skin was not delicate, the vegetables were steamed and completely unseasoned. Perhaps this is the style of authentic Sichuan food but the noodle soups were all disappointing. I preferred the broth of the spare rib and the meat in the beef noodle soup (less dry). Soups overall were pretty bland and tasted of pure spice. \n\nI appreciate the generous noodles but would come back only for the egg.
