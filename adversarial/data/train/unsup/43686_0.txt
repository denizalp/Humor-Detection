Had to stop by and try out the Bloody Mary at Fieri's Vegas Kitchen... and it did NOT disappoint. The \"stuffings\" was spicy and good, but certainly not the best we've had, but the drink itself.... top shelf! That alone is worth trying the beverage. We coupled it with their nachos (with brisket) and bacon wrapped jalapeños... and damn!! Hats off to Guy for an incredible tasty beverage on a 102° day, with flavorful appetizers to accompany. We were here with a group of thirsty ladies for a pre-wedding celebration. The staff was friendly, gracious, and funny. Many thanks! We'll be back!
