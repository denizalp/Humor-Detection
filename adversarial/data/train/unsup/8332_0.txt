This salon is a joke!! I moved here from California where let's be honest they have amazing salons in California I was a little spoiled, so I look up salons online and I see this one being a paul Mitchell salon you'd think it would be good right? No so very wrong! The stylist I had was great.. The owner and front desk girl was beyond unprofessional and rude.. I see this special they have online that if you book between 4-7 you get highlights for $75 I was thinking well ok that's a great deal. We get there and we have to fill out a form with all our personal info.. Red flag! Like why do you need that? Thennnn they start putting foils on my hair and bring out a checklist and all of a sudden I'm paying $200 charging me left and right for things when I told them I booked with the special they said \"oh no that's for chin length hair\" I said well it doesn't say that I even pulled it up on my phone and showed her.. At that point it was too late for me to say no they had foils in my hair! My mom was going to do the same deal her hair is literally at her shoulders and they were trying to charge her the same price so my mom goes no it's ok I'm not going to have my service done today I can't afford it and the owner says to her \"well I'm going to charge you anyway you might as well get a haircut\" my mom at that point was heated and said ok fine the stylist literally trimmed her bangs that was it!!!! For $75!!! This place is a joke I will never step foot in there again! Although I like gabbi she was great! I think they should really have the board go in there and inspect how they conduct such awful business considering the owner doesn't do hair she just stand with a checklist trying to get every penny out of people bad business honey.
