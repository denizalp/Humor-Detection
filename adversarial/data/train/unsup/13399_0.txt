***Tower City Center reminds me of a lot of Downtown shopping centers where you have some contemporary stores as well as a lot of services and shops that have been there for a long while and might not feel the freshest; overall, it is not a bad place to walk around, but it also not a great collection of shops; the architecture is occasionally interesting and the glass design provides a view of the river from many vantage points (though the river does not look that great)***\n\nI am not sure what the parking situation is here.
