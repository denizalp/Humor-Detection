After a full weekend of debauchery and gambling, we went to the Venetian to relax and watch some sports and do a little bit more gambling. As we were walking past the sports bar area, we found this joint and felt like trying something new. The d√©cor of the restaurant is definitely different from the Venetian; it kind of reminded me of Hot Topic. We made our way into this restaurant\/bar and as we sat, we immediately saw the specialty of this place to be burgers. We all ordered the Rattlecan burger with a side of tater tots and fries. \n\nOn my Rattlecan, I chose to put an egg and ordered a side of the ghostbuster chili just to add some kick to my burger\/tater tots. My friend ordered a drink but didn't realize it came late until the nice waitress came with the drink and apologized for the drink coming late. On top of that, she comp'ed it since she felt bad for it. Now this is the type of Vegas service that makes me LOVE Vegas. \n\nWhen our burgers came out, we didn't realize how HUGE these burgers were! The burgers here are definitely big enough to share so for those with a lighter appetite, keep that in mind! Also, this restaurant doesn't ask how you want your burger cooked. They automatically cook it to medium (pink in the center) and that's how it should be! The burgers come with the usual fix ins: tomato, cole slaw, and pickles. The burger itself was pretty good but for those wanting a kick, order a side of the ghosbuster chili and smother your burger\/tater tots. **FYI The ghostbuster chili IS spicy so for those that aren't too keen on the heat, don't go overboard!\n\nThe food here was relative to Vegas price: 16-20$ for a burger. All in all, I liked the burger here and see myself coming back here again!
