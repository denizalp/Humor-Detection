Border Grill - Mandalay Bay\n\nOur last night in Las Vegas, we decided to take a stroll over to Mandalay Bay and have dinner at Border Grill. This place was highly recommended on the gluten free sites and showed on their website to have a dedicated gluten free menu, so needless to say I was pumped to check it out. \n\nThe hostess was not very friendly. I gotta say that I am a stickler for happy, positive employees because they are the face of your business and crucial to customer satisfaction. \n\nI was pleased to see such a large gluten free menu until I opened it and realized 2 of the pages were filled with alcohol choices. \n\nWe decided to try the Queso Fundido, which they brought out with corn tortillas and the chips are gluten free there. The dip was pretty tasty for sure but it didn't knock my socks off. \n\nOur waiter was aware of celiac disease and gluten free preparations so that made me feel at ease too during our time there. \n\nI ordered a shrimp and rice which came out on a plate filled with rice and then a strip of shrimp down the middle. The rice was in a pool of liquids making it a bit soggy. I have to say that I can't stand wet rice so I just ate the rice off the top and picked at the shrimp. The dish was disappointing and I didn't leave there feeling like I had an amazing gluten free dish coming from somewhere that specifically has a gluten free menu. The cost of my 10 small shrimp and rice was also $28 which I found to be completely out of line for the quality of the dish. \n\nNow, had that dish come out and completely wowed me, I wouldn't blink at spending $28 on vacation in Las Vegas for dinner. It just didn't do it for me so I can tell you I won't likely go back on my trip to Las Vegas next year. \n\nI would recommend Border Grill because they are educated and understand gluten free meals but I'm not sure it would be my first pick for someone. It's the safe choice.
