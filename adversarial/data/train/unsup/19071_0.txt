People rave about this place - and I *think* I see why, though it isn't necessarily because of the food. Grand Electric has an atmosphere + ambiance that makes you *feel* like you're having a good time - it has an intimate community atmosphere where it's lively, casual, and you feel nothing awkward. It fuels the idea that you're having just a plain ol' good time with friends over good drinks and food. And that warrants this place's popularity and stars.\n\nWe dropped by a weekday evening around 6:30 PM, and this place was jammed - there aren't many seats to begin with. So note - if you don't want to share a communal table or be stuck waiting at the door. There's also a good amount of paid street parking in front of the restaurant.\n\nIn terms of the food itself (which we came for), I actually think there are tastier taco joints in Toronto. We ordered the nachos platter which came with different dips (a good-sized portion, and good for a group), and a variety of tacos. They weren't bad - not excellent, but they were alright (if I remember correctly, the Baja Fish taco was the standout for us).\n\nOverall, I think if you come here, you're visiting for more than just the food - you're here for the atmosphere, the hip & casual spot to grab drinks with friends, and for the community. But if you're coming here solely to look for life-changing Mexican food, I'd look elsewhere.
