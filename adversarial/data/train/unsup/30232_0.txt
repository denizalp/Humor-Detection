Amazing place, all the pasta and sandwiches come with a gluten-free option, and the gluten-free bread is delicious and has great flavor and texture. All healthy ingredients that you can eat and feel good about it. Totally gourmet creations to try on the menu. Even the kids' meals are made from scratch. Excellent atmosphere and patio dining with misters.
