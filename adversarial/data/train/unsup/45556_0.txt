The accommodations are solid- a bit better, but mostly what you'd expect from a Red Roof Inn. King bed was really comfortable. Bathroom's a little small. But my reason for the high rating is based on one experience: in a moment of bad luck, I opened my wallet while in the elevator and a ten dollar bill fell out of my wallet and somehow fell through the crack on the floor of the elevator, down the shaft. I could see down the crack that the floor of the shaft was not far down- it's only three floors. I asked at the front desk whether they might be able to get it- I figured it was a long shot. Instead, the manager opened the drawer and gave me a ten dollar bill, saying that they'd retrieve my bill later. Maybe my expectations were too low, but this struck me as really kind. I can imagine that this level of care for guests extends throughout this hotel. So, if you need an affordable place to stay in the area, I would certainly trust these folks.
