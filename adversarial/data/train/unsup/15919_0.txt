Called to order food for dinner and seems half the kitchen was not functional. Naan wasn't available because tandoor wasn't working, Dosa wasn't an option, and paneer sabji wasn't an option. That should have been my first clue to run for the hills but I ordered anyway. Specifically told the guy that everything should be mild as kids will be eating and he said everything except 1 dish that we ordered would be made mild. We bring the food home and all the \"mild\" food was so spicy it was not edible. The food also was cold from the inside - most likely because it was just defrosted from the freezer. We called the restaurant 4 times to complain just to get hung up on.  Finally got in touch with them and had a full conversation around 845 PM (we ordered dinner at 615) where the guy said he can re-make the food - however dinner was well over and kids were fast asleep. Cold and spicy food and poor customer service! We won't be going there again!
