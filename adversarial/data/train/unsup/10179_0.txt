Wow where was this place when I was a kid!!!\n\nThese guys know how to deal with children! The dentist and all of the staff are super professional and sweet with the kids but most importantly very patient!\n\nMy 7 year old found out she had a cavity and very sensitive teeth... She went from loving the dentist to freaking out that she was going to have a cavity filled. The staff was calm and patient and let me talk to her... We decided to do the cleaning under the laughing gas in conjunction with the cavity filling.\n\nI couldn't believe they were able to get me in same day for the filling and assist us with calming her down. The laughing gas was candy scented which my daughter thought was really cool and she finally started to relax.\n\nThe dentist was amazing and she never even felt the shot or noticed what he was doing. He gave her a token for the little toy machine up front to hold and another one when she was finished. This place is incredibly cool for kids and so much better than the dentist I used to go to!\n\nIf you have children that need to see the dentist and are leary, I  highly recommend this place!
