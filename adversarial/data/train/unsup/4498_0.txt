I had a fine experience at this Budget counter. I booked online at Costco.com, which usually has the best rates, and lets you add a driver for free. We lucked out and didn't have to wait in line when we arrived. The best thing is that you simply have to cross the street to get to the cars. No need to get on a shuttle to an offsite lot. This helps a lot when you're coming back too so you don't have to a lot way more time to return the car.\n\nWe got a newer car, which ran fine for the duration of our trip to State College and back. We ran into a small snag on the way back. We wanted to use a different car to pay. So the guy in the garage instructed us to settle the charge at the counter. It was a bit complicated, and took some time, but the two ladies who helped us were patient and nice.\n\ni have no complaints.
