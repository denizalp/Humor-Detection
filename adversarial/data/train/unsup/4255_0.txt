WORST SERVICE EVER!\nI went there with 4 other friends. 2 of us were there first. We waited for about 10 mins for our other friends. During this time, the waiter never gave us water. After our other friends arrived and ordered, the waiter still did not bother giving us water. I finally decided to ask for water. I had to ask for water 2 times before I got water. On top of that, he just gave us 4 cups instead of 5! We asked for another cup of water twice and he never gave it to us. Also, the waiter was on his iPhone the whole time texting away. The table beside us came later than us and left earlier than us because they were also pissed off at the lousy service.\n\nFood wise, nothing special, the egg pudding for $1 is pretty good. The hazelnut dessert is a bit dry. Do not get the chicken wings, nothing special about it.\n\nHopefully you will get a better server than the one we got if you decide to go. Wifi PW is \"desserts\". They will give it to you if you ask them.
