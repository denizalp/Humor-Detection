I am modifying my previous post for one very simple reason - Cameo charges you whatever they wish and Melissa Simon, the Guest Manager, reserves the right to refuse to tell you how much things cost beforehand so they can rip you off to their heart's content later on. No kidding, a much nicer-sounding iteration of this is actually their stated policy.\n\nI booked my wedding party there for hair and makeup on my wedding day. The price was quoted at around $600 for four women including the bride. When I went in for my trial hairdo I was told it could be literally hundreds more. But nobody would tell me how much more. In fact, by the time I was done emailing with Melissa, as it turns out the BARE MINIMUM of the cost was $600. What I was told, in essence, was that Cameo's prices are based on the whim of the designers. How do they themselves determine the prices of their services? This is a black box, if you're a customer. Frankly, it's probably a black box if you're Melissa Simon, as well. Melissa's most amazing statement: \"If you can get past the issue of cost, I think you could have a good experience with us.\" Are you kidding? One does need to plan out a wedding budget in advance.\n\nCome on, Cameo you doofs.  Why not change your policy to be like EVERY OTHER SALON IN THE WORLD and just charge by the time something takes, the service in question, and the experience level of the stylist? It causes people NOT TO HATE YOU.\n\nIt's a spa, and it's supposed to be relaxing, and there's nothing less relaxing than walking out all ticked off because you just got stuck paying a bill that was much more than you had been led to believe it would be. That goes double on your wedding day. We canceled our wedding block at Cameo and rebooked at a salon willing to give a price range for services, but I look forward to looking at Cameo's website and seeing some positive changes in the future.
