Checked this place out for it's grand opening with some high hopes, but the food was just ok. It's in the neighbourhood and I'll definitely be back, and maybe they'll get some of the kinks out. \n\nThe atmosphere and the service was great. Everyone was very attentive and you can tell they were very eager to please. The decor is nice, and while it still feels like they're missing a few finishing touches, it really was great. \n\nI had the Beef Pho, and while the broth was fantastic, it was odd that we didn't get a lime, sprouts, mint, or herbs (cilantro, mint basic, etc.). The amount of beef for the serving was a little small compared to most soups in the city. My partner had the chicken vermicelli, and again it was just average. \n\nI'll update the review next time!
