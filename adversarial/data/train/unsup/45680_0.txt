I ordered a shrimp dinner through GrubHub for delivery. I placed the order at 4:12 pm. The estimated delivery time was 5:05pm- 5::15 pm. The order arrived at 6:12 pm. It was ONE HOUR late, and the manager refused to refund my money, giving some cockamamie excuses about the delivery driver being held up. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!
