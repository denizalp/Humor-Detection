There are better restaurants in Port Credit.  I've dined here half a dozen times and it's ok at best.  It's tasty but nothing special.  I once found a piece of metal netting in my burger.  The waiter handled the situation appropriately.  Summer time mojito pitchers are pretty good.  Oh and when they advised that our pasta dish was served al dente (which is the way it should be) we didn't realize that meant uncooked and clumped together.
