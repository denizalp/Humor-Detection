For the last 20 minutes, my nose has been running, and my lips have been on fire. Sin City Thai brings the HEAT!  Finally, I found a Thai restaurant that understands how to infuse spice into a dish without compromising the other ingredients.  \n\nThey offer plenty of lunch specials for $6.95, but I was craving spicy chicken with basil for lunch. I ordered Level 3 (out of 5) and instantly knew I was in for a challenge. I like Hot food, but not to the extent where my mouth goes numb and I start crying. The food smelled so spicy and delicious, I couldn't wait to get back to work and eat it. After giving it some thought, I decided to sneak a bite at the first stop light to see how spicy this food really was. Then it hit me--WOW! Not only was this dish hotter than Jennifer Lawrence, it was really good. \n\nThe chicken was cooked perfectly (sliced not ground) and was mixed with white onions, basil, red, and green peppers. However, what I liked most was the fantastic sauce this food was swimming in. I tossed my steamed rice up in there to soak up every last delicious drop. \n\nThe place is casual, and the gentleman who took my order was really nice. My food was ready in 10 minutes which made me nervous. I didn't think you could put a dish together that quickly that packed so many flavors. I really like it here. Next time, I will bring my wife so she can try something else and I could sample it. I know what I am getting! Why mess with perfection?\n\nChallenge accepted Sin City!  I laugh in the face of your level 3. Just kidding-don't hurt me. Level 3 is just fine!
