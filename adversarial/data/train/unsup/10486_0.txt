We own a vacation home in Northern Scottsdale and decided to take a drive through Carefree and Cavecreek. Loving Mexican food we decided to try out El Encanto after reading the reviews here on yelp. I am someone that always goes to wash my hands after we place our order and in doing so I had to pass the kitchen. Big mistake and I really wish I didn't see what I saw. It was a mess!! The odor coming out of there was horrible and everything was so dirty. To even think my food that I'm going to put into my body was coming from that kitchen made me nauseous. So word of advice be seated and don't move. I'm giving it three stars because we did survive but we will not be back
