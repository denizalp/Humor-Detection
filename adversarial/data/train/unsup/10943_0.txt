Been here probably 4-5 times. The food Is cheap, standard dim sum, but nothing to write home about.  The owner really nice especially this one time when I got ayce dim sim. He made sure everything I check off on the menu  came even when I said please no more food.....I didn't want to waste it,  but it just kept coming, towers of dim sum.\n \nHowever last week when I was there it was different story one of the waitress there was pretty rude. It literally look like she was throwing the cutlery at us when she was setting up the table, it was unbelievable. I get it, you hate your job but  please don't brake the dishes and please don't stick your thumbs into our cups......I hope the owner sees this review and does something about his staff and hope the  waitress doesn't poisons me because she recognizes my profile pic.
