It is probably the dumbest thing in the world to rate a fast food restaurant but I just had to leave a comment about my experience just now. I ordered a No. 6, a JR Cheeseburger Deluxe and 6 piece nugget. I asked the kid in the window if I can wait for fresh fries and nuggets. He said it will be about 5 minutes. So, I waited. Food comes out like 7 min later and I see that I have only 4 nuggets. So, I go in and tell them. The man who saw me WAVING could not even come to counter... he was just like (mumbling) \"what\" -- basically. So I explain. He walks away and tells other people I need more nuggets (instead of just walking his lazy ass two steps and putting extras in my container I brought in. He tells some kid to do it. The kid is like... scared of something. Finally picks up on what I need and adds extra nuggets. I walk out. Well, the nuggets are old as FU*CK and I got a HALF a container of OLD, DRY FU*CKING fries. I'm pretty sure every single one of those lazy morons would have been annoyed if they spent their $12 on some old sh*t when they specifically (kindly) asked if it's okay to wait for a new batch. \n\nNot to be a jerk but every person in there was black and I guess they just didn't give two fu*cks to help a white chick out. \n\nMerry Christmas and I hope that every one of you, for the rest of your lives, always get overcooked, or underdone, dry, old food where ever you go.
