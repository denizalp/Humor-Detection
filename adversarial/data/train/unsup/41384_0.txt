We ordered the chicken sandwich and fries from Uber eats. It arrived quickly and was delicious. Fries stayed surprisingly crispy even though they were in a closed container. And really good hand cut fries, not too much salt. Sandwich was perfectly tender and moist, really tasty slaw and mayo. Only wish it was cheaper, but the quality is great.
