Best. Buffet. Ever.\n\nA few years ago my friends uncle took us for dinner and I was blown away. I generally loathe buffets and find that the quality of food is not worth the price you're paying; nor do I like feeling like I must gorge myself to justify the money I'm spending or so that I don't feel like a wuss for not taking advantage of \"All You Can Eat\".  But the Wynn buffet was fantastic. Crab legs. Amazing soup. Fresh ceviche. \n\nWhen I went back with my girls this past week I insisted we go. We arrived too late for breakfast, but the lunch buffet had an omelette station so there was at least a little breakfast element. The salads in the cups were adorable. The flank steak was juicy and flavorful and tender without being cooked to death (how they did this I have no idea, especially as it was at a hot station). The desserts were plentiful, adorable, and pretty tasty for buffet desserts (the strawberry shortcake is pretty damned good, as is the raspberry champagne parfait). \n\nEverything I've ever had has been delicious- put aside your buffet fears, there WILL be something to please you. **\n\n** Do not put on a bikini afterwards. We learned this the hard way.
