I've heard about the Hero Factory for years but never had the chance to try their sandwiches until today. While waiting in the 4 hour line to redeem our Jimmy Fallon tickets, our friends were kind enough to give my pregnant self a break and let me grab a sandwich while they held our spot in line. The Hero Factory truly lived up to their name because their sandwiches were incredible and they were the closely spot open to the Orpheum. I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap and my husband had the Eddie Machete. Both sandwiches were amazing but I especially loved my husband's which had chicken, bacon, cheese and this amazing chipotle mayo. I wish I lived closer to the Hero Factory so I could enjoy their sandwiches more. The guys working there were super nice and friendly. If you're in Downtown Phoenix, stop by for a sandwich and you won't be disappointed!!
