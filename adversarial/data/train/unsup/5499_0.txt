I'm not going to waste time comparing this place to In-n-Out. They are completely different. period. I prefer a bigger meatier burger with mushrooms and bacon but everyone has their own personal preferences. \n\nThe fries both here and at In-n-out dont' compare to the industrially-engineered unnatural (yet perfect) fries at Mcdonald's, but they are both natural fries and that's the way it is. They aren't great, the fries at in-n-out aren't great. I dont really eat many french fries so I don't care. \n\nMy burger was perfection (I actually LOVE canned mushrooms so I'm so pumped they give me these included in the price), and the bacon and cheese and meat was all delicious. As an added plus, they have 100% beef Hebrew National hotdogs. You can get cheese melted on them too, or cheese and bacon. I split a yummy cheesy hot dog with my husband in lieu of fries ! \n\nSo I'm taking a star off because I used their online ordering system so I could skip the lines. I pulled up to the extremely crowded, busy restaurant (they had 17 people working in the kitchen so they definitely weren't understaffed!), and told the order guy \"I'm Blair, I have a web order, do you know how I pick that up\". He gave me a clueless look then asked the manager. She fiddled around a bit and then said \"uh yeah, it's being made\". Ok, fair enough. The problem is even though i told him my name and that I ordered online, they only call the orders out by number. After he called \"43\" a whopping 5x, I asked him \"any chance that's for me\". He shrugged and handed me the bag- sure enough it said \"WEB ORDER - BLAIR\" in huge letters on top. Hey clown, when I tell you \"I'm blair, waiting for a web order\" maybe don't call it out by  number??!?!? How are web orders supposed to know we are order \"43\"??? Call web orders out by name, idiot!\n\nAnyways, despite my little web pick up mishap, the food was delicious and wonderful and I will be returning many times. I'm hoping because I went on their 2nd day of business they will iron out the issues (like internet orders) and when I return this week they will be better.
