Awesome kid friendly place!! Loved that every exhibit is hands on, perfect for littles who love to touch everything!!! The planetarium was AMAZING!!! Even my 5 month old was mesmerized by it  \n\nWe went on a Saturday which I'm assuming is busier than if you were to go during the week. I do wish they had staff in every exhibit to do some kid control for the parents who haven't taught their children proper public etiquette. The items in their gift shop were pretty lame especially their official science center souvenir selection...not a big deal but  it would have been great if they carried official science center Christmas tree ornaments...hint hint \n\nOverall it was a great place and my kids really enjoyed it! Definitely plan on coming back next time we are in Arizona!!
