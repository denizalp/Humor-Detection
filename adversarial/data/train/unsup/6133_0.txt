I stopped in for breakfast last Saturday, but I didn't know that it wasn't open to the public. It was what is known as a \"play date\" (practice for invited guests). When I got to the door, there was people milling about the entrance and I didn't see the signs that read, \"closed, invited guests only\". Well, I walked in and there was a bunch of staff members in black tee shirts having breakfast and others in the dining room. I selected the breakfast I wanted and ordered at the counter. When I tried to pay, the girl said \"we are not  taking money, today is a practice day\". I was like \"ooops\" I didn't know.\nThe cool thing was they let me have breakfast at no charge, so happy day for me.\nMy breakfast was served in just a few minutes and it was very good. The best part was the pancakes, which were very light and airy. They reminded me of the now defunct Country Kitchen restaurants that served the best pancakes in town. The \"Corner Cafe\" version is exactly the same, pancakes cooked at low heat so that when the syrup is poured on it absorbs into it and not like other places where they have a tough outer crust which makes for a poor breakfast experience. The scrambled eggs and bacon was good too. Excellent service, although the paper sleeve that held the silverware was missing my fork and just had a knife in it. \nThen menu is extensive and there are many choices for lunch and dinner. \nWell even though I was a party crasher and ate for free that day, I will be back for sure because the food and service was great.\nI don't know what is going on at Stephanie street in Henderson, but it is turning into restaurant and junk food rowe of the southeast!\nRestaurant will see some competition here, but \"Corner Bakery Cafe\" should have no trouble from what I've experienced.
