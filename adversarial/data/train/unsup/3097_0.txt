Oh the aesthetics here are so clean! The lighting is so perfect! Service was kind! But the marble boba milk *latte* was just meh. \n\nI got the iced marble boba milk *LATTE* with soy milk. Their milk alternatives can be used for any of the lattes. The reason why I continually emphasize LATTE is because lattes mean that it's a coffee (or sometimes a tea latte). However, their latte is just the milk with brown sugar and tapioca. It was disappointing and I wish they would either indicate explicitly that their lattes don't include coffee or tea or they would choose a different name like Marble Boba Milk. Otherwise, Yang has a lot of potential given its location and minimalistic interior design which will definitely attract Instagrammers and other food bloggers. I will consider returning to try their iced teas!
