Full disclosure: I was here for a conference, so part of my bill was picked up. \n\nThis is a nightclub disguised as a hotel. Having stayed at several W Hotels over the years, I expect this. What's different about this one is the location. The hotel is situated in the middle of a 22-28 year old tank-topped douchebro's fantasy world...clubs and bars in all directions, with the associated Uber traffic. The W's club scene is expected, but the \"thump...thump...thump\" of the surrounding clubs from 8pm-2am was unexpected. We stayed in the WOW Suite on the top floor, but couldn't escape the sound despite the elevation and (provided) earplugs. \n\nIt's hard to complain about a massive suite....and I mean massive. That being said, this particular suite had been \"rode hard and put up wet.\" Scratched\/beaten surfaces abound. Strangely, all of the electronics and lighting had been unplugged prior to our arrival, so a modest amount of time was spent just looking for plugs. Speaking of electrical outlets, there are very few. Want to charge your phone? Leave it in the kitchen area, as the plugs in the bedroom are covered. Amenities were quite nice, and linens were soft and fresh. \n\nService was great, as you would expect from W\/Starwood. Drinks were quite pricey, as you would also expect. \n\nBottom line: very loud, even for a W. Unlikely to return.
