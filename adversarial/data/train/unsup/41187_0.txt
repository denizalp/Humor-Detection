Stopped in on a snowy Saturday to grabs some drinks with friends to celebrate a friend's birthday. Since it was during the holiday season, Crocker Park was PACKED. And so was 87 West 2. I'd never been there before, and it's pretty small on the inside so we had to steal some chairs and tables (think living room furniture) to have enough seats. \n\nThe wine list was solid and they had a decent selection of beer, too. They have a small food menu that we ordered off off. They were able to veganize the bruchetta for me and I had some olives, but otherwise, there weren't many options for me. Others in my party had flatbreads and said they were good. Service was really spotty, though. We were hungry and thirsty the whole time. Our waitress was within sight rolling silverware, but she didn't check on us as often as she should have. (we definitely would have spent a lot more and ordered a lot more if she had)\n\nI think this is a great place to go for a date night or to grab a drink with a friend, but if you're part of a large party? I'd go elsewhere. They're just not set up to handle a large group.
