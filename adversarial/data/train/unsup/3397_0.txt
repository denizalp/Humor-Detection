It's been years since I've written a review...YEARS !\n\nsadly, this one is short and not sweet.  Heck, it revolves around one issue - TERRIBLE SERVICE !!!\n\nFrom being told it would take 25-35 minutes to be seated ( party of 6, Sunday brunch around 11:30 ) yet it took 75 minutes.  Oh yeah, while patiently waiting a 10-12 year old boy being dragged into the restaurant by (grand) mother to use the restroom ( my sense, not a customer ) and as them boy passes us a throws up on the ground just behind my wife's feet ( a smidge hitting her pants )\n\nSo finally seated, drink and appetizer orders promptly taken, after all, we memorized the menu while waiting.  To keep the poor service going, one drink forgotten after 3 requests for it, another prepared incorrectly.  Two orders of the biscuit app never made it to our table even though it was mentioned several times with our server.\n\nThe main entrees.  Well, they got the orders right but served an hour after ordering them, we hit our limit.\n\nThe wife and I ate here the first week they opened.  Several service kinks back then;  the problems persist so we've crossed this place off our Sunday brunch go-to list
