I love Melt. Every time I am near one it's not up for negotiation, that's where we go. I just went with a friend to a concert in Cleveland so we had to stop.\nWe pulled in around 2:00 on a Saturday and they were busy but out of control, we waited about 10 minutes or so for a table. \nSince we were going to a concert and not to hibernate I went with the simple Kindergarten sandwich with sharp cheddar and a cup of tomato soup. \nThe food is just so comforting and delicious. Service is always on point and food is always amazing.
