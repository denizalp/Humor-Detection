Bizarre story. Waiting in line to check out today. It was 1\/2 price Saturday-so it was packed. The lady in front  of me was upset because the cashier told her an item was double the price marked. The cashier was implying a price sticker  switch. I was sympathetic to the cashier because if you have ever worked customer service, you've been there. \n\nThen It was my turn to check out. I was told that the stool I was buying was more than twice the sticker price. The reason I was given was that the stool spins. WTH? She is just making up prices as she stands there! At least I wasn't accused of sticker swapping. \n\nBased on the items stacked around that particular cashier, I wasn't the only one that decided they could just keep it.
