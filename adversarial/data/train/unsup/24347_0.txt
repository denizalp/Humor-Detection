If you haven't eaten here before, and you love Thai food, I highly recommend!\nIts on West Sahara past Valley View on the south side of the street in a little strip mall.\n\nThe restaurant is clean and has nice sound effects with the water fountains at the entrance. The server \"Sam\"  has been my waiter the last two times I have been, and hes super nice and attentive.\n\nI ordered the shrimp curry(super hot) both times. Its so delicious, I dream of the flavor! The 8-10 shrimp are a very generous size and super juicy. And yes, its only 10.95 and comes with a huge side of white rice(no need to order extra rice, its plenty for two people).\n\nWhat a great little place for lunch or dinner.\n\n*Boo.. no delivery though!\n\nI will be back, you got that right!
