I am not at all impressed with the service at this dealership. The service quality has gone down immensely in the past 10 years. Years ago, I purchased a vehicle from this location, however based upon my previous experience and today's experience, I would not give this dealership my business again. It's outrageously disappointing to be ignored when you walk into a showroom floor and look at a vehicle and it takes over five minutes to be greeted by a sales rep. \n\nI went to the service department as I was directed for a replacement part on my present Mercedes and when I walked in, I wasn't sure if I was at a Denny's take out buffet or at the Mercedes service counter. One of the sales reps with stuffing his face at his computer in my presence as a customer inquiring about pricing and the other customer service representative had his meal in a Wal-Mart bag in front of his computer on deck.\n\nI was offended when asking about my replacement part, the sales rep in training asked the other representative (who was stuffing his face) if they even carry the part for this old vehicle. When I asked for pricing on 3 additional parts for my vehicle, the representative took license plate covers that he was putting price tags on and started stocking the shelves during our conversation as if he was over it. Incredible!
