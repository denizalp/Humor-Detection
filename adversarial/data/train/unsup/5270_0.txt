Yeah, these people crack me up with their discrimination against poor people, like poor=criminal. Shame on you! The neighborhood is surrounded by older and newer homes that were going for half a million bucks up until  2008 so anyone living in the neighborhood could either afford half a million bucks or has been living there for 30 years when housing prices were cheaper. Very few apartment complexes around!\n\nAnyway- the produce department is the best in Vegas....Good prices...selection on other items is hit and miss. They do have some very nice Romano cheese there that I can't find anywhere else, so there you have it.\n\nIf you don't mind having to be exposed to some people who may or may not be on............YUCK................FOODSTAMPS!.....then this is a great grocery store.\n\nThe rest of you can go to hell............which is where you'll be!
