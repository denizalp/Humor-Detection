Place is a little expensive compared to the refined\"dollar menu\" palate I usually have, but their seafood is great, the free biscuits are great, and the servers are professional and nice.\n\nLast visit was Father's Day 2015 for me and despite it being very busy, our server was checking in every few minutes to make sure we didn't need anything, the food was brought quickly, and the manager stopped by just to make sure we having a pleasant experience.
