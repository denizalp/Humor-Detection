If you live in the area the food is OK. Nothing fresh or special, it's part of the late night limited options category. \n\nThe only people who seem to love this place are people raised in etobicoke, I moved here a couple years ago, and everyone I know admits it's an nostalgia thing if they like it. As a girl who has lived and traveled all over Toronto and always had family all over Toronto and the GTA, I consider myself unbiased lol. This is one of the worser of the burger nostalgia places, of the various borough burger places that people hold dear.
