I've been here before and it was a delicious experience. And it was because two girls from YouTube sent me. We got some wild sodas, but we didn't get candy,gag gifts, a bottle opener, or anything else.\n\nWith a wide variety of different sodas,candy,and gag gifts,you can turn yourself into a total weirdo but it is fun. \n\nSoda - From Lester's to Gross Gus's, soda can either be completely crazy or plainly ridiculous. They also have their own factory made sodas.\n\nCandy - By the pound,in a box, or in just large packaging, the candy would be great to have. They even have Jelly Belly Bean Boozled Jelly Beans in a box as large as a board game!\n\nGag Gifts - From fake vomit to joy buzzers, gag gifts at Rocket Fizz are immature, but hilarious.\n\nThere you have it. What I love about Rocket Fizz.
