I really loved this theatre! First of all, the lineup of shows they have scheduled every season offers something for everyone.  Second, the location in DT Gilbert is fantastic and allows for great options for a before or after show dinner.  And finally, I love that this theatre is in the round (or in a square).  There isn't a bad seat in the house.  If you enjoy live theatre, this is a must- visit venue!
