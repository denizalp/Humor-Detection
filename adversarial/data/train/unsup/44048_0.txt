This store should be your first stop for gifts of all kinds.  I stopped in because a friend was raving about it on Instagram.  I started following them and loved everything they posted so I knew I had to pay them a visit.  They carry Burn candles that are handmade in PHX.  I already had one of their candles at home that I had bought at the Gilbert Farmer's Market so I knew I loved them.  I ended up buying a larger candle in a different scent.  I also bought a beautiful necklace from Adam Rabbit.  Each designer\/artisan takes turns working in the store, so it's a true team effort to run it.  Support an amazing local store that carries fantastic items that you will love!
