Soo disappointed. Got my food for lunch, I work near by.I never call and complain, but I had to.the food was old,you can clearly taste it. They had just opened at 10am, so why would there food taste old, as if it were from last night .I couldn't even finish it.\nThey wouldn't give my money back , and they seemed non interested in the fact that a customer was not happy.\n\nPlease talk to your crew, I'm sure if they came to my place of business and the same happen to them, they would feel how I felt MAJORLY DISAPPOINT! \n\nI didn't even get a darn apology smh.
