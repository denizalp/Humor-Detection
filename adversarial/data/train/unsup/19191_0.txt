EPIC FAILURE!! Everybody was hyping this place up and it disappointed me.  There was 20 strippers in there and all of them were ugly. Uglier than the 1986 Boston Celtics starting 5, Bird,  McHale,   Dennis Johnson and Robert Parrish. The girls scared the crap out of me!! Come on man,  this is Las Vegas! These are the girls you send out? Most of the girls are ugly black women and all they play is rap.  I like rap,  but not every God Dam song.
