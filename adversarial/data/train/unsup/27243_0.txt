Had a  reservation at this place. Has a good atmosphere, good furniture, good people and great service. We ordered two main courses which are absolutely fantastic, drinks are well kept up... especially when I asked them to make the vesper martini from the James Bond Movie and it was all good everything lol. Biggest thing was they looked at my special request here on yelp when I made a reservation and came through with it! 5 Stars ALL THE WAY :)
