I don't know why we keep coming here. \n\nThey are almost always out of something we order. Pot pies are pretty much a myth around here. \n\nTonight the drive thru was closed with a sign asking folks to come in to order. There are 5 separate parties in here now all waiting for food. Yikes. Going to be a while. \n\nI feel bad for the employees - it seems like they are trying hard to keep this place afloat. I won't blame them. \n\nThe parking lot is a disaster. Pot holes everywhere! Bummer to see it sinking so badly.
