While out exploring I saw this coffee shop from afar so decided to check it out. Unfortunately I got here just as they were closing so I was not able to sample any of their cuisine this visit. Too bad since it is lunch time. This Cafe is brand new. It is so new that it still has new car smell, but it is open. The individual that I talked too was very cordial and was leaving from closing the store from a long day.\n\nI did see in the business window that they are on Yelp, but did not see this business as of yet on Yelp. I added this business so everyone in the Yelp universe may come out and try something new then Yelp about it. \n\nThe space that the cafe occupies is fairly large with booth style tables for eating at. The tele in the corner of the store is a nice touch that I believe that more smaller cafes need. This way when the Golden Knights are playing we can watch the game or highlights about the game. \n\nLooking forward to trying there food here there is a flyer on google that states if you print it out a customer can come in and get a free cup of joe until 6 of July 2018. \n\nThe type of food that they do sell is sandwiches and chips. Or pastries with coffee. Seems like the perfect little spot to pop in and pop out for real cooked food. They support the Golden Knights as well as offer military discounts. Have to support local businesses that support our fabulous troops.
