Every time I go, I get good service and pricing.  I think they are the most flexible and friendly car wash around.  It seems they have the best pricing on interior shampoo's around.  I had a friend who spilled milk on his back seats, they charged $15 to shampoo his seats and it was solved.  I like their location to, there are a ton of shops and eating places nearby so you can do something while you wait.
