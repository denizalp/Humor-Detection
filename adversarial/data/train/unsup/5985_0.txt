I can only call it for Friday nights w\/Soul Power, but It's definitely one of the most entertaining live music venues in Phoenix Period! The place has a good vibration about it...hard to describe unless you've actually been inside this crawl space..lol \n\nLiterally it's small and not much space to move around, but the spot is live, has great drinks and service. Come for the good time and leave the snobbery at the doe!\n\n5 STARS
