This was the first place we came to eat during our weekend getaway in Vegas just this weekend! I have came here before and I just fell in love with it! I had their carne asada fries, the large size, and immediately began scarfing them down! I didn't share with my girlfriend or our friend because I am just hooked on these fries! The staff there is pretty cool AND there was no line when we arrived around 10:00am. DO NOT come on Sunday morning du to the large line that will be there when you arrive. Small place but very nice there. This is the place to hit up for a late night taco or burrito run or anytime of the day. People, come to this place. You will not be disappointed. If you are, Ill personally buy you a couple tacos to change your mind!!!!!!
