RATING IS BASED ON: comparing this fast food coffee joint to others in it's class, customer service and the fact that it's also an internet cafe.\n\nMuch better choice than Tim Horton's down the street: no flies in the food displays and no men openly checking you out. Came by after shopping at Value Village. \n\nThis is NOT your typical coffee house. They serve ethnic food items like Jamaican Patties, Samosas and Indian desserts. They also have computers and printers that you can use for a fee. There are many tables that are spaced out so you have lots of elbow room: each seats 2-3 comfortable and 4 cramped.\n\nThe owners are very friendly. We ordered 4 combos and 2 large bowls of chili to go; the chili was actually pretty decent. The male owner didn't charge us extra to switch out the donut for a croissant and even gave us a free pop since we had a \"big\" order (his words). I was very impressed that he checked on us during our meal; his wife even brought our take out orders to our table. I was pleasantly surprised that he was kind enough to called a taxi for one of his customers: now that's first rate service for yah!
