A strip mall in Ahwatukee is home to the Arizonian best cheese shop I've ever been to.\n\n- Rennet types are listed & very much appreciated.\n- Sammiches are all varieties of cheesy and bready, but consistently quality. \n- The selection of cheese truffles will make you forget you're in a strip mall in Ahwatukee. \n\nIt's pricey, but it's worth it. Sit outside, get some cheesy morsels, and revel in it. \n\nCan't get enough? Also bring a metric sh*t ton of goodies home with you, then say to your significant other, \"We don't need no money, baby, we got everything we need right here.\" *smile and point to massive assortment of cheeses that just cost you the remnants of your joint bank account*
