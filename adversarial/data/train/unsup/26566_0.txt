I was an avid SoHo sushi customer until I went Vegan 6+ months ago. I've missed SoHo burritos too and was excited to see they had a Vegan Lover's Bowl\/Burrito.  I didn't realize they always had Veggie\/Vegan options! The Vegan Asada with Unagi sauce is delicious and now I'm hooked! They use Gardein so you can't go wrong. I love all Gardein products. Rose made my bowl and it was absolutely bomb!! Chef John knows how to create the perfect combination of flavors, super tasty. Thank you for making my first Vegan Bowl so yummy, ROSE. I'll be back!!
