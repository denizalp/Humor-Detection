So...........we were excited about staying at the Wynn Casino and wanted to grab a decent meal before hitting the tables.  My friend have told me that they had the best Italian food in this restaurant.  We ordered some drinks and they brought over some bread.\n\nBread was stale.  It came with a house made pesto.  I like dipping the bread in marinara so we ordered the appetizer meatballs.  The sauce was great and the temperature was perfect but the meatballs was only warm.  Very disappointing.  Plus the bread was bad.\n\nThe Lasagna was good but the middle of the lasagna was lukewarm  The sauce was hotter than the lasagna.   I think if they would have used the same sauce on the meatball as they did for the Pasta with lobster and shrimp, it would have tasted better. They have two different types of marinara sauce?  The pasta was hard in a not so al dente way.  Meaning the spaghetti with lobster and shrimp for 44 dollars was probably left under a food heating lamp a little too long and the lobster and shrimp were a little rubbery.\n.\nThe whole meal lasted 1:45 minutes.  We sat near the bar and not in the main dining area so that we can watch the lakers game.  I have heard that this was a great restaurant.  The service was the only thing that gave them the extra star.\n\nFor the price that you pay here............the food should be a lot better.
