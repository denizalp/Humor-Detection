This used to be my local Wendy's back in the day and I used to frequent it a bit too regularly for the Spicy Chicken Sandwich.\n\nI don't really recommend fast-food or chains but I have fond memories at this particular one.\n\nGotta luv using french fries as a fork for your frostee and seeing it partially melt around the fry.
