We went to Old Homestead on Jan 29, and I was so looking forward to it, especially given the reputation of its renowned NYC parent.  Geez, was I disappointed. The service was great, but the food absolutely sucked. The cook(s), for whatever reason, either wouldn't or couldn't properly cook mine or my wife's filets ... medium-well ... which isn't that hard to do. They tried three times and never got the steaks beyond medium rare, but they burned the outside of the steaks to hell. Needless to say, the steaks were completely ruined at that point. And when the concierge came to our table, he only asked if our food was okay. When we said it wasn't, his reply was, \"Yeah, I saw you send it back.\"\n\nWhen our server came to our table a couple of minutes later and asked if the manager had come over, we said no, but that the concierge had. The server then informed us that it wasn't the concierge at all, but rather the manager (he never introduced himself as the manager). Of course, he never came back over to the table or attempted to rectify the problem in any way whatsoever. He didn't even bother to offer an apology on behalf of the restaurant. However, he had absolutely no problem charging us $192.42 for an absolutely crappy meal.\n\nThis place sucks and I'll never go back, nor will I recommend it to anyone ... except to recommend they not go. The Old Homestead in Caesars replaces another steakhouse that was called Neros. While Neros was nothing to write home about, it was lightyears better than The Old Homestead. As such, avoid this dump at all costs.
