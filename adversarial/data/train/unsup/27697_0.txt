Went here for our anniversary early on a cold New Years Eve.  Service was very pleasant.  Waitress talked me into a seared tuna that was just outstanding.  Throw in beautiful view of the Wisconsin State capitol just across the street and a very reasonable price, and I have to keep Blue Marlin on my short list.
