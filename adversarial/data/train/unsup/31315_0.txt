If I could give zero stars I would. We placed a phone order and accidentally called the other location. When my husband went to pick it up the guy refused to make food for him. He said \"You called the other location so pick it up there.\" When my husband asked if he could just place a new order, the guy told him no! They refused to make us food! The other location was way downtown, not just a few blocks away, and it's a simple mistake. We have never experienced this kind of rudeness at a restaurant before. We will never go back!
