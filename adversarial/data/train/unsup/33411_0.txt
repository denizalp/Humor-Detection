Delicious food!!!  This concept is amazing!!  Everything is good...short rib and green chili chicken is my favorite!!  Then there is the jack potatoes...yes potatoes which are amazing!!!  The corn bread is yummy but has a good kick!  The chips are super crunchy, I could eat the whole bag!  Then finish the meal off with a pumpkin cookie....omg good!!!  \n\nWish there was a location in the west valley, but it's well worth the drive!!!  Can't wait to go again
