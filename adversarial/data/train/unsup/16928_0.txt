After reading all the great reviews for this restaurant we decided to come and dine here.\nIt was a Sunday afternoon and we were hungry. The place was empty, as we walked in we were greeted by a friendly waitress and a manager\/Cook.\nThey asked us where we found them, we said Yelp.\nLet's talk about the food experience we ordered:\n\nWater, it tasted really bad, not sure if it was the water or the ice. (They should check that)\nTabouli salad, it looked great but it was dry had too much cucumber and mint.(they don't have cucumber on their menu description)\nShish kebob was dry and not fresh, one of the sweet spices in it didn't make it any better.\nThe french fries were soggy and greasy.\nThe whole wheat pita was really good.\nThe gave us baklava for free, it tasted good.\n\nWe love Mediterranean\/Middle Eastern\/Israeli\nfood, for over 30 years we have been eating it at friends homes and restaurant's, in Los Angeles, NY, and any where else we can find it, this establishment didn't do it for us.
