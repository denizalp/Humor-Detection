My friend and I stopped in here to make a simple purchase of some Rit Fabric Dye for tie dyeing T-shirts.  First of all, there's no one on the floor anywhere to be found to ask where things are located. So we looked in all the obvious places like where the T-shirts are or by the fabric dye. Well, we finally gave up and walked over to the department where you purchase fabric because there was a human behind the desk. She didn't even look up at us as my friend told her what we were searching for. She told us to try looking where the T-shirts are!  We finally went to one of the two women cashiers and asked her where we'd find Rit Dye. She said back by the T-shirts and yarn, nooo...not again! So we schlepped back to the freakin T-shirts for the now fourth time and looked everywhere. No dye to be found, don't know if they're sold out or what but we were so frustrated we just walked out and went to Michaels instead which was equally frustrating. Think I'll just order on Amazon next time!
