I was lucky enough to win tickets to the Strong Beer Festival and I was pretty stoked to check out it!\n\nParking was pretty easy; it was free parking at a garage just up the street.\n\nWalked into the park, gave up our entrance ticket and got a green band place on the arm, and was directed to the other booth across the way to pick up our 2oz cup & 16 tickets to try out some amazing beers!\n\nThere where breweries from all over Arizona and Colorado, and even though there was a lot of people, there really wasn't a long wait in line to try a beer.  I 1st headed on over to Santan Brewery, tried out the Sex Panther (didn't really need to try it, I knew I already liked it) Chip from Santan let me know my fav SunSpot wasn't on hand, but that was alright with me cuz I love me some Sex Panther too. Also ran into some friends by the Santan booth as well, fun to be had!\n\n It was great trying out the many crafted beers. Some of them I tried just by liking the name of the Brewery, like Wanderlust, I'm a suffer of wanderlust, so it made sense to check them out, now I'm thinking I should do a road trip to Flagstaff and really check them out. I also stopped by one booth, it was one of the Tucson Breweries, I wish I remembered the name of it, but they were handing out tastings of their Coffee Beer, OMG that stuff was amazing!! I have to find out who they are!  Also check out Oskar Blues (in fact the pic I took of my cup has Dale's Pale Ale) \n\nNow who would have known that Feb 15th that it would be 90 degrees outside but it was, for this fact I did not stay as long as everyone, their wasn't that much shade, other than the tables & vip lounge area, and outside of the  hurricane fans, not much of a breeze was going on. So I didn't stay as long as I would have liked to. I still had some tickets when I left so I handed them off to a lucky couple for them to enjoy!  \n\nOther than the heat, I had a great time; I will come back next year!
