For a place open late and those who don't mind Mexican food at any hour I can't think of another place to go eat at 3AM. They have a good selection and prices are decent. I had their tacos de al pastor which is my go to meal when I'm trying out a new taqueria and they were good. Definitely worth checking out especially after drinking all night... really hits the spot.
