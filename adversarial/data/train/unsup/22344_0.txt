At first, I was reluctant to review because I wanted to keep the place to myself. Fat chance.  Get there early (or go late) for lunch because they get line-ups now. As they should.\n\nThe food they give you for $6.50 can feed an army. And it's good!\n\nSalads with heaping piles of vegetables. You can add on gyro or chicken or steak (that takes longer). The salad is so big, I sometimes go half-zies with a co-worker or save some for the next day's lunch.\n\nGood falafel too.\n\nNot much seating. More of a take-out place, but you can sit if you need to.
