As good as it gets!!!! Amelia and Rob are the absolute best! I contacted their company to do my hair and makeup for the Marine Ball in Vegas. At first I thought their prices were a little high, but after calling around I appreciated that they come to your hotel room, gave us a Military discount and their quality of work would be better than going to a mall shop. I am so glad I went ahead and booked with them. My hair and make-up was perfect, especially because I didn't give Amelia much to go on. She worked with the little detail I gave her and made me look amazing! She was on time, very professional, super nice, accommodating and great company! Thank you so much for making me look like a princess for the ball. I will definitely be contacting her for any future fancy events I might have!
