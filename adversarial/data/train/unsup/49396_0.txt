Had dinner recently here and the food did not disappoint. Various members of our group had seafood pasta, eggplant parmigiana, and, of course pizza, and everyone enjoyed their meals. I absolutely love their pizza, just the right thickness (actually, thin-ness), crispy, with freshly made sauce and chunks of tomato. I had the prosciutto with pine nuts, and even polished off some of the margherita that my kids didn't finish .... it's that good. Decent selection of wine too.
