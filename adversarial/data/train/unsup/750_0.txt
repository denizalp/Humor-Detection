Great experience! I came here for the first time for their one year anniversary by recommendation from one of the bartenders at LGO. Arcadia is killing these days with new eats. I love the location and the views of Camelback Mtn from inside the restaurant. I'm not the biggest expert on eating seafood and the bartenders were great in giving me the lowdown  on how it all works. They had some great specials for their one year. I started off with one of their signature drinks - \"your money or your life\" (one of my favs over at LGO). Then my buddy and I split some oysters that were half off for the day. The oysters came with some choice toppings and went down smooth. Stone crab was in season and I snagged a claw for my first time. Despite being in the desert, these guys pride themselves on serving the freshest seafood that is flown in daily. We ended our day with a couple more drinks and the halibut ceviche that was nice and light and delicious. The manger checked on us and a couple servers greeted us as well. The customer service was definitely on display for their anniversary. They are building an outdoor patio bar that should create a fun outdoor dining experience. I have nothing but good things to say about this place and I'm still savoring that salted chocolate chip cookie they handed me as a walked out the door. Keep up the good work!
