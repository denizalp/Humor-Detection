I just moved to Phoenix recently and I'm searching for a great massage spa. This is the first one I tried out. I got the regular Thai massage which is on a chair, just like in foot reflexology spas. The massage was basically that, but I've had better. I'd assume there would be something different to it being Thai but no. All in all the massage was okay. BUT WHO THE HELL MASSAGES THE SPINE WITH STRONG PRESSURE!
