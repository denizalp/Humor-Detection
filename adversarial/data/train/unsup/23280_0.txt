I love this spot, I wish I worked closer to this place because everyone would find me here eating lunch everyday. \n\nThe venue is nice, staff are dressed up with long aprons, the way they set it up, you don't feel like your crammed in a can, you can breathe. \n\nCame here for lunch, we shared the salad and each got our own pasta dish. \n\nLunch: \nFall Caprese Salad ($15) Sweet and Sour Beets, Torn Bufala Mozzarella, Vincotto and Olive Oil.\nSpaghetti Pomodoro ($24) Tomato Sauce, Basil with Turkey Meatballs. \nRigatoni Arrabiata ($17.50) Spicy Pomodoro Sauce, Italian Herbs and Pepperoncini. \n\nAll pasta dishes are served with freshly grated parmigiano reggiano and both were super yummy! \n\nLove this place, it's the best! :)
