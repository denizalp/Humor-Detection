My husband needed the oil changed on his F150 truck so we stopped in and he was told it would be $45.99 and take 30 minutes. We usually go to Walmart but the wait was three hours so we figured we would pay a little more for the convenience. After 40 minutes they charged him $79.99. They argued with him and he was stuck paying the bill. Be sure to get your quote in writing they are truly scam artists! I will be reporting this location to the better business bureau and any other entity that will listen. You shouldn't be able to rip people off!!
