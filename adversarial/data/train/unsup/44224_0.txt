Not as big as Lee Lee's which is good and bad.  For a first time visitor it was much easier to find what I was looking for here at Ranch than I remember it was during my first visit to Lee Lee's.  That being said, Ranch does not have the selection that Lee Lee's does.  Lee Lee's is much closer to me, so I prob. won' t be going here too much.
