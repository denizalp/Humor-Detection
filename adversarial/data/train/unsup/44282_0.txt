Not at all what it use to be! My husband and I stopped in for appetizers and dessert no drinks and spent nearly $50.The food was mediocre and the service was poor!My husband and I decided to enjoy the cheesecake at home.Our server was unattentive until near the end of our meal. Deffinetley not a value.
