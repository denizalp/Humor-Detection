Very good tart frozen yogurt. I like the pomegranate flavor. Toppings are numerous and fresh. A bonus for this place is they will add extra yogurt on top of your toppings. While the prices may seem high, you get a generous amount of yogurt for the price! The employees are nice and seem happy.\n\nUnfortunately I don't live close by, but I do try to hit up this place when in the area. Even with Yogel's up the street and a new Yogurtland coming soon, I will probably stick with patronizing this place.
