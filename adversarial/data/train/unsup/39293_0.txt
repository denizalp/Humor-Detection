The food really is all that it's hyped up to be. Glad I read some reviews before going in because the ordering process is indeed a little confusing at first. Like everyone else explains, you simply get in the line of the type of food you want. But when it gets busy, this type of ordering process gets pretty chaotic because their space isn't conducive to long lines. \n\nThe vibe of the place is cool and good for groups and families. They could use more help on keeping the tables and floors clean--it was messy everywhere.\n\nWill definitely be back for the yummy food though!
