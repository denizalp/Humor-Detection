Awful. I hate to do it, but just AWFUL. We are already tired and had to stop in Peoria to get some food. Since it was 11pm we stopped at this McDonald's because it is open late. We pulled in and sat in their two lane drive thru and waited a good five minutes. Another car pulled up around that time and they were helped first. I tried not to be irritated at that, but when I finally ordered we pulled up to the pay window which was wide open and no employees on site, although I could hear them having a grand time talking to each other. After about another 4 minutes a girl finally came to the window. No hello, no I'm sorry for the wait nothing until I said hi and handed her my money. Once I was given my card and receipt I waited for the car in front of me to get their food. 15 minutes later I finally had our food. Two cheeseburgers and fries and an order of chicken nuggets with two drinks. The lady that brought our food looked so tired and is the only one who apologized for the extended wait. We pulled over to eat and low and behold our food was cold. The fries were soggy and my son said his nuggets tasted burnt. I know McDonald's is no fancy meal, but three things should be your priority....hot food that tastes good and good service. All three were lacking. $13 down the toilet. Worst McDonald's I've ever been to. We ended up throwing most of it away.
