Today I got my garage door opener replaced because my old one was old and burnt out. A A1 tech by the name of Brandon Chavarria came out in a timely and professional manner. Brandon was very knowledgeable and was just very positive and happy. Just his energy made me like the service. The repair was a great price and he finished in a timely manner. I would definitely recommend this company to other people. Make sure you ask for Brandon!
