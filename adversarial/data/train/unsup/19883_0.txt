This isn't your typical comic book shop.\n\nThe floors are clean, the stock is well-organized and the staff is friendly. When I first walked into this place, I was amazed at just how different this place is from other shops, it doesn't give off the vibe of a typical comic store, but more of an established chain you'd see in larger cities such as NYC, Chicago or San Fran.\n\nIf you go in on a semi-regular basis, the staff will start to recognize you and engage in your comic interests discussing story arcs and such. This is something you don't get at most comic shops and validates picking this store over any other. If you're going to spend money on comics, this is the place to do it.\n\n Jay has created a sanctuary for nerds everywhere and I wish him continued success!\n\n(I really need to stop spending so much money on those darn South Park Kidrobot figures.)
