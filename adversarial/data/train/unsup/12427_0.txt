The absolute WORST. \n\nI have never been treated so rudely and brashly before at an area meant for tourists. \n\nMy boyfriend and I decided to visit this museum since it was for free and with it's really high score. Less than five minutes into entering, I was fumbling around my purse to take out my phone to take a photo of one of the statues and there was a packaged, SEALED snack in my bag that shifted around. \n\nImmediately some portly, mustachioed Caucasian security guard huffed and puffed his way towards us and said, \"NO FOOD IN THE GALLERY\". We explained to him that we were not eating it and that we just wanted to take a photo and that the food was sealed. \n\nMy boyfriend and I turned around to go back to the statue, but LO AND BEHOLD this man was right behind us and yelled, \"GET OUT OF THE GALLERY\". \n\nI was utterly shocked and appalled at the lack of courtesy and common decency that this man employee had. There was no \"I'm sorry..\", \"Please\", or \"Excuse me\". \n\nFor a place that is meant for tourists and visitors this form of treatment and behavior was completely unacceptable. \n\nI will NEVER visit this museum again and I will advise my friends and family from doing so as well.
