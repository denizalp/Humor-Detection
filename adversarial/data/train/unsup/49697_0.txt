I pass by this DD daily. Today was my first experience. The location itself is good, however the only SAFE way is if you are driving towards Mt Lebo on Washington rd. I was surprised and pleased to see that they had a garage door with seating so that you can enjoy your Joe and donuts with some fresh air. The place is very clean and modern. \n   Being that it is pretty much on the border of Bethel park, and the fact that most of their customers with be coming from both Bethel and USC, I was wondering why they were excited with representing Mt Lebo and not any other schools. \n    ANYWAY! The checkout line went fast, but my sandwich was on somewhat of a delay because the sandwich dude didn't realize I ordered one. I think I was asked if I ordered a drink 3 times, with my response always being that I ordered a sandwich each time, before my the thing was made. I will give this place another shot sometime. Maybe today was just a bad day for them.
