I enjoyed staying here.  The service was excellent.  The hotel's not over the top glamorous like a lot of the other hotels in Vegas.  Nevertheless, it was tastefully decorated and modern. \n\nIt's not on the strip, but it's located within walking distance from a monorail station.  It was perfect for a visit to Vegas.
