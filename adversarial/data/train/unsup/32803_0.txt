Just happened to see this place driving and thought why not. \n\nIt's in a little strip mall shared with a convenience store so parking was a bit of a challenge with \"15 minute\" signs everywhere. \n\nAt first we thought it might be a dive. A bit dated inside. But there were a fair amount of people eating and it was quick to be seated and the staff were friendly. The menu was hard to decide from and we asked for their recommendation. Ended up with deep fried pork & peppers with a side of rice, side of noodles and added in their deep fried dumplings. \n\nNow this is the second time I've had Korean food and both were delicious. Most are sharing dishes. The price for two people to eat without drinks being under $30 bucks is pretty amazing and you leave happy. The dish was great and had just the right amount of spice for me. \n\nI thought it was odd they dropped scissors off with the chop sticks and plates (You'll need them to cut the noodles) I highly recommend the dish we had and if you like Korean or want to try it, this place is great.
