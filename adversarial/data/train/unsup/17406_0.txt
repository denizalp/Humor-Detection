Visited here a few weeks ago with 3 friends after hearing the hype about a new, cool hipster place for fab cocktails. Plus I am a fan of whatever Bernie does, so I figured it had to be cool. \n\nWithout repeating what everyone else has said, this place leaves a little something to be desired. The hokey, NYC-wanna-be-like process of getting into the place is kind of lame and was an immediate turnoff to me. I completely understand wanting to limit the number of people in this cute little space, but come on! Gimmicks just bug!\n\nAs mentioned by others, the drink list is very limited and you cannot order anything but what is on the list. The G&T takes well over 20 minutes to \"brew\" and when the bill came, which did include the 20% grat, we spent $100 for 4 drinks...seriously, no drink is that good...it is still gin and tonic at it's core.\n\nMy least favorite thing about my experience is the rotten, grease trap smell that invades this spot. It is completely and utterly nauseating making it impossible to stay for more than one cocktail, if you had the bankroll to afford another.\n\nI hope after reading some of these reviews, they make a few changes and lighten it up a bit as who needs to be so dang serious about cocktails!
