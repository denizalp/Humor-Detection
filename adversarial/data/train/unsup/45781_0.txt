5 stars for this barber shop!! I just moved from San Diego and was recommended by a local barber to check out this shop. Christian has now cut me up a few times and has always been on point. Good location, parking, atmosphere, but most important quality of cuts. Come check it out if you're in the area, you won't regret it!
