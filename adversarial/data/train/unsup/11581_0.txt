Not exactly \"ideal\" but they eventually got the jobs done.  My home warranty company, Old Republic, had them come out to replace a ceiling fan.  The first one they put in was no good so it took another week for them to come back and make it right.\n\nWe also had them return a couple of other times to do things our home warranty didn't cover including replacing light fixtures and installing a fan switch.  Both of those jobs were done well.  The service guys that came out were personable, helpful and fair.  They deserve at least 4 stars once they are physically there.  \n\nMy biggest issue was the three times we had set an appointment only to have them flat out no show.  We went with the 9am-noon blocks each time to prevent us sitting around waiting all day but that's exactly what happened.  One time they said they didn't have a record of us making an appointment and twice where they said there was an emergency and they couldn't get to us (they only told me this when I called around noon asking where they were).  I would havve gone with someone else if they had not already replaced the fan and the other instance where I had already given them a deposit for the light fixtures.  \n\nSo triple check your appointments if you go through them!
