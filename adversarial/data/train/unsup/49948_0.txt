Overall experience: 8.5\/10\nFood: 8\/10\nAtmosphere: 8.5\/10\nService: 9\/10\n\nAuthentically Italian all around. \n\nThe staff, the food, even the wine, is as Italian as you're going to find in Toronto. Wine is imported directly from Italy (not even available at the LCBO), the staff will converse with you in Italian, and the way the menu is set up is genuine. There are no massive pasta bowls you'll enjoy, but rather apps, a small pasta or risotto course, and then your main meat dish. \n\nThe food here is good - but the flavours will be different than what you may have experienced. As my very Italian friend explained, Stelvio's palette stems from northern Italy, whereas Roman or southern Italian notes are more common in other eateries. \n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE: a lovely, genuinely Italian place with good food. Worth checking out!\n\nPRO TIP: if you like olives in even the slightest, get them here. They are divine!
