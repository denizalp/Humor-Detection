Biggest pho place I've ever seen, and also only one that doubles as a banquet hall. Right off the lively street known as South Blvd, Saigon Palace (not to be confused with Saigon Bistro on the other side of town) has everything you need for your pho and bun cravings (which I have very frequently).\n\nHad the grilled shrimp bun which is soup-less vermicelli, lettuce, bean sprouts, and grilled shrimp flavored with fish sauce. It was yummy, as was the spring roll appetizer. The service was great and waiters very nice. I definitely need to go back and try their pho!
