What a great idea!\n\nOkay, I've been to other airports that combine rental car companies into one location.  But for some reason, VEGAS does it better.\n\nHop into any of the appropriate shuttle at the airport and they'll bring you here--about a 5 minute ride.\n\nI didn't have to call my individual rental company, nor wait for an individual shuttle.\n\nThis place is so clean!\n\nNote that I don't love all the rental agencies here, I like the fact they're in one location.
