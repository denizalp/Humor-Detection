This review is for their online store, NOT retail store (which I just adore!).  \n\nWhat a horrible first-time experience!  Here is a snapshot of my experience:\n\nNov 26\/12 - After going through a not-so-user-friendly website, I finally placed an order.  Received a confirmation email itemizing my order.  \n\nDec 4\/12 - Still no shipping confirmation; emailed their customer service asking for shipping status. No replies for 4 days!!!\n\nDec 8\/12 - Was just about to email them again when I get an email from an e-com rep from the Yonge store.  He didn't even address me by my name.  He advised me that one of the items was no longer available and that 2 more items had to be sent to the shipping warehouse.  He didn't give an ETA on when the order will be shipped but did advise me that I would be receiving a confirmation email re: shipping once my order is \"completed.\"\n\nDec 10\/12-Still no ETA.\n\nI seems that the items advertised online are scattered amongst all their stores and then each store has to ship the items to the shipping warehouse where they then send all the items together to the customer.  What a waste of time and money!    I would think it would provide a much better cx experience if each store is responsible for shipping out the various items.  They can take a lesson or 2 from Land's End in the US where you get items arriving to you within 3 business days!!!\n\nLet's hope my items arrive before the 25th of Dec since they were all purchased as Xmas gifts.  \n\nI love you guys at Sporting Life but the E-com mgt team needs to rethink their operational and customer service strategy!
