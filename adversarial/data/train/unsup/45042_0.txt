This is a great place! I have been to several Starbucks locations and this one consistently get my order right, items are fresh, the staff is pleasant, and the place is clean. I have gone through the drive through, ordered in advance, and done a order at the register all where they have been consistently kind and moved at a fast pace.  The team of baristas are festive during holidays and care about what they are doing. I recommend and will return.
