Place is really cool. I stopped by the other day to check it out. The only thing about this place is it has a way of feeling really cluttered but not actually being? Make sense? Just a lot going on there. This place may have TOO much stuff and maybe that's why?\n\nStill place has great nostalgia collections going on. Many display cabinets with loose toys for sale. Many walls of still packages toys. This place is defiantly worth a shot if you love toys and nostalgia. I feel no matter who walks in there they could find something they like no matter what age.\n\nStore was clean and staff was a little strange. Some guy asked me if I needed help 3 times in one minute. Kinda felt like I was under a micro scope the whole time. Don't get me wrong he was really nice just kept popping up.\n\nEasy location from Fremont to get to. On the main Fremont strip side by dennys. Totally worth it. I know I'll be back on a rainy day or when I'm down there. If you like everything from Star Wars to the power rangers you will sure love this place!!
