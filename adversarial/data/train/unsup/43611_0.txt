You must come here to dine if your in Vegas. We dined in here around 3pm. There was a 20-30 min wait which wasn't too bad decided to hit some slot machines while we waited. The food was amazing ! The ribs are to die for fell right off the bone. The macaroni and cheese was the best I've ever had. Extremely satisfied!
