I eat here at least 3 or 4 times a month. It would be easy for me to knock them due to the fact that they messed up my order tonight. I ordered a carne asada burro with sour cream. They forgot the sour cream. With that said, I love the food here. I eat a ton of Mexican and I won't say this is super authentic but I will say it has good flavor. I have never been disappointed in the food itself. I have ordered probably everything on their menu including the vegetarian burro. They get the order out quickly and usually everyone is fairly friendly. So I have to get them 5 stars.
