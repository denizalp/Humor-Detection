Another excellent dinner at Vintner Grill. They just never fail to meet our expectations. Service was top notch. Server made several recommendations to our group which we accepted. My wife had the vegetarian portobello dish with fried spaghetti squash which was superb. I had the lamb chop special. Fantastic. Other standout dishes for the group were scallops (always good here. ps: bring back the sweet corn risotto) and Oso Bucco. In my opinion the best fine dining off the strip.
