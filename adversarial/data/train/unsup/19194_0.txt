I was not very impressed at all when I recently went in to check out the used record selection. Many of the pop\/rock titles seemed overpriced for their condition. This store does not seem very picky about what is selected to sell, like they'll just put anything into their bins and slap a price on it, no matter how shabby it appears (I felt like mold spores were being released into the air as I looked through the albums). Jazz section seemed a bit better in item quality, but was a pretty small selection. If you are ga-ga over used cassettes, they have plenty of 'em (kind of an insane amount). CD selection is average. Younger girl working behind the counter seemed apathetic to be there. All in all, I'd pass on this store. (They also display some more rare vinyl outside of the store, but the covers are all very faded due to sunlight exposure...a bizarre choice for displaying such items!)
