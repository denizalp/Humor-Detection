The newest Hooters in Charlotte but the same old servers. I mean no offense to the young ladies, but I think I rather see half of them in T-shirts and Jeans.\n\nOdd location for a hooters... ZERO traffic during the day with no chance in the world of a suit walking in and in the night you have nothing but business travelers from the Marriott looking for Ms. Right Now.\n\nSorry... old enough to be over that scene but young enough to still want a good scene.  Not here.
