Every time I have been to this office I am seen within ten minutes or so, and the doctor or PA seeing me is patient and listens. I am an established patient and I can always get a new appointment the same day or within a few days if it's not an emergency. If I'm concerned about something they listen to me and we develop a great plan of care. I never have to plead my case or fight for a test to be ran, they always are eager to help me find the solution and get on my way to feeling better. I haven't had a primary care doctor in over ten years, but Complete Care Medicine has changed that for me because they are friendly and easy to get in to.
