I have to admit, I had high expectations for Sugarbakers since reading Sean M's 5 star review... and when I walked into the restaurant for lunch yesterday, I was more than excited!  It's adorable - I actually kind of felt like a kid in a candy store looking around at the fresh bakery items and large menu with so many fresh, yummy items to choose from!  I think the colorful walls (mauve, pink, yellow, and green) added to the happy girly atmosphere there - I began to wonder a bit about Sean!\n\nIt was a beautiful day at the Borgata and my first trip there since their remodel, so I was blown away by how happening it was on a weekday.  I chose to wait for my lunch companion (the lovely Kristin S) at a table outside in the sunshine by the fountain and green grass.  \n\nI should've taken some more time to study the menu instead of my beautiful surroundings because I ordered wrong!  I didn't read the menu description as closely as I should have, I guess... I went with the 'California Open Face' sandwich under the 'Sugarbakers Favorites' section of the menu.  Looking at the menu now, it reads \"Fresh roasted turkey breast, Provolone, bacon, avocado, tomato, lettuce on wheat & special sauce with fruit cup.\"  I missed the 'special sauce' part of the description so when my food arrived covered in a mayo-like sauce, I was not so pleased.  I also was disappointed because it came on rye instead of wheat.  (minus one star for that).  \n\nOn the positive side, the food being served around me looked really good, and Kristin seemed to enjoy her 'Italian Salad.' Although it wasn't exactly what I would've liked to order, I ate my open face sandwich (special sauce and all), and we had a delightful lunch together.  I will be back to Sugarbakers, and I'll look forward to trying their breakfast and bakery items in the future as well - next time, however, I will take more time to study the menu beforehand!
