Stayed here on the last vegas trip with some friends. I can't say I'm a huge fan of the casino, but as far as the rooms go, awesome! Pretty spacious rooms kind of like venetian\/palazzo. Four of us fit very comfortably in there. \n\nThe best thing about the room though by FAR was the shower. I love showers with strong water pressure. My god the shower was so good I'm pretty sure the shower-head needed a cigarette when I was done. I want to stay here again just to take another shower.
