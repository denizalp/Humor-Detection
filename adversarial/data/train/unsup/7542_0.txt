Horrible food! Ordered the frog legs, alligator meatballs and fries. \n\nFrog legs were tough and in the freezer too long. It had that \"freezer burn\" after taste. \n\nMeatballs were very very salty. I love salt so for me to say something is salty is serious. \n\nThe fries were gross. Soggy, greasy and ugly. Yes, ugly... I didn't taste any Cajun flavor just grease. \n\nThe staff, Maria was great. Kind and helpful. The manager, Sean did come to check in us but at that point we were DONE. This will be the last time we will ever come here.
