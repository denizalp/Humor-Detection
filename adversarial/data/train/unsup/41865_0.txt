Went in with a group of 8, supposedly with VIP seating, but the venue is so small I really don't think it was necessary. However, it was for a bachelorette party so fair enough. The show was not as raunchy as I was expecting. It was more like lots of muscly men dancing fully clothed, then dancing not fully clothed. Some of the girls brought up on stage upstaged the performers. :) But the show was pretty clean fun.
