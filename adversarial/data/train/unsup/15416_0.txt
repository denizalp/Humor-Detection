WOOO SHINEE! Can popcorn be described as pretty or a work of art? That is how I feel every time I walk into the shop. The masterminds in the kitchen are constantly coming up with new flavors and I cannot help \"poppin\" in to check out what else they have in the works. \n\nLast week, I stopped by to pick up a couple of bags for a friend's birthday. The caramel sour apple was a hit, but she ended up loving the dill pickle and refused to share. After walking around the farmer's market, the gravitational pull drew me back into the shop. This time I picked up two bags for myself. I like their sweet popcorn, but the savory flavors will always be my favorite. The jalapeno is a new favorite, especially when mixed with the dill pickle. I could not help getting a bag of the Dirty Vegas as well. I keep wanting to come in to try PB&J, but it is never up on the board of flavors. I forget quickly when I am handed something else to try anyways.\n\nI have not met an unfriendly person that works there. I tried to limit myself with their testers, but that never happens. Still no cut off point, instead more smiles. This might be a weekly habit.
