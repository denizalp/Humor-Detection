Jabbawockeez... they know how to tear up the stage with some sick dance routines as well as keep you entertained.  I saw this show once when they headlined at the MGM Grand and once at the Monte Carlo.  I think the show got better when they changed the venue.  The show is a little shorter, but I think the changes they made improved the overall quality of their show.\n\nPre-show: One of the crew members entertained the audience for a bit. Pretty hilarious! Good audience involvement.\n\nMusic: The music was awesome and it incorporated many different types of music. Not just hip-hop. \n\nDance: Great choreography. Freestyling sections are soo sick! Comical at times. \n\nOverall: A very entertaining show that's much more than choreographed dance.
