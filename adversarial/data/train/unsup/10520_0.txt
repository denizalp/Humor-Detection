Yesterday I ordered a Meatball Panini Sandwich and a small drink. The cashier handed me my table number while I was trying to cope with sticker shock. Any lunch that costs $11.20 better be a kick-ass, take no prisoners bountiful gastronomical feast.\n\nAlthough the sandwich tasted good, I felt like I was served a child's portion. I asked myself........Where's the Beef?, certaintly not at Sauce. I will not return since I feel that their sandwich prices should be at least a 1\/3 lower given how puny they are; not worth the money in my opinion.
