Man I wish there was a business in SD like this. I do a lot of late night eating in my town, and there's only a few choices for somewhat healthy eats after hours so I was thrilled to see that this sandwich shop was not only open till 3am, but they also deliver. \n\nIt came quick, it was pretty darn tasty, and I didn't wake up with my digestive track saying \"F*** You A**hole!\" A foot long turkey with avocado to my hotel room for under $10 at 2am?!?! Can I get a hell ya?
