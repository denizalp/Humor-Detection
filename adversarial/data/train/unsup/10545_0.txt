The weekend of Frozen Fury is infamous for pre-party at Hofbrauhaus before the game.  Game got cancelled and no one was here, but the food more than made up for it!  The pretzel was a tad try but the mustard was great.  I got a jar to go and we paid $5 for it...I just found it today at Cost Plus World Market for $2.50.  Darn; I thought they made it themselves.  We got 2 random dishes that involved sausage and something that resembled potato dumplings; not sure but both were delish!\n\nThe entertainment is amped up to high, even though the place was half packed.  The man looked like he escaped from Beer Fest and was smashed in the wee hours of the afternoon.  Rock on.  We'll be back!
