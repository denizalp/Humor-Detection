I went to Performance for a 40 series Flowmaster exhaust on my 07 tundra. I've been here previously for the same type of work (twice). I don't doubt the work they do. I've always been pleased with the attention to detail they have on their exhaust. However this particular time I was quoted $350 for the exhaust and $50 dollars for the tips over the phone. When I got there I discovered my estimate for the work was much higher that the phone estimate. Anytime I've ever went there I've never paid more than $450 for exhaust. When it was all said and done the invoice was 120 dollars more than the estimate. I did have separate tips than what were originally quoted. There was nothing too special about them. Regular stainless tips with a rolled edge. It certainly wasn't enough that I thought it justified an extra $120. \n\nI dropped my car off at 8:30 for a 9:00 appointment. The truck didn't get finished until close of business because of a misunderstanding regarding the placement of the outlets. That was after my vehicle had already been there 4 hours. I also had to go back the next day to have them touch up some of the spots they welded. Unless their prices significantly come down I will not be returning to this shop. My last two previous experiences there definitely were not this frustrating or expensive. \n\nI thought the staff there was very helpful and courteous. But I did notice a big difference in quality of work that was performed on my truck this time. I didn't recognize anyone there which leads me to believe there was a change an ownership. Unfortunately I won't be returning for any future business there.
