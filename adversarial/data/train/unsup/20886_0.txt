I've heard about how great this place is but never went because I would always hear about how incredibly packed it is. But I managed to make it one rainy weekday about 30 minutes before they were closing.\n\nYes, the place is pretty hipster. The people working there all looked borderline homeless with lumberjack shirts and beards to match. But they all seemed nice in a \"don't really give a fuck\" kind of way.\n\nI had the Breakfast Pocket I believe it was called? It was insanely delicious. After I finished the first half I was wondering if I could tackle the second, and I came in feeling quite hungry. The coffee was alright but I don't usually get too picky when it comes to my daily caffeine.\n\nThe decor is interesting but reminded me a little too much of a redneck Northern Ontario vibe. The photos on the wall of old graduating classes were enough to keep my eyes occupied, but other Salvation Army themed furniture made me think of uncomfortable moments in places like Angus Ontario.\n\nThe price was right. In and out very quickly and felt very satisfied with the food I ate. Plus I was a tad hungover and didn't feel sick eating things like eggs and peameal bacon, so they must have done something right.
