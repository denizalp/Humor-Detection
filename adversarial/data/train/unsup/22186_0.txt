Tampopo Ramen has been on my radar for quite some time. I have been wanting to try this place out especially as I was craving ramen the other day. There was a little bit of a wait time for a table which was understandable as I went on a weekend. Their service could be improved however as I felt the wait staff was just running around and they never checked on me until I was done with my meal. I ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen which must have taken at least 20-25 minutes to arrive. While their noodles are very good being hand-spun noodles everything else was average at best. They use a hard boiled egg for their ramen soup whereas other ramen restaurants use a soft boiled egg which I prefer. The pork was extremely chewy, so much so that I couldn't even get myself to finish it. As for the broth it was flavorless and I had to even bring myself to use soy sauce. One positive is that their broth is not very salty which I suppose some people would prefer that instead.\n\nI've had ramen in both LA\/SF areas and while it would be unfair for me to compare the ramen here to the ramen shops in California I feel that there could be improvements made to their ramen soup here.
