This place is cool. Retro cool, dude. \n\nIt's a bar filled with arcade games from the 80's and 90's. I was very excited to relive my youth when I saw the Galaga machine and promptly got the high score! I was very proud of myself for a moment until the next guy tripled it!\n\nIt was freeplay night while I was there, so that was good.\n\nNo food. Good drinks.
