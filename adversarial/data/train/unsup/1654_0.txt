This store is amazing!\nThe level of quality you get is just insane. I stumbled in after going to Comptoir 21 and I was very impressed. \nThe store is beautiful. Super well kept.\nThe clerk offered me tea as well as a pricing sheet before leading me to the sink in the middle of store to wash my hands and try the products. They even offer you a small hand towel to dry your hands afterwards!\nEverything has top notch packaging, it's super impressive. On one side of the room they have gift packages and each comes with a sleeve that has unique artwork and a poem.\n\nSadly, everything is very expensive and I can't justify paying for any of it. I let my sales associate know this and she said it wasn't a problem. She gave me a catalog and some samples before I left just in case I ever wanted to treat myself.\n\nExcellent customer service! I was so pleased after my visit.
