15 minutes after my wait in the drive thru of \"cash only\" I couldn't help but think about the negative impact this business has on the environment. I see several cars ahead of me receiving several bags of food. It starts to make sense \"why the wait\"; large orders. Finally my turn! I think to myself; \"this should be quick, my order is small\"... 6 more minutes later I finally get my change and food. What I learned about my stay at the window... One person's job is to check to see how many cars are coming while the other two prepare food, with no sense of urgency, I've seen molasses move faster. Upon arriving home I see my hot food is sitting in styrofoam. Nice Pete! My mushrooms are just water battered in salt and there is an excessive amount of \"chips\". I generally don't like wasting food, but, as I am not a pig and all I wanted we're fish and \"mushrooms\" I did throw some away. I don't imagine this food ages well. Needless to say; I experienced them, I don't get it and I will not be back.
