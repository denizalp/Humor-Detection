It truly pains me to write this review as I used to be a HUGE fan of Shawarma Knight.  They were a regular stop every other Friday night after an evening of debauchery.  My large beef wrap + a beef samosa + 2 falafel balls was almost a ritual for me over the past five years.  Dunno what happened but over the past six months its been a downhill slide for both the quality of food and service.\n\nFirst the food.  While their food isn't bad (still quite tasty) its no where near as good as it once was.  A few times they've been out of staple fixings (i.e. onions or those funky pickled beets or cabbage (dunno what it is, I've heard them called both)), seriously what donar shop runs out of that?  The samosas had kind of a furry (don't know how else to describe it) texture the last time I was there.  \n\nNow the service.  Used to love going here because the staff were just so damned happy.  Was cool to see people having fun at their job and seemingly enjoying what they're doing.  For the past six months every time I've gone in and ordered they're all cranky.\n\nWill mix my shawarma intake between these guys, Jimmy's and Shawarma King and see who comes out on top.
