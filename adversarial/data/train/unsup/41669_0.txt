My husband and I recently moved to the area from out of state and needed to find day care rather quickly. I had toured another center in the area and was horrified, on the trip home I drove by this establishment and decided to pop in for a quick tour. \n\nThe owner, Julie immediately greeted me and was extremely friendly and knowledgeable. My first impression was that the facility was extremely clean and organized. She led me on a tour of the infant room where my son would be. It's important to know they keep the young babies (6wks to 6months) grouped together and the older babies (7months to 12 months) separate for safety reasons. You don't want a tumbling crawler to fall on a newborn- which is extremely smart. The cribs are alongside the walls which maximizes the plays pace in the room. The babies were happily playing; some in the jumper, others with various toys, and some being held. They have a pretty solid scheduled with naps, playtime, Thursday's in the \"gym\", and feedings with snacks. At the end of the day the teachers send home a report card detailing important info about low supplies, a diaper blow out and capture the lengths of all naps, what they ate, volume, and any other notes. You can call the school and check in on your child anytime. \n\nI'm so happy with Triple R. This is my first child so I was thrilled to find a place where my baby is comfortable, safe, happy, and actually learning. The teachers even took the time to help my son create a Mother's Day card with his handprint on it. So cute! If I have more kids, they will all be students here.
