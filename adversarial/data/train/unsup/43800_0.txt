Just happened to stop in last night and I am SO glad I did. This is such a cute little seafood\/sushi joint. The service was attentive and friendly. The food was absolutely exceptional!!!  And very fair pricing for the size of the portions. Fish-N-Bowl is my new favorite restaurant. I will pass on AYCE sushi from now on and stop in here instead. MUCH higher quality than I've had elsewhere in town. Don't sleep on this hidden little gem in SW.
