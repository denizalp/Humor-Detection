2.5 stars\n\nI've gone with my mother to buy appliances here. It was a good experience. They're on the bottom floor.\n\nMy last trip? Not the best.\n\nThey have some funny clothes here. I spent almost 10 min laughing at just 1 jacket. I'm not even going to describe it just in case someone reads this who bought 1 of those jackets. Those clothes provided some good laughs at the end of my mall roving trip.\n\nThere are NO mirrors! I don't want to have to go into a dressing room just to see what a jacket looks like. I couldn't find a mirror to save my life! Really, the only mirror is the big round 1 close to the ceiling so people can watch for shoplifters. W... T... F...\n\nThe restrooms were a disaster! Just gross. There are 2 sinks but only 1 mirror in there too. What's with Sears & mirrors?!\n\nAnyway, I saw 1 shirt that was semi cute. Maybe if I was more country plaid style... Too bad it was the last 1, & a small. Like my boobs would fit in that?! Pfsh! Ha!
