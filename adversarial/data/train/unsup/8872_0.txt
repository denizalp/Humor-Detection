Got someone you don't like. Get them the groupon special for this place. We spent just shy of 10 minutes in the place and headed out. TERRIBLE!! \n\nUnfriendly staff...check\nNothing to do...check \nThings that cost extra money...check\n\nA literal walk in cooler.   Yes it is cold. There are some frozen ice seats, an ice sculpture (not a pretty clear ice sculpture but some kind of partially melted polar bear that was solid white). There was a jumbo Jenga in the lobby, and a jumbo connect 4 type game. Inside the freezer was a beanbag toss game and some dirty stuffed snowballs. The beanbags were very dirty and felt damp. \n\nWhy is there no staff greeting to tell you all the awesome things?  Because there are no awesome things. They tell you where the coats are...great work. \n\n4 very old video game machines in the place...all requiring extra quarters. First time I've ever been charged extra for \"tax\" on a groupon. Maybe an AZ thing since we're from out of town. \n\nHated it.
