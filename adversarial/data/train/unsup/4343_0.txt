I don't know what the hype is about? I came on a Saturday evening and waited 1.5hrs. The chicken which I'm told is pretty famous in the Philippines was so bland. The gravy didn't help and didn't taste good either. I'd much rather have Popeyes. Or even KFC would be better. \n\nThe mango peach pie is basically a pastry with liquid. There was virtually no fruit inside just liquid. Careful when you take a bite, might spill all over you. \n\nThe only saving grace was the spaghetti. It's a sweet sauce which I believe incorporates ketchup.
