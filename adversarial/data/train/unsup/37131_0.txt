I used this company twice. The first time the actual charge was 4 times higher than the estimate. The second time, about 18 months later, I arranged an appointment to have them diagnose a leak in my pool heat pump and install a water bypass to the heat pump.  The two technicians that came out did not diagnose my heat pump failure as I requested.  They did install a bypass to the heat pump to allow the filter pump to work.  They apparently had to move the heat pump back several inches in order to cut the PVC piping and install the bypass.  In doing so, they broke the electrical conduit which houses the 220 volt wiring to the heat pump.  They also stepped on and smashed the plastic tubing from the ozonator to the base of the filter pump.  They removed the cover to the control panel on the heat pump and left on the fence. They removed a routed AC power cord and left in dangling over the pool equipment. They left the door to the timer control open.  When I called their office the receptionist offered to send the two guys out to fix or repair the damage, but due to their obvious incompetence I decided not to have them back out.  I spent several hours buying replacement parts and repairing the broken tubing and electrical PVC.  I would NOT recommend this company for any services.
