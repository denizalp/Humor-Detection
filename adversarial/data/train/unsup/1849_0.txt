They got my lunch take out order wrong and I didn't realize it until I'd returned back at work.  The flavors didn't sit with me but I've only tried one dish.  My co-workers rave about it so I'll keep an open mind, hey - everybody has a bad day, right?\n\nOh Yeah, Guy Fieri is not someone I consider reputable.
