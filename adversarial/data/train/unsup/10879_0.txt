FINALLY got to try the highly praised Bacchanal Buffet inside the Caesar's Palace.\nI gotta say that I was quite impressed with the wide selection and excellent quality of the food. Did I eat $60 worth of buffet grub? I'm not so sure. To be honest, my experience here could have been better. I felt like a marathoner that couldn't finish the race. \n\nI literally started off with a sprint. I ran to the first station of food that I could lust my eyes upon which was the carving station. I got 2 legs of lamb, 2 bbq pork ribs, prime rib, and a truffle potato gratin. It filled up two plates, and I devoured it. The meats were a little salty, but I really enjoyed the truffle potato. Unfortunately, I could start to feel the effects of starting off too quickly. Next, I went on to the seafood station which included jumbo sized cocktail shrimp, mussels, snow crab legs, and raw oysters. The seafood was a little salty as well which resulted in a lot of water consumption. Then, I went on to try their dim sum and sushi. The spicy salmon sashimi was fresh and very tasty. Finally, the reason why I feel like I couldn't finish the race was because I was too stuffed to really enjoy the seductive looking desserts. They had macarons, all different kinds of cake, ice cream, and even Mochi freakin ice cream! Sadly, my stomach only had room for a black sesame and green tea Mochi ice cream :(\n\nGotta come in with a better strategy next time!
