Being new to Charlotte, we were so excited to learn that there was a ramen place here. Having been deprived of that pork broth for weeks, we went hunting for the best ramen. My other half and I traveled the world a bit and have tried a variety of different flavored ramen broth. So I think I would know the profile of tonkotsu ramen. What we expected was a rich pork flavor. What we got was a bowl of noodles sitting in a bland and under seasoned broth. To top it off, there was a layer of oil that congealed if left untouched for a few seconds. It was missing that salty porky flavor that would have been developed have it had been slow cooking for hours before it was served. The shoyu was a little bit better but was lacking that kick that makes you feel warm and fuzzy. For the price we paid, I dont think it was woth $14 a bowl. Very disappointed and underwhelmed. We left our bowls nearly full. Will not be coming back here ever again.
