Pastries are fresh and delicious... although we did get one thing that had strange tasting cream in it... Really love the homey feel of the place and appreciate the authentic \"Italianness\" of it.  Bread was very fresh.  Only wish there was more selection of bread types - there were many types of rolls but all white bread type rolls...  wished there were whole grain and mixed grain options.
