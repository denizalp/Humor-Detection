disclaimer: everything you read on this review is completely true. and awesome.\n\nabout 6 or so years ago i was hauling my ass thru the 19th ave Peoria area in the middle of the night...having fun. yea!! so out of nowhere. whoop whoop. i get pulled over, long story short, i get a ticket and opt out with traffic school. so a couple weeks later.....i'm at this super huge church on the corner of Central and Glendale, you know the one. looks like a space age community college, well this was the location for traffic school. so traffic school starts early in the am, ho hum boring right. well it comes to lunch break, and this random lady stands up and announces to everyone that she is providing lunch and that she owns Luke's and will have her employees bring over Italian beef on the lunch break. i was like..cool...speeding does pay off after all. lol.\n\nfirst time having Luke's was a little strange, it was delivered over and sorta mass produced. there was like 50 of us in traffic school, still really good. and i have this cool story to remember about the first time I've had Luke's. haha. I've been into the restaurant more then a hand full of occasions for normal encounters with Luke's..awesome Chicago dog.
