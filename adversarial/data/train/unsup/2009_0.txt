Dumplings coming in hot!  I haven't tried anything else here since im not big on chinese food; however, i do love me some fat, delicious dumplings.  Whether it be Mandoo, Gyoza, or Potstickers as long as it's pork and cabbage i'm all for it.  \n\nI tried both Pan Fried and Steamed Pork Dumplings here.  Both delicious but steamed is more up my alley because I don't feel as guilty loading up on the chili oil and dipping sauce.  Actually steamed is not any much healthier, but i do subconciously feel better about it.   But man, pan fried is soo good too.  The wrapping has an attractive deep yellow crisp on one side and the fillings stuffed with juicy fragrance.  Favorite dumplings in town.  Even better than mom's, oh whaaaa? Who said that?\n\nIt's better to dine in than to take out as they lose their integrity.  Either way you'll be leaving a lot more cheerful than you were before you came in.\n\nDon't forget to grab some of fruit \/ boba milk tea.  They use real ingredients here.  Gary is the man!
