I've had BC bookmarked for a long time and now that I've been I am a big fan.  One of the first things I noticed was the very enthusiastic owner who seemed so excited about his food and everything.  That is one of my favorite traits of an owner, when they are excited about their food and excited about the people are going eat their food. The line was almost out the door and I could hear the excitement from right at the door.  Which is always a good sign.  I think we all ordered the Bosc!? Bosk!? Bosq!? however you spelt it it's all sounds at least 6 of us maybe 10 just because how he explained what went inside.  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/baguette-cafe-las-vegas-2?select=5LkJ582csgxifnT_0pTL1A#5LkJ582csgxifnT_0pTL1A It wasn't on the menu but ask for it you're going to enjoy it. It was delicious.  I also picked up a green tea frappe.  Just trying to stay cool.\n\nEverything they made looked and smelt so good. I wanted everything.  They made sandwiches, pastries, soups, salads, frappes, and coffee drinks.  Items are reasonably prices. It was very busy during a mid week lunch and the seats filled up.  There are more seats outside in front and if you're lucky some in the shade of a tree. I was fine with eating outside even though it was hot there was a nice breeze. \n\nI have their quiche and their other sandwiches on my radar.  I'm just going to work my way through everyone's pictures. I'll be here more often.
