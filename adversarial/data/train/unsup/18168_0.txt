This is truly a rep cinema run by movie lovers - you feel a little bit like you've gotten together with friends in your living room to watch the movies you love, just on a bigger scale with somewhat neater seating. (Although because of the gentle, sloping nature of the seating arrangement your view can sometimes be obscured by big heads.)\n\nI think the thing I like most about the Underground is that while it does run some recent release stuff, they mix their schedule up really well with themed programs, special one-off screenings and fun events (Q&As and the like). This is not somewhere you can assume what you'll be getting - it's somewhere you can be surprised by and somewhere that provides fun and often nostalgia.\n\nThe small snack bar offers pop, candy & popcorn - a small, but reasonable selection of snacks. Prices include tax (woo!), as do the ticket prices on the door. \n\nThere is nothing gleaming or slick about this - it's homey and friendly and that's just how it should be. There's no points card system here - the only points you'll get are self-furnished happy points for making the decision to visit the Underground. Keep an eye on their Facebook and Twitter to keep up with what is going down underground!
