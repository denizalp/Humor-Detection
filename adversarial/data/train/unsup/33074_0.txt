Friday night, place was packed and it took a while, but the kids had fun looking at the decorations and moving carousel with tables on it.  Would be nice if they had a hostess to seat people but certainly not a deal breaker.  Last time we were in town was two years ago and 7 year old remembered the ice cream \"dog\" and didn't have to even look at the menu to know what she wanted.
