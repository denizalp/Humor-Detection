I got a smog at valvoline. I did not ask but was told my price for Any exterior car wash would be half off. I asked 3 times as I get an exterior hand wash do to the convertible top. I was told the hand wash was 1\/2 off. Go there and the manager says that is a detail service and I can't get half off. We are not affiliated with them and I am upset. Now it is a detail service to do an exterior wash. Just change the wording, your word should be your bond. Fabulous keeps raising prices but quality is dropping. Last time I had to come back for a rewash because it was so bad. Look at the other reviews, not as fabulous as they claim....look at the photo attached , when you wash the exterior of a car it is a Car Wash !
