Yes, I am a fan of the sandwich.  But I have a few comments.  First off, the food.  I had the \"Do Gouda\".  It was a very tasty sandwich, tender roast beef on a grilled French bread with arugula, micro-slivered red onion and \"sweet onion marmalade\".  Menu says there was Gouda on this sandwich, but it was undetectable.  The wife had Pot Roast Dip, Turkey pot roast, swiss cheese, again the micro-slivered red onion and jalapeno jelly on a baguette.  This sandwich came with an au-jus for dipping.  We both agreed that the sandwiches were quite tasty, although for me, the sweet onion marmalade conflicted with the savory\/bitter flavors of the rest.  I'd prolly order without this next time.  Wife loved the turkey, and the baguette looked delicious, but we initially questioned whether it was turkey, and whether the au-jus was turkey or beef.  regardless, both sandwiches, four stars!\n\nNow, here is where I have some problems.  First off, the online ordering system is fucking frustrating.  I could not even add a basic sandwich to the cart, and I just gave up and called in the order.  That ish should get fixed ASAP as it nearly drove me away.  Next, it was a bit confusing when I arrived to pick up the sandwiches, and there were various people yelling at me just as I walked in the door.  I don't know what restaurant consultant ever thought that yelling at your customers, even greeting them, is a good idea.  That person should be taken out back and shot.  Please don't yell at your customers.  Greet them, don't shout at them.  Really.  Oh, and it's only necessary for ONE person to greet, not the entire crew.  I implore you, please set an example and stop this practice NOW.  Opening day jitters.  Yeah, I get it.  'nough said.\n\nThe basic concept of giving back to the community is to be applauded.  It is an honorable thing to do and I really like that my discretionary income, in some small way, is going to help those less fortunate.  For that I give you major props.
