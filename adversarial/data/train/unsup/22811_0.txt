Worst service ever. If you're going to have a guy working the counter then they should know how to deal with mass service and whose order goes to who. Our food was given away to drunk patrons on the curb. While I really enjoy the Paz food this truck needs a serious \"redesign\" in who runs the truck and how they present customer service.
