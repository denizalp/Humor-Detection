I could have gone to this little spot everyday of my stay but the hotel is so massive it took me a few days to actually find this little jewel.  They serve mini donuts made to order while you watch and the toppings are endless.  I only ordered 6 at a time but I could've really gone overboard as they were so very delicious.  I loved them with powdered sugar and a little swirl of chocolate, and they have so many different ways of topping them but I'm just too indecisive for that so less is more for me.  They're located near the check in area just look for the sign that says 'underground' and follow that down the escalator and follow the smell from there.  They offer samples also so you can try before you buy but seriously who can turn down made to order dough?  Not I....don't miss out.
