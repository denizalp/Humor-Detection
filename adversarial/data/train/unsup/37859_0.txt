We are local and had to stay at a hotel due to a house emergency repair. We were very pleasantly surprised about how comfortable and welcome we felt at this hotel. All of the staff is super friendly and the food at the bar and restaurants is amazingly good!  Beds in the rooms are super comfy and we enjoyed hanging at the bar after Coyote game!  Definitely a great stay and would recommend to anyone needing to stay in this location...close to great shopping and sports activities
