We will always make it a point to stay at the Venetian.  I would advise against their new tower, Venezia... the last time we were there the room was smaller and the maid didn't do a thorough job cleaning.  We actually found a pair of women's boots in the closet.  Freaky!\n\nThe all-suites at Venetian is great.  Not to mention all of the Chinese channels on TV.  But you can get that at Bellagio and the Wynn now too.\n\nNo buffets at the V, but that's nice too.  You don't attract the crowds as much.  The tables also don't attract the younger crowd so if you're into hardcore gambling with less rowdiness, the V is the place for you!
