Ordered the mixed shawarma on a pita.  They didn't give me any of the chicken and all the meat was burnt and taken from the bottom  drippings (they didn't shave any off) plus they burnt the pita when it was grilled.  Not a good experience, though my husband thought his falalfel sandwich was good ( I suggested not to have them toast the pita).  We had to race to a meeting so I didn't asked for a replacement but I saved the burnt bits to show the counter staff.  There is very limited parking here.
