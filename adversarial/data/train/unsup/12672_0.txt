Woah, holy shit, another place that sells Kronos Meat Cone products and calls itself the \"best Gyros in town\"... which, if true, means every other Gyro spot is also the best in town.  As Richard Christy would say, \"It's mah faaavorite\".  Food's good, quick service despite being hella-packed, I mean, line out the door packed.  The dude at the counter might have been mentally retarded... not like, drooling and slapping his chest retarded, but functionally retarded.  \n\nAnyway, $9 and some change gets you a huge plate of Kronos Meat Cone product, rice, salad, pita (or fries if you can get the mongoloid to understand your request), and a drink.
