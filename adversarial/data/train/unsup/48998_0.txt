I'm a huge F&E fan, and am so relieved they've not closed my store here at Alma School & Elliot. I use the coupons, the rewards program, the Made For Me custom coupons...love shopping here.  Produce is good, prepared meals are not bad, prepared salads are really good, both are reasonably priced. I love the clearance sections, refrigerated and not, because I get fantastic deals and can try new things affordably! A 24-case of bottled water here is the best price outside of the big box stores. I buy nuts, chocolate, wine, produce, meat, cheese, quinoa, frozen fruit, ice cream, salads, prepared meals, cereal, veggie chips....well, a lot of different things. I like the self-check, and an employee is always nearby if needed. I just wish they opened earlier in the morning!
