IF YOU'RE THINKING OF GETTING A CAR HERE. READ THIS FIRST\nSALES MAN: IGGY \nVery bad and sneaky customer service.\nI was promised so many things during the initial meetings\/negotiations, then at the day of pickup, the manager tried to scam me for a $2500 down payment that was never talked about\/agreed on. Mind you that I had already given them a $7000 trade in for a much cheaper value. When I said to her that his wasn't the deal, the clown of a sales man teams up with her and says yeah ofcourse that was the deal. I take out all my contact copies and that proved them wrong after ten minutes of going back and forth...they didn't even apologize after!\nIt was worth a shot for them, they wanted an extra cash and they tried to scam me for that amount!\nYour sales man is supposed to be helping you make a deal, and this guy instantly teamed up against me, that tells me what kind of a person you are!\n\nAnd then another incident when I had asked for 3yrs vs 4yrs, he kept promising that he'll do it and send me the comparison, that never happened. Until the day of\nPickup, he says oh i cant do that, if u want know we'll charge you for a new application and will need to do another credit check and get you approved..\nThat's the second lie.\n\nThe third lie is that I went for a key replacement,m, he told me to only pay for the key and they'll install it for me. I pay for them to order the key, $330, that was it.\nTwo weeks later, the key gets there, they install it and charge me $200 of labour! When i spoke to the same sales man again, he goes oh i didnt know and i can't do anything for you, this is service.\n\nSTAY AWAY PEOPLE
