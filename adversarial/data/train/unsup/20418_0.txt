90% of the time these are really good. Once in a while they taste like they have been sitting for a day or so. I really like the cinnamon and sugar pretzel. The prices are reasonable and they have a punch card where you get one free after so many. The person working the register is usually very nice and they have a great lemonade. If you want a snack while in the mall they also have smaller \"bites\" that are good since the pretzels are pretty big and filling. Great stop for some carbs!
