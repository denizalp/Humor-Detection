You gotta hand it to these guys; they know burgers. Located near Queen East and Coxwell, their California-style burgs are thin, loosely packed, and cooked medium-well on a flat-top. Everything is served with basic toppings (ketchup, mustard, mayo, lettuce, onion, tomato, pickles) on a soft simple bun. The meat is moist and succulent (they claim to grind it hourly) and it's dripping with flavour. I like these burgs.\n\nYou'll probably hear a lot about \"The Option\" which is two portobello caps sandwiching a hunk of cheese, and then panko-breaded and deep fried. You can have this on a burger by itself (this is their heart-stopping veggie option), or combine it with a cheeseburger to make their signature burger, \"The Priest.\" Honestly, eating this thing was a gooey and painstaking task -- hot cheese spurted everywhere -- but it was delicious. Everyone likes their fries differently, and I liked theirs. They are not terribly crispy, a bit soft actually, and well-fed on sodium. If that sounds palatable, you're in luck.\n\nI have three complaints about this place: a) it's too small to sit, so you're pretty much doomed to take out b) they have pretty lame drink options, and c) it's expensive! The Priest is $10 which is just insanity for a single sandwich. That's not to say it wasn't a mouth-loving good time, but if I do come back, I will get something more modestly priced, like a cheeseburger or some errant cheese spurts from the floor.\n\nCash only.\n\nObligatory Title Pun: You're sure to get FATTED eating their CALF.\n\nMenu Readability: On three cross-stamped tablets above the cash. (And those biblical references are not ironic.)\n\nNeed to mention: Wait a few seconds before biting into The Option unless you want to be scalded by hot cheese.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: I'm far more open to proselytizing when beef is involved. (OK, not really.)
