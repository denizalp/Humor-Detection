Finally tried out this new wine bar\/pizzeria. I didn't have too many great expectations, as I had read the ever-insightful Kristen's review noting that this was \"a starter wine bar for college kids.\"\n\nIt is, but considering what else Mill Ave\/Downtown Tempe has to offer, I'll still take it! Ha ha. First, I love the décor; they're one of the few Tempe area restaurants to pick up that more downtown Phoenix vibe and style. The quirky celebrity photos lining the wall by the ladies' room make me smile - I want to be in those pictures! What are they doing? Is that Cate Blanchette smoking a joint on the john?? The giant portrait over the bar is pretty cool too.\n\nOK since I have an issue with brevity, I'll try to make short comments on the basics: \n\nService: Pretty good. Came in for a quick drink on the patio one day and the server was incredibly friendly, cool and actually helpful (I'm always shocked by mature and efficient service on Mill Ave, which is littered with student hosts\/bartenders\/servers who act bored, annoyed and are slow and simply don't give a damn - I'm looking at you, RA).  \n\nService cont'd: When I came back for dinner our server was still good, and the poor guy had to deal with the fact that this restaurant does not appear to have its shit together at the moment. Case in point - checked the web site for price range before committing. (Btw I LOVE when restaurants have their entire menu, including prices for food AND drinks online; this one does.) On their home page, they list their daily specials, and Sunday was half-off bottles. Show up and have to sit at the bar for a minute because they appear to be in the aftermath of a Gammage pre-show rush. No prob. I ask the bartender if there's a separate menu for the half off bottles. His gruff response: \"We don't do that.\" Then stares at me. No explanation, no follow up, no suggestions\/alternatives. So I bring it up with the server because I want answers. His explanation was sort of a meandering list of a couple of reasons that just kind of sounded like the restaurant didn't wan to do it anymore. Tried ordering or asking about a couple other things (I wanted a wine they no longer carried but still on the menu and asked too about the Sunday movies) and he uncomfortably explained the restaurant is doing a lot of \"restructuring\" right now and things are changing and information on the menu and web site is outdated. Kind of annoying when you hear that about three requests\/questions in a row. \n\nFood: Pretty damn good. The organic seasonal happened to be a white pizza with merlot soaked mushrooms and spinach. For $11 it was big enough to share for two who aren't starving. Or you can share a salad or app as well. The ingredients were delicious and were of good quality, not to mention the crust was ... I don't know that I can even explain it. Grilled and chewy and buttery and soft and wonderful all at once. \n\nGlasses of red started at $7, and yes were of pedestrian choices, mostly from Cali - if you have a local organic pizza, maybe have local wine too? Kudos for having homemade sangria on the menu (giving Caffe Boa a real run, eh?) \n\nDécor\/atmosphere: see first graph for décor. Atmosphere was nice. Low key, they turned the lights down pretty low and servers are laid back. Loud in the large, open space though. Couches with tables (though the here the tables are actually lower than the seat, so would make for an awkward eating arrangement) are scattered throughout along with regular tables and some tall seating as well as a short bar area. You have the exact opposite issue if you sit at the long booth in the middle of the room, as those small tables are much higher than are comfortable - I feel like my wine glass was at neck level! Patio is nice with tables and couches as well.  \n\nSo, all in all, I judge it on a relative scale because, well, there's really nothing else like it in the area (nearby CB is much pricier). \n\np.s. hey, remember when I said I was going to be brief? Ha!
