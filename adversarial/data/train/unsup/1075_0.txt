So in total fairness- even when I lived in Pittsburgh I thought the North Hills bar scene was pretty pathetic. When my friend wanted to meet up on the evening of Christmas Day, this bar was at least open at 11 pm.\n\nThis is your standard Pittsburgh dive bar and is comparable to Shenanigans down the road. My mixed drink was $2, which as a resident of D.C., left me shocked. The drink was mostly sours and small, but I almost wished to move back to somewhere so inexpensive. The kitchen was closed, but they do $4 pizza and appetizers later at night apparently. The kitchen closes early, though, most week nights. I might have been interested in trying the food another time, if not for other issues.\n\nAs other have mentioned, you will be thrown back to the 1920s and shave five years off of your life as you inhale second hand smoke. My friend and I went in a back room where there was no one smoking, but you cannot really escape the stench. The people drinking in here could be defined as Yinzer trash, as it was all white people making audible racist remarks, while throwing food at each other. The bartender was rude and did nothing to stop this, which was really not OK. I am more than ecstatic to be a city dweller, and had I not forgotten my ruby slippers, I would have clicked my heels to go home. This is not the scene for an educated young professional, to say the least.\n\nAll in all, two stars for being cheap and being opened when nowhere else was. I hope to not come back here.
