For a family getaway, we opted to stick to the Cambria Suites chain and thoroughly enjoyed our experience.  The suites were spacious and comfortable.  We were a little surprised not to see a safe in the suite but just a small detail.  Customer service was extra friendly and helpful.  The pool was a bit small and shallow but the perfect size for our young children.\n\nWe love the Cambria Suites brand and look forward to our next visit!  We did opt out of the breakfast buffet and hit up Cracker Barrel nearby instead.
