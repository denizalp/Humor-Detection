My family really enjoyed the lunch at this place. Super friendly service. We asked for less oil, and the dished indeed were much more like home made, but tastes great still.  We asked for the fresh in-house made fish-balls. That dish is the best I ever tried in 10 years of staying in US.  Exactly the same good taste as back home in China.   My husband gave 50% tip at the end of the meal, to thank them for the hospitality and a great lunch indeed.    Well, part of the reason of the 50% tip is also because of the  price is good.     Overall, well exceeded our expectations.     We will definitely come again next time we are in Vegas.
