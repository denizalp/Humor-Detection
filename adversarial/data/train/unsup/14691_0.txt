I've been several times now and I feel like it has so much potential and so little self-actualization. \n\nFirst, let me say I was a former small business owner and I can appreciate how challenging it is... I don't want to rip on anybody's livelihood. I'm sure the best of intentions are all there and they will make this into a very cool place. \n\nThat said, what the fuck is up with the serivce? The dude at the counter (I've been there several times but this story may as well be true for any of the visits) was totally friendly. No complaints about him. But why on Earth did I ever have to interact with him when there appears to be a server serving the patio? Except, she wouldn't look at or speak to us. We were there for over an hour, the first half of which was spent waiting for her to notice we were there (we were one of two groups on the patio). Being ignored sucks. I'd rather be discriminated against because at least they acknowledge your existence. \n\nThe location is cool but the parking is not fun. The decor is fantastic. Big fan. \n\nI really wish they would improve the service. I'll probably give this place one more shot.
