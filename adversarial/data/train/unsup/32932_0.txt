I was completely blown away by their penthouse suite, which is where I held my reception for my wedding. \n\nIt was on the 61st floor overlooking the Luxor's pyramid. The view was incredible! \n\nThis room had a full bar, conference table, 2 sitting areas, 4 TVs, a bathroom that would bring you to tears, a sexy bed and just about anything else your little heart could desire in an amazing room. \n\nIt was the perfect location for my reception. I had plenty of space for food and drinks and it fit over 80 people in the room comfortably. \n\nIf I could afford it... I would definitely be back!!!
