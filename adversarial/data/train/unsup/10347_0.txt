Londa's Place is a buffet style, soul food restaurant with a good location.   I agree with the reviews by Ashley D. and Chris H. Clean facility, courteous staff, wide selection, and decent prices.\n\nMy fried chicken was lightly breaded (not battered), moist and tasty.  Everyone has their riff on mac-n-cheese.  Londa's I'd order again.  Her collards, however, were good but I'm not keen on the sweetness.\n\nOverall, a pleasant experience and looking forward to tasting some of her other fixins.  When in the area I say \"Give Londa's Place a soulful whirl!\"
