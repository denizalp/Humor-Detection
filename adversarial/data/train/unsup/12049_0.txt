I came here recently on a weeknight, and we were the only customers.  Maybe because they are a new business?  Maybe because it was a weekday?  Maybe because it was 9:00pm or so?  Whatever the reason for the place being occupied by us and the employees preparing food, I hope it continues for just a little bit longer.  I can see myself coming back here for their shaved ice (and I can't wait to try their coffee) and chatting with friends.  The interior is cute, with lots of bright colors, flowers, coffee products on display.  The back of the chairs even have a coffee cup punched into them!

I really had no idea what Korean shaved ice was, and the menu didn't help much either (Credit to Tony T.: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/XnLa8RM80ZmRfM6YwGVn3g?select=s6Sh3vU6TSjgDEta3s-gWw) My friend and I ordered the Green Tea Shaved Ice.  Did you see in that picture of the menu, how next to the shaved ice items they show smoothie-like drinks?  That's what I was expecting.  Ohhhh no, you end up with something much more beautiful: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/XnLa8RM80ZmRfM6YwGVn3g?select=uLcaBz5SDvNJuWlMtNZOHg.  What you see there is a bowl of shaved ice with green tea\/milk, buried beneath strawberries, kiwi, mango, banana, red beans, tea powder, mochi and boba (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/XnLa8RM80ZmRfM6YwGVn3g?select=mT7nldJm_Xw8GpXWGFpdvg).  All served on a glass bowl with a  cute little wooden tray.  It was flavorful and refreshing, and like I mentioned, completely unexpected based on what I saw on the menu.  \n\nI'm excited to go back here and try their coffee and some of their treats.  Maybe it's the colorful setup and the bright lighting, but it just felt pleasant sitting inside Tiffany's and taking my time.  With the limited seating (three or four tables) this place can get full quick, which would mean eating out in the Greenland Food Court.  With the several dining options nearby and shopping at Greenland Market, Tiffany's makes for a great way to wind down.
