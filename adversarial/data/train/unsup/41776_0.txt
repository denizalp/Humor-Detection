I had a very similar situation happen to me this week. My warranty company assigned them to an issue I had with a leak in my bathtub. The technicians were okay minus calling in sick and forcing us to reschedule several times. The major issue I had with them was their office staff. They were very rude and inappropriate. Ruby referred to one of their clients who was causing my appointment to be delayed as not mentally stable. Then, she asked me to describe the plumbers by race. This company is terrible and I would not recommend them to anyone. I will call my warranty company to request that they remove them as a service provider as well.
