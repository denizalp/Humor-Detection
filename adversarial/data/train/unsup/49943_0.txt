Visiting from Illinois with my wife. Hands down best tacos of my life. Also Monday's just so happen to be half off the tacos. I recommend to everyone! I had the charred steak, braised green chile chicken, and braised pineapple pork. My wife had the poke tuna and said it was very fresh, light, and delicious. Wish they had this restaurant in Chicago!
