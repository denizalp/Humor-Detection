The worst Denny's I've ever been to. I don't even know where to start, because most of my experience was unbelievable.\n\nI'll start with the 15 minute wait to get seated while astonishingly bored and uncaring employees strolled back and forth. Once in a while someone would look disinterestedly at us and hold a finger up, ostensibly to say \"one more minute\", even as the bulk of the restaurant was relatively empty.\n\nThen there is, of course, the clientele. I mean, it's the north end of the strip, so yeah... There are families with 17 kids and awkward old men with hookers. That's fine, it's Vegas, but when you're agitated as it is, this kind of stuff doesn't help.\n\nOh, the service. We had Mr. \"I seriously don't give a shit that you're here. What do you want to eat?\" as our waiter.\n\nAfter ordering, I got up to go into the bathroom. THE BATHROOM WAS COVERED IN BLOOD.\n\nI can't make this up, Yelp friends. The bathroom looked like a murder scene. There was blood sprayed all over the floor, the mirror, the sinks, the counter, and the paper towel dispenser. Fresh blood. After that, it may as well have been my appetite that got butchered in there.\n\nI told the staff about the blood and the manager at least looked concerned, in the \"oh my, what else do I have to deal with tonight\" sense. They scurried off to figure out what happened. \n\nI got my food, and it was served on a dirty plate. The final straw. This place is a fucking shithole. Go to the other Denny's, go to Walgreen's next door and buy Doritos for dinner, or even better, go to The Peppermill that's a hundred feet away, it's way, WAY better for the same price.
