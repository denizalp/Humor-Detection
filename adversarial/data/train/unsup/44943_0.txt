Went out of way to get a cheese cake from this place as it gets a lot of attention.\n\nI picked up a cake for take out so can't comment on dining room experience. The gal who served me had on a cute uniform and was very customer oriented.\n\nI picked up a Matcha Cheese Cake which was still warm.  It was light, fluffy and delicious!\n\nWould I return? Yes\nWould I recommend? Yes
