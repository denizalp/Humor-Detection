Dave's is a convenience thing for me. I go because it's close and especially if there is traffic, which is bad enough in that area. I always end up yelling at everyone coming in and out of that chaotic parking lot anyways, so it doesn't really matter what the traffic is like. \nEverything is slightly overpriced, but when I need milk, I need milk. I'd rather go find myself a cow and milk it myself, but Dave's is just easier. I'd much rather go to Whole foods for produce which can actually be cheaper or the same price there and it's certainly of better quality. Paying extra for a peach that'll be rotten within hours? Sorry Dave's, I don't want to come buy fruit daily. The beer selection here is pretty nice, though, especially when you want beer and don't want to go to Coventry Mart or Murray Hill market which would be even worse on the wallet. If you drink enough of whatever you purchase, you'll forget what you paid for it and probably have a good time along the way! \nAnother thing about this place that bothers me is the unusual smell that slaps you in the face when you walk in the doors. It's like a combo of frozen fish and freezer burnt chicken nuggets. Or something like that...
