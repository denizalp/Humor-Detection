I loved this place and can not wait to go back!  My friend and I went here for lunch and almost went back for dinner!  The service was spectacular.  The server was very prompt and knew a lot about the menu. \n\nI didn't check out much from the beer list but I easily found something I wanted. \n\nThe menu items were just too much!  In a good way!  So many items I wanted and I couldn't choose. The server helped me by telling me more about the items so I could pick a favorite. \n\nActually, after having went somewhere else for dinner that night, I wish I would have returned to the arrogant butcher for dinner. \n\nGo to the arrogant butcher. He has a reason to be arrogant!
