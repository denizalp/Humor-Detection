Very trendy \"full service boutique hotel.\" It doesn't have a casino, it's dimly light throughout, and your able to live here. I believe Mayweather owns 2 units, which one of his chauffeurs stays in.\n       \n       We stayed in a contemporary penthouse suite (1,900 sq. ft.) on the 56th floor, with a going rate of about $1,700 on this particular Sunday night. The suite included an infinity jacuzzi on the outdoor balcony. It was nice but it was non-functional. It was more like a pool for our guest. None of the controls to the jacuzzi worked, besides the light. \n\n     The penthouse also included 2 bedrooms, living room, 2.5 baths, small TV room, and kitchen w\/o a functional refrigerator. We had to keep ordering ice from downstairs and at one point they handed us a bill and we refused to sign it. \n\n    T.V.'s jacks are all locked so forget about bringing the XBOX or other contraptions with you. They won't work. They do supply a cheap surround sound in the living room which hooks up to your Bluetooth device.\n\n     The overall room was nicely decorated and the staff was very courteous.  I also liked the fact that out party guest were able to go up to our room with no scrutiny from hotel security. \n\n     This was just another hotel stay for me, besides the fact that we had a jacuzzi on the balcony and a breath taking view. Next time I put a celebration together, with friends and family, it will be at a different Las Vegas location.\n\nP.S. Again a $28 resort fee with limited WIFI for ONE device for 12 hours, after that you get charged. Resort fees should be a crime!!!
