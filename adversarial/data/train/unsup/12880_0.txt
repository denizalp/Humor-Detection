Impressed? Yessir!\n\nWhile tending to my usual weekend cupcake pick-up duty over at Sprinkles (I refuse to eat them, they're for my mother), I actually noticed something new out of the left window. Omp, did that say Yogurt?! As in Fro-yo?! Hm...if I buy my mom one less cupcake, I might be able to afford this, I thought to myself. And did just that, practically skipping over to this cute shop. \n\nDid you know the walls are green?!! Like one of my favorite shades of green?!! I'm in heaven. I've died, and gone to the right shade of green heaven! Mind you, I've only walked in the door at this point. I calmed myself and prepared for mediocre fro-yo...\n\nBefore I start talking about how perfectly wonderful their fro-yo did taste. I will say that I respond well to pictures, like I'm sure most of us do. They had these cute lil' pictures above the machines to tell you the flavor, and yes, I do know Juju Berri has something like this, but not as cute and well made, sorry! I was just stuck on that for a bit. I collected a bit of the Coconut and Pineapple flavors, added Kiwi and Almonds as toppings. And took my small cup of fro-yo to the scale, like if I was approaching the chopping block...Shocked and amazed, my mound of fro-yo came to $2.36ish. And I got to pick my own green spoon! I'm pretty sure I had an a orgasm on the spot. \n\nDon't tell Juju Berri, but I think I may have found someone new...Cheating never tasted so deliciously tart!
