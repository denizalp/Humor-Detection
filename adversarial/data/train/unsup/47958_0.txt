Great, inexpensive breakfast spot, our bill totaled like $13 (we didn't get drinks). While on a quick vacation in Charlotte this week, my boyfriend and I ate a Rise. I ordered the \"righteous chicken\" biscuit with white cheddar cheese and he ordered the \"bacon, fried egg, and cheese\" biscuit. We both agreed both were delicious and very filling, might I add. The chicken was well seasoned, hot and just all around good. I'm very particular about my biscuits, but there's were that perfect balance of soft, not oily and firm.My boyfriend devoured his food in minutes. The only thing keeping this place from a 5\/5 is the hashpuppies (paid almost an extra $2 for them too), wasn't crazy about them. I expected cheese melted on top of tater tots, however the cheese was the filling inside the tater tots instead. Next time, I'll try a donut, but we came an hour to close and their selection was extremely limited. Definitely go and enjoy a quality, inexpensive breakfast\/lunch option.
