One word. Gorgeous.  I parked in self-parking.  There was plenty of it and it wasn't far from rooms.  Also, it was well patrolled.  Every time I came in or out I saw a police cruiser in motion not just parked idly by. Staff at front desk were friendly upon check-in.  Stayed here for a work conference and got a great deal on corporate rate compliments of my company.  Room was ridiculously amazing!  Stayed on the 38th floor so got an awesome view. Everything (drapery, sheers, lighting, AC, etc) is electronic and linked to a remote control that had 2 panels (one when you first walk in by the door and another by the bed for easy access.  The room was huge and the bed extremely comfy.  The bathroom was something out a movie with 2 sinks, separate shower and tub with jets.  I took a bubble bath and almost drowned as it was soooooo deep!  Had to quickly grasp the sides, hold on for dear life and save myself otherwise I wasn't gonna make it!  There was confusion regarding paying for wireless.  I called to confirm it was included only to be told at check-out it wasn't.  After a few minutes of investigating the charges were removed and I was taken care of.  Excellent customer service!  Would definitely stay here again!
