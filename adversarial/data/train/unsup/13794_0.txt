I agree with all the other reviews. This place is horrible. The office employees are not very bright. It took a month and a half after filling out the application to know if we were approved or not, and we didn't find out until the day before our move in date! And that was with constant calling and going down to the office. They are extremely unorganized, and they are very polite and friendly, until you move in. Then they act like they can't be bothered with you or your problems. They can't keep track of anything, it takes constant calling to make sure they are on top of your requests. I would not refer this apartment complex to ANYONE.
