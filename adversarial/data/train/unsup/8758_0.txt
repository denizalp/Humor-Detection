Wish I could say I liked this place. The woman who did my nails was very nice and I hate to leave a bad review, but I'll never go back. I got a French tip manicure and it was awful. Uneven, chunky and bubbled. One was particularly bad and she noticed me looking and asked if it was ok. I told her where the tip met the polish didn't look even to me and she tried to fix it but I'm pretty sure it just ended up worse. I was going to do the same for my pedicure but switched to a solid color. It was better, but nothing I couldn't do at home. I also got an eyebrow wax done. My brows look good, but she got wax in my hair that she attempted to get out, but after leaving I noticed a small chunk still in my bangs, plus a little in the corner of my brow. \n\nReally wanted to like the place, especially since she was so sweet, but I can't recommend it to anyone.
