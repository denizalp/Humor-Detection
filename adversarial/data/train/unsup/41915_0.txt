As an avid runner and soccer player I have a tendency to acquire a lot of injuries, but Dr. Serrick has done an amazing job of keeping me on the field!  \n\nI first saw him for recurring foot, ankle and knee pain.  After a thorough assessment he got me fitted with orthotics and used adjustments and various tens\/laser\/thumper treatments to whip me back into shape.  \n\nHe's extremely knowledgable, knows both injuries and his treatment tools very well, and is an invaluable part of my healthcare team.  Thanks for all of your help Dr. Serrick, you're amazing!
