The first two visits may have been a bust in terms of wait times and customer service, but since then I've had only 5 star experiences!\n\nThis place is within close proximity to my school, so driving off campus for a healthier alternative is incredibly easy, and I never have to feel guilty about how often I'm here. Light, fresh, organic superfood. I'm all about it!\n\nWait times still run just a bit long- but I'd say anywhere from 5-10 min.. Not the 30min I had previously experienced.. And not any longer than a Tropical Smoothie drive-thru. The customer service here has been fantastic! Very personable, willing to make suggestions and super friendly.\n\nThey also have a pitaya bowl that isn't listed on the menu, but it's advertised at the pick-up window. It should be noted that the acai bowl melts really quickly, whereas the pitaya bowl holds up incredibly well. If I'm taking this into work with me, I grab the pitaya, which should still be eaten within the hour.
