I had a craving for brownies and ice cream the other night so we decided to give this place a try. They have a good number of choices with house made ice creams and at first I thought the prices were a little much for just dessert but after eating it I think it is worth the indulgence once in a while. We went at night, some time after 9PM, and we were the only table. The atmosphere is nice and simple. \n\nI had the waffle hot plate with earl grey ice cream, brownie bits, mixed nuts, and chocolate cream sauce. The ice cream was really good! I could actually taste the tea. I decided to go with the waffle instead of the brownie base since I figure the brownie topping would be the same kind of brownie just crumbled up, so why not have best of both worlds? \n\nWe also tried the milk and honey toast mountain. It had vanilla cardamom ice cream and green apples. There weren't very many apple pieces. The ice cream had a bit of a spice to it, something not everyone may like but I enjoyed it. Everything had to be eaten in one bit to appreciate the combination of flavours. \n\nMy hot plate dish and the toast mountain were the same price but I think the hot plate was more worth it. ($10)
