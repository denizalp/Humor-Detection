Is it possible to rate a zero?  I will try...\n\nWe came here tonight because the kids wanted some pizza...  The hostess (a middle-aged blonde -haired woman with a lot of miles on her face) looked at us, and immediately looked away.  She then commented to the kitchen worker, \"I don't believe this crap!  I just cleaned out the buffet!\"  She refused to wait on is and continued complaining, \"Don't these people have homes!?\"  \n\nUmm, yes, we have homes, but enjoy a meal out from time to time...  What a terribly managed restaurant this must be to allow a waste of oxygen like her to have a job...\n\nWe walked out and went to Red Robin where the experience was 180 degrees in the opposite direction!
