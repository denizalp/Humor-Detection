I would give more than 5 stars for the Mississauga location and 3.5 - 4 stars for the St.Clair location. The only reason why the St.Clair location would get a lower star rating is for the simple fact that some of waitresses were taking shots the WHOLE time my boyfriend and I were dining. Which probably explained why we had to ask for our third round of drinks over again- regardless they were friendly and the food was bomb- so can't complain.\n\nMenu:\nExcellent variety, great price point and exceptional quality and portion size.\nI've had numerous things off the menu either for sharing or as an entree.\n\n- parmesan truffle fries: DELICIOUS. The flavour of the overall fries were delicious and I loved the combination of the cheese, rosemary and truffle oil.\n\n- nachitos: AMAZING. A nice spin on classic nachos as the salsa and sour cream come in corn tortilla cups. Very filling and great for sharing.\n\n- smoked chicken quesadilla: MUST TRY. The flavour, portion size and dipping sauces are great. I'm not sure what they do to the tortilla bread- i'm thinking they dust it with a spice of some sort and then grill\/bake it or something. Whatever it is, it's perfect and adds a nice kick to the quesadillas. \n\n- smoky club flatbread: TO DIE FOR. We had everyone at the table try it and they all agreed that it was one of the best flat breads they have tasted. Great blend of cheeses and the grilled chicken with the the smoked bacon and garlic aioli work wonderful together. Consider this starter if you have a group of 2 or more.\n\n- epic cheeseburger \/ roasted mushroom melt burger: both great options for a burger. Loved the cremini mushrooms in the burger, it was wonderfully saut√©ed and tasted great. The burgers were juicy but not greasy and the side fries were hand cut and fresh!\n\n- Ache High Club: My boyfriend had this and said it was some of the best sandwiches he's ever had. He was a little skeptical at first with the cranberry focaccia but he said the sweetness of it complimented the sandwich and that it was very filling.\n\n- Chicken Vindaloo: My boyfriend also couldn't stop raving about how delicious this was. I also tried it and it was great! Newer addition to their menu but worth trying if you enjoy Indian food. It is not in any way over powering.\n\nAtmosphere: Cozy, rustic and great for groups or date night. The chairs are comfortable and extremely big which gives you the impression they want you to stay a bit. \n\nI HIGHLY recommend checking this place out. You will not regret it!
