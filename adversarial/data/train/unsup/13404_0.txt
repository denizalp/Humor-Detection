Fun Time With Friends\n\nWe went here for a friend's birthday (The Dirtttty 30) and took over the track with our little group. \n\nWe hung out in the bar area until our turns came up and the bartender was friendly and got the job done. \n\nIt's got a fun feel to the atmosphere and all in all is a cool spot. \n\nThe cars are fun and the track is cool. The staff was polite and friendly... I like that it's all battery powered so I don't have to suck exhaust fumes all night. \n\nWe haven't been here in a while and should plan another even here sometime soon... Maybe the track is a new format now? \n\nMy only complaint is that you're not supposed to pass and how can you win a race without passing! They say you only win by lap times but your lap time is low when you're behind slow people. They need to make wider spots now and then to get around people...
