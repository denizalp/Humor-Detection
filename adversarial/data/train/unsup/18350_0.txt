Bear in mind this review is coming from someone who is not a major \"sweet\" eater.\n\nBut OH MY DEAR LORD IN HEAVEN(TM), I love this place.\n\nI discovered this place when I was living back in Texas years and years ago.  I used to buy their bubble gum ice cream by the pint, take it home, and lay on the floor in a coma like some kind of ice cream drunkard.\n\nWhen I moved to California, I again found a Marble Slab.  It was way out of the way for me, but I found the time, though alas, no bubble gum ice cream.  Their other flavors are no slouch, however, so I made do (what kind of saying is \"made do\", anyway?  I guess that's beside the point).\n\nI discovered recently that Marble Slab exists here in Vegas.  It's been... a while.  I don't go crazy for most ice cream, but their brand is fairly magical.\n\nI walk in, look through the selections....\n\nBubble gum ice cream.\n\nIn which my head nearly exploded from glee, I ordered a cup, and it was as good as I remembered it.  Most attempts at this flavor always taste like some weird knock-off, but this is like those little pieces that you would get from the bank drive-thru tellers, except that the taste lasts much longer than 3 seconds.\n\nDid I get a pint to take home and resume my binges?  Not this time, but I know where you live now, Marble Slab Creamery.  It's only a matter of time....
