Liquid is fun... IF you have a table\/cabana or bottle service. If you don't, you will have to hide all your things under a towel that will inevitably get soaked and ruined. Seriously, there was no where to hide when all the splashing started!\n\nMy friend graciously got us bottle service and the ladies working made sure we all had a drink in our hands at all times. My friend was turning 30 and you should've seen how excited she was seeing her name in the big cards and champagne showers! You all made her day.\n\nWe popped one of the massive swan floats after about 5 minutes in the pool. DJ HAD to call us out \"This is why we can't have nice things!\" lol oops #Vegas Baby
