Dr Brenda Martin was recommended to me by my skin specialist and last yr july, I requested for a meeting as had few questions,since it was my 1st pregnancy we were planning.they generally do not do meet and greet and I was charged for the visit but guess bcoz I mentioned the recommendation, I got to meet Dr martin.my 1st meeting and the way,she spent quality time with us,answered my questions, her body language and smile,  we knew we had met our perfect doctor. Come dec'14 and we got the good news, Dr Martin remembered me and also had remembered our conversation in july... me n my husband love her, Christy- her assistant, the office staff... they all look and sound like they enjoy the job. Delivered my baby in Aug and we had few complications but Dr Martin handled me, the entire operation so well. She was on top of her game and me and my husband couldn't have asked for someone better to do the job!
