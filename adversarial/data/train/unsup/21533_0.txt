So, it's not like this place was ever gonna make it outta my e-gutter, cuz there's nothing really redeeming about it. You know, sometimes a craving makes one act desperately... sometimes against one's better knowledge. Nevertheless, I make my way to Monty's one fine day, craving some sort of ice-cream based treat, similar to a beverage, but of a thicker consistency. Nothing special, just some plain old ice cream and say, caramel. It was $6.38?! Okay, so I go into a Vincent Vega state of mind, zoning out while the shake's bein' made thinking to myself \"Did I just order a six-dollars n' 38 cent shake? Sure did. A shake? Milk, ice cream, caramel? Uh-huh. Six-dollars n' 38 cents? Yep. They don't put bourbon in it or anything? Nope. Just checking... smh... Whoa, WHAT?! When it came up, it was in a small, flimsy styro cup, with a sad lil' wafer sticking out the top. Wait... did they just charge me like that much for this??? Ugh! I was so pissed, I told em' keep it, n' got my money back. I can get Culver's or Michael's for like, way better... Even the Chocolate Shoppe, or like, buy your own pint and a gallon of milk, stir in some Smucker's flavoring and have change to spare... I don't even know why people like this place. Dude, seriously...
