This is my favorite place for Boba, smoothie, milk tea, and tea drinks.  The people inside working are always nice and friendly. One of my favorite drinks is chocolate milk tea with coffee jelly.  So good!!!  My wife loves the peach green tea. I had the watermelon smoothie today, it was awesome.  Check it out.
