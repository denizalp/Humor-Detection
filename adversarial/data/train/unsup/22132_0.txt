Service: Waited about 10 minutes to be acknowledged by our server, he actually seemed bothered that he had to wait on my friend and I.  Throughout our evening he did warm up a bit and checked on us two times.  The hostess was rather rude, and ignored us altogether when refilling the other customers' water.\n\nDrinks:  The martinis were wonderful, I highly suggest the Lyche martini.\n\nSushi: Was wonderful as usual, very fresh and believe it or not we got it right after ordering.  (In the past we have waited 30 plus minutes for sushi and the place wasn't even busy).\n\nI just with our server had been a little more attentive and that the hostess\/water girl would have paid attention to my water.
