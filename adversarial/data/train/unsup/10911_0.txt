Out of all the escape rooms we've been to, we enjoyed this the least. They have the most employees in the escape room scene but they're not the friendliest or most helpful. You ask a question and they act like you're bothering them. This place is hot like their A\/C isn't working.\n\nMy friends and I were in the Sherlock room. It was just one door, one room. Not super thrilling\/ stimulating as other escape rooms we've been to. You can hear people screaming from the other room.\n\nThis place was just not for us. The only thing I could say that they do differently is that you sign a waiver and fill out your info using an iPad - yup, that's about it. We're not crazy about this place.
