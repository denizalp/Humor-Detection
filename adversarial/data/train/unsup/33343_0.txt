I was looking for something in the area that I could walk to, so I decided try out Spa Olive! \nVery clean, intimate environment, which was great. \n\nI had booked the massage service. My masseuse was very professional, listening to me to understand areas I wanted her to focus on and also sharing details with me about areas that had tight muscle, etc. \n\nPro Tips:\n- If you're looking for good pricing on your services, this is the place for you \n- If you're looking to book a spa for a special occasion, this isn't the place, you should try other places instead
