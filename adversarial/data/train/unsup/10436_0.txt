I was so excited when I heard we were getting a bigger and better Smith's in the hood. Yes it's big but not better. \nI tried the Starbucks on our first visit, my husband got his tea in minutes but it took forever to get my Frappuccino, and I had to ask them about it because people that ordered after me were getting their orders.\nWe have used the deli multiple times, it takes forever if there is a line or not, the staff have to ask multiple times what I wanted. Once I was told I had to take a number even though I was the only one there. Another time there were many people waiting at the deli but they weren't calling numbers. \nI do like their skillet frozen meal bins, they make for quick, handy meals.\nThe layout is strange, they are often out of products. The nice neighborhood workers I was use to at the Rainbow location are nonexistent here.
