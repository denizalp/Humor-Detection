Reviews of this place have been very hit-or-miss. Well, ours was definitely a \"hit\".\n\nWe were staying at another hotel nearby, and the desk clerk recommended RBG for dinner. We walked in through the back door of the Radisson and ended up sitting in a little bar\/lounge section of the restaurant. It took us a while to realize there was another section (with surprisingly nice furnishings\/ambience) and move there.\n\nThe service was terrific, possibly because we were nearly the only customers there. Our server was friendly and attentive, offering suggestions and refilling drinks.\n\nI had a salmon sandwich on focaccia bread; it was excellent. One companion chewed his way happily through a substantial burger; another enjoyed fish tacos (which were a tad dry but did come with some sort of sauce); and a third enjoyed a salad with well-prepared veggies.\n\nRBG isn't some epicurean nirvana, but for a grill in a hotel in some off-the-beaten-path part of town, it was startlingly good, and we'll certainly return if we're in the area again.
