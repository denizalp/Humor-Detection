I came here because I was in dire need of a massage. I was able to make an appointment online for 2 days later.\n\nI got the 90 min SolEscape Signature Massage with Julia Rowe. I will say, it was one of the best massages I have gotten. Julia was able to get all the kinks out (and 90 minutes was the perfect amount of time). Towards the end of the massage, Julia used hot stones on my upper body\/face and it felt amazing.\n\nEven though I live in Milwaukee, if I get a chance to return here, I will.
