I've been there only for breakfast. They serve you what they call Feta omelet: a secret mixture of, well, feta, eggs, butter and dill. Sounds ramdom, but tastes like no eggs you've ever had before.\n\nYou can also choose to go with the date omelet, or the oriental one. If you order the \"combo\", you'll get a coffee, homemade bread and homemade jam (the waitress will overwhelm you with her rose-carrot-ginger-orange-pistachio-lime - and it goes on...-  list of possible flavors) for about 9$. A deal.Very exotic, all of it served in a beautiful place, all of wood, with windows wide open during the Summer. \n\nThe only downer: the service is kinda slow... It's usually because the owner and her daughter are fighting about something, which is actually worth the wait.\n\nPlus, the neighborhood is great: young and familial, with cheese and bread shops, organic and clothes stores. Everything you think Montreal should be!\n\nKeep your eye out for all the Qu√©bec celebrities hanging out in this joint!! Not that you will necessarily recognize them if you don't live here, but anyhow, they usually wear sunglasses at night. Like our very Corey Hart.
