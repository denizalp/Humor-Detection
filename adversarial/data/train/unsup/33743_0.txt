I had a fantastic experience here with my partner. Being in the dark really heightens your sense of taste and smell and the food was absolutely delicious (and surprisingly healthy). I loved the mystery of trying to guess what each of the courses were. The waiters were so kind and helpful in leading us in and making sure we weren't lost. I would definitely come here again!\n\nP.S. Being in the dark is also a whole new kind of romantic. You'd be surprised how much you depend on sight to communicate with your sigificant other, so just relying on their voice or touch can be fun and interesting.
