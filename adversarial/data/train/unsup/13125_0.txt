Had I written a review after having their Bun Thit Nuong, I would have rated Pho Ngon 4 stars. It was some of the best I have ever had and the portion was huge. \n\nI went back with a Vietnamese friend one evening and found the food average this time.  I opted for the Vietnamese papaya salad and spring rolls with grilled pork. I love Thai papaya salad and found the Vietnamese version quite different. I liked the jerky style beef pieces on the salad but the salad itself was not very flavorful except for being a little spicy. The spring rolls with dipping sauce were bland and the rice paper wrap didn't have the perfect texture. \n\nMy friend ordered a bowl of Pho and said it was not as good as the one from a highly rated Pho place in Chicago suburbs she frequents, not to mention it was almost 30% more expensive than the Pho in Chicago suburbs. $9 for a bowl of pho is pricy. \n\nThey do have several Vietnamese hot pots on the menu which you don't normally see in Vietnamese restaurants. I may give them a try one day.
