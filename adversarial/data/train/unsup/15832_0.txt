This morning I was awoken by a sound.  Not one of those ultimately heartwarming \"Horton Hears a Who\" sounds, but that horrific peeping sound of a smoke detector; that evil sound that will lodge itself into the very sacred crevice of your soul and torment you to the point of madness.  \n\nHaving just had someone change out all the batteries, I concluded that these smoke detectors were actually on life-support, now squawking till their bitter infinite end.  With a day of appointments ahead of me and knowing this was beyond another pic in the \"it sux to be my friend\" photo album, I scoped out handyman on Yelp and called Steve.  \n\nHe was booked, but I described my dilemma (the peeping and dangling wire) and he was able to accommodate me after his scheduled appointments-complete with a whole house full of new smoke detectors.  This alone was impressive!  Actually...VERY IMPRESSIVE!!!\n\nSteve was prompt, in touch via phone & text before he arrived and he really does have a red truck.  He is not one of these Vegas goofballs who (between hits on a crack pipe) decides to go into business for themselves.  This guy owns the red truck and his business, and my problem (which was a bit more complicated than a switch out) was expertly solved complete with explanations.\n\n\nHis prices were very fair, his service and knowledge were exceptional!  I've scheduled him back here for my long list of Honey-Do's!
