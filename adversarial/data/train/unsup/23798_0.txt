Not sure what all the poor reviews are about! This place is exceptionally clean, seats are comfy, no hassles. They just released a new FREE stubs program, which isn't as lucrative as their (now ) $15\/year Stubs rewards program, but for me, it's better than nothing!\n\nBack home in New York, a lot of AMC's have renovated to have reclining seats that you reserve ahead of time, so that's the only thing this theater could use! \n\nOther than that, friendly assistance at the box office and concession stand, new Coke Freestyle machines where you can pick your soda flavors, and stadium style theaters. What more could you want? \n\nPs I'm here for a Saturday matinee, and it's only $5.25.
