My husband and I are regulars to Saigon Kitchen.  The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is clean and modern.  We both love the carmelized salmon - it is absolutely to die for.  You get a generous serving of salmon in a delicious sauce, cooked in a clay pot.  The meal comes with soup, salad, and rice and we always end up bringing some home.  It's unique and a great addition to Surprise!  Try it - you'll love it.
