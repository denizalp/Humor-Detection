Dingy, old and smelly. While I've been swayed to have a dairy treat or two from this establishment, I haven't quite figured Yelp's infatuation with it. Their vanilla soft serve is comparable to that of the Golden Arches but costs twice more. The balding lady behind the counter, who I assume is an owner, is rude. Once, I thought I had caught her nibbling as I walked in but as it turned out she was shamelessly munching on a cone. Also, being a cash only business, they handle money then touch your ice cream.
