I am so ecstatic about my results from Charles. I keep looking in the mirror and admiring the job he did with my lip filler. I had previously had filler that looked OK but my injector and no longer lived in town so I needed to find someone new. I was very hesitant about going to someone new but after reading the reviews on Charles and looking at the pictures I decided to make an appointment. The office is in a cute area of Scottsdale and very modern inside, his staff was sweet and Charles is truly an artist. He made my lips 10 times better than they were before and I feel so confident about them. He is the only injector I will be going to in the future!
