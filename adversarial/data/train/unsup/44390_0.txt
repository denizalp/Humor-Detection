Brilliant Bridal's business model works with me! I appreciate the lower prices they can offer their customers. For brides on a budget, it's worth popping into this salon. I wanted something under $400 and the choices were endless, unlike other salons where I would only be limited to glorified bridesmaids' dresses. Although I was shopping for a more minimalistic gown, they have plenty with the bling, poof, lace and twinkle most look for. \n\nNot only will you find gowns for half the price of normal stores but since it seems they carry discontinued or overstock styles, you can find something unique. This was my case and I'm in love with my dress - vintage, romantic and truly unconventional.
