Best all day breakfast joint I have ever had! Amazing food and quality. I ordered French Toast with strawberries, bananas and walnuts.  i highly recommend tryin it. Montr√©al has the best breakfast resto in da world. I enjoyed every minute of it. Kinda on pricey side but well worth it. I also order a bowl of cafe latte and it was delicious. All said and done the experience was great, the vibe was fun and the service was exceptional. Bon appetit!
