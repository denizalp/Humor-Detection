Its been a while since I last visited RM Seafood.  The only real reason I wanted to come back was for the Moon 'n Doggies.  I had one for an appetizer when I last visited for dinner.  But since then they pulled it from the dinner menu and regulated it to their lunch menu.  I finally decided to come back for a lunch session and was delighted to see the Moon n' Doggies still on the menu.\n\nMoon 'n Doggies --  http:\/\/bit.ly\/1z9g2en\nTwo White Shrimp Stuffed Hot Dogs, Asian Slaw, Cilantro Aioli  \nThese are so good!  It's prepared differently than when I had it last time (http:\/\/bit.ly\/1GyUo7H).  Back then it was served as one single Hot Dog whereas the one they served me for lunch was two thinner Hot Dogs.  No matter, these were still amazing!  And it comes with choice of Fries or Housemade Potato Chips.\n\nKey Lime Pie --  http:\/\/bit.ly\/1v4NPPo\nSwiss Meringue, Cilantro Syrup\nI wasn't expecting much when I ordered it but when it was presented to me I was really impressed!  Very tart and creamy and the crust was good!  I did not regret ordering this one bit.\n\nSo yeah, it was a very nice return to RM Seafood and I would definitely return again in the future.  There's still plenty of other things for me to try on both their lunch and dinner menus.  Maybe I'll even tackle their famous Blind Ice Cream Guessing Game once again!
