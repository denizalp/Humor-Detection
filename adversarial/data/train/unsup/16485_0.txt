I'd love to write a review on the service but I didn't receive any. I'm here in the parking lot writing this review as I'm extremely annoyed. \n\nI showed up 5 min early for my appt. I get to a locked door. Ring the bell 3 times. I knocked a couple times. Been here for 5 after my scheduled appt. Someone has to be here. There are two cars in the parking lot. When I drove in, I asked a lady coming out if it was fine to park where I was as I was a bit confused. She said yes and left. Customer or stylist... Who knows.\n\nI'm only here for a consultation but if the unpreparedness is any indication of the service I would have received... I'll pass.
