Fantastic People work here.  This property is perfect because the strip is right around the corner yet far enough away for some peace and quite.  There is everything you need within walking distance and the Convention Center is 1 block across the street.  I took advantage of the rooftop pool as well.  This will be the Only hotel I will stay at when I am in Vegas it has Everything I need.  Friendly on the ball staff, a great Breakfast with plenty of healthy selections (I Body Build), nice big lobby, Lyft and Uber come within min's and it offers a shuttle service.  See you again soon.
