What's better than chicken and waffles? CHICKEN AND WAFFLES SANDWICH!! I've been wanting to try Bruxie after walking past it while strolling around the strip. There was a poster of their \"Holy Chicken!\" sandwich outside of the restaurant and I was tempted to try it out for my first time. This sandwich consists of the fried chicken (maple glazed), bacon, cheese, Sriracha sauce, with Sunny-Side Up egg along with the waffles. Bruxie does an amazing job making the waffle crispy thin and not too heavy to go along with the chicken. If you're more of a waffle person than a chicken person, I probably wouldn't recommend it because the waffles are crispier and thin rather than fluffy and sweet!\n\nTheir servings are pretty huge but you also get what you paid for as this sandwich was around $13 (YIKES)! I also tried their \"Palmer\" drink and it was perfect since it was not too sweet. \n\nI came around 11:30-ish am and it wasn't that packed but by the time I left, there was a line out the door around 12pm so I would try to go before noon. There are plenty of seats outside and inside but I can definitely see this place getting packed throughout the day when it would be hard to find a seat. \n\nThe process to order and eat is pretty fast and easy. You receive a buzzer while acts like a tracker for the servers to find the table and deliver the food to you! I love this concept because you don't actually have to get up and pick-up your food. \n\nI gave this place a 4\/5 because I felt that this place was a boujee way of incorporating soul food for hipsters to like, it wasn't anything too special that \"wow'd\" me. Overall, I'm a big fan! I definitely will want to come back and try out all their other sandwiches!
