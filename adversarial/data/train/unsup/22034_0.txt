They will steal your money for a consultation and then say they can't represent you. The secretaries are clueless and Unprofessional. Michael is just out for money and doesn't care about helping people. He's really laid back and doesn't seem to have the tenacity for litigation. They also will make you an offer and then if you don't like it they lie saying they're busy and back out. Really disappointing.
