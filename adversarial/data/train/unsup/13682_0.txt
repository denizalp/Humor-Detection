It's a Kohl's....\nI can usually find somethings to wear at reasonable prices. Occasionally I look at their housewares and pick up some dishes or some linen or towels.   \nOn this trip I had $30 in Kohls Cash and a 30% off coupon burning a hole in my purse.  I also needed a new vacuum cleaner (which they carry).  \nI find that you are pretty much on your own at any Kohls I have ever been to, as the Customer Service Reps are usually focused at registers.  Also I have found that baskets here come at a premium.  When looking for ways to get my vacuum cleaner up to the front register I had to suck up my embarassment as I utilized a double kid carrying cart just to use the basket portion to load my vacuum and carry it to the register and later to my car. This cart was like 8' long....\nYou gotta do what ya gotta do....
