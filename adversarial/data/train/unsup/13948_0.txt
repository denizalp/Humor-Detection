Dear John,\n\nSince we couldn't get a table till it became god awfully late, we decided to sit at the bar and have our meal and it was our great misfortune to have landed you as our bartender\/waiter. I know you are a bartender and your job is to get us drinks primarily but not filling a water glass for our entire dinner when you're at the bar might be a cardinal sin in your line of work. You didn't offer us a dessert menu, didn't take our order, watched through the corner of your eye as we waited for some kind of attention and just generally decided we were not worth your bartender's time of day. John, you are not only an awful bartender but might also be quite a terrible person. \n\nWe ordered from the vegetarian\/vegan menu. For starters we had a tomato based soup with zucchini and basil. Probably the only good item for the night. It was really more of a reduction and not a soup but the point is, it tastes good. My starter was the Cocotte Parmigianno Reggiano. A custard made with strong Parmesan flavors and topped with mushrooms and brussel sprout leaves. An intriguing presentation but since I left more than half of the thimble-sized portion I'm going to go with advising you not to order this. \n\nFor our mains we got 2 half portions of risotto. The whipped vegetable risotto was not all that bad but I have nothing resounding to add about it. The other risotto that comprised peas, asparagus and herbs was an assault to every taste bud I had. One bite and I was done. Forever. \n\nSince John, you did not bother to get us a dessert menu or take our order, we were kind of put off and skipped dessert. \n\n1 star goes to your \"assistant\" bartender Gustavo, who tried very hard to make up for your ineptness. 1 star goes to the fact that you offer 1\/2 portions on the vegan\/veg menu for all the pasta offerings. \n\nThe abhorrent service and disastrous food sealed this place as a \"No-go\" on my Vegas Italian list. With Sinatra a few yards away, it's absolutely pointless to even step into this travesty known as Bartollota.\n\nFurthermore, on our way back to the Encore parking lot, my eyes were assailed by the lines of people with copious amounts of hair gel and the tightest, most uncomfortable outfits ever known to mankind trying to make their way into their mecca known as Xcess.\n\nIf anyone wants Italian here, please make your way to Sinatra and steer miles away from this joint. \n\nSincerely\nSang.
