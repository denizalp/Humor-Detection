I decided to check out unPhogettable for the first bowl of pho that I'd be enjoying in AZ. Tasty broth, chewy tendons, generous meat, and as many bean sprouts, fresh basil, and fresh limes that you can stuff and squeeze into your bowl! Solid bet for a big, tasty, filling bowl of pho at a reasonable price ($8\/9). Convenient location, connected to an Asian grocery store so you can walk on over and stock up on seaweed, longan and strawberry Pocky after finishing your pho.
