I feel like a salmon going against the current with my 3 stars review of CRAFTkitchen. I've made 2 visits here around lunch time in the past 30 days. The food is a funky mix of items that you may not find at other more traditional breakfast places. The food was hot, fresh, colorful, flavorful, and filling. Why the middle of the road rating?? The service and the seating are not something I want to experience on a regular basis. Wait staff seemed overwhelmed and rushed. It was like they were trying to be patient and engage with the customers but they just didn't have the time. \nThe seating is very tightly packed together and when you get that place full it was so hard to hear that I had to raise my voice to be heard by my friend across the table. Then the front entrance was blocked by the people waiting to be seated- not sure how code enforcement would feel about that. It just gave me like an anxious\/rushed feeling while I was eating. There are tables outside if you want to brave the elements but I would be afraid that service is even slower if you eat outside. \nSad to say the cramped style of eating is not my cup of tea so I will let all the 4 and 5 star reviewers eat there while I dine elsewhere.
