\"Fishies, Lizards, and Snakes, Oh My!\"\n\nA cool little pet store popped up in our area, so we decided to take a peek and see what they had. Run by a gentleman and a woman, their knowledge of fish and reptiles is very abundant(the woman had a collection of 150 snakes! She now has 50) so if you have any questions at all about investing in one of these cool critters about things like feeding and maintenance, they will be more than happy to set you up for ownership. \n\nAside from snakes, turtles,  and lizards, they have a great assortment of beautiful saltwater and fresh water fish. Having raised Jackson Chameleons back home in Hawaii, their different species of Chameleons up front are one of my favorite sections.  Don't forget to take a look at the huge beautiful Panther Chameleon on the counter - he's not for sale,  but is the store's mascot!\n\nIf you're in the area,  it's a great place to take the kids for an up close look at these cool creatures. ALOHA!!!\n\nShaka Meter: \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  4\n\nReturn Factor: 100%
