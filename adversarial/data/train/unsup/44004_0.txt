I really like this place!  Loved the green chile burger.  My daughter got a patty melt that she enjoyed and my son got chicken fingers, he liked. They actually forgot to put the chicken fingers in the bag and luckily didn't get too far to go back bit when i returned they apologized sincerely,  upgraded the order (no extra charge) and gave us a free pint of chocolate custard!  They made it right and we were all happy! Definitely will be back !
