Skip the appetizers and go straight for the tacos! We all ordered different variations of the steak tacos and they were amazing! The ingredients are fresh and there are so many topping options that it took us some time to decide. The guacamole, cheese dip, as well as rice and bean sides were all average. Good, but nothing we haven't had elsewhere. The beer selection is extensive. Too bad they don't offer a beer flight because we would have liked to try several but once we finally chose one, we really enjoyed it! The waitstaff is attentive and the restaurant has a great atmosphere. If you're in downtown Cleveland, the Barrio is a great option!
