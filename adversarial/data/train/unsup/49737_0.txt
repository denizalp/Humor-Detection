If at all possible DO NOT go here. The worst care I have received in my 50 years. Nobody is happy to be working there. The Doctor I saw was friendly but totally unconcerned with the pain I was in. (ankle\/foot issue) I decided to end any care I was receiving there and went into my online acct to cancel an appt. with them only to find this note. \nPulse: 125 (Regular) \nBP: 142\/105 (Sitting, Left Arm, Standard)  Abnormal vital signs have been discussed with the patient. Patient has been advised to see PCP asap. Patient aware that they are at high risk for heart attack and\/or stroke. Patient given note for PCP.\nI was never informed or given any of this information. The nurse that gives you your follow up appt. is rude and seems to hate her job and apparently the patients too. Other wise she would have share this information. Tried the Patient Advocate but no apology from her on the lack of care or concern.
