These are some tasty pizzas.\nWoodfire goodness, good flavourful crust, saucy sauce, delicious cheesy things, etcetera. \nFor reference: We had the margherita & saccense, yes I like anchovies..deal with it. \n\nOn top of the food goodness the d√©cor is also extremely cool (I want that gigantic cast-iron chandelier-y thing).\n\nThe 80's music that played all evening kind of irked the hubster, but he just doesn't appreciate the awesomeness that is keytar and saxophone, I enjoyed it. \n\nSo far the best pizza I've found in Montreal...But that doesn't stop me from looking for even better, back I will be however even if it's just to stare at my new favourite chandelier and sing along to Kayleigh.
