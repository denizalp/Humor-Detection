Run!  Don't use that Groupon!  This place is creepy and dirty. The stylist are either 80 years old or have neck tattoos. The hair dye is like water and the blow outs are horrible. Everyone looks miserable and the facility looks like no one cares about its appearance. Empty waters bottles, crap on the walls, dirty fake flowers, dusty shelves, ugly work stations.  I can't figure out how they make their rent every month cause I can't imagine anyone goes to this place more than once.
