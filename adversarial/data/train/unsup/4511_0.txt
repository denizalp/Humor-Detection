I heard a lot of good things from friends about The street Eatery and thought I should try it out too.\n\nMy fiance, lil brother, and I went there on a Friday and we were the only ones there. We ordered bibimbap, korean chicken,  one of their burgers, and a KFC chicken bowl. The orders came in quickly and the servings were large. \n\nThe food was okay. The bibimbap didn't taste remotely what a dolsot bibimbap should even though it was in a stone bowl. The korean chicken and KFC chicken bowl was super salty! And the burger my fiance ordered was just mediocre. \n\nWe might come back to try the milkshakes, but not in a rush to come back at all.\n\nOverall, we were super disappointed with our food and would probably only recommend The Street Eatery for their milkshakes - since you can't really mess up a milkshake.
