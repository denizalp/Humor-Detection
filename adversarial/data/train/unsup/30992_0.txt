A great local Hakka\/Thai option with great value!  \n\nWe've tried this place multiple times because of its convenient location and I'll admit they have their hits and their misses depending on what dish you order... but since we've found our favourites we are definitely repeat customers.  They are also very accomodating with varying the level of spice in their dishes to your taste.  Please note - my husband still prefers Federicks though.  \n\nHITS - pakoras, chili chicken, shrimp in lobster sauce, mango salad, deep fried squid, basil chicken, singapore noodles, hakka chow mein\n\nMISSES -  any beef dishes (tried multiple but none ever tasted right), lemon chicken (sauce tasted like very artificial)
