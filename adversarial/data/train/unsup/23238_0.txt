Amazing outlet! I was not excited to come to woodbridge for this, just because I went to the nike employee store & the stuff + prices were absolute garbage. This was a trek out, even for a markham girl but it was totally worth.\n\n50% off pretty much everything?!!? The prices on the merchandise were all around retail price and 50% off that is pretty damn good. There are the basic bitch adidas soccer pants for $25-30 (tag says $50-60)!! There's also a whole section on reebok stuffs and a crossfit section, which is awesome. The star of the show though, goes to the shoe section, which I pretty much bulldozed to as soon as I was permitted entry. My friend bought limited edition superstars (the basic bitch shoe that everyone and their mother has) for $50. WHAT? The tag said $100 so half off.. oh my geeerd. They sell for literally $130+ in browns. I bought ballerina primeknit golf shoes (originally $140 on tag, therefore $80) and the amazing zenopeltis reflective 'snake' shoes for $50..... YES. $50. Check the adidas website - they're $140. KAY I'M DONE. *drops mic*\n\nTwo pairs of amazing shoes for dirt cheap.. can somebody please send me another invite next time?
