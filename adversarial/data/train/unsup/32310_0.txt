If I could leave less stars I would. \n\nWe came in with a large group, we check out different restaurants around the city a couple times per month. \n\nOur server was lovely, great attitude, and she worked her butt off for us..but 20 or so people as well as having other tables would overwhelm anyone...I give her kudos for her effort though!\n\nIt would have been nice if the manager (redhead, beard, glasses) either, A got off his phone, B stopped just leaning on the bar, or C maybe helped the staff get their food out instead of sitting in the booth behind us doing nothing. \n\nI ordered the jambalaya and for an almost 20 dollar dish, I received a plate of penne pasta in tomato sauce with 3 shrimp, 3 chunks of sausage and 4 hunks of peppers. It was watery and it didn't include any garlic toast to soak up the juices. Disappointing to say the least. \n\nI can't say I would vote for us to return. At very least I would think the manager would have gotten off his phone or left his friends in the booth behind us, for five minutes to see if the group bringing in well over 1000.00 was enjoying our experience.
