I found my favorite fast-food taqueria since arriving in the Valley.  It's Rivas Mexican Food.  Talk about an AWESOME-tasting enchilada plate.\n\nThey've got a menu similar to whateveri-berto's, but with a fresher, more kickin' flavor.  Kind of like if your Nana ran a drive-thru.  If you eat in, sometimes the TV is a little loud, but once you start eating, you won't care.\n\nGo.  You will like it.  Nuff said.
