Wife and I had dinner here and then lunch on the day we were to fly back home.  Dinner was wonderful.  We made a reservation and they were running a little behind, about 15 minutes.  They offered to take my cell # and call me when our table was ready.  It was ready right at about the 15 minute mark.  We received bread and water almost immediately after we were seated.  Kimmie, out waitress came over and introduced herself and took our drink orders.\n\nI cannot say enough about Kimmie.  The restaurant was very busy and Kimmie was a dynamo in action, but she took the time to answer all our questions about the menu and keep our drinks full throughout our meal.\n\nWe started with the bruschetta and it was delicious.  My had the spinach, pear and bacon salad and the chicken piccata .  I had the tomato basil soup and the veal kickerello.  The soup was outstanding.  Creamy with a ton of tomato flavor.  The veal was tender with a touch of lemon served with fettucine alfredo.  The salad was good, my wife didn't care for the balsamic dressing, but Kimmie was happy to replace it with the house Italian.  The chicken piccata was very good as well.  It came with angel hair pasta and sauteed asparagus.  The asparagus was a little tough, but tasty.  I don't remember what is was called, but we had the angel food cake with strawberries.  It looks impressive and tasted out of this world.  I nice finish to a great meal.  \n\nThe tomato soup was so good we had to come back and try it again along with one of their pizzas for lunch.  We split a pizza and a meatball panini and both had a cup of the tomato basil soup.  The soup again was great.  The pizza was thin crust and crisp on the edges, but just slightly not as crisp as I would like in the middle.  The meatballs were tasty, but I would skip the panini next time as it was just OK.  Service again was outstanding.  I wish we had a location of the Grotto near us as we would be regulars.
