Top golf was a blast! I would definitely recommend going with a group of 4-6, because it costs $40-45 per hour, per pod. You can have up to 6 people per pod. I went with 3 other people and we had a great time. The staff there was really nice and friendly and very accommodating. The food and drinks were great. The atmosphere was awesome too, I mean it can't get better being at a driving range where everyone is drinking and having a good time. The bucket specials are pretty sweet (spent $20 for 6 leinenkugel sunset   wheat). If you go with a group it's easy to split the cost of things. Top gold offers various game options at the driving range that keep players amused. Overall I had a blast here and definitely would recommend this place to friends trying to do something different on the weekend or even during the week.
