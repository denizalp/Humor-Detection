Definitely a casino for locals. Definitely a great place to meet up with friends and have a good time. Definitely a fun place for the kiddos. Definitely my favorite casino around town! The movie theater, bowling alley, restaurants, even the hotel rooms are spacious and very modern. Occasionally you can find great room rates from Groupon. Or check their website for package deals, always the worth the money. Parking used to be sort of a pain but they've opened up more spaces recently...thank you!! All around it's just a cool casino. I love the low-key but upbeat vibe.
