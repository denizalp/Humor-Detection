If you go to a party and are given a card that gives you free guac for three months, you are going to return... a lot. El Patio, you are marketing geniuses. You got me!\n\nI love this space. It's like a little secret hidden amongst the skyscrapers, and it happens to be fueled by tequila and a delicious taco truck. What's not to love? \n\nFull disclosure: I planned an event with these folks, but I've also been twice as a paying customer, and I really wanted to share my authentic, fab experiences.
