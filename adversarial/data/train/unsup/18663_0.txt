Walking in here is like entering the enchanted forest of the sewing world! \n\nThere are all sorts of flowers, and jewels, and I don't even know what, adorning the walls of their showroom. Its almost mesmerizing.\n\nIts hidden away in the commercial area right behind Smashburger. This is a wholesale business but they are open to the public. You can buy in large quantities like entire rolls of lining and various sundries that you use in sewing or just pick up one of the trinkets on the wall if that suits your fancy.\n\nThe staff were very friendly and quick to put together my order. They weren't busy when I came in so they had three people helping me to get me out super fast. Great customer service.
