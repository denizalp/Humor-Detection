What a huge disappointment!  We were looking forward to this restaurant as it recently opened in Chandler.   Unfortunately, the food was just awful.  I had the Chicken Pot Pie, which barely had any chicken in it.  Immediately, upon eating it, my stomach began to hurt and I went to use the facilities at the restaurant. \n\nWell, Big Bear Diner, you can't run a restaurant when the one and only toliet you have in the mens room is broken.   The employee in the bathroom didn't seem too concerned that the one toliet was broken.\n\nWe left the restaurant right away. Not a great start!
