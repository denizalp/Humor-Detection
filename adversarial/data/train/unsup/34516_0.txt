I couldn't be happier with this company.  I have a piece of crap builder installed shower enclosure that over the last 10 years has fallen apart due to its cheap pieced together nature. I called CCVG to rebuild and reseal it all up. Initially, my experience wasn't so wonderful as the first crew that came to do the work didn't really perform the scope of work that it took to make the shower door right. After contacting the company back to express my dissatisfaction, the owner Brandon was immediately alerted and personally saw to it that the job was completed toi the end. In fact, he personally did the work with a helper. The shower door works perfectly and everything lines up and its absolutely better than I expected. \n\nMy point is this... not all companies nail it right out of the gates but if you have a company and a business owner thats willing to do whats necessary to perform the job and make it right, no matter what.. thats a company you WANT to do business with every time. Period. \n\nThanks Brandon and thanks CCVG for the excellent work.
