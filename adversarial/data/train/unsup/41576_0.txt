In a word: wow! I  consider myself a bit of a foodie and thought i knew of many of the great places in Phoenix, but I was really blown away this evening! I had a celebratory dinner to organize for a work gig with late notice, and this place was mentioned by a coworker. We made a reservation and were unfortunately late, but they called to make sure they should hold the table. We were greeted warmly (although an hour late!) The chef\/co-owner greeted us and seated us, and told us about the menu. We ordered wine that was very reasonably priced, and amazing dishes including osso bucco, lamb, pork and filet mignon. The seasonings, sauces and sides were amazing and very creative and well thought. The service was wonderful and the chef and staff attentive and entertaining.\n\nThe dessert (my soft spot) was amazing! They offer a limited list of the most incredible things! The two we tried were a chocolate chili 'soup' with a puff pasty and strawberries which was incredible (and I had to take the remaining little bit home!) and the chocolate flourless cake was excellent. \n\nIt's a small place with nice touches on a quiet part of Roosevelt, and was a really lovely surprise. I'm already planning my return trip!
