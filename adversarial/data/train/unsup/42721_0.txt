Absolute perfection ... charming, small store on Davidson's historic Main Street. The manager is almost always there and the service is great. Goes without saying that the ice cream and sundaes are delicious ... plus you've got Summit Coffee, Main St. Books, Village Store and Sanctuary Gallery -- all within walking distance. Love it!
