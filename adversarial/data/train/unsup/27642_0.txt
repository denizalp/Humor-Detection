A little too bright inside, but I understand why--it's close to Sun City and the bulk majority of clientele is over 60.  Maybe the above-table\/booth lighting could be kept bright, but the room lighting can be more dim?  Alas, perhaps someone tripped and fell a long time ago, again because of clientele over 60, so adequate lighting is essential.\n\nHonestly, I think that's my biggest gripe with the place.\n\nThe food and presentation is very good.  Oh wait...now that I mention it, here's another: if spice level is requested to be medium, then that would mean somewhat spicy, right?  Maybe not.  In my case, it was zero spice level.  It could have been a fluke.  It was still good though.\n\nServers and water-filler-dude were all friendly and very attentive.\n\nThe wife and I have been here a couple times, and we will continue to frequent the establishment for years to come.
