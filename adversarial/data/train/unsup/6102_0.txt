Tequila and I have had a long love affair.  Ever since I lived in Mexico, I've had a soft spot for delicious Mezcal and Tequila. I don't know how it took me so long to actually go here, but it was a really lovely atmosphere, with a great jazz band that played and REAL Mexican SANGRITA!! Ayyyy Dios mio! There were even tiny chunks of jalapeno in the sangrita - I wept a little. Maybe from the heat, maybe from joy. Either way, it was a great time.\n\ni was a little surprised to see that the chips and dip were quite literally chips with dip, but I think that speaks to the pull-no-punches quality of Reposado's menu and also my starry, tequila filled eyes.\n\ni will be back. Oh jess, I will!
