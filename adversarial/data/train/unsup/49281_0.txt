Disclaimer - can a vegetarian really appreciate a Greek restaurant?  Methinks not, but this one tried.\n\nI popped in here with my mum this week for lunch.  The Decor? Pure cheese but I was fine with that.  It was a little tricky to order for myself being a vegetarian, altho my mum wasn't terribly impressed either.\n\nService was attentive.  The appetizers we had were pretty good - Hummus with toasted pita, and the flaming cheese.  They each get a star :)\n\nMy mum had a lunch special of the calamari, fries and salad.  All three were fine, but absolutely nothing to write home about.  The calamari was a bit chewy for my tastes.  The fries tasted a bit ..... calamari-ish as well.\n\nI had the salad (a version of Greek without the lettuce) and here is where major pointage was lost.  There was about half an inch of oil poured over the whole thing, and so for every bite I had to lift my vegetable out of the bowl, and wait for the oil to slide off.  To make matters worse, I also had to salt the tomatoes since slathering them in low quality EVOO doesn't really add to them.  The salad was gross. Seriously.\n\nOther people around me who had the souvlaki plates looked like they were enjoying them, so I wouldn't rule this place out - but I personally will not come back here because even the salad was too oily for me!
