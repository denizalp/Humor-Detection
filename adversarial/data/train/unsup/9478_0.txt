Four words, my friends: F**K YOU, CRISS ANGEL!!!!!!\n\nWe passed up the Justin Timberlake and Friends concert in lieu of this excuse for \"entertainment\".  Furthermore, I was subjected to an overpriced Nathan's Hot Dog dinner because we were in a rush to make the show.  BASTARD!!!\n\nCriss is a horrible actor, his 5 tricks were predictable, and he couldn't sing.  He even attempted to dance!!  If I had them, I would have kicked my own balls at that point...it would have been a lot less painful.\n\nDont expect to be impressed with anything other than the beautiful set and costumes.  Days later, we were still trying to figure out what the f**k his vision was AND how any Luxor executives could allow this production to go on.  Also, don't expect Criss to NOT stroke his ego, since the whole show is a supposed look into the mind of the \"master\" illusionist.\n\nAt our show, Criss mentioned the president of the Luxor was in attendance.  Holy crap...if you have any brains, Mr. Executive, you will stop this mess before it tanks.\n\nOur exit poll revealed no one was entertained or impressed...and more often than not, people wanted their money back.  In fact, we witnessed several people leaving in the middle of the show.  I only wish I had been one of them....\n\nWhile waiting for the valet afterwards, my boyfriend levitated a la David Blaine and delighted a passerby who, to this day, is probably more impressed by that 10-second illusion than anyone in the Believe audience.\n\nOne star ONLY because I couldn't give it 0 stars.
