I stayed at this establishment and have to admit I was impressed at all levels. Let's be real, this is a vacation resort not a 4 diamond hotel. I came down with the family while I attended a convention and the lids absolutely loved the heated pools. Btw for all you Starbucks lovers, they have one at this place. Also, the shuttle service was convenient. It p\/u at the WM and drops off at the Monte Carlo. I used it many times while in Vegas and had no reason to drive myself anywhere. The staff has been great so far and responsive when I asked for additional towels. I stayed in a 2 br and enjoyed our stay.
