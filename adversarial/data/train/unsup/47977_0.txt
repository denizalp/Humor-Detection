This was by far the worst \"detail\" I have ever gotten.  If you can even call it a detail.  The car actually looks worse than when I brought it in.  I came in for a wash and was going to do the wax and leather clean myself.  I allowed myself to be upsold because of the \"discounts\" the wash attendant offered me and the fact that it's well over 100* outside.  When I came out to see the car after it was \"finished\" I noticed extra baked on wax all over the place, bugs had been left on the front of the car and just waxed over, and it looked like no one had even touched the leather seats or door trim.\n\nI asked for a refund for the leather portion of the \"detail\" but the manager told me that they couldn't refund any money since they already performed the service.  I asked them to do a more thorough job and re-do the wax and leather clean.  Unfortunately when I came back out, the interior was still a mess. There was greasy cleaning residue everywhere, yellow fluff from the bright microfiber towels they use, and the leather seats were still not clean!  In the end I just left after being told they are a car wash and not a \"restoration\" place.  Unfortunately they are clearly not a detailer either.  To make matters even worse, I found out that they don't pay their staff minimum wage and they are forced to survive on $5.25\/hr plus tips.  Who wants to tip on service like that?  How do you tip the people who actually did a good job?\n\nI will not be back and will be letting all of my car enthusiast friends to stay away as well.
