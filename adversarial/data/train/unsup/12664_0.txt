Last weekend I was extremely tired and in search of green smoothie, this place came up on Yelp search. When I walked in I smelled nice fresh greens, then I realized I haven't eaten anything on that day.\n\nTheir menu is extensive, I took time to study each dishes to see what sounds good for my body. I ended up picking Gangnam city, for some reasons, red meat along with all the veggies listed on the menu sounded good.\n\nSalad was very tasty, I thought I wasn't hungry but I ended up eating more than half. Normally portion size would have been perfect but I was suffering from lack of sleep and extreme fatigue. \n\nSalad and steak (protein) gave me just enough energy to get through my day, my body felt much better after eating something good for my body.\n\nI would love to come back now I recovered from jet lag to enjoy their food and green juice.
