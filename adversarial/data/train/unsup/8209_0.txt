Why come here? To park. And to roam around. This location is good to park at because there is always ample parking and it's in the middle of downtown. You can walk to wherever you need to go from here. It's better than parking on the streets because you never know how people are when they're walking around. It's located on 4th street going north. The entrance is quite hidden and you just see one little sign. You can miss it if you're not paying attention. I also like that when you go upstairs to the main area there's many places for you to eat and check out what downtown Las Vegas is about.
