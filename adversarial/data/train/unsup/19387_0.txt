Best brunch in town they say. I don't want to say it's the BEST but it is definitely up there on my list of top brunches. \n\nThey have different types of brunch packages. There is an Al Carte menu which is just for the bar. We got All you can eat brunch which was about $59. This included 4-5 different stations of foods and also you can order as much as you want on the al carte menu. At first we were just going to do the Al Carte menu but decided with the price ranges of the Al Carte menu it would probably be more beneficial if we decided to do the all you can eat. That was a great idea. \n\nAnd than there are few different drink packages. We got one that was about $35 and it consisted of all you can drink mimosas, Bellini, and bloody Marys. The other drink packages had premium alcohol and\/or champagne on it for higher price.\n\nThe different food stations: we had a seafood station that had oysters, crab legs, shrimp, and poke. All delicious and we visited this station the most. They had a dessert station, a fresh salad station, they had a juice station, and a station where they had bagels, steak and salmon. All really good.\n\nFrom the Al Carte menu we ordered Loco Moco and Fish tacos. Both were soooo delicious. From the juice station they had this bomb juice that had berries, pomegranate, Red Bull and vodka! wow that was so good we had 3 of them. It was safe to say that we left that place in a good mood! \n\nThe staff was very attentive. Always coming to check on us, never had an empty glass. \n\nGreat brunch. Highly recommend
