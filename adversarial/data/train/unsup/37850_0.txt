Had lunch here today and had the best Orange Chicken I have ever had. It was crispy and perfectly seasoned! Orange chicken, rice and an egg roll was $6.95! I don't typically go here - it's a little out of my way but today reminded me to go back! Service was great!\n\nTaipea South is located in the Food Lion strip shopping center behind Burger King and across the street from Lowes (Johnson Road near Highway 51).
