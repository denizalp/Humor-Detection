I would give zero stars if I could. My experience with them was not good. I had an agreement drafted up at another law office but due to privacy concerns I decided to go elsewhere. I met with a lawyer from Soby Boyden Lenz and gave him the copy of the agreement. All he really needed to do was to go through that agreement, make whatever minor changes he though would be necessary and then get me to sign it. The initial consultation was in January 2014. It is now April 2014 and I'm still waiting to sign the agreement. Throughout Jan\/Feb\/March, I was sent numerous drafts of the agreement to go review. Each time, the agreement was filled with errors. Simple errors such as having the incorrect name in certain paragraphs, incorrect references, and even TYPOS! Each time I pointed out the error, he would charge me for \"modifications\". Um, sorry, buddy, those are corrections for mistakes you should not have made in the first place. In the end, between all the \"modifications\" I had requested, him actually charging me for his time to read the emails I sent making corrections (one mistake was pointed out twice to him so I got charged TWICE for his carelessness), the bill was nearly double the previous law office for poorer quality work. Do not recommend!  No attention to detail, outrageously expensive for what they do, and does not deliver in a timely manner. Big fail.
