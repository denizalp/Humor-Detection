Casey Jones is an Amazing Local Bar. I absolutely love the community presented and apparent here. The owners, servers, and especially the skilled chefs, draw me and my best friends here. Mike the bar tender and Armando the skilled culinary adventurer top this place off with a cherry on the Sundae...Chris the bar tender always offers a beautiful smile and friendly welcome. I enjoy the music freedom of selection. If you're here too late and don't agree with the patrons choice of music, I suggest you come back during lunch. Caseys's seems to promote the patrons experience and accommodate each genre. Including many fun options throughout the week to include each patrons interest. This place is FAMILY.
