Bingsu here was fantastic, very authentic flavours that are similar to some of the Bingsu I've had in South Korea. I usually get the Original Bingsu with Soy Bean Powder and Red bean. It's a light, sweet and slightly roasted dessert. My next favourite would be the Mango one if my sweet tooth is feeling extra decadent! The store is also very beautifully decorated, perfect for Instagram photos. At my last visit, a group of girls no older than 18 asked if they could take a photo using the wall behind me, haha! This is a trendy spot for all ages.
