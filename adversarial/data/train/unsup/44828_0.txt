If you see this show and at no point you find yourself filled with child-like wonder, you have no soul. This was incredible. You know how people say things are awesome and they really aren't awesome, it's just people overusing the word 'awesome?' This show is ACTUALLY full on awesome. It takes the human experience we all share of those weird dreams that make no sense and then taps into it to make it a shared and live experience for everyone. They somehow manage to bend reality and not in a half-assed kind of way. It's reality bent and twisted into a surreal experience capturing the essence of every Beatles song played. This was my first Cirque show and I hope they are all this fantastic.
