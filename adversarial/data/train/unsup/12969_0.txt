Why is this place not shut down yet and made room for a better restaurant. The drink and food are comparable to the Roberto's. We waited  for a seat this evening to see if it is worth it. While waiting in line to be seated while what appeared to a creepy manger\/owner was hugging and kissing the group. He was a disgusting creep and when I inquired if he treated all of his guest this way, his gross smile reappeared and he said \"no just special ones\" so you nasty gringos stay away basically. You don't matter. Thank god for many amazing restaurants in the vicinity that will drive this dirt bag out of business. STAY AWAY
