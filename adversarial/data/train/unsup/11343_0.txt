It's always exciting to sneak out of the office for 15 minutes to stop by this Starbucks and grab a hot chocolate in the winter or an iced coffee in the summer.  If I worked independently I'd love to come here with my laptop and say things like \"indubitably\" while wearing trendy glasses that don't actually help me to see better.  Additionally, the staff is always very attentive and friendly.
