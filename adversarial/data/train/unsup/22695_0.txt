Drunken Debauchery occurring all day long in Las Vegas, Why not? How can something so wrong feel so right?? \n\nGod I love Moorea. I walk right in, skipping the line and I feel right at home. Hello Pool, hello cabana, hello bottle service, hello girls with out their tops on. I like the looks of this. I like the looks of this a lot. \n\nNot hard to fall in love with Moorea especially if Rehab is not your scene. Moorea is a smaller version of rehab, minus the dirty brown pool that I wouldn't set a foot in. I actually got in the pool at Moorea and swam around, wait I take that back, walked around, I didn't \"swim\" technically. Such a great crowd here, everyone is laid back and chill and looking to avoid the whole 5 hour wait, $100 cover, to get into Rehab only to chill with a bunch of meat heads and go go dancers. \n\nThe best part about Moorea, had to be the Cabana beds. I loved them. Great bottle service. We danced everywhere in there. Took shots from everyone. Didn't have to wait long at the bar or bathroom which is a huge plus. I would definitely go back again! \n\nPS. You can take your top of here too ladies!! No shame in that! Don't worry about which of my friends and I did or didn't join in the fun.
