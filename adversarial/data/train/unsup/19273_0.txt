A little bit more local than the big box pet stores, I think. This shop has very well stocked shelves with a great variety of stuff for dogs, cats, fish, birds and \"other small animals.\" I was impressed by seeing three half aisles of dog treats, which had a very nice selection of rawhides, not rawhides and all kids of other things to give your canine to chew on that will keep them occupied. Prices were pretty solid.\n\nSomething I've not seen before? Bulk dog biscuits. Mix and match, fill the bag and pay by weight. Neat!\n\nFriendly faces working the register.
