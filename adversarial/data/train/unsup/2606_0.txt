Like the other reviewers, I have had to wait well over an hour for an oil change--even with an appointment.  Any reviewer who says these guys are honest has an ulterior motive.  I bought a 3 oil change for the price of one deal on living social, and this place was the only place open on weekends.  The very first time I went in, they told me my wheels had to be balanced.  I asked how much, they said $7 total.  When I left, they charged $7 per tire.  Ended up paying more than if I'd paid for the oil change.\n\nThe last time (and it will be the last time ever), they recommended a list of repairs as long as my arm, INCLUDING the easily verified \"your radiator only has water in it and needs to be flushed.\"  All amounting to nearly $1000.  I took it to my normal mechanic to check out the list.  NOT ONE THING ON THE LIST NEEDED DOING.  The only thing that needed attention was a fraying serpentine belt which cost less than $200.\n\nIf you must go here for oil or tires, that's fine.  But be prepared for a wait.  And DON'T LET THEM ANYWHERE NEAR YOUR ENGINE.
