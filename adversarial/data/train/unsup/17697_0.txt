#500\n\nMy wife and I celebrated our 4th wedding anniversary here.  What a dining experience it was!  \n\nThe complimentary gold MGM limo picking us up right in front of our place was sweet.  You must do this!  We were met by a beautiful hostess straight out of a James Bond film as we rolled up to the Mansion.  An amazing place to check out.  I guess this is what playing $25k a hand in blackjack gets you.  \n\nWe had all intentions of getting the 16 course dinner but realized there was no chance whatsoever of my very petite sized wife having even a hail mary's shot at finishing.  She might've reached course 10 at best.  \n\nNo problem!  Let's just fill up on champagne and do four courses.\n\nThere are so many extremely detailed reviews for this restaurant.  Read all of them!  I'm only going to do notes and observations:\n\n- Is it possible to be too fancy?  This comes close. I love fine dining as much as the next fat Asian with glasses but the word \"stuffy\" came to mind.  Maybe my suit was too tight.  \n\n- The man, the myth, the legend was there.  Right before our appetizers (ah-hem! Une Entree) came out I heard a \"Bon Soir!\" from behind me and there he was in the flesh!  Joel Robuchon!!  He shook our hands.  Joel stops by the restaurant 4 times a year according to the staff and he said we were lucky to see him.  I should've asked Mr. Robuchon to sign one of the rolls from the ridiculously amazing bread cart.\n\n- The lobster salad with fruit was orgasmic.  \n\n- Whoever invented foie gras should go down in history as one of the greatest people ever.\n\n- Veal cheek kind of tasted like if a chicken thigh had sex with filet mignon.  I savored every little bite.  I believe the neighboring table shot me a look after I said this out loud to my wife.  Whatever.  More champagne please!!\n\n- They served us an extra dessert to celebrate the occasion.  It was the white and yellow meringue fruit pie cake I took a picture of.  I forgot what they said it was called. Blame it on the ah ah-ah-ah-ah ah-alcohol.  Tremendous stuff!  We ordered 2 more dessert dishes and THEN the dessert cart came out.  Wow!!\n\n3 hours later we were stuffed and ready for the limo to take us back.  A fantastic gourmet experience I would recommend to anyone.
