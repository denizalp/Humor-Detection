Visited over the weekend for dinner. To start I ordered a Moscow mule (homemade gingerbeer with vodka) it was very refreshing and nicely garnished with a ginger candy.  Main dish was the beef shank shepherd's pie which was served with a biscuit.  It was a generous portion.  The beef was tender and the vegetables in the dish (corn, peas) still had bite to them and were not overcooked at all.  I got about half way through before I was too full to finish.  Ordered the BBQ kettle chips as a side--they were nice but a tad over cooked.  A fellow diner had fried chicken which I did sample--it was excellent nicely seasoned not too salty--and the portion size was huge more than enough for two people to share.  WBK is definitely a nice addition to the area.  I will be back.
