It's been a bit over a year since I last visited Baton Rouge. Previously I didn't know what Yelp was (don't kill me!) so I couldn't express my disappointment...but now I can! I still remember that night as if it was today.\n\nI dined here with a few of my friends for my 21st birthday (I'm 22 now). I chose this place for one reason, to try their prime rib. When the server came to take our order she told us that they weren't serving prime rib because they ran out. I was soooo disappointed, you have no idea. Instead, I ordered their seafood linguini because my sister raves about it...even right now as I am writing this haha.\n\nThe scallops and shrimps were ginormous (which I don't mind at all...I love seafood!). However, as I bit into the scallop it was freezing cold and still raw. I thought that maybe it was supposed to be like that so I swallowed it, huge mistake! I got my friend to try it out and he told me that it was raw. I called the manager over and he brought me back a new plate...this time it was fully cooked. At this point I was already upset...first, the prime rib and now the raw scallops. He didn't charge me for my meal (obviously) but I barely touched it because my appetite was ruined. My stomach started to feel uneasy by the end of dinner so I ran to the washroom to throw up.\n\nLet's just say that dinner was a disaster and I am definitely never returning.
