Being from Hawaii, I have a high standard for korean plate lunches.  Normally places on the continental U.S. can't even compare to the local food we have in Hawaii.  It's very weird to have a mix of korean and japanese food in the same restaurant.  No one does that in Hawaii.\n\nWith all that being said, I was extremely happy with my meal at Yum Yum BBQ.  I had the 2 combination meal with meat jun and bulgogi.   The bulgogi was OK, but the meat jun was delicious.  The meat jun was on the crispy side and didn't ooze any fat.  Some people tend to like the \"wet\" meat jun style where the meat jun is moist with healthy amounts of oil, fat, and egg, but not me.  Yum Yum's meat jun might be my favorite meat jun, which is a shame because I don't live in Vegas.\n\nI also tried 2 sushi rolls, the Yum Yum roll and the shrimp tempura roll. Again it's very weird to have sushi in a korean restaurant, but the sushi was very tasty.  Normally when I go to the mainland to have sushi, I expect bland fish with grainy texture.  I got none of that here.  Both rolls were worthy of being served in Hawaii.\n\nI also tried the tofu soup, but that was watery and didn't taste all that great.\n\nIf I lived in Vegas, I definitely wouldn't complain about the option of eating at Yum Yum BBQ.  They make good food for a good price.  If I'm craving Hawaii local style food I would make my way to Yum Yum BBQ.
