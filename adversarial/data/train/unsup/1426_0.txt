While I wait for the fine people at Chipotle to finally wise up and build a location north of the Loop 101, this one is the closest to my home in Desert Ridge.  With a craving for a burrito bowl, and Chipotle's easy online ordering, I put in my girlfriend and my usual order (which was originally made for another location by our old home) with a single click and drove down to PV Mall.\n\nThere's nothing that really sets this Chipotle apart from the others.  It has the typical look and feel of every other Chipotle ever built.  The food is the usual quality I have come to expect from this quick service chain.  My only real put off was that my order was not ready on time.  The confirmation email said our food would be ready by 8:10pm.  I walked in at 8:12, skipped the line and went to register, waited for the person paying to finish, then told the cashier that I was there for my online order.  It hadn't even been made yet.  The staff quickly put it together in less than five minutes, which allowed me to jump ahead of three or four people who had been waiting, but that also means if I just left my home earlier, it would've taken about the same amount of time.  Not the worst thing to ever happen, but it does defeat half the purpose of online ordering.\n\nHaving said that, here's a tip for all the people who complain about the long line at lunch time.  This location is right outside a mall surrounded by a ton of apartment complexes, retail centers, and office buildings.  It's going to be busy.  Order your food on chipotle.com (there's also a fax form on the website, or call ahead, if you're old school) and skip over all the people who did not plan ahead.  If they screw up and don't make your order right away like they did with me, they'll drop everything and make it.   No need to feel like a jerk.  You're now just smarter than the other customers who are now mad at you.  You're welcome.
