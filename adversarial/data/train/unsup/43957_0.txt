Are you tired of Patty King*, those cheap Jamaican patties that are a familiar item of convenience stores, subway station stalls and frozen aisles throughout Toronto?\n\nThen you need Patties Express, downtown Toronto's newest patties to-go go-to place!\n\nBe blown away by the warm and juicy freshness oozing out of each bite of their beef patties. Eat happy knowing each freshly made patty is only less than $2! Order two and a soda for less than $5.\n\nHungry for a quick bite on Yonge Street? Stop by this tiny Elm Street takeout stand. Patties are standing by. Don't wait, eat today!\n\nNo nonsense friendly staff. No seating area though. Consult your stomach before participating.\n\n(* the Patty King in question is not to be confused with the Patty King store at Kensington Market, which apparently has nothing to do with the Patty King International pre-made patties business.)
