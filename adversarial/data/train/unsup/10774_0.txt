This smith is so tiny and the people that goes here are so ghetto. I have a person that's high on drug asked me where is her food? Wtf how would I know where it is. And the employee that works there would rather help the crackheads and they wouldn't even help you even if you just stand there waiting where they were stationed and asked for help.
