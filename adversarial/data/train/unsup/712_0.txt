Every city has a place like this.  It's a semi-upscale Chinese restaurant that also serves sushi.  While in Charlotte on a trip, I found Fujo on the ground floor of the hotel\/office building complex I was staying at.\n\nLuckily, I also found a Groupon for a slightly cheaper meal option. While Fujo isn't outrageously expensive, the discount definitely made it worth trying. \n\nSuprisingly, Fujo wasn't busy at all early Friday evening.  As such, the service was attentive and the food came out quickly.\n\nOf course, the food is the key here, so let's review and discuss.  Pan fried pork dumplings? Ok.  They were slightly oily coming out of the fryer and the sauce with it could've benefited from a touch of spice. The General Tso's Chicken was of high quality, but had way too much citrus taste and not enough spice.  Heck, to be honest, it had no spice.\n\nIn short.  Neat location.  Great service.  Food needs some improvement.
