I love Kimpton chain hotels and have been lucky enough to stay at several across the country; including Hotel Monaco. Sure I just live in Bloomfield but when it opened a couple of years ago I had to check it out. Of course I wasn't at all disappointed. Having been there since many times for events and meetups I'm still happy. The decor is impeccable, rooms are luxurious and comfortable. Staff is at the top of their game.
