We went on the Rock and Ruins hummer tour and added the shooting package.    Shooting in the desert was a new experience.   There were 9 of us shooting so it took quite a while to get through everyone.    It was fun to shoot in the desert and there were a variety of targets that could be used. \n    \nThe desert tour was beautiful.  We had covered the same ground the previous year on a Tomcar  tour and that was actually more fun than the Hummer.      Our guide was a proficient driver but not as personable as I would expect for a tour guide and from my perspective, the guide can add a lot to the experience.  He was also late picking us up and did not say even acknowledge it.
