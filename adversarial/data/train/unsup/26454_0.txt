Still amazing, since my first review I have ordered about 5 times at least. I recommend this place to a friend that is a pizza snob, mind you I know nothing about pizza I mean of course I know the difference between homemade style and Pizza Hut. Anyway my friend is from the east coast he was blown away, he told me i was spot on. Great place worth the money, it tastes like heaven.
