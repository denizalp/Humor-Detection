The Deuce is a great little bar\/lounge in the middle of the casino floor.  I stopped here for a quick drink with my husband.  They have a few signature cocktails that are a bit pricey but we went ahead and gave it a shot.  We ended up both having the Raspberry Sorbet Martini which was excellent, a good amount of alcohol and great raspberry flavor with a huge covering of fresh whipped cream on top.  It is dimly lit with comfy couches, a large table for a big party, and a few black jack tables that no one was really playing at.  The ambiance is great.  The music wasn't too loud or annoying.  I imagine we will come back here for a drink or 2 with a group of friends to hang out before moving on to see where the night takes us.
