This place needs a menu refresher. Not only did they not have the dessert I ordered, but they don't carry several bottles of wine listed on their menu. Or they were out of the ones they did have listed. I know for a fact they took off one bottle a year ago, but low and behold - still listed. Maybe it is time for an update.
