This place does not make a great first impression. It's on the corner, across the street from a Taco Bell. Walking inside, I wasn't sure which restaurant would have better food. Since it was a warm summer night, we sat outside on the back patio, which was good because the place is a dive inside.\nThere used to be a Tortilla Flats in the 90s across the street and a block or so east of this location. I was hoping the new Tortilla Flats would be as good as the old one was. It was not.\nThe cheddar jalape√±o soup had no cheddar in it. It tasted like a corn soup. It was okay, but it wasn't a cheddar soup; but it did come in a tortilla bowl, which was nice. \nI had chicken enchiladas for the main course. Again, as was the theme for the night, it was okay, but nothing special. There was some sort of weird thick creamy sauce with the chicken that was sort of like a bechamel sauce. \nMy husband got the chimichanga, which was tiny. However, to be fair, both chicken dishes had real, big chunks of chicken breast.\nWe ordered the funnel cake churros for dessert. They were definitely the highlight of our meal. \nSo this place is a solid meh. It wasn't the worst Mexican restaurant I've ever been to, but it was nowhere near the best either. I don't think I'll be back.
