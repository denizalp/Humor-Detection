So I was off on vacation this week and I decided to spoil myself with a Birthday treat to the spa.  I racked my brain as to where I should go and I settled on Body Blitz.  I had heard great things and had popped in once when I was in the area to have a look around.\n\nThe atmosphere is amazing and it appears as though they have kept much of the original wood and structure.  The wood and brick gives a nice earthy feel and makes it very warm and homey.\n\nI choose a body bake and went on a Wednesday a they have cheaper rates for body bakes and scrubs on that days.  They also have \"Cheap Tuesday\" where the water therapy is $38.\n\nI made sure to arrive 2.5 hours in advance to relax, sign in, and enjoy every aspect of the spa.\n\nUpon arrival I was asked to fill in my health form, and then select my mud for for my body bake.  They have 3 muds to choose from and the staff walks your through what each one does and the benefits.  I was also asked to pic a juice from a list as a Birthday Special - but I think that everyone gets one as once I got into the spa, all the ladies had them.  Not gonna lie, if I had to pay for it, I wouldn't have.  I can't justify $7 for a smoothy.\n\nYou are given a tour of the spa and told about the water therapy cycle.  I changed into my suit and ventured into the water room.  This being a women's only spa - clothing is optional FYI.\n\nI'm not gonna lie - the water therapy is AMAZING!  I was so relaxed the the second I stepped into the water it was amazing.  Before showing up I was bloated and grumpy, after one round of the water cycle I was feeling amazing and the bloating was gone.\n\nYou are to cycle through different pools of water and rooms.  They include: \n~ warm sea salt pool \n~ hot green tea pool \n~ cold plunging pool \n~ aromatherapy steam room \n~ infrared sauna \n~ showers\n\nMake sure that you drink lots of water and don't over exert yourself in the hot pools.  The cold plunge is COLD!  Not gonna lie, it takes your breath away.\n\nI am not one for modesty - ask Vivian V, but I have to say it was a tad shocking seeing naked women.  I know we all have the same parts and such, but I was just in shock.  After relaxing after the first round, I took the plunge and took off my bikini and did the second round naked.  It was very freeing and very liberating.\n\nAfter completing the cycle for the second time I re-robed and relaxed on the lounge to wait for my next treatment.\n\nAnn, my spa technician came to get me and lead me to the body bake room.  Once again - the only thing that you wear is a disposable thong.  I have to say, I know understand what my dog goes through at the groomers.  You are asked to get on a table and you are sprayed down are scrubbed from head to toe.  The body wash smells amazing and the glove they use to scrub is great, but it is a very weird feeling to be laying there and have this happen.  Once you are scrubbed you are slathered in mud and left to bake.  The body bake room is not very inviting to tell you the truth, but oh well.  Over all I didn't really think that the body bake was worth the money or the time.  I have had similar treatments at other spas that were much more enjoying and much more relaxing.\n\nOver all the spa was great and is worth a try for any spa junkie.  I can say for a fact that I will only be going back for the water therapy.
