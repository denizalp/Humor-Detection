This W sucks... So smug and unpleasant, whether its the annoying people, the overpriced everything, or the horrible staff, this place blows hard. I have been to W's in SF\/Hollywood\/NY and they all actually are pretty cool and I have enjoyed them.\n \nYou can totally tell that Persians run this joint, don't get me wrong, I love Persian people, but there is that certain breed of them that wear douchey designer glasses and are obsessed with shiny jewlery and their 3-series and treat people like shit. That is the vibe this place puts off, like a sleezy wanna be vegas spot that is so far from cool that it is laughable. Don't even waste your time, but if you do make sure to pre-game because that shit is expensive!
