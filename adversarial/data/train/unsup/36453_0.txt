I went to the Totally Chi location again today in Metro Center and it is amazing.  I've been 4 times now and I can't say enough great things about the experience.  I get the same therapist, a female who is very very good at knowing the right pressure and giving a deep massage.  I get 30 minutes on the table then 16 minutes with just feet.  Total price is $40.00 and it's worth every dime.  She is extremely skilled at pressure on parts that need stretching, pushing on the spine with care, kneading out stress knots in the shoulders, and giving you an incredible healing experience.  I will continue going because she is so so so good.
