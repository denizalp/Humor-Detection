Wow-- can I just say thank you social media! I recently saw a post from a friend on Instagram and her nails were amazing! I was able to get an appointment scheduled. I am very much a \"plain Jane\" nail person and don't do anything fancy... However, I trusted Muriel to pick the polish and she was spot on! She got me out of my nail comfort zone and I am beyond happy with my nails! Not to mention the color scheme, but the manicure was seriously the best manicure I have ever had. Soooo looking forward to my appointment in 2 weeks
