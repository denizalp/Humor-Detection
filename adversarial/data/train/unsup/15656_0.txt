on business again in newmarket, this time i thought i'd skip across the street and give holiday inn express a try.  \n\nverdict:  should've stayed at comfort inn.\n\nnot a fan of the weird green \/ blue \/ strip club like lighting effect outside the building.  now onto the complaints:\n\n1)  i found the room to be much much smaller than comfort inn.\n2)  the restroom fan was blaring loud, sounded like i was showering with a turbine.\n3)  the breakfast was straight up sad.  something's not right with those hash browns, they tasted like cardboard.  the eggs?  microwaved.\n4)  upon entering the hotel it reeked chlorine.  have fun dipping yourself in chlorine!\n5)  horrible blow dryer, died on me the first night.  i was trying to hurry the eff up at 12 am to dry my hair so i can wake up early for work tomorrow, couldn't do it because my blow dryer was broken.\n6)  spotty wifi, at 12:30 am i was trying to get work done and wifi was not cooperating.  \n\nbut yeah, i'm going back to comfort inn next time.
