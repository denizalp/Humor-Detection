Love, love, LOVE this place!!!  Perfect place for sustenance after a full day visiting the Botanical Gardens + Insectarium.  Why the love? 1) An extensive\/impressive beer selection (Unibroue, now one of my new fave beer makers - hope I can find their brews in Ca!); 2) Food: Fully loaded nachos with bacon, sausage, chicken, black olives, cheese + onions. Bison burger was juicy and flavorful; 3) Great service\/ambiance - definitely mellower vibe in the early evening, but still all good. ;-)
