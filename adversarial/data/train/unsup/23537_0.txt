What I was expected was pretty mediocre, Americanized-Mexican food, fast. And I mean, that's OK. Especially if that's what you came for. \n\nBut this Cozumel location was much better than I was expecting! The margaritas weren't florescent, the salsa was fresh and whatever they put in that bean dip is pretty ridiculous. You like at it and you're like, \"There is no way I'm going to like that.\" Then you taste it and you're like, \"I've been a FOOL!\" It's that good. \n\nOnce you've filled up with margaritas and chips, don't forget that you have a massive plate of entree coming your way in about 30 seconds. It's so fast. I tried taquitos for the first time in like... 12 years? I don't even know. I think the last time I had them they were defrosted from a box in the supermarket. Not these. Freshly prepared, deliciously seasoned and shredded chicken. So much good. \n\nDon't be surprised if you see me here a little too often.
