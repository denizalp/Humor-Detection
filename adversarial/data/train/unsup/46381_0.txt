At the suggestion of my friend, I tried out this restaurant that she has been to a few times. We ordered the dinner combo and the price was reasonable because it came with a large dish of noddles with soup plus bubble tea. At first I thought the bubble tea size would be in a glass cup just like the tables around us. But it was given to us in a takeout container (and slightly smaller in volume than the glass cup). While the portion size was huge, it was very bland. The sauce was too salty and overwhelms the taste of the noodles. I probably would have visited the restaurant just beside this one because that one was priced a tiny bit lower.
