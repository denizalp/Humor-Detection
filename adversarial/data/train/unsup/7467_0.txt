Love Yogurt has an extensive, unique, and cute menu that seriously goes above and beyond for a froyo place. They have almost everything! Noodles (choose the type of noodles you want and whatever toppings you'd like), bubble tea, smoothies, froyo, coffee, crepes, creme brûlée, fruit sodas, etc. Their selection of crepes is mouth watering (\"Blueberry NY Cheesecake,\" \"Chocolate Nut Party,\" \"Amazing Cheese Fries,\" etc.). \n\nThings I've tried:\n\n- Potted plant iced matcha latte: Has a very plant-like\/earthy flavor because of the matcha and ice and whipped cream if you know what I mean (or am I just imagining it?). Still pretty good. \n\n- Matcha strawberry chocolate crepe: So good! That's all. \n\n- Frozen yogurt: Pretty standard in terms of flavors and taste. However, they have Lucky Charms! Which you don't see a lot. Yum. \n\nOwners are really accommodating and sweet. I once forgot to tell them that my iced matcha latte was to go, but they immediately transferred my drink to a to-go cup container and still made it look really presentable. \n\nVery spacious and colorful inside. And puzzles\/games on the tables while you wait!\n\nSo many more exciting things to try on the menu. Definitely will be back to try their noodles and more crepes.\n\nTaste | 4\nAtmosphere | 4\nPresentation | 4\nService | 4\nOVERALL | 4
