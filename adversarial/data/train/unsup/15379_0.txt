Hmmm...I love meat and potatoes, so when a friend asked me to go there for her birthday I agreed knowing it was super expensive and upscale.  It's also located downtown which equates to #parkingnightmare.  I'd say bus down there, but busing anywhere in Pittsburgh takes an eternity.  I digress.\n\nThe food here is awful.  I got some kinda Bolognese Pasta, it tasted like dirty gym socks.  Not kidding.  The presentation was terrible, and it tasted warm as opposed to hot.  I'll do a warm hamburger from a fast food joint because they aren't charging $23, but not warm pasta from a place that has reservations and $50 and up plates.  They charge $5 or some shit for toast, so that's the kinda place this is.  The wine was delicious, but it's hard to mess up red wine for someone who imbibes as regularly as I do.  Had it not been for the wine, and company, I would probably 1 star it, but I'm no high class gal.\n\nThe service was ok.  They kept trying to take all of my silverware and plates before I was done with my dishes.  It's like, back up, I'm not even finished eating yet.  And I used to serve tables for a long time, so I know the difference between hovering over a table, and allowing someone to eat and enjoy their company.\n\nHere's the kicker, a friend got the highest priced plate cause he's a baller (unlike myself), and well, it's supposed to come with MASHED POTATOES.  Well, they said, \"we're out of mashed potatoes, would you like french fries?\"  My eyes got so big, as did his, and we were like \"are you for real?\".  Their like \"yes, we ran out (on a friday night no less), so if you want mashed potatoes, we will have to make more for you\".  He said, \"Ummm...if I'm ordering a $50 plate of steak and potatoes, I don't wanna eat french fries\".  Seriously.  I was floored.  They were kinda rude about  him wanting mashed potatoes, too.  And, as you can imagine, it took a very long time to get our food.\n\nThe atmosphere in this place is cool, and our server was pretty efficient for the most part.  The birthday girl enjoyed her food (i think), but I wish we coulda just went to Thai Cuisine.  The steak looked greasy so I figured pasta
