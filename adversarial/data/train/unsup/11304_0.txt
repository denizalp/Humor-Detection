I'm at a loss for words. I'm so hungry that I don't have the energy to make my brain crank out words to bash this place. Let's just say that it's true when they say \"the more ratchet the place, the better the Chinese food\". This is worse than white washed Chinese food. My god! One star for unique looking dishes. And another star for big portions. That's it. I'm outta here.
