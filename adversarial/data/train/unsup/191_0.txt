I am not quite sure what the heck was going on at this place.  First off, I do not venture out to the west side too often but my fiance and I were visiting with some good friends so we decided to grab a late bite to eat.  The only place we could find open was Cocono's.  The staff was a bit strange, like quite possibly on muscle relaxers??  We asked 3 times for water and our appetizer was forgotten and the server was confused on why we never got it?  Maybe b\/c she never brought it out?  I dunno.  But surprisingly the food was really good!  I had the Beef Machaca and it was delicious-- this is why I gave 3 stars.  The food was good.  The service was not.  It could have been because it was pretty late to eat dinner and they all popped some muscle relaxers right at 10pm so when we got there about 10:15, the pills were kicking in.\n\nWe had a pretty good laugh about it though and the night was still enjoyable b\/c the company was good, we had some drinks and we enjoyed the food.
