This is a very nice JCPenney. The store is in a nice location and is always clean. Sometimes I find what I am looking for and sometimes not but that is like anywhere. I especially like the sales that JCPenney has and the great coupons they offer. You can get some really nice quality clothes and other items for a great price when they have their sales combined with their coupons. I also think their return policy is great.
