Well, I can't comment on the drinks or head massage\/hairwashing because I wasn't offered or given either of these things. My stylist did warn me that she wouldn't be washing my hair because the curl I asked for wouldn't hold if she did. I reluctantly agreed, even though that is usually my favorite part of a blowout.\n\nShe put hot rollers in my hair and did no styling, sending me out of the place looking like Shirley Temple. She told me to just run my fingers through it when I'm ready to go out. I also asked for some more volume, and I was told to tease it up myself before my event. I came to this place because I suck at doing my hair, but in the end that's what I had to do. The whole experience was very disappointing, especially since this place is so close to my house. When I pay for a blowout, I expect to leave the salon with my hair finished, and this wasn't even close.\n\nPlatinum Entourage is 1000x better but a bit more pricy and difficult to get an appointment. The new Blow n Go blowout bar in Village Square is so new that it's still pretty unorganized and took 1.25 hours for a 30 minute blowout, but I left with my hair looking fantastic and a style that lasted for days. Either one of these experiences were worth my money, but Blowout Dollhouse was a ripoff.
