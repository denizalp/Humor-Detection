No job search firm should charge candidates a fee, which should be paid by the employer upon hiring. Plus they keep sending me these annoying junk emails about \"jobs\" that I am not even slightly interested in. Why would they think a professional graphic designer would want to become an insurance salesman, especially when they claim they have read my resum√©??? Beware of this scam! Where's the zero stars button?
