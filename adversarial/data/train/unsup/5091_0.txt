Best Massage Around Mesa\/Tempe Area!\n\nI am not kidding when I say this is my favorite massage house around. My favorite masseuse here is Hannah who I think is probably the owner. She is always warm and welcoming and has always gone out of her way to do an awesome job and somehow knows where it hurts and focuses there. \n\nSomehow she knows just where to work on for me and get those knots and tight spots. The bummer is that she seems to be busy with other people when I go in most of the time lately. \n\nWarning... Very addictive coming here!\n\nEveryone is friendly here and it has a nice clean and quiet feel. Relaxing music so quiet you can fall asleep sometimes!\n\nDid I mention it is $40\/hr for a full body massage? It's a good price on a nice massage. \n\nI only wish the full body massage too care of the front of the legs and chest more. After a rough week these areas would be nice too. \n\nPS: the bad 1 star review is probably a scammer competition review... none of it actually makes sense except that in many smaller massage shops they do have to greet customers sometimes during a massage, but it's pretty rare.
