Weak happy hour margarita, ended up buying a shot of Patron' to make it yummy. Also ordered their sampler platter for $10.95 ( apps are half off during happy hour) thank goodness because if I would have paid full price for this I would have been pissed. Nothing was good at all, and it bugs the crap out  of me when Mexican restaurants add soooo much \"filler\" to  their shredded beef and chicken...you know like tons of onion, celery, peppers, and very little actual meat. \n\nOur server was ok, but we were sitting next to the server station and all we heard were employees complaining about customers and talking shit about other employees. No bueno.
