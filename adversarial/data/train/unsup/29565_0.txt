Came to the new location at Arrowhead last week and the food tastes amazing. We ordered the steak and chicken kabob plate plus the Greek fries. It all came out fresh, and delicious. The order was missing one addition kabob, and they made it right by adding another kabob in addition to the one they brought out later.\nMy son spilled some soda on the table and the manager was attentive and courteous. \nWill definitely be back!
