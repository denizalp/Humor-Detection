Small restaurant with 5-6 chair bar, quaint but nice atmosphere reminding me of NOLA. I use to drive across the bay in Biloxi to D'Iberville and eat them great tasting po boys.\n\nHad their lunch catfish po boy, fries and the fixins with ice tea. Can't complain, probably the best po boy I've had since moving to the Phoenix area 10-years ago. \n\nDefinitely plan to return and try more of their Cajun dishes. Recommend giving this place a try.
