Not really sure how one can go from wanting Thai food to ending up in a McDonald's drive-thru.  But after sitting through a Wranglers game, everyone was famished and the Thai place was closed, and necessity was the order of the evening.  This particular drive-thru was quick and friendly and the food was as McDonald's does....A-OK.
