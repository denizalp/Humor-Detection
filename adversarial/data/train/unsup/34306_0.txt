This place is amazing; the people who say and rate otherwise are just too nitpicky. I used to eat here whenever we were in Vegas with my family. Only drawback is the price (which is very costly, though it is a buffet), and the (usually) long wait to get into the buffet. They have everything though, and lots of seating as well. Whether you're looking for salad, American food, Mexican food, fruit, dessert, meats, seafood, etc. they've got it! I get hungry just thinking about it.
