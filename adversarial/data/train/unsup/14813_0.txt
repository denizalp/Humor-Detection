I would like to say that I emailed my concerns to the owner 2-3 weeks ago without a response AND I posted on the \"reviews\" section on their FB.  Finally I received a comment on FB saying someone would be back to be soon, tomorrow at the latest.  That was a week ago so here I am.  I feel I've given them ample time and they are choosing not to address the issues and they have deleted our concerns from their FB page.\n\nFirst, I will say that their bulbs have always been good and we get a quality tan.  That is the only positive thing I can say about the Surprise location.  Their location on Bell and 63rd (I think) is the complete opposite, very clean and a very friendly staff.\n\nMy husband and I have been tanning here for 3 or 4 years at the Surprise location.  In April of this year we noticed that things were going downhill.  The overall cleanliness is poor, there is shelving ripped off the walls and not replace, clothes hooks ripped off the walls, some beds have music, some don't, etc.  Most recently bed one was down for a month.  We were told that someone used the wrong tanning lotion and they were waiting on a cleaner...for a month?  Meanwhile we are forced to wait for a bed and if bed one was working, that would be lessened.  \n\nObviously the owner doesn't care, that is clear with his lack of attention to these issues and it is a shame.\n\nTanners beware, the Surprise location is the ugly red-headed step child.  You will pay all the money at Celebrity, which is fine, but you will not receive high-end service or accommodations.
