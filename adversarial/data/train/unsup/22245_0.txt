I showed up right when they opened. Woops! Sorry, I had dragon breath from stinky tofu and wanted to wash it down.\n\nSuper nice chick working inside. She was very sweet. I always order the #1, and she was NOT stingy with the pandan jelly (my favorite part) Thanks for making my vacay so enjoyable and giving me more goodies than the Bambu in SF does!
