After having lice through out my family  and neighbor back in July.  September  we were going through it again.   We had lice doctors come out and treat my family and my neighbor  at my house.    Amy was awesome and knowledgeable about lice and did 5 heads in 4 hours.  It took the stress off of me doing my children and feel confident they are gone for good.  I would recommend them to anyone.  Thank you live doctors for all your help!!!
