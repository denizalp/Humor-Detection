A large group of us went here for something to do on my brothers birthday. We all bought their membership and two race package. Seemed like a decent thing we might have done more often. If it hadn't been completely ruined by a guy that kept bumping and slamming a few people in the party. Instead of taking the guy off the track like they say they will they just always tapped  the no bumping sign at him and ignored it. I had seen them pull a different guy out for a few laps to talk to him and was surprised that this did not happen to this individual. When we went to speak with the staff after we were done as to why they refused to follow the rules with this individual to make it a fun experience for everyone we were informed that they couldn't really do anything as it was the manager Andrea's son. So instead of looking out for their paying customers the employee's have to let the kid that does nothing but race for free harass the actual patrons. There are other places to go in the valley and after this experience I encourage everyone to go elsewhere.
