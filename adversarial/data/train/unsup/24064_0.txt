When I was told I would be relocating to CLE from Chicago, there wasn't much to be said about how Cleveland was going to trump Chicago.  Lebron James & the Rock & Roll hall of Fame were Cleveland's claim to fame & it's unlikey that The Hall is going to take it's talents to South Beach.  So I came with high expectations & it delivered.  Music doesn't play a huge part of my life, but I know enough to appreciate all the memorabilia & enjoy reading about the life of the people I grew up listening to.  The icing on the cake was the video which showed all the entrants in the past 20 years including a few bit & pieces about the band.  All in all, definitely worth checking out.  $24 well spent.
