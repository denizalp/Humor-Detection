This is the Grand Lux Cafe located inside the Venetian. There's another one in the Palazzo but supposedly this one is better. The only other Grand Lux Cafe I've been to is the one in the Beverly Center in Beverly Hills and in comparison, they're pretty similar in terms of ambience and food, but this one is open 24 hours!!\n\nWe had a huge group of about 15 and we were lucky enough to get seated right away even though it was peak dinner time and we didn't have reservations (you have to make them 2 hours in advance). \n\nMy friend and I shared a sausage, pepperoni, and mushroom pizza. It was super doughy (a little too soft for my taste). I couldn't even break the pieces apart cleanly without all the toppings and cheese falling off all over the place. But the CRUST was delicious! My friend and I found ourselves just eating the crust off of each slice towards the end. They have all kinds of food here--it's really similar to Cheesecake Factory because it's the sister restaurant. But I'd avoid the \"asian\" food if I were you, especially if you're looking for something authentic because you're probably not going to find that here.
