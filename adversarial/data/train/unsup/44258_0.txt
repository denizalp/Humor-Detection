Yum! I absolutely loved their kouign amann! It was the greatest combination of savoury and sweet. The pastry was moist and was baked till crunchiness perfection! I also got the almond croissant and now that was something. It was fantastic! It tasted great with a cup of coffee! I would also recommend their cafe au lait which was delightful. The milk foam was fantastic, but I would have preferred stronger coffee. Overall it was a delight to finally try this place out!
