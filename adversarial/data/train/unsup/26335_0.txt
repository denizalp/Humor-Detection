Sunday brunch buffet, after an absolutely atrocious visit to the Spice Market Buffet the prior night, which had us a little concerned that all the criticism of Vegas buffets was becoming warranted!  After a wait of around ten fifteen minutes we made it to the promised land!  Unlike Spice Market (once upon a time a Vegas fave of ours), just about all the food looked quite appealing!  How can eggs Benedict from a buffet be so darned good?!  I'm a massive fan of breakfast food, and nothing I had was disappointing.  Wife loves her fruit, and was especially pleased by the watermelon.  It was one of those experiences where you almost wish you were back in Roman orgy days (oops... wrong casino!) so you could go to the vomitorium and then come back for more delectibles!!!  I'm oh so close to giving the buffet 5 stars, but drop one as a result of mediocre coffee, the lack of personalized stations other than for omellettes, and too many limp and rubbery-looking pieces of bacon to wade through to find some crispier gems.  Thanks for restoring our faith in quality Vegas buffets, Bellagio!
