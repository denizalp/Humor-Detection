This review is based on my breakfast I had here one morning and the few glasses of wine I was able to enjoy here at the bar the night before.\n\nI really wish I could have spent some more time at this place. I absolutely love the hip bluesy, laid back, loungy atmosphere and could imagine it must be a fun place to kick back on an evening before hitting the rest of the town.\n\nSunday morning and limited to the selection of breakfast choices to go to and not craving to go back to the not so delectable Cravings buffet option we chose before, this seemed to be our last, but decent resort.\n\nI was seated promptly and given my much needed coffee immediately. I ordered an omelet with Swiss cheese, bell peppers, onions and sausage.\n\nIt arrived within a timely manner appearing fluffy and deliciously appealing. I then noticed it was ham instead of sausage in the omelet( I don't like to be too picky but I really don't like ham) so I told the waitress, she apologized politely and had another one remade.\n\nCome to find out it was sausage just a different kind and the chef actually came out (no, not to strangle me) but to show me a display of different sausages how they are and what I would like to use. She was extremely professional and extremely polite.\n\nShe gladly remade it and brought it out to me. The omelet was seriously a fluffy, flavorful goodness. Savory flavor in each delectable bite and cooked to perfection. Yeah I know, that rave over an omelet, I just have to give praise to those who can make simple things outstanding.\n\nMy experience the night before was nice; wine was nothing special though, the service we received from the bar tender was sincere, friendly and prompt.\n\nDefinitely will make a trip back to this place again:)
