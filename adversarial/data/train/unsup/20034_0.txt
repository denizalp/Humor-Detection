This place was so freakin' fun!!  My 7 year old son wanted to go back the next day. We spent 2.5 jam-packed, non-stop hours there. Climbed the center structure to the summit, stopping at each of the outer floors on the way up. Then climbed down to take the elevator back up to each floor again.\n\nLeft with a cramped up left leg (yeah, maybe I need to step up my daily exercising) but would do it again in a second just to see my kid's face light up like it did while we were there :)\n\nStaff was super and very helpful.  They all looked happy to be there. No doubt we will visit each time we are in Vegas in the future.
