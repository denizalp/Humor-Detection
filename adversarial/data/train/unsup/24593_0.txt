You can't really say you're from Vegas until you've been to this spot for their chicken wings. I came on a Tuesday night after class around 7PM, and they were BUSY. Don't be discouraged by the line, there were a few people ahead of me waiting to order and for their food, but the line moves quickly. \n\nThey have a classic \"American\" selection of wings, fingers, nachos, and burgers -I think that's about it. The sauce they use for the wings was really good, but pretty spicy so I'll be cautious next time. The wings & fries were perfect, the only thing missing was a good ranch to go along (I think theirs is bottled). Parking is really limited, but most people are ordering to-go so getting a space won't be an issue if you're willing to be patient.
