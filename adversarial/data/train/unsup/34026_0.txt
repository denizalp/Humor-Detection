Easily the most delicious pizza in the Shadyside area. Their delivery service is always on time, and most of the time it's early! I think there's only been one instance where I was waiting the full time that they had given for the delivery. They've got tons of topping options, and they are competitively priced compared to some of the other pizza joints in the area.
