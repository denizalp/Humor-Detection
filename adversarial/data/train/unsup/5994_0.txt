Took our \"Riccar\" vacuum in for routine maintenance and repair. They did an excellent job! My only complaint,  I asked them to fix the switch that controls the suction from floor & tools, to carpet mode and they didn't fix. Although there were quite a few minor problems with the vac and probably just overlooked that one. \nStill runs great and I will be back in the future! \n\nUpdate: \nI actually took it back in and they took it back in right away to fix it! \nThank you
