Went for lunch and most of it deserves 2 stars. Place is a quarter full and I waited about 20 minutes for the mako shark plate. During my wait, I drank my water, and couldn't get more. When the plate came, it was missing the fries (\"not done yet\"). Fries came about 5 minutes later. Food, yep, 2 stars. The mako was the special, cubes of ok fish for $18 in their house rub, which I give 2 stars. I think I'll wait to return to this location when it's a new restaurant.
