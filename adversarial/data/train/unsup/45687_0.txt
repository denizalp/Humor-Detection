Decor is extremely upscale and classy, so I kinda felt like a celebrity. Probably because I went here for a formal a while back and the group I was with was pretty dressed up. We even got seated in the backroom, VIP baby! We were served several courses. Considering it was a formal and everyone was all squiggley and silly (aka drunk), I'm not sure sushi or raw meats was a good pick, but the dinner was decent and the food was good, nothing over the top amazing, but the giant white corn kernels were pretty bomb with the rare cooked meat.\n\nNot that I should review this place and mention it's restroom but why in the world is it so dark in there?? \nI had trouble locking the door when using the bathroom..I wish you lit it up just a little more.
