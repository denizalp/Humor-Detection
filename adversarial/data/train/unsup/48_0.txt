I was convinced by my coworker to try laser treatments 2-3 years ago.. And I will NEVER go back to waxing! \n\nLaser hair removal is overall such a great investment! It really is cheaper and worth it in the end.. Less painful too! \n\nGreat staff! Everyone is always so friendly and helpful. My two favorites have to be Mary and Vicky.. They're so outgoing, funny and they really know how to make you feel comfortable during your sessions! \n\nTreatments I do are my face, underarms, bikini. I also do eMatrix which helps with sun damage, acne scars, fine lines and wrinkles -- not that I have all of that but I've tried it to help with my mommy scars! \n\nAmerican Laser offers such great deals throughout the year AND they offer financing! I think that's why I always get suckered for more treatments!! LOL\nNonetheless, I'm very happy with my results!
