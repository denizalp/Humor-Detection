Fry jack bread. I'm sooo happy right now. One piece comes with breakfast. Then it's a 1$ per extra.  Look how big and fresh they are. Omg!! \nElvira's style eggs are sweet and interesting but it's good. \nCorn beef hash is homemade. A little fatty for me. My buddy scarfed them down. \nShort ribs are fatty for me but again my buddy scarfed then Down and is happy. \nCoconut rice, potato salad l, fried bananas and beans are fantastic. \nI give five stars not because the food is amazing cuisine but it's exactly what you'd get in Belize and the food preparation must be a pain. \nYes we will come back. Yes we will recommend. \nKeto friendly. No. Carb heaven. Yes.
