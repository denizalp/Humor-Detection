I went back last weekend, only because I had a $150 coupon left.\n\n\nI was actually shocked at what I saw. The inventory was what I'd call limited, the last time I was there, but now, it's actually laughable. \n\nAll they had was a huge amount of chicken breasts, chicken legs, and whole chickens (that worked out to be around $25 EACH!) over flowing in one display case ...  \n\nIn the other other case, was a small pile of sad looking (& very expensive) rack of ribs. i wouldn't buy the ribs, as they didn't look very meaty nor substantial, but I was in awe, when I saw a guy ask for one, they weighed in, and said the price to him, $62.00! That's for ONE rack of ribs. Unreal. \n\nI also made note of of 2 cuts of a some pork ends. I'm assuming they'd be used for stewing, as they looked like huge hunks of bone. \n\nThey didn't even have any stewing beef during this visit. \n\nThere was absolutely nothing else - the coolers, the fridge, all completely empty! In fact, the cooler, had a big white curtain over it, as to say 'don't look at the emptiness'. \n\nI walked out with $100 worth of chicken, and will NEVER EVER return.
