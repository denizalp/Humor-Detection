We are weekly regulars at both the Casa Mia and the Sundance Grill.  But this review is for the Sundance Grill.  The quality of service overall has gone down, especially if you come in after 9:15 pm.\n\nToday on Wednesday, July 12, 2017, we showed up at at 9:15 pm and stood by the \"Wait to be seated sign\" until 9:30 although the restaurant was not busy.  There were two workers at the cashier (uniformed) and the manager (I assume) with plain clothes and long hair.  She only cared about her accounting and she looked at us at 9:30 and said \"uh I'll be right back.\"  But her tone was phony as if she just said it to say it and of course she never came back nor did she send anybody over. \n\nFinally we looked at one of the cashier (a little Asian guy with glasses) and said,\"is anyone working tonight?\"   His response was he looked around and said, \"I'm a cashier.  I have to find a host.\"\n\nHe couldn't find anyone so he looked at the seating chart and came back and seated us at a four seat table at the end of the bar.\n\nAs we began to sit down, the server in that section got very upset (heavy set gal with dark hair and pony tail and her hair had tight curls). She said she was doing her side work.  So the Asian guy cashier asked us to move and then we moved to Kamaile's section.\n\nOnce we sat down in Kamaile's table, her service was excellent.  But our mood had been spoiled by the poor management and service coverage of the tables.  This is a direct reflection of that manager's inability to see what's going on her floor or lack of care.  I feel that the customer should not hear a server complain about her side duties.
