It's not my favorite Restaurant for Irish Cuisine but it's still very good and the bar scene can not be beat.\n\nWe were in the area today and stopped shortly after 11:00 for an early lunch. Being early, we pretty much had our choice of seating. Most of the seating is Bar Seating on stools but there are a couple of regular booths over on the side. We choose a booth.\n\nMy wife almost had a fit when we walked in because she is from Pittsburgh and this is a Browns Bar. I reminded her that Killington's in Huntersville is also a Browns Bar and she relented and went in and in the end, had a great time.\n\nOur server was very good and we did not want for anything. She took our drink orders quickly and gave us enough time to make up our mind on a very extensive menu.\n\nShe ordered the 7th Street Steak Sandwich with Mac-n-Cheese as her side. I had Shepard's Pie with Tater Tots as my side.\n\nShe enjoyed her Sandwich and proclaimed it to be one of the best she had had. My Shepard Pie was good although I am a traditionalist and prefer lamb. Plenty of beef however and a good savory taste with ample portions.\n\nAnother couple who came in later and sat on the porch had a yellow lab puppy with them and being animal lovers, it was a nice touch  and added to what was already a nice  atmosphere.\n\nWe have to go back down in a couple of weeks and this will definitely be on the table as a dining option.
