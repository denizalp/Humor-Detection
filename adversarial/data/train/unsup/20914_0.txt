Kensington's family operated-pizza joint puts out some tasty pie!\n\nWhen I'm looking to feed some friends, Demetris is my go-to party pizza, and they do it up Canadian style - thick, heavy, full of cheese and full of flavour! \n\nIf Ninja Turtles taught me anything, it's that nobody can agree on the best pizza toppings, so to help us all out, Demetris has got a pretty decent selection. You can keep to the traditional Pepperoni or Hawaiian, or play it pizza fashion forward with the artichoke and chicken \"Affair of the 'Heart'\" or the \"Alberta BBQ Steak.\"\n\nThe sauce is...saucy, and tangy, and the crust is good and crunchy without being dry. \n\nDemetris price is definitely on the high end when it comes to take out pizza, but I'll keep coming back because they've been deliciously consistent with every order.
