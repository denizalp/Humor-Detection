Piecing together the stories that I've heard about La Comida, I imagined that it was the type of establishment where the food is fine, and you don't hold back the tequila shots. Can't say much for the latter, but the food certainly is good. \n\nRESTAURANT\n\nEven during the daytime, it's difficult to miss their skeleton monkey sign that entices your curiosity and draws you into the restaurant. The wooden tables with their long benches and the folding chairs give it a homey vibe. Day of the Dead elements and rosaries that hang on the walls add touches of Mexican culture throughout the dining room. \n\nFOOD\n\nComplimentary bowls of tortilla chips with salsa are presented as a light appetizer. I say order the guacamole, too.\n\nAppetizer - Queso Fundido: Cheesy, gooey goodness served on a hot plate. \n\nEntree - Sea Bass A La Baja: When our server explained how these are the only tacos on the menu that use flour tortillas instead of corn, I had doubts. After my meal, I can't imagine corn being used for these tacos. The tempura battered sea bass was crunchy, and the chipotle mayo added a tolerable spiciness. I would never have thought that pickled radishes to complement the other flavors. This didn't disappoint.\n\nDessert - Flan: This is one of the best flans that I've had. It's solid and doesn't jiggle much. Smooth, creamy, and not super sweet.\n\nDessert - Fried Plantains with ice cream: Sweeter than the flan, the fried plantains retained their crunchiness even as the ice cream started to melt and created a pool in the bowl. Decent, but I prefer the flan. \n\nSERVICE\n\nNo complaints. Everything ran smoothly.\n\nOTHER\n\nThe fútbol channel was on during my visit. That's a plus!\n\nOVERALL\n\nI would make the trek back here, especially to try their shrimp tacos and watch more fútbol. Lunchtime seems like the ideal hour to make a visit. I wouldn't be surprised if this place becomes packed around dinnertime. Make reservations if possible.
