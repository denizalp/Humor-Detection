As soon as I stepped in, the air was hot and thick with the scent of garlic and onion and all the other good stuff. I knew this wasn't gonna be some crap pulled out of a box and slapped onto the grill. Their meals take EFFORT. \n\nThe fries are perfectly seasoned. The cheesesteak is absolutely bomb and won't leave you disappointed. They don't skimp--it's literally spilling over with toppings. You're damn right if you think you'll feel guilty after this meal. Not because of the obvious caloric intake but because I don't know what you or I have done correctly in life to enjoy something that tastes this good. It's the best!
