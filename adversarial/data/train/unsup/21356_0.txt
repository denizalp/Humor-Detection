So looks like most of the reviews are either hot or cold. This is my first time here and maybe I just came with the right people. \n\nThe wings were the best part - double fried Korean Style - the coatings were unreal and so crispy - the Soy Garlic and Spicy both kick butt - try them both! The Cracklins were good covered with the Sriracha\/spice powder - the portion was huge and is plenty to share - they almost seem to magically refill themselves!! The last best thing was the fried tofu - nice firm texture and lots of flavor. The potato salad and the Ramen Mac and Cheese were nothing to write home about.\n\nIf you are a drinker - go all out and get the Coconut Soju - dude (or dudette) it's just not a party without that Soju - it will sneak up on you and kick your a$$. Warning - do not try to eat the coconut - not that I'd know anything about that (ahem).\n\nI would definitely come back for the wings!
