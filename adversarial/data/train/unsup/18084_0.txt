Please do not ration my hot sauce! When I say I want a lot that does not mean 2 thimbles instead of one. Also please warm up your precooked ingredients before you slap them in a burrito.\n\nI went on a trip here with a Friend after a hike, we were hungry, and his out of town guest wanted to try a \"taco stand\" so after driving around the shadier parts of town for a bit we found this place. \n\n I ordered my usual Chile relleno burrito. Here they fill the space around the Chile with rice cheese and sauce. However my Chile it self was cool as if they just pulled it out of the refrigerator. The one surprising thing is that I did not get sick.\n\nMy Friends seemed content with their burritos however there was an extreme shortage of hot sauce, we shared it, then we fought for it, it was a truly sad scene.
