We were looking for a quick, tasty meal before exploring the ROM and we found it! It was a classic, diner-like experience, with great service and a diverse menu. \n\nI ordered an egg in the hole, which is fried eggs on a bagel with cheese and bacon that's been broiled, and a side of home fries.  Despite the food being over broiled (it was burnt in parts), the food was very tasty and flavorful. The bagel was chewy and delicious, the eggs were well cooked and the bacon was nice and crispy. The home fries were good, but very basic. Don't expect a lot going on with the potatoes.\n\nOverall a great experience before the museum. I would definitely return.
