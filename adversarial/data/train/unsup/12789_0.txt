A great tasting tortillas.\n\nIf you enjoy Chipotle then you will Love Caf√© Rio. Somewhat same concept, however Cafe Rio has much better food. The tortilla's are hand made and absolutely delicious. So is there fresh homemade guacamole. You have to try Cafe Rio's sweet barbocoa pork, it is amazingly tender and succulent.\n\n Cafe Rio is an excellent Mexican Grille, that's quick, however Cafe Rio doesn't skimp on the big bold flavor. I prefer to get the taco salad with the pork barbacoa or green chili beef.  Make sure you try the house cilantro lime ranch dressing, a wonderful compliments for your salad.\n\nHomemade tortillas, daily specials and fun atmosphere add up to a great place to eat. Reasonable pricing and great service.  Would recommend to anyone.
