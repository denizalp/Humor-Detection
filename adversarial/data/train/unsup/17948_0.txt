I agree with another Yelper on here, this place is not as bad as everyone states.\n\nMy parents have a time share here and they live across the street (literally) they go to the resort all the time since they have day use privileges also. My boyfriend and I were visiting from CA for my sisters wedding and my Dad bought us a 2 night stay here for the trip. \n\nI was nervous to check in since other Yelpers had issues...we did not get to the resort til' 5:30 pm since we were at the wedding all day. Morris helped us, he was hilarious, nice and helpful. We got checked in just a couple minutes and went to our room to check it out....pretty amazing.\n\nWe got a one bedroom king master suite with a jetted giant tub, full granite kitchen and washer & dryer right next to the adult pool and bar.\n\nWent to the pool, grabbed a cocktail, and starting talking with the food and bev manager down there, she was very nice. My first margarita was pretty heavy on the marg mix, she made me a new one. Then shegave us a free chicken quesadilla since someone called in an order then cancelled it, it was good.\n\nWe had some friends come by, took them and their kids to the family pool with a fun waterslide, the kids had a blast! We brought our own cooler full of beer in there, we got asked to not have a cooler full of beer since they were selling ten feet behind us...lol, oops, my bad :) they were nice about it, after all, the sign when you walk into the pool says no outside beverages right on it. We had a little shin-dig that night, no complaints, we accidentally checked out late, they were nice about that too.\n\nAll in all, we will be back, I will recommend it and We had an amazing stay.\n\nThanks for making a weekend visit just to go to a sisters wedding into a nice relaxing and fun vacation :)
