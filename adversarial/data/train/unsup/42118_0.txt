The couple who own & work the store are so nice and love what they do. One of them enthusiastically explained to us all of the different ingredients and health benefits\/uses for their \"elixirs\" and let us sample all of them. They all tasted like really flavorful juice and were DELICIOUS. You could slightly taste the vitamins as an aftertaste, but my friend and I really didn't mind (according to the owner, they had 100-something different fruits & vegetables and a ton of different vitamins inside). You can mix them any way you want to suit your health needs OR what simply tastes good to you. A refreshing 12oz drink was $6.\n\nI didn't get any food, but I read the menu which looks pretty delicious (ALL VEGAN!). Most importantly, it seems like everything is super affordable. Definitely gotta go back to try the menu.
