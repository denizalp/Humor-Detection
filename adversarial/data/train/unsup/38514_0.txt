This event is so much fun and great for all ages! You need tokens to pay for everything inside the gates, so be sure to bring cash to exchange for tokens! Definitely don't eat breakfast before hand, you'll eat more tacos here than ever before in your life. They have a huge variety and other food besides just tacos as well. The price can add up quickly though so definitely buy the ticket option that best suits what you like, for example, I do the margarita lovers so I get more margaritas for the same price. There's also a lot of activities as well. They do a taco eating contest, burrito eating contest, and even a chihuahua beauty contest which is hilarious! It's a great way to spend the weekend no matter how large or small of a group you have, and no matter your age. I'll definitely be back next year!
