Tri-Lite Builder's remodeled my '80's style home in 2010.  They never really finished the job despite several visits after they were \"done.\" Now that the warranty is out, the cabinet doors are not working, the dishwasher connections are leaking, the new doors won't stay closed....shall I keep going?  As with any contractor, make sure you KNOW the owners before you sign on the bottom line.  The people working for them (designers and foreman) may be honest and forthright, but make sure you meet the owner first.
