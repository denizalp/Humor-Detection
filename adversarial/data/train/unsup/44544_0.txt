Worst than gangster\/criminals. Several unaccounted cases of employees barging into apartments without prior notification. 2 break-ins occurred with items stolen\/broken. Management took no responsibility even if the apartments with break-ins are opened with key. After the break-in, local superintendent threatens tenants like gangsters to prevent reporting these activities to law forcing them out of the building. Several complaints in tenant board are still pending against these crooks.\nDo not trust them, they have all their employees covered as they have significant roots with local gangs.
