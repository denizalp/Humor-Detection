Friday morning and wanted more than the usual Starbucks run, I finally found this hidden gem tucked in the back of a large business complex when you enter off Sunset.\nBaguette is a quaint breakfast\/lunch spot that caters not just to the surrounding office community but to savvy locals who want good food and a great ambiance.\nOlivier is welcoming and greets every guest like an old friend. The pastry chef moves about the kitchen bringing out scrumptious treats like tarts, muffins and the fresh baked croissants. These croissants will completely spoil you forever. It would have been a sin not to have one. The warm buttery aroma wafts through the air like a warm blanket for your olfactory senses. Close your eyes, sit at a table bathed in morning sunlight, drink a fresh mango orange juice, then take a bite of heaven.\nThe Croissant & egg omelette was incredible. The omelette is prepared to outstanding culinary standards, the croissant is light, flaky with a thin layer of buttery soft dough that almost melts in your mouth as you take a bite, there is a light tomato basil sauce that elevates it above all other breakfast croissants and it is served with a small house salad so you can have a serving of greens.\nI am elated to have finally experienced Baguette Cafe and will make this a regular morning ritual at least once a week. \"Bon Appetite!\"
