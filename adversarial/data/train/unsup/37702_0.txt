A friend recommended this place to me and told me that this was the best, authentic Italian food that he could find in the Valley.  With me having a gluten-allergy, I was a little hesitant to go but did agree to meet him there, and just decided beforehand that I would get a salad to keep my allergy from flaring up.  He got there a few minutes before me and asked the owner if they had any gluten-free dishes, he advised that they did not really have any on the menu, but that they did sell gluten-free pasta on their grocery shelves and that he would be willing to set up a fresh pot of boiling water for GF pasta and that I could choose from any of the dishes on the menu and substitute the GF pasta for the regular.  How could I turn down an offer like that??  My pasta was just as AMAZING as the customer service!
