Review is for Restaurant Week 2017 menu\n\nChica takes the spot of the former DB Brasserie in the Venetian.  I went for Restaurant Week dinner and I chose (with menu descriptions):\n\nEmpanadas Pabellon - Crispy arepa masa stuffed with braised ground beef, sweet plantains, black beans, queso fresco and spicy guasacaca pico\nPorchetta with crispy yucca hash - Slow roasted suckling pig, crispy brussels sprouts, fried yucca, pearl onion escabeche, pork jus\nTres leches dulce de leche - Traditional \"Three milks\" cake topped with toasted meringue, with exotic fruit pico\n\nThe empanadas were the let down of the meal.  You can see from the photo that the one was especially crisp and the bottom of that one was blacker in one spot.  Someone needs to watch the grill more carefully.  The empanadas were OK but they need more moisture.  The porchetta was flavored well and was juicy.  It had a crisp exterior.  The pork jus made the porchetta even more juicy.\n\nThe tres leches cake was the real winner of the night.  Excellent cake-moist throughout from the three milks.\n\nService was good but sometimes it was too good.  There was a busser who kept walking back and forth and took dirty plates almost as soon as you put down your silverware.  The table next to me had to ask for another share plate because he took the one she was using for shrimp tails she cleaned off her shrimp.\n\nThis is an OK place.
