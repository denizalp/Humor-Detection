I'm not exactly a strip bar expert, but I've been to enough of them that I know a good one when I see it. For Your Eyes has the best dancers (and by best I mean good looking and relatively sober at work), the shooters girls are really fun, and not trashy at all and it's the only place in the city where you can go with a big, mixed group and still have a blast. It's not cheap though, not by any means, but strippers are not exactly an area I would cut corners in.
