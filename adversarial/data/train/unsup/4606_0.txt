Not sure I WILL EVER GO BACK. I thought I was going to get that groovy dive or at least diner experience. Well yelpers, there was nothing groovy about my experience. \n\n1st to our server, sorry to have bothered you by coming in as you were coming down off your Meth high. This woman was definately an addict of some sort. After repeating our order several times and her running to the manager to ask questions, we finally got some food. \n\n2nd the food? Is this real food or a food substitute? I ordered 2 eggs over medium, a chicken breast instead of a steak, hashbrowns and toast. The eggs were sunny side up runny yuck. the chicken was rubbery with no flavor possible microwave victim. The hashbrowns were under cooked and the toast well buttered bread was more like it. \n\n3rd back to the server and service or lack there of. The server drops the check and then disappears for about 10 minutes. The bill was like $4.09 clearly that's not right for 2 breakfasts with beverages. So we hunt her down to let her know that she made an error & we were under charged. She snatched the reciept and says \"Oh you would have loved to have this check, huh?!\" She then turned and rushed to get a new receipt. No thank you nothing, RUDE! She came back dropped the new check and then disappeared for over 15 minutes. This check was charging me for 3 eggs, I got 2 eggs. Then she charged me for the steak breakfast plus an ala carte chicken breast! 15.00 later I am searching for a manager. The manager wasn't doing much better in the service department. She basically said I lied and had 3 eggs, because the toothless wonder in the kitchen said he remember cooking 3 eggs. I said did he remember that he cooked them wrong too?! \n\nBad bad bad!\n\nThis place looked like fun and it's closed to my house. Since they closed the village inn by me I thought this might be a good replacement. I was wrong!
