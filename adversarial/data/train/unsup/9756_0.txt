I was honestly disappointed when I came to Nobu. My highly anticipated reservation was on a Saturday night at prime time. Some would argue ... what did I expect? After all, it is SUPPOSED to be a fusiony Asian cuisine \/ Japanesey kind of place. \n\nI suppose for that, they're okay, but they're not so creative that it blows my mind, although it certainly blew my wallet. \n\nI didn't feel great value eating here, I didn't feel like they had fantastic service, or were amazingly impressionable. Or personable. Or anything really. I just felt like I went to an expensive restaurant to eat a meal. This is actually a far cry from my experiences elsewhere on the strip. Yes money is the reigning king in Vegas, but it doesn't mean you can get away with just anything if you have a name.\n\nI would pretty much pass, because it's kind of just a fancy, to be seen place. Not really great for food, drinks, or if you want to have a good time.
