Henry Vilas Zoo spoiled me. Seriously, how can anyone complain against a FREE zoo!? It's amazing!\n\nSure, it's not the biggest place, but for its size, the place has a lot to offer! Penguins, bears, turtles, rhinos, lions, giraffes, and even the adorable red pandas!? Plus, kids have a giant playground to run around. \n\nToo, there's a beach and large grassy areas right around the place. \n\nI loved coming to the zoo on my off days when I lived in town, and it's one of the things I now miss the most. Take advantage of it! :)
