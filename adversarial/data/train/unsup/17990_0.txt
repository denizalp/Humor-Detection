Taxco mexican restaurant, 9719 Sam Furr Rd, Ste E, Huntersville, NC, charged me 8.25% sales tax for my dinner tonight. I queried the waitress when I noticed the error, I was impolitely told, \"That's just the way we do it here!\" I showed her the correct sales tax rate (7.25%) from the Internet, and asked her how long this practice had been in effect, the waitress said,\"As long as I've been here, more than a year.\" They made no effort to correct this egregious, illegal error. Beware!!
