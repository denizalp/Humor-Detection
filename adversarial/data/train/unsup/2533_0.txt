3 stars because it's really crowded (but what vegas club isn't..) + music is loud to the point where I'm pretty sure my hearing has lessened even more.\nYou're not going to look cute with ear plugs, however you'll be safe.. sigh.\n\nNo pics cause whatever happens in Vegas stays in there, as does my phone. -____-\n\nI saw some eye candy, but this time we didn't hustle so I can't really comment on the nature of everyone there. Then again, a lot of them were not sober on the dance floor and it was packed like sardines.\n\nStayed there from 12am-5am, with some people eventually lessening up the dance floor so it was easier to breathe. \n\nThere's security occupying the entrances to all the floors and they're kind of douches. I left to go take a shit, and when I swam through the crowd, he didn't let back in. I explained to him that my friends were in there. I wasn't even drunk yet nor was I being incoherent, I just wanted to get back to my friends!! He didn't let me in for a couple minutes (it's the principle) but eventually he let me join them.  \n\nThe lasers and that jellyfish\/chandelier thing is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO cool. Lots of colors. Would suck if you were epileptic.\n\nIf you're on guestlist, good luck cause they make you wait outside in the blistering heat. If you have a vagina, goodie lol
