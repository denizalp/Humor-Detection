I pawned some music equipment here once and when i came to pick it up a day later big suprise it was missing a knob. Not only did they damage MY items that i pawned they refused reimbursement their customer service is terrible and quite frankly the level of unprofessionalism ranges from the sales people to the sensitive manager keith who is pron to being and acting like a little bitch. Never will i do business with them again these people are seriously as bright as a shit colored crayon
