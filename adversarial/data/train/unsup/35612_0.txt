Hands down the best cupcakes I have had. Was just walking by and saw their minimalistic, stylish display. Got their 4 for 12$ deal with one each of carrot, strawberry, turtle and lemon. Each was one fabulous. Light and not too sweet and the perfect size. And the way they served them in a cup was cute too. Tho they might be able to find a more environmentally friendly way to do it. Support your local business and be rewarded with a yummy delectable treat
