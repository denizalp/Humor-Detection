Really delicious dinner spot. \nTrendy, so wear your outfit to be seen in\nOnly one complaint, it was very loud! \n\nRESERVATIONS:\nThey do take them on Open Table. It's gets busy so make a reservation. We didn't have a reservation however they do have some lounge seating so we were able to sit there with full menu \n\nOUTDOOR SEATING AND BAR:\nThey have a nice large patio with misters\nThere are some stools around around the bar. I couldn't tell if people were just drinking there or also eating \n\nSERVICE: \nExcellent service, food was timed perfectly and they even split the dishes on separate plates (a friend and I shared a salad and entree) without us having to ask \n\nFOOD: \nThe portions were quite large, even the small plates section. \nThe trio of bruschetta is a great way to start the meal. The Mozzarella was a favorite of the group \nThe BEST part of the meal was the Sweet Potato Cannelloni. Very flavorful and well seasoned. \n\nPARKING:\nThere are spaces in the area and a parking garage
