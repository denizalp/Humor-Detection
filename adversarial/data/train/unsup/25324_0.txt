I am traumatized from years of having my brows overwaxed (and even burnt) by inexperienced estheticians in my tween years and I hadn't let anyone touch my brows since. \n\nFurthermore, I've always felt unsure of my brows and insecure in knowing how to tidy them, fill them in, what shape looks best on me, etc. After loads of research and skepticism, I eventually found Eye Love on Yelp and booked a Brow Fix Consult & Shaping appointment with Mary. \n\nMary answered all of my questions and I walked out feeling confident in my newly tidied brows and new-found knowledge on how to properly apply makeup to them. Mary wasn't tweeze-crazy and didn't pile on the makeup; my brows looked super natural and neat - just as I have always wanted. Basically, Mary is a total brow wizard and I will only trust her with my brows in the future. \n\nHighly recommend!
