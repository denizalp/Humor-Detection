Where do I start?  There were so many good things about this Tommy Bahama experience that I think I could live there.  They'd probably mind that though, huh?\n\nMy sis & I shopped at the cute Tommy Bahama store attached to the restaurant and bar before we decided it would be the perfect place for happy hour!  They had a lot of delicious looking specialty drinks but we narrowed our choice to the Blueberry Basil Smash.  And even though it was $12 a drink and we were expecting martini glass cocktails, we were happily surprised when the drinks arrived in pint glasses looking like blueberry mojitos.  :)  We definitely got our moneys worth!  These drinks are the bomb!!!  My sis found the recipe online (http:\/\/www.tommybahama.com\/TBG\/Stores_Restaurants\/Drink_of_the_Month.jsp) and then ordered us both mojito muddlers too!  It won't be the same sipping this cocktail without her, but I'll cheers her every time I make it!\n\nThe menu was filled with yummy food too.  We ordered the Coconut Shrimp and then changed our minds and got the Scallop Sliders.  These had fresh basil and cilantro on them and they were so fresh and flavorful!  I love sliders and they're always made with meat so I don't get to enjoy them.  It was kind of a fantasy to find seafood sliders.  :)\n\nThe vibe was Carribean and we felt like we were on a tropical vacation with the steel drum and reggae music.  I wish Tommy Bahama had a hotel so I could stay longer.  Definitely worth the trip!
