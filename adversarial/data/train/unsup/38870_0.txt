My fiance and I have been coming here almost every Sunday for the past three years. I love everything about it. The waitstaff is extremely friendly and they're always smiling and upbeat. The service is great, even when it's extremely busy, which it usually is on Sundays. I've never had to worry about someone coming to refill my coffee, they always come around and offer refills at the perfect times. The coffee itself is GREAT. Best coffee at a restaurant I think I've ever had, and it's always served hot and tastes fresh. The food has never been disappointing. I tend to order the same two menu items frequently, but any time I try something new it's always good. The only remotely negative thing about this place is it's very popular so there does tend to be a wait time when we come in. However it's usually only 10 minutes tops and I think it's well worth the wait.  I will continue to come here every Sunday for as long as it's open.
