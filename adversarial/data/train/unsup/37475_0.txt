The Border Grill took great care of us and our 50 guests for our May wedding. We rented the north side dining room and patio. The weather was mid-80s so the 7:30 pm ceremony and reception were outside...beautiful, perfect and plenty of room!\n\nWe supplied the decorations the morning of the wedding, and Gracious and the staff decorated for us. Talk about awesome ~ It allowed us more sun time at the pool with our friends and family! \n\nAutumn and the crew were attentive and fun. The food was delicious. We selected a variety of passed appetizers. It was a great way to sample a bunch of different bites while mingling. Dessert note: The tres leches cake is a must ~ so amazing!\n\nThe whole event was easy and relaxing. We highly recommend Border Grill for someone looking for a classy yet laid-back wedding and reception venue.
