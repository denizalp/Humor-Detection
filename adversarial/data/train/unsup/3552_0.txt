I lived in Big Creek Apartments for about a year and have very schizophrenic feelings about them. I'll split my review up into things I liked vs. things I didn't like for the sake of brevity.\n\nThings I like:\n\n- cost value is very good. I lived in a 2 BR 2BA apartment that was about 1300 sqft for $850\/mo. A garage was included in that price.\n\n- location is good for Parma. Now, I won't at all claim that Parma the loveliest place to dwell in the Cleveland area but it is safe and if you are going to live in Parma, this location is as good as it gets. It is located right on the Big Creek Reservation so there is plenty of wooded area and looks very nice.\n\n- the apartment buildings look nice and the grounds are very well maintained.\n\nThings I didn't like (Okay, hated):\n\n- the leasing staff are a-holes. Literally, they are some of the most miserable human beings I have met. They will treat you very nice and are extremely helpful before you move in, but that will be the end of it. Good luck if you need help after that. They will be rude and completely disregard you and your requests. In fact, everything you ask to be done they will tell you that they \"don't deal with that\". \n\n- maintenance requests are done quickly but NEVER done right the first time. Our apartment flooded 3 times due to a faulty water heater that they refused to replace and we had similar problems with 2 other appliances. Although the maintenance staff was generally friendly, they must like to spend a lot of time with tenants because they always have to make follow-up visits. Maintenance requests also have to be made online or by phone so there is no way to get confirmation that you actually submitted one.\n\n- there is no storage space in the floor plans. Although our apartment was fairly large, we didn't have any room to store anything so we ended up having to rent a storage unit. Closet space and other storage areas are almost non-existent.\n\n- the pool hours are ridiculous. They only let you swim when there is a \"lifeguard\" (hot teenage girl) on duty so basically every hour or so they make everyone get out of the pool so she can take a break. Also, the pool hours are very limited and the \"season\" that they keep it open is literally barely a month.\n\n- the fitness center is very poor. Most of the equipment doesn't work and the weight machines are so old that they are pretty well useless.\n\n- water\/sewer costs are very high. First of all, other than houses that I have rented, this is the only apartment that has every made tenants pay for water\/sewer and since they just bill you with your rent, you have no way of knowing if they are ripping you off. The bills have been astronomical despite the fact that there were only 2 of us and we used very little water. That said, our other utility costs were fairly low.\n\nOverall, I would not recommend Big Creek to a friend. The price seems attractive but in Parma you can rent a house for about the same price and probably end up better off. Plus, until they fire the lazy pricks who work in the front office, I wouldn't set foot on their property.
