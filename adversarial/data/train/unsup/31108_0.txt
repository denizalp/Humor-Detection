Four staff working the line, less than 10 people in the place when I order at the end of the lunch rush and a 20 min wait for a hot sandwich tub? Food is good, but having ordered this same item multiple times at other locations busier than this, it appears as though they've either got new staff or weak management. Food was great, but would have been better with ten extra mins to eat instead of shoveling food in.
