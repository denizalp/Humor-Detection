Stopped in here once just to check it out. I asked the bar tender if he had anything on special. Immediately  he told me to \"Get a job\". Then he said he can understand some locals coming in and wanting cheap drinks but not someone with an ASU hat and an American Eagle shirt. I apologized to the guy because I didn't mean to come across as being cheap. Blew it off and he got me a drink.\n\nOther than that one incident, the place looks pretty fun. Perhaps I just had a stressed out bar tender. However, it's not okay to treat friendly customers that way. I don't plan on going back or recommending this place to anyone.
