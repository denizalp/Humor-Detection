If they didn't have their deal of $56 for two nights in a two-bedroom suite, with a free bottle of alcohol included, I probably would not have come here. Quite honestly, this is the \"cheapest\" hotel I've been to in Vegas, but when you're out celebrating with some friends and you're not planning to stay in the hotel for long, this is a good place to be.\n\nCome on, $56 for two nights? In Vegas? On The Strip? With free alcohol? That's an amazing plus! I was actually super satisfied with the location, since it's right across from great hotels like Caesar's Palace and Bellagio. It's also within reasonable walking distance from other hotels like Aria, The Venetian, and New York New York.\n\nOn the downside, the layout of the place is confusing -- Mark S. and I had a room in Tower 4, and it took forever to walk there until we found out a shortcut. Even with the shortcut, it'd take forever to get to our rooms because EVERYONE was using the same elevator to get to their rooms on different towers. Yikes. Not to mention that the rooms are really basic -- just a step above Holiday Inn or motels. Pretty warm in the casino, too, in general. Customer service isn't the best, either.\n\nStill, you get what you pay for, and IP actually did go beyond my expectations for its incredibly cheap price. But if you plan to impress someone or if you want to \"go big,\" look anywhere else on The Strip but this place.
