I'm a sucker for pizza. The kind that is made by a passionate pizza maker and fresh ingredients. I avoid chains and the line of frozen ones. I was referred here by another patron who shares my passion of toppings, rustic bright sauce, and classic chewy dough. \n\nFunny story-  I ordered two pizzas yesterday. One cheese and another layered with fresh veggies. My family enjoyed a mere three unbelievable pieces of hot stretchy cheese and the like and decided to go for a quick swim. We returned to a happy pooch sitting between two eaten and proudly chewed up pizza boxes. Seriously! My pup pounded his pie hole eating both large pizzas. Grrrrrr... \n\nI couldn't help to repeat the order today because the pies were so good. Stretchy, house-made cheese atop a variety of toppings makes this my new pizza go-to.  Their specialty pies are also unique. Chicken lover? Then order their crispy chicken sandwich. It's unreal and topped with slaw and dressing on a soft brioche bun. Their herb shrimp app is also filling dunked in butter and herbs. I can't rate the service as we ordered takeout. But, based on the cleanliness of the restaurant and friendliness of the host I can only guess they take care of their customers.
