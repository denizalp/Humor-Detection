If you long for the days of music done on a Casio and really like rocking out to Slayer, CCR, Radiohead, KORN, and a slathering of other random mixes this place is for you. If you hope to learn proper words to songs via the karaoke prompts, get annoyed by random mismatched Asian videos playing behind your rendition of Simon and Garfunkel's \"Sound of Silence\", this place is not for you. \n\nWhat this place provided was a smoke free, belly busing laughing good time after a giant dinner on my 40th birthday. It is a place that was recommended by the hotel's concierge and though we had nothing to eat, they did provide a menu and a few of us ordered cocktails and beer. No Kirin (this is a Korean not Japanese establishment) but they did have Sapporo. \n\nThe jokes were flying, the music was awful but we had a great time and I might do something like this again but now I know what to and what not to expect. \n\nFairly cheap entertainment and thankfully, some of my girlfriends and I were able to bust out some old rap songs we remembered from the 80's and could sing acapella so we could get away from the Casio beats.
