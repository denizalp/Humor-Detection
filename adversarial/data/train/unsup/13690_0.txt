You say \"Tomato I say Tamato,\" You say \"Coffee and I say STARBUCKS!\" What a beautiful location. Unlike most Starbucks in the valley this central location has really peaked my interest. Not only is it renovated but it is not your typical modern feel. It has an Arizona Artsy twist to it. Very nice inside with plenty of seating. Matter of fact their is a large private meeting room that is enclosed by glass doors. Perfect place to rent out for a meeting and enjoy your favorite Starbucks drink. \n\nThis is a drive-thru location however, I have only picked up to go as a walk in. The staff is very attentive and friendly. My drink and food were made to order perfectly.  I walked the small shopping area inside that is stocked with all the great Starbucks coffee mugs, cups, snacks and much more. They even have a cooler for fast pick to go items. \n\nThe really cool thing I noticed when checking out is they sell a treat by Sassy Cake by Nina. Very cool of Starbucks to support a local business. \n\nThis is now my new spot. Way to go Starbucks on 7th Ave.
