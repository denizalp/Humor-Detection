The Good:\nThis place is in a pretty prime location downtown as it is located to some of the best eateries downtown (Merts, Pita Pit), a few blocks from Bobcat Arena, walking distance to Bank of America Stadium, and a stones throw from the heart of Charlotte (Trade\/Tryon).  \n\nThe room had an ipod dock which was a nice touch.\n\nThey seem to operate on the honor system when it comes to receiving more room keys.  I stumbled downstairs at about 2:30 in the morning, asked what room my party was staying in and was promptly given a room key.\n\nCollege St. turns into a ghost town at about 2:30 at night, so it is very easy to make your way back to the hotel from the Buckhead Saloon, which if situated anywhere else would be an inadvertent vehicular manslaughter waiting to happen.\n\nThe Bad:\nSee Austin J's review regarding payment policy and competency of front desk.  At least worth -2 stars.\n\nTheir televisions could be called outdated... at best.  I am fairly confident that their analog tv's will go the way of the dinosaurs when the changeover happens next year.\n\nThe beds.  This is not 18th century America. People no longer reach maximum biological size at 5'8 160 pounds.  Don't advertise a room as comfortably accommodating four when it would be a snug fit for the cast of Little People Big World.\n\n3 years ago I was charged $80 dollars for a flower pot that I ALLEGEDLY broke.
