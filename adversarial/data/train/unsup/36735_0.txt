Good singles scene at night on the weekends. The place wasn't totally packed, but had enough people to keep you there for a few hours. Beers were about $5 and the crowd wasn't that \"scottsdale\" crowd that I had heard about, plus no cover charge. There also are a few back rooms and outdoor areas and plenty of TV's. Also tried some appetizers on a previous visit and the stuffed cherry peppers were the highlight of that bunch of Happy Hour specials.
