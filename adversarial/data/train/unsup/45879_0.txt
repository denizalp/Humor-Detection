Love it here. The sales are always great and even the things that aren't on sale you can get a coupon online for 50% off any regular priced item. I just screenshot the coupon and the cashier scans it for me. All the Halloween and fall decor was like 50-75% off! I advise you not coming here with your boyfriend unless they're into crafts too (which he isn't) because then you'll hear a lot of complaining on when you'll be done. Uhhhhh? Never!
