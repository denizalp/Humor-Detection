The hostess was a doll but dinner went downhill from there. Group of 9 with reservations at 7:30 on a Saturday in October. I'm not sure if the server was trying to pace us so slowly but this dinner dragged on forever. \n\nThey were out of both Halibut and Lobster. Not even enough lobster to go into the mac & cheese. Very disappointing. I asked for the bread once we put in drink orders and began ordering entrees, and the server told me there was a protocol. And to wait. We had already been there 30 minutes? Give me the bread for love of.... (Spoiler:Bread was anticlimactic). \n\nFood arrives. Nothing stood out to me. We ordered brussel sprouts, mac & cheese, green beans, steaks, Steak was cooked well but no flavor. How disappointing! Worst steak I've had in Vegas. I'm so sad to have to say that. \n\nAll the credit for me not leaving this place and abandoning the group goes to my dear JC. He had me laughing the whole night. Harder than I've laughed, since college. So, if you're coming here, make sure you bring a good friend.
