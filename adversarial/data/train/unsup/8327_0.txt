Went to Triple George with a party 7 for lunch. A waiter (not ours) brought over an ice tea and said he had an extra one does, would anyone like it. So i said, sure i'll take it. And he goes \"just to be clear, its not free, we would have to charge you for it, but i wanted to see if you wanted it before i dumped it out.\" Um...if you are planning to dump it out anyway, why not just let us have it??? Weirdly enough, two other friends of mine said that exact same thing happened to them at this restaurant. I won't be eating here again. The food was just eh, but I can't overlook the \"either you pay for it or we dispose of it\" bad customer service. So so tacky.
