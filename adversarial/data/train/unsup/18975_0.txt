We ordered takeout from this place.  Based on other reviews, we were worried about the amount of food we would receive and if it would be packaged well, but we were pleasantly surprised that we received a normal amount of food and nothing was spilled or leaking.\n\nThe food itself tasted good, but it was just entirely too greasy and oily.  The vegetable handi we ordered was just sitting in so much oil.  The spinach curry and tikka masala were also swimming in far too much oil.\n\nI did enjoy the texture of the naan, fluffy yet crispy on the bottom.  The samosas tasted nice but they did not provide the red and green dipping sauce, which is the best part of eating samosas!  Without the sauces it's just fried mashed up potatoes.\n\nI will likely not order from here again, but I do not regret ordering from here, if that makes sense.\n\nFYI tip for others - the medium spice level is really not that spicy at all. if you are looking for a bit of heat, go for hot!
