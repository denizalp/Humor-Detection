I parked on the street and paid the meter which had a few minutes remaining from someone previous. I had a sub the Clevelander. I eat the whole Clevelander. I enjoy the logo design of a giant pickle climbing the terminal tower. What do we really have to say for ourselves when we can buy giant hoagies and navigate astounding heights ? I am enjoying Cleveland in the summer, drones, plane safety, and pickles.
