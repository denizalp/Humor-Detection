I saw an advertisement for WLIA and felt it was time to consider this option. I was very impressed with the comprehensive program they offer, it's more than a surgery and you're on your own, there is a nutritionist, a consult with a Exercise Physiologist, monthly support group meeting, FB and online resources as well as a very friendly and supportive staff. I felt their financial options were very reasonable and over all I'm very impressed with WLIA. Dr. DeBarros was personable and answered questions without making me feel like he was in a rush. I felt well informed and in capable hands. After researching Dr. DeBarros' extensive experience in bariatric surgery and health issues with weight make me feel confident that I'm in the best hands possible.
