Pretty place with pretty decor with pretty drinks with pretty chairs (yes the chairs are in plastic but still pretty). I come here ONLY and MAINLY, EXCLUSIVELY for bubble tea. Any season is bubble tea season. Tea tea tea drink tea. Add stuff everywhere! Tapioca pearls, lychee or mango or anything! Your choice! \n\nI usually take everything regular but no ice! Who needs ice??? Without ice, more tea to drink!\n\nBut the wait is long within rush hours.
