This stuff is absolutely amazing. Good lord that moist brisket has my mouth watering as I type this. A bit pricey, but worth the wait and the drive. We drove approx. 40 minutes and waited about 1.5 hours in line for food. We spent $60 on 1lb moist brisket, 1 lb ribs (3 ribs), .5lb smoked turkey, grits, baked beans, and coleslaw.
