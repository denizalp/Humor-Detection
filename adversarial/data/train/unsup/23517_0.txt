Stay away even if you have a groupon! Worst company I've ever dealt with! I had a Groupon for $20 worth of groceries plus a fresh produce box. After they delivered they had charged me for my entire order as if they forgot my special deal and I had to wait two weeks for that refund to later find out they were still charging me $16 just for delivering it to my house although online it said the charge would only be $6! Thanks for those hidden fees Winder Farms. And now a month later after I cancelled my account due to unsatisfied customer service, they have randomly charged me $30 for who the hell knows?! And I probably won't receive that refund for another two weeks, how lovely is that! I am not happy because of Winder Farms and refuse to ever use their services again.
