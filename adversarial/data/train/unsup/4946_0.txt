Stayed here over EDC weekend.\n\nBeautiful property but it didn't feel as luxurious as some of my other 5 star hotel stays. They have a very lovely pool for their guests that is clean and well maintained. However, I found it rather hard to get help in service such as trying to book a dinner reservation within the property or day club info.\n\nAlso, my next door neighbor flipped out and began yelling, pounding, and throwing food and dishes down the hallway. I had to call security because I was too afraid to leave the room. I was told them would stop by to let me know when it was safe to leave but no one ever followed up with me. I ended up showing the front desk photos of how they trashed the floor, even breaking the floor decor and overturning the trash then emptying its contents around the elevators. I'm pretty shocked that the resort did not offer to move me to a different room\/floor or offer any compensation since I was a paying customer during one of the most expensive weekends in Las Vegas.\n\nBased on my stay here, I would give a 3.5 star but I am bumping it down due to the lack of service or follow up.
