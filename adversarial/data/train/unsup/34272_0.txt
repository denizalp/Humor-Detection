BEWARE!! The furniture this company sells is cheap crap!!!  All you have to do is read most of the bad reviews and it's all TRUE!! We bought a sofa living room set from them and it reeked of chemical smell SO bad that we couldn't even stand sitting on it.  I had my arm placed on the arm rest for awhile and my arm actually smelt like toxic chemicals afterwards! It made me wonder what the manufacturer was so I looked at the tag under the foot rests and it's from Vietnam... this company is obviously ordering CHEAP products and they don't give a damn because we tried to return it after the 2nd day and they DO NOT take ANY returns at all and it's because they know they sells cheap crap and people want to return it when they realize!!!!!  We ended up moving the set out of our house and buying a whole new one again at Living Spaces and are very happing with that set.. we will NEVER step foot again into a cheap Ashley store.. this company needs to go bye bye !!!!!!!!!!
