Sheherzade is the sister restaurant of Pomegranate in the College and Bathurst area. Just like Pomegranate the emphasis is Persian cuisine with particular attention paid to Kabobs and Dizi. I have tried the Kabobs and they are fantastic. As far as the Kabobs go I would recommend the Bakhtiari Kabob as you would get the best of both chicken and beef worlds. If you're a bit more adventurous, then give Dizi (also called Abgousht) a try. Dizi is a slow cooked lamb stew mixed with chick peas and potatoes with aromatics that will have you drooling over the fresh pieces of Persian flat bread.\n\nFurthermore, the staff is highly attentive and will take their time to explain every dish on the menu in great detail. \n\nBottom line, Sheherzade, was created to deliver the feel and taste of a traditional Dizi restaurant in Iran and with its authentic decor and excellent Persian dishes it delivers what it promises. Highly recommended!\n\nFood: A\nService: A\nFood presentation: A\nAtmosphere: A\nPrices: B+\nRecommended?:  Yes
