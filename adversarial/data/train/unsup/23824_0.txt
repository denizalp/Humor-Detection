Ladies, make sure you tell your man to bring you to this little old school steak house.  Fellas, you want to bring your ladies here, all the staff with take care of the rest.  They will definitely take care of you.  As you walk down stairs into the steak house.  The host will greet you and hand all the women long steam red roses.  Everyone here was so friendly and enjoyable.  \n\nI came with a group of three ladies celebrating a birthday on a Friday night.  We all order the ten ounce filet.  This came with the following: salad, sorbet, meat with all the sides, and dessert.  \n\nThe handsome salad man, who tosses salad all night long, will come over to the table and make you the perfect salad with whatever you want on your personal salad.  First chose you dressing and then you can add whatever you want.  \n\nAfter the salad you will be served sorbet which will cleanse your pallet for your main course.  When our filet came out, it looked so delicious.  The filet was served with garlic whipped mashed potatoes, green and white asparagus, and b√©arnaise sauce.  The steak was succulent and devine. It was cooked just how I like it.  I will definitely be coming back.  \n\nThis is great place for anniversaries, Valentine 's Day, or any date or event.
