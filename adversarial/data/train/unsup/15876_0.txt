The owner was there on the evening i went. I am going to agree with the guy above she was not a good person. She without a doubt costs her bartenders tips, and customers. Too bad she is oblivious to her customers needs and anyone else in her vicinity because she really wasn't a bad looking women. Oh well next time I'll go to Torrey pines pub.
