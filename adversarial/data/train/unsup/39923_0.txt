We were looking for a quick bite after the show at Harkins 101. This place is just a few doors down from the theater, and was the perfect choice. The restaurant is clean and welcoming. The menu has a wide variety of Mediterranean delites. We shared the stuffed grape leaves to start. They were yummy. We both had chicken kabobs. They can be served over rice or salad. We both chose the Shirazi salad, a finely chopped salad of tomatoes, cucumbers and onions with a lime dressing. It was excellent. We will definitely plan to return. Check it out.
