Still comparing vermicelli bowls in town, I found myself here. The glowing reviews made me do admit, I must admit.\n\nIt's located in an old strip mall along Sahara Ave. The place was empty and the air smelled like old grease - the type that sticks to your hair and clothes, a pet peeve of mine.\n\nShould I get pho? Banh mi? Rice combo? Appetizers? \n\nBun Thit Nuong Cha Gio:\nHuge portion. Lots of noodles, egg rolls and meat. However, I was not impressed by the taste of the egg rolls. I didn't like them at all and I just can't figure out what exactly I didn't like about it. Were they fishy and salty? Maybe. I haven't had this dish I did not finish so, this was a first. 2\/5\n\nCom Dac Biet:\nSteamed rice with grilled pork, sausage, pork cake, and egg. Pork cake? Por que? It's not what you think it is. It's like meatloaf slices made of pork. 3\/5\n\nBanh Mi Thit Nuong:\nA huge fat sandwich with grilled pork and veggies. Oh my goodness, this thing is thick and delicious. They bake the bread on premise so, when you get your sandwich it is so lovely and warm. You'll ask, \"where have you been all my life?\" Whatever bad things I said in the previous paragraphs, just disregard them. Their Banh mi more than made up for everything. Your first bite, the warm flakey crunchy bread...oh, my! And it's packing some good meat...lots of it. It's just perfection. It's about $6 and it can feed 2 people. Those places that sell sub  sandwiches has nothing on this. 5\/5\n\nSo, yes, come here for the Banh mi and take it to-go. Skip the egg rolls.
