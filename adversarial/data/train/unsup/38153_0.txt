We had just finished a round of golf at Vista Verde, and were heading home, when we decided we were hungry. So we decided to stop at Cousins, and get some sandwiches to go.\n\nThis is a little sandwich shop similar to Subway. However, you do not get to choose your ingredients for your sandwiches in an assembly line manner.  Their main selling point seems to be the price and their different types of breads, and quality of ingredients.\n\nNothing special, and not the best sandwich shop in the area.  But it was good, fast, filling, and convenient.
