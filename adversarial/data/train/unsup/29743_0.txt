I love Crossfit Infinite Strength! I recently moved to another state and am sad because I haven't been able to find a new gym with the same level of programming expertise and knowledgeable coaches. They take the time to write the programs based on what their members want to achieve and have periodic fitness tests so that you can track how much you are improving! Another aspect that I loved is that the workouts aren't just \"Crossfit\" workouts but strength and skill programs as well. The gym is run by a wonderful family and they take pride in having great coaches, the best equipment and keeping the gym clean and safe!! I would highly recommend this gym!
