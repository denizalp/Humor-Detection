Easily one of the best Bahn Mi in the city. This review is based upon the sandwich experience, I haven't tried much else here yet, but the soup was very good too. It always drove me nuts that a city stocked with the two main requirements for Bahn Mi - fresh french bread and great asian stores - couldn't ever properly put the two together. Or at least I haven't been able to find one yet. So this one definitely was legit. Warm bread, traditional fillings and balanced flavour.\n\nI dig the low key location too, and the staff (I believe family run) were great and really nice people.
