The food is okay. Had Queso and chips, Caesar salad, Filet and Lobster tail.  The Queso was excellent, and the Caesar salad was mediocre if you like lots of bitter lettuce drenched in low end dressing with tasteless parmesan. I cannot comment on the Filet or Lobster because after 2hrs I cancelled the order.  FOODIE BEWARE! Abhorrent service and management! What a joke! Can see the potential but the current version, NO THANKS!
