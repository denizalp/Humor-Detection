Priti is amazing with her work ethic and knowledge as well as experience in the skin care business. She is not going to necessarily tell you what you want to hear about your skin after a consultation she's going to tell you what you NEED to hear and make every effort to help you achieve healthy skin. Hands down best facials I have ever had. Great at waxing, EVERYTHING. And for those ladies hailing from big cities used to and struggling to find someone who uses hard wax for Brazilians, this is your lady!  I'm sad to see less than 5 star reviews for this business. If you're looking for someone who is professional and passionate of her work, than of course she's popular (be on time for your appointment and you'll get what you need).. If you have bad skin and expect a general facial that won't help your skin well be ready for honest feedback otherwise there are plenty of run of the mill spas all over Charlotte for you to pick from.  La Petit Spa is independently own and Priti is truly passionate about her work and her clients. Her business doesn't win best of Charlotte year after year for nothing!
