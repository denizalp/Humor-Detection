This place is great! The sandwiches are delicious and the bread is fresh and fantastic. Keep in mind, it might take extra minutes to be ready but that's because everything is made fresh and to perfection. The pastry's are also very delicious. Friendly service too! Everyone that has served me there has been very upbeat and pleasant. I will keep coming back.
