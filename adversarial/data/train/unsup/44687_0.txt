My favorite thing here, ok I lied. 2 favorite things:\n\n1: They bring you giant drinks out on the patio.  Staff is usually friendly, remember me and make excellent Vodka Presses.  Ask for extra lemon! \n2. I love the Ahi Tuna salad.  The cucumber \"spaghetti\" with wasabi dressing is delicious.  I order it every time. \n\nIf you don't want a vodka drink and Japanese salad there are other choices.\nI've had a variety of other salads, burgers, sandwiches, etc.\nI think their cuisine has improved over the years.  \nThe outside patio has a big pond with a fountain.  It's nice.\nPerfect for large groups, tons of space, 2 separate areas that can be rented out for private meetings or parties. Own parking lot. 14 minutes from downtown or 5 minutes from EPIC.
