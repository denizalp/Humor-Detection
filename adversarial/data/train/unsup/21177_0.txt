Cici's is a buffet-style pizza restaurant for family-style eating. This location has a nice salad bar, fresh, hot pizza, low, low prices, and is nearly always crowded on weekends. I took my twins here tonight, and it was a mob scene. \n\nThe help is cheerful and efficient. They know how to keep the food moving and the people moving and the mouths full. With a crowd like the one we saw tonight, it's hard for the bus boys to move through the aisles and clean tables, though. These people hustle!\n\nThis is definitely a \"strap on the proverbial feedbag,\" inexpensive, all-you-can-eat restaurant. I'm always sadly amused at the number of exceedingly obese people who frequent this place. Tonight, there seemed to be an inordinate number of flatulent fatties wearing stretch clothing and tattoos, and smelling like they hadn't bathed after afternoon orgies in the hog barn. \n\nThe pizza was great, but the ambient odors from the guests were, well, off-putting to say the least! Even my 11-year-olds were grossed out by the egregious display of gluttony and poor hygiene! But, we're all guys, so that didn't stop us from eating.\n\nHey, at these prices, with such tasty comfort food and no limits, you get all the hungry dregs of humanity. It's a freak show, but we'll be back with the kids. \n\n(I need to get to a real haute cuisine place soon, to recover from this!)
