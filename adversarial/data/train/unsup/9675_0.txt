Truly one of calgary's finest dining establishments. Removes the pretension of having to order food by name, and replaces with convenient and multi-lingual numerals. \n\nI highly recommend their fried meat sandwiches, served with a side of fried potatoes. Perhaps a nice cup of 2014 Coca-Cola would pair nicely. \n\nMagnificent.
