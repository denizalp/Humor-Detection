I have always been a CFA fan over the years. In fact, if you pore through my profile long enough you will see Cfa reviews from Florida, Arizona, California, and (maybe) Texas.\n\nThose chicken sandwiches are always scrumptious and those waffle fries are always crisp and tasty. I HAVE to get myself to try more menu items one day, but I just love those chicken sandwiches so much that it might be a while!\n\nPlus the service has ALWAYS been so friendly and kind. Especially from the guys taking the orders on the outside all the time. The guy that took my order today (I believe his name was Aiden) was very engaging and personable. Good service always makes a great impression, no matter where you go!\n\nChick-Fil-A is always consistently good quality food with friendly service with a smile. What's not to love?? I will be back. Repeatedly.\n\n\n4 stars.
