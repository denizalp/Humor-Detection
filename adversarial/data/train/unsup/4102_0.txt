Excellent concept with horrible support. The people working here are so slow that it will take you hours to even remove a screw. \n\nI went there to get a wheel for my bike and was unfortunately served by the slowest guy in the world. He started eyeballing the wheel size, then got me the incorrect one and then after 40 min told me that he doesn't have anything that would fit. Why waste 40 min if you are a professional?\n\nNext time, I went to get an Allen key to unscrew something, it took them 20 min to tell me that they have set up a self serve station outside - that didn't have the alley key I wanted.\n\nSo, the professional staff at bikechain has no clue about what they are doing and are very slow to tell you that they know nothing. If you are planning to learn basic bike repair here - go somewhere else.
