I called and asked for a quote. When I was quoted a price much lower than I was expecting I immediately booked an appointment. Ian and James showed up on time, were very professional and friendly. They were able to remove everything from the property that I couldn't put into the regular trash cans and were done in about 20-30 minutes. The price was more than fair, and the service was excellent! I highly recommend the Pick-up Artists for all your junk removal needs!
