Hi, welcome to Best Buy!!\n\nsdfasdhfljkdsh\n\nThat's the only response they get from me, a response so vague it really is just a sound. No customer service whatsoever, like the other reviewer said, two employees were chatting and we were standing looking right at them wondering where iPad cases were and they looked and continued chatting! hmmm???\n\nUsing the powers of walking and sight, we were able to locate them but I still think we should have had some type acknowledgment. Pretty basic like much all of the other Best Buy's. I would recommend Fry's Electronics where although the employees can be just as idiotic, at least there is a way better selection of what you need.
