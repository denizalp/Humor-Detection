As of yesterday, this place has officially closed. Sushi Rock started going down hill around 2011 and continued to plummet to levels below belief, especially when you consider the highs it once soared to.  I just wish I had the recipe for the sauce they used to toss their fried calamari and shrimp in.\n\n\nThe place smelled like it had been cleaned using rancid dish towels and their sushi smelled the same the last time I was here; dirty menus, bad service and overpriced portions are the only things left here. Buyer beware, I wouldn't be surprised if everyone walked away from here with food poisoning.
