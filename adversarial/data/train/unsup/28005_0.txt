Loving the new salon! its really pretty in there and still has the wonderful touches as the FT Apache location. I will say though i hate the drive. Going from the Ft apache location all the way to the Hard Rock hotel is a pain in the A$$! But! having Sarah style my hair is always going to be worth the drive.
