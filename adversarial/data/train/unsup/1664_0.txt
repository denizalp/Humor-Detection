this is my third time at Tao and while i have a great time at Tao, it is WAY TOO crowded. the music is good. the girls in the stone bath, bird cage, and lounges are super hot! the main dance floor is hell so avoid it like the plague. when tao beach is open, it's a great place to go. more air, more space. the side room is also super chill and you can lean on the chairs to rest your feet. =)\n\nthis last time happened to be Kim Kardasian's bday so it was even more crowded in the main dance floor. everyone stood underneath the balcony with their cameras out. it literally took 10 min to move 1 foot. super annoying! And, there was a line to go down from Tao Beach. err? \n\n4 stars for the ambiance and music. 2 stars for overcrowding.
