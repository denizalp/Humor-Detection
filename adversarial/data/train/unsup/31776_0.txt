I've been in Vegas for  25+yrs. and I utilized MANY PT places whether to avoid surgery or after surgery. I've had 2 shoulder surgeries and am trying to avoid neck surgery, my rrhap has been absolutely amaxing..The staff from the front desk, Aimee to ALL of your PT staff, Colby, Ashley, etc.. have been kind, professional, supportive and actually listen. Arturo is wonderful. He knows exactly what he's doing. I would and have recommended  this facility to family & friends.
