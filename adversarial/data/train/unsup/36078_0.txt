Nice atmosphere. Good selection of unusual & hard to find  wines. You must order food in order to get a table (not sure why but we were told that when we arrived). There is a selection of small plates. Food was good but plates were quite small. Ordered hummus, bison sliders & bruschetta. Pours are 2 or 4 ounces or by the bottle. Server let me try a taste of a wine and brought me something else when I didn't like the selection.
