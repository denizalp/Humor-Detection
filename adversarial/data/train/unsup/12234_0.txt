decent bar, with some good 2 for 1 specials, a lot more english speaking than some of the other bars in montreal, and there is always an ass ton of girls working!!  i try to get out to montreal once a year and cleopatra is definitely worth a look, it's a lot more user friendly than all the tourist rip offs on st catherine st
