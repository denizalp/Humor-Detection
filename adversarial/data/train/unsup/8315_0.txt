There are days when I wake up feeling a bit down. It's hard to describe the low mood, but I think the best analogy would be a fleck of whale shit resting on the lowest part of the Continental Shelf. \nNot even depression meds help when this mood hits. \n\nI don't reach for my dad's 50 caliber Desert Eagle.\nAnd I don't sit around thinking up flamboyant ways to off myself that will make all my friends, like; \"Wow dude, he really kissed himself with a fireplace poker?\"\n\nThinking this way accomplishes nothing, other than the good feelings I get fantasizing about the many millions who showed up at my funeral and are now so distraught their lives will be in upheaval forever.\n\nThere's only one remedy for me. \nWalMart.\n\nWalMart is the place where I go for solace. \nTo remind myself that I have all my teeth, I don't have a bubble-butt with a ledge (in yoga pants), that I know the difference between Armani and Martha Stewart, I can count without the aid of my digits, I don't breathe through my mouth, and I know enough to not wear a tie-dyed beater two sizes two small, exposing my midriff.\n\nIf there was ever such thing as 'comfort food for the brain\" this is it. \n\nGod bless America and Sam Walton, his billionaire heirs and heiresses, and all the uber-losers who shop there and while doing so,  unknowingly recharge my self esteem batteries.\n\nNote:\nI don't mean to imply everyone who shops at WalMart is an uber loser. They're not. \nIt's more akin to spotting a punch-buggy in traffic. \nThey're there. You know they're there.\nYou just need to scour the aisles until you find one....hitting self esteem gold.
