I have yet to have a bad experience here.  Oh wait, I was here once while ill, but I can't blame that on them.\n\nEach time I come I try something different and I've not been disappointed yet.  Their Feta Rosa is excellent.  The live music is always great and the servers are cheerful and cute.\n\nI've worn my \"bearded for her pleasure\" shirt here and I think it actually got me better service!
