Yes, I'm giving it 4stars. I was very hesitant on staying here with all the negative reviews, but I did. Let me first back up and say I only stayed here becaus I purchased a smart circle coupon deal from my job last year. I had read the reviews then ...and hoped that by he time I visit in 2014 the construction would be done. \nFast forward to July 2014, I signed up for the a Rock n Roll marathon and thought I check out the Quad ( was the name at the time of coupon purchase) checking reviews.....they still weren't the greatest. Loud construction, broken elevators, dirty rooms, theft....I mean after reading this who in their right mind would stay here?!? Me! \nSo I had given my sister the disclaimer and said it's just a room, to sleep, it's reasonable let's do it. I went in with an open mind....\n\nTo avoid any more headaches Valet park, check in was easy, elevators worked, never heard of any complaints of none working, room was clean. My wi-fi worked I had shampoos, conditioner & soap in a dispenser and They provided travel since Adequate room service. I just wished that there had been a clock, coffee pot and a Bible!
