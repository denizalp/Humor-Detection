Ordered couch , and two recliners along with two end tables , tables were are back order . When the couch was delivered we noticed a small rip in the seat cushion, the delivery guy took a pic and said they would notify the store . I  called the sales person I dealt with and reported the damage along with damage to the recliner lever on one chair , that was two days ago days ago and I've heard nothing yet ...I will update this post when I do. The delivery guy also told me that according to his order the tables should have been on the truck but were not.\n\nUpdate \nA manager promptly contacted me to Remedy this situation , thanks Laura !
