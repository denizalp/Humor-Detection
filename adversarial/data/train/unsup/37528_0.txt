Dandelion is great. What else can I say about a place that has good beer, cheap wine specials and good food. The service here is also pretty good and the food comes out sans problem. \n\nYou can order a couple of things for yourself or order for the table and share (I think it's better to share so everyone gets a little bit of something). I'm a big fan of the lamb lollipops, mac and cheese and fries (which come out super crispy). \n\nWe went on a Tuesday when they had $15 wine bottle specials and they are well worth it (both the white and reds). Everyone got something a little bit different and had a bite, overall the bill was not astronomical and we all were full by the end. I recommend this place for anyone looking for a bit to eat or just drinks uptown.
