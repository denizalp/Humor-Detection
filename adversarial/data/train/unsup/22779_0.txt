I love love love the Wal-Mart. I enjoy walking the aisles and looking at all the different items. So naturally, when the Wal-Mart SuperCentre opened up relatively near my house, I was Super excited!\n\nI have a Wal-Mart right around the corner from my house but it doesn't compare to the SuperCentre. This place is montrously huge. The electronics section is at least triple the size of the one by my house. It's extremely excessive. If you were to go through each aisle in this store, it would probably take you to entire day. There's honestly no reason to ever go through it all but it's just fun.\n\nMy favourite section is electronics where the DVDs are ALWAYS cheaper than any other place. And yes, I do still buy my DVDs because I'm old school like that (sometimes I buy CDs too). But going through them and sometimes finding an old TV show that has recently come out on DVD. Love it!\n\nI also buy all of my household items here from shampoo to face cleansers to laundry detergent. Honestly, if I ever walk out of here from buying stuff less than $100 it will boggle my mind because coming in here, you find things that you need but you weren't there to buy but because they're on sale, you're definitely going to get it now. There's always sales and the prices are always great.\n\nThis location is kept pretty neat and tidy which probably has a lot to do with the fact that it's in the middle of nowhere and it doesn't get too busy. I also go during off hours like weekday afternoons\/nights. But I always see workers walking around and cleaning and putting stuff away. Which is definitely not the case in other locations. \n\nIt is a bit of a drive for me to get here so I won't always come to this location but if I had a choice, this definitely would be where I go.
