Mint Cafe is the best Thai food in Cleveland - sorry Asian Grille in Lakewood!  I recommend the Mint Garden Chicken (nice steamed vegetables and chicken with an amazing peanut sauce on the side), the Crazy Noodle (Bangkok-style flat rice noodles with a spicy peanutty sauce), the Pumpkin Curry (a seasonal special), or the Yellow Curry.  Always very friendly service, family-friendly and reasonably group-friendly.  \n\nThey also have great appetizers, like the edamame, tofu triangles and the crispy spring rolls.  They have some more expensive dishes, but many of the dinner entrees are less than $10.\n\nGreat food, reasonable prices, nice atmosphere, and friendly service.  For the guy who said there was no parking, there is a huge parking garage just one block down the street behind Marc's.
