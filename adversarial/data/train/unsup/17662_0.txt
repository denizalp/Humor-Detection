Worst customer service I've ever experienced at an RV dealership. The customer service rep. Did not answer our questions and told us to get out of here. He approaches us with a negative attitude from the get go. We asked for a comparison of the XLR trailer they have out front in comparison to a Winnebago toy hauler and the only answer he gave us was that the XLR has an all season package where the Winnebago does not. Then he proceeded to say that Winnebago are pieces of shit when they carry their products on their lot. We have been researching the Winnebago and they have the all seasons package and we states this. He then proceeded to tell us we were wrong and don't know what we are talking about. He told us we were wrong and to get out of their lot and to \"enjoy our Winnebago\"\nI will NEVER buy any product from Findlay.
