Well, if you've only got 10 minutes and desperately want something that resembles BBQ i guess this might be the place. However, a strong argument can be made that you'd just be better off with a McRib.\nI got a half rack with frozen fried okra and cole slaw fresh out of the tub. The three sauces I tried were sickly sweet but you'll want sauce 'cause the meat just doesn't bring much to the table. \n\nThat's about all I can say about it.\n\nDid I mention they were fast? They're really, really fast. Faster than McDonald's so you might want to consider that in your decision making.
