Tried The Covenant today with my son. I've been in the area for years and have seen the establishment change from business to business several times. Upon driving up I was impressed with the aesthetic of the outside, but was nothing compared to when I walked in the door. I'm by no means a expert of interior design so I wouldn't even know where to begin with the style, all I know is it felt good when I walked in and felt very cool. When I stepped up to the register I was kindly greeted by a friendly gentleman named Jake. Being my first time here I asked what he recommended and he gave his suggestion. Not seeing it on the menu I gave my trust in his judgment and was not disappointed. It's some type of hot chai\/mocha\/almond milk concoction and MAN! is it good. My son got a hot chocolate and he seemed as satisfied as a kid can get. My curiosity doesn't always lead me to the best of places, but I can assure you I'll be back to try the other offerings that The Covenant has to offer.
