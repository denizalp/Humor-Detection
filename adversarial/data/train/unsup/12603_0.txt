The money factory!!  Clearly this place prints money for the doctors and don't you dare get in the way.  Doctor was okay - clearly too busy counting his money to have read all those damn forms we filled out and otherwise okay attention to details like our names.  He seemed knowledgeable but none of his canned remarks reflected our specific situation - but in fairness, he could not have known anything about the situation having not read the detailed forms, nor asking any specific question or without actually listening to what we said.  Plus his can I blame his careless demeanor when I don't remember his name nor care to speak to him again.\n\nThe highlight of the trip to the money factory was the office manager who we were told was to explain the process.  All she did is put a price list in front of us and tell us about payment terms.  When we questioned an item that had recently been done we were brusquely informed that it had to be done with them because they were the experts and could not be sure what us done elsewhere.  Yup, plus their process on depositing my money is second to none!  \n\nThe money factory is a wonderful place.....for the owners!  They print money every time a fool like us walks thru the door and more when you return according to the price list (or whatever other name they use for the schedule). We went elsewhere as this is a difficult and trying time and we wanted an office that not only had the right diplomas and know how, but also compassion.
