Absolutely awful service. This location is in desperate need a new manager. When we arrived, there were 5 people ahead of us. We were told to just go order at the register. At this time, more people walked in and they had their order taken and got their food before any of us who were previously told to order at the register even ordered. This caused a massive line being formed at the register which didn't move. The older woman at the register was clearly confused and didn't seem to know how to use the register. When it was my turn, my order was rung up wrong, then I needed a refund, then they refunded me less than the previous wrong amount. This store lack communication and customer service. I will not return.
