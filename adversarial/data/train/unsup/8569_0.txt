Passed by this gelato place on the way to lunch at the Pool Cafe. The BF is a gelato fan. So we save room for dessert.  They've  got a variety of choices from the classic Stracciatella to your Berry sorbet.  They charge $5 for a scoop; it's the Bellagio, so, it's overpriced.  The Cappuccino one satisfied my taste for anything coffee flavored.  Very creamy and yummy! So what's a girl got to do after having gelato? go back to the room and take a nap....ZzzZzz
