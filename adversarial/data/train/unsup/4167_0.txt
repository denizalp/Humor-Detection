Came on a Friday night. It wasn't too packed. There are two parts to this place. A bar where it's small plates and a restaurant next door. We went to the restaurant there was an AKA event on the bar side. When we came in we were greeted and seated. Staff were nice. Had the skinny margarita which is weak. The server noted its alcohol mostly - not! I didn't get the regular or other options because they are pre made. Don't waste your money on his drink. We tried another the one of my favorites  in general a Brazilian drink, the Caipirinha. I'm so glad they didn't mess it up. It was good I could actually taste the alcohol. The server was busy didn't see him waiting on tables on our side, but it took him forever to bring stuff out.  I was happy that I was able to try various tacos instead of getting all one flavor. The beer battered cod\/ fish taco was the best. It wasn't spicy but had a good amount of flavor. The chicken taco was horrible I was very surprised considering that most people eat chicken and lacked flavor. The shrimp taco with the jalape√±os and bacon was super spicy. The rice wasn't cooked properly and the beans were just OK. I am shocked. Had better in food quality. I think you pay for location. Good luck.
