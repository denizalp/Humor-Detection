I have to agree with most of the reviews on here, the chips and salsa are good and the service leaves something to be desired. We went for lunch a couple days ago and ordered off the lunch menu, we got the Carne asada plate and a chile relleno and chimi combo, the beans needed salt and the rice was dry. The meat was cooked perfect and the chile and chimi where good. They didn't have mexican Aguas\/drinks such as horchata, which is not cool. There was a piece of plastic in the guacamole on the Carne asada plate, you can see it in the pic near the rice. When we informed the manager she apologized and offered to replace meal, but by that time we were almost done. No smiles on staff faces at all. Real shame the service is bland as well as the food, since the restaurant itself has a nice mexican ambiance.
