This restaurant has good food, good service and is actually pretty affordable.  Every year we go to a concert in MGM and try to make a reservation at a different restaurant every year.  We've always noticed how busy this place looks and have tried to get in before, but this year it worked out.  We made a reservation for 5:30pm before our 8pm concert on a Saturday night.  When we got there, the wait was already up to an hour.\n\nWe started off with a bottle of wine, Merlot, which was the same price as the half bottle we'd ordered the night before at another restaurant.  For dinner, I went with meatloaf and the hubby ordered the prosciutto pizza.  I wouldn't normally order meatloaf for dinner, but it sounded like a good option to go with the wine.  The food was pretty good.  \n\nThis would probably be my second favorite place of the MGM restaurants.  It is a good option for decent food at decent prices.
