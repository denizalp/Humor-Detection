I had to edit this review after being here several times.  I still love the fact that they're a small family-owned business that is still going strong, but do yourself a favor and just get takeout.  \n\nEvery single time I've been there the service has been SLOW and RUDE.  You wait forever to get a table (because the service is so slow!), and then they treat you like YOU'VE been keeping THEM waiting, and how dare you have questions.  God help you if you need to flag down the waitstaff for any reason.  You *might* get your water glass filled in time for your bedtime pills.  \n\nThe pizza really is good, though, so the rest of my review stands:  \n\nThere are a couple of things that really sets Geraci's apart for me.  First off, it's not greasy at all.  We got the deluxe, and even with both pepperoni and sausage, neither the crust nor the toppings were greasy.  Both the pepperoni and the sausage are obviously made with REAL MEAT, not processed meat-like disks and nuggets.  The veggies are fresh too - no canned mushrooms here.  The sauce and crust were just right for me too.  The sauce is flavorful and not overly sweet, and the crust is on the thinner side but not cracker-thin.  \n\nThe calamari was great too - light and crispy and amazing with the spicy marinara.  \n\nI've heard that they have really good meatballs there too, but I'm not sure I'd be able to pass up the pizza to try them!  \n\nA couple of things to think about before going - \n1. They're going to be busy, so plan to go when you're not in a hurry.  In a pinch, call in a carry out.  \n2. They don't take credit cards, so make sure you have enough cash in hand.  \n3. It's a little pricey for pizza, but you really get what you pay for.  \n\nEnjoy!
