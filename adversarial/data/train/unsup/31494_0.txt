If I could leave 0 stars, I would!  I consigned 4 items of furniture in January 2018, after following up I learned all items sold in  early February.  I inquired where my payment was and was advised that corporate would be sending me a check.  March 2018, still no payment received.  I followed up AGAIN by phone and was told to email my inquiry to the corporate office as they issue the payments.  I have phoned over 5times and sent over 10 emails to the corporate office AND the Scottsdale store where my items were sold, as of April 16, 2018 STILL NO RESPONSES AND NO PAYMENT.  Worst customer service ever, they sell your furniture AND NEVER PAY YOU YOUR PERCENTAGE!  Unethical and immoral company...thieves!  Do not do business with them!
