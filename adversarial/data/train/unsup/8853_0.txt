If you have money to blow definitely call these guys. We used them twice and on the third time just wanted an estimate and they charged 85.00 just to come out. Then wanted 1600.00 to fix it. While the unit is still under warranty. Ended up calling someone else and paid 750.00. True they do come on time. But they bend you over big time.
