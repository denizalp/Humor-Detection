After a great day of galavanting up and down St. Laurent, Coco Rico is a great place to end your day if you are on a fixed food budget. I see students and locals of all ages and ethnicity come here to feast on some good ol' poulet, so I must give this a try.\n\nI ended up sharing a rotisserie chicken with my girlfriend and a side. The chicken skin is thin, crispy and a piece of heaven in every bite. Lets just say someone can get hurt fighting over it. I almost poked my girlfriend for a piece. My mom is going to kill me, she raised her children not to fight over food and I have committed a cardinal sin. SORRY MOM!!!
