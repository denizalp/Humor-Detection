Why oh why is this joint always out of ham and cheese crossaints...prepare people!!!  I really don't think theres anything special about their sandwiches, I've tried a couple of them.  The soup is usually good, the salads are o.k but the cookies are pretty good.  Service is null, I actually caught a couple of the young guys who were making the sandwiches joking about one of the guests (rude).  I never order coffee here anymore because they always find a way of screwing it up.  So why do I keep stopping in here....it must be the cookies.
