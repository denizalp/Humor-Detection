I love the location of Beerhaus.  Smack dab in the heart of the Park.  The service is casual and the vibe is cool.  The price is moderate and you can hang out and grab drinks while waiting for an event to start at T-mobile.  What I like most is that it's easy--an easy place to meet up, easy to find, easy to hang at.  It's got lots of space and can accommodate big crowds.  Oh and the beer selection was obviously fantastic.  Cheers!!
