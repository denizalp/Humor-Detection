A friend organized a get together for a bunch of us and we went out to his favourite place for \"wings\".  I was kinda sold when he said wing night was something like 30 cents for a wing (perfect!), what could go wrong right?\n\nWell it turns out... a lot.  The wings were not really that great.  When it comes to wings, you can screw them up in one of two ways... the sauce and overcooking them.  Cooper's Pub has managed to do both (that's a 100% failure rate).  I found the sauce abysmal, sure they have a bunch of different sauces, but they don't really stand out at all or taste amazingly different.  It was pretty much honey tasting sauce, and \"hot\" sauce.  Speaking of which, \"hot\" is a relative term I guess, because their \"hot\" sauce is weaker than Frank's Red Hot sauce.  For all of you who actually do like hot sauce you'll know what I mean; Frank's is maybe a \"medium\" hot sauce.  The worst thing I think you can do to a wing is overcook it as well.  I really don't like eating jerky wings, maybe that's how they get you to buy more beer.\n\nI didn't really find anything wrong with the beer, it's pretty much standard.  However it was kinda interesting when one of us ordered a sprite and got a coke.  Maybe next time they'll give me beer when I order a water... It's a miracle!!
