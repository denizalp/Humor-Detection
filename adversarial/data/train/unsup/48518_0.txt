Went here for dinner with a couple of friends.  It was quite busy on a Friday night.  The food was great, great service but I wish they would take credit card as payment.  The menu is simple to understand and I would definitely return.  \n\nFood: 4\/5, very tasty and close to authentic which is hard to find in Toronto.  The fish taco, salsas and the chicken mole are delicious.\n\nService: 4\/5, you order at the counter and pay before eating. Easy way to get food.  They bring the food and the owner is very friendly to all customers.  Hard to find in Toronto.  We got diablo potatoes, they were delicious but he said he was 100% happy with it so he gave us desserts for free, which was a nice surprise.\n\nAmbience: 3\/5, small place and it could get loud but overall, it is a nice joint.  They might do well in a larger location. It was full constantly throughout the night.\n\nPrice: 3\/5, not bad for what you get. Around 15\/person.  Toronto isn't great for what's worth for the food but this place is alright.
