Heist Brewery has come a looong way from what I remember a few years back. Not sure if many of you folks recollect but the beers here used to be \"flat\". Like, that was the intention - their claim to fame - was flat beers. Little to no carbonation. It was a hard start and people really talked a lot about it. Maybe it was intentional to get people in the door? I donno! But they did a big upset and flipped it all up one day.\n\nThey apparently hired a new brewmaster. The beers became stellar! Now you can find all manner of seasonal and small batch brews alongside their regular line up with lots of reliable flavors spanning the whole list of beer types. None of them flat! The bar staff is extremely helpful even at popular times - and they get a LOT of attention these days. So much so that the parking lot can be quite a bit of a pain. But as the weather warms up, a leisurely stroll to Heist from NoDa proper could be well rewarded with a cold one.\n\nOh and did I mention the finger foods? I've been in here on special events a time or two which were well catered, although I should probably refrain from reviewing since I haven't tried their full menu. Let's face it though, who cares about any of that stuff when you've got the good 'ol Heist BEER CHEESE and pretzel breadsticks. Amazing stuff! I can't speak much beyond that but when you're in here drinking and enjoying the amazing ambiance (love the window view into the brew room and all of the random wood detail on the walls) just leave the tab open and keep the beer cheese and Pater Tots pints coming.
