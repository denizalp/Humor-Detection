Stopped by for a breakfast burrito on my way out of town. The total tab for the burrito (with bacon) and a drink was about $13. For that price, the burrito was very small and the eggs were COLD (yuk!) and they threw on a couple of pathetic (also cold) strips of bacon. As a result the cheese didn't even melt within the tortilla shell and the whole thing was pretty disgusting.\n\nThe fountain machine was malfunctioning so that it was spraying syrup droplets on the sleeve of my shirt and the napkin dispenser was also broken. Small things admittedly. But the whole thing adds up to a place that enjoys a good location and really does not care about the food they serve or the whole experience
