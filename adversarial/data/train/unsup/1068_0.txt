I would consider this place a high end burger place. It's basically burgers, fries, and salads (4 total) on the menu.\n\nThey have the usual \"build your own\" burger option (meat, cheese, bun, toppings, sides) or their own specials. This time around I chose the American Classic for $12.75: Ridge field beef, American cheese, crispy bacon, tomato, onion, on sesame bun and I added mushrooms. I chose the regular fries. \n\nThe burger itself wasn't too bad, a bit dry, but good quality moo. The fries were nicely crisp and soft at the same time. Mmmm, good food. It also looks like they make milkshakes like how they did back in the day. Metal cup\/whole milk\/Hershey's chocolate syrup....oh yeah. I need a cigarette. Oh, this part of the casino\/resort, you're not allowed to light up.\n\nConsidering the X games were happening, my dinner companions and I were talking about Pierre (forgot his last name) about doing Moto-Cross and Skateboarding. One of the really pretty waitress' (that one of my dinner companions were looking at since we sat at the bar), said, \"Oh yeah, he does both.\" To which I was waiting for my friend to say something. I guess he didn't hear her. So, when she came back, I asked her how she knew. She responded with. \"I'm a big extreme sports fan.\" This time, both my dinner companions looked (both confused and WTF, why is she talking to us? faces)...to which she quickly turns around and goes off to do other things. D'oh! \n\nMaybe next time I'll try a more expensive burger and my friend who's interested, will actually SAY SOMETHING to her instead of making her feel dumb. :) Hee.
