All the accolades presented were given to the original restaurant located in Kailua, HI, where you will experience the full menu, including 100% Kona Coffee.  Here...  well, it'll do.  10% Kona blend by Lion doesn't quite meet expectations, but what can i say?  GMonkey spoiled by the original.  \n\nGMonkey do:\n\nOMG-WASABI RIB-EYE(9oz) w\/2 eggs - delicious!\nPISTACHIO PANCAKES (vegas location only) - fluffy like cake\nKALBI LOCO MOCO - good\nHAWAIIAN OMELETTE - kalua pig, lau lau w\/(minuscule evidence of)butterfish, tomato, onions +\nTIRAMISU PANCAKES - which must've been an off menu special.  Surely, Monkey enjoyed it.  \n\nService is nice, friendly and efficient enough.  Other daily and specific day specials are available, too.  What boggles my mind is that while MALASADAS are a classic Portuguese favorite, they're only available on Wednesdays!  If you're open 7am to 3pm, and i have a job...  GAH!   Why? Why not have MALASADAS on the weekends???  \n\nRestaurant by same name, similar menu, different coffee and just that much off...  make it not.  Lower your expectations to appreciate this one.
