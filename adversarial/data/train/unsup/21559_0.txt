Welcome to Vegas, one of the most scandalous cities in all of the USA, woooo!!\n\nI have crashed at most of the other hotel\/casino spots in Vegas that are a bit more pricey but I don't know why this hotel has a 2 star rating, I had a goodass experience. The room was clean, they didn't have bed bugs or any nasty weird stains or any of that. I mean, yeah sure the closet is bigger than the restroom but that's not a big deal I guess. The staff was decent didn't have a good not bad experience. The slots did me good, I won $90 within a half an hour on the slots do that's cool with me. It's fairly close to a lot of food joints and little shops and not that far from old town Vegas. The crowd was a mixture of people so that was cool too. The pools were drained that is the only real negative I guess. Anyway, I would drop by if I was ballin' on a budget.
