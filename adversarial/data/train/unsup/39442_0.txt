Done.  Over it.  This place has ton of potential and I can see why people have given it 5 stars.  Drinks are well made and almost all of the food is really good.  But I've come here to play golf.  I'm still waiting.  After two visits to this place, I admit they were on busy Saturday nights, we have yet to actually get a lane.  \n\nBoth times we showed up knowing the wait was going to be long.  So we bellied up to the bar, ordered some food and got our names on the waiting list.  Both times we were told it was a 2.5 hour wait.  In speaking with the employee with signed up with, we were told it would probably be under 2 hours in actuality.  Well bot times we were 3.5 hours into our wait before we tossed in the towel.  \n\nIf you don't have hours just to sit around and wait, don't plan on playing any golf.  Whatever they tell you the wait it, add an hour.  Good Luck!
