Paula Cross you are one of the best servers we have ever had! For a late night dinner or breakfast for that matter, you had us laughing like we were long lost family... Ihop you have a real treasure in this beautiful lady! I have already returned to just be served by this lady and if that doesn't mean anything the 15.9 miles to drive here has to. PAULA YOU ROCK!!!
