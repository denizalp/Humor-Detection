I went here for lunch with a few girls from work and I was super impressed! The service was incredible ' they answered all my questions and provided suggestions about the menu. The tacos were delicious!! I had the potato and chorizo. We Also had an order or caramel churros which you must try! However my favorite part was the coffee. I had a vanilla latte and I swear it was the best vanilla latte I've ever had!! Not to mention they put Drake on it- it literally doesn't get any better than that!!
