A friends, brothers, great aunts, cousin, \ntwice removed referred me to Austin at Studio 21.  I probably sat on that referral for a year. \n\nI finally got the courage to call them and schedule. Before I pick up the phone I'm expecting to have some rough man answer the phone and I speak 2 word sentences to get my point across (you know, so I don't confuse him). \n\nI was warmly greeted by Joey (I think that's what his name was) or should I say my new BFF, when he answered the phone. He answered all of my questions throughly and without hesitation. I felt like I was talking to my brother. I'm really critical of people's professionalism whether it be at Target or at a tattoo studio. I prefer for people to have pride in their job and Joey surpassed my expectations by a long shot! I was super stoked for my appointment. \n\nSo here I am sitting in the waiting room waiting for my artist. I suddenly get nervous. Am I really getting this tattoo? Yes. Yes, I , am. I already paid my deposit. Naturally any reputable place would make you pay a deposit to hold your appointment.  Palms are sweating, heart starts to beat a little faster...I think I might leave..I'm going to make a break for the door, eff my 50 bones...but behold! Austin! My tattoo artist that I booked with. Maybe I'll stay??\n\nHe was so friendly. I told him what I wanted and he was \"so pumped\" about my idea. Listen, I'm not artistic in any way, shape, or form nor do I pretend to be one so when he suggested to change my idea up a but I just went with it. I'm so glad that I listened to him! \n\nThe tattoo stung a smidgen but in the area that I got it in I didn't expect anything less. Austin did a wonderful job keeping things light and making me laugh throughout my appointment. I'm assuming this is a Mom and Pop shop because I think his Mom came in briefly during our appointment. Another big bonus in my book. \n\nWrapping this long a$$ review up\n1. Prices are reasonable (you get what you pay for and I'm obsessed with my tattoo) \n2. Small business, BONUS in my book\n3. Kick a$$ work\n4. Kick a$$ people \n\nI would refer my 90 year old grandmother to them. Maybe you should check them out too.
