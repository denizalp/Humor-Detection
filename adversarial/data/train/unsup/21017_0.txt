The lounge is passable in being away from the busy terminal area. The staff were quite rude and indifferent. There is some stupid rule that while OneWorld Emerald Members can use the First Class Lounge, they aren't actually allowed to eat or drink there, even though the lounge has a service restaurant and a bar. I did confirm from BA that this is \"policy\".... dumb policy .... but policy.\n\nElectrical outlets were very scarce. There were some in the floor that I managed to use. There are no showers or restrooms--at least according to the staff who really wanted to be anywhere but there.\n\nIf you have nowhere else to go and you need to sit in a dry, hungry, quiet and you enjoy indifferent service, come here.
