This place is not fit to rent rooms to a moldy hotdog let alone a human being. It's supposed to be smoke free but my room smelled like someone had been chain smoking newports in there right before I checked in. There are scratches and smoke stains everywhere and the bathtub looks like someone was recently murdered in it. Since the killer is probably still in my closet I believe this will be my final yelp review. Also, the AC was broken in my first room so they moved me to another but it keeps switching off on me and the sound of it is the only thing that muffles the noise that the dudes cooking meth in the room next door are making. If you like to sweat profusely, enjoy noisy felons and smelling like smoke and pure unfiltered ass, this is the place for you. The only positive here is that the lady at the front desk was apologetic and accommodating. Still by far this is the worst hotel I've ever stayed at in my entire life. You've been warned!
