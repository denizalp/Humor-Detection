I enjoy shopping for my groceries at this location. But I don't like the fact that the people who work here have no idea where anything is. Excuse me where would I find the Rotel? Rotel....whats Rotel? Wait do we sell Rotel? Hell, I don't work here I'm asking you. Really how can u work in a store and have no idea where anything is. So because I like the store and it's location I have just decided not to ask anyone where anything is. I just send the husband to look for items if I have no idea where things maybe. Other than that is a cool store.
