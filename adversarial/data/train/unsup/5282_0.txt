May 23, 2018\n\nTasty food indeed!  Great service, too!  (Ask for Martin!)  I definitely am returning to try other tasty-sounding items on the menu.  Ordered half-portions of two appetizers and the \"seasonal 'rita\" since I had a YEE (Yelp elite event) to attend after the meal.  Strange that I was charged full-priced for the drink after I was told that the cocktails were $2 off during HH...  Oh, well.  \n\nI like that I was able to order half-orders on almost everything on the menu, except the Crispy chicken sandwich.  And to be able to change my mind and do full orders mid-meal is even better!  I tried the special salad of the day, which was the Orange-Fennel salad, minus the orange (allergy), and the Shattered Chips-- deep-fried slices of potato chips dusted with cracked salt and garnished with lebni and homemade jalapeno sauce.  Both were fabulous!  The salad came with goat cheese and almonds.  I was not aware that it also came with avocado (allergy), so I had to fish the pieces out.  \n\nNo dessert, as Ingo's Tasty Food is part of the LGO restaurant concept, and the idea is to have people experience deconstructed dining by eating food here and then crossing the street to have dessert at LGO.  There was a footed stand of complimentary salted chocolate chips, which I was told I could help myself to, which I did, but the cookies were too salty and too hard\/dry.  I'd suggest to pass on these, unless you like over-salted and rock-hard cookies...\n\nHope to return soon!
