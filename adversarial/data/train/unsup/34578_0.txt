Probably the best Value Village I have ever been to! They have a rainbow wall of scarfs and a well organized section of purses (colour coordinated) that makes you feel like you're at Winners. Once I stated my admiration for their hard work to a worker, they mentioned they love to organize on their spare time. This location is said to be the #1 for their district. I could agree with this. I also came here during Value Village's large 50% off everything sale and they did a great job in managing the large crowd, they made a closed off cue line, just like in Walmart. This place really makes the shopping experience wonderful. I hope Value Village can acknowledge this location and try to duplicate this to the rest of their stores. I will be back soon :)
