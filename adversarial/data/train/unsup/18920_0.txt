I love burritos but I have to say I don't eat them that often. It's impossible to find good ones in Europe and haven't had the opportunity yet here in Montreal. Though I've had amazing ones in Oklahoma so I know what to expect!\nThe place on St Denis has a young and modern feel to it, quite welcoming. The ingredients look fresh and smell nice. I had a Barbacoa burrito which was filled to the limit... the tortilla actually broke when the girl tried to wrap it but it didn't seem to bother her. I had the Pico de gallo sauce with that too. All in all the burrito was good though a bit watery\/juicy (from the sauce, the meat and the rice...). I was expecting more taste and more freshness though, especially since it's actually their slogan...\nAround 9.50$ isn't cheap, but again this is Montreal and it seems to be normal prices around here (am I the only one who thinks that eating in Montreal is bloody expensive? Seriously?!)\nSo, it's good though not extraordinary. I haven't had burritos elsewhere in Montreal so I don't know if it's how they are here or just this place... I will keep on investigating that question!
