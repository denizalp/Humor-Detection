I took my iphone to them to get the screen repaired, they checked the phone and it was working so they fixed the screen and they gave it back to me but the microphone was no longer working and the phone became useless.\nI took it back to them and they could not fix it and I asked them to refund the money or replace the phone and they disagreed.\nSo now I have to spend hundreds of dollars to replace my iphone and have already paid $70 which they wont give me back.\nI would not trust them at all!
