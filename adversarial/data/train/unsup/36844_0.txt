I've went to a number of different threading places since I've moved on this side of town I didn't think I could find a place that I really liked because my last threading place was in Summerlin and I loved them. Eyebrow envy is very efficient fast and the results were good. I've never had to wait long and the ladies who work there are always nice. No complaints on this end!
