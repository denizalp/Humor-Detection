Bacon wrapped dates.  I don't think I need to say more, but I will anyway!\n\nI had the dates and an arugula salad, both were very fresh and delicious.  The bread that's brought to the table is good too - don't skip the pesto that comes with it.  This is not your average \"throw-some-olive-oil-and-cracked-pepper-together-and-call-it-a-dipping-sauce\" kind of stuff.  I could almost make a meal out of the bread and pesto alone.\n\nOur waitress was almost over the top attentive, but I'll take that over one that disappears any day.
