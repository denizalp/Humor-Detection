I wanted to take my brother to some place he'd never been before, and so we tried Black Bear Diner.  He loved it!  I've been to this chain in other states, and was not disappointed at this location either. \n\nOur server was attentive and friendly. The food is very good and portions are large.  My brother had the bacon and cheddar burger with a mix of regular fries and sweet potato fries.  I tried the cheeseburger salad.  The lettuce was crisp, there were plenty of add-in's, and the mix of hamburger, cheese, tomatoes, onions, and lettuce with Thousand Island dressing was tasty.  \n\n\nBlack Bear Diner is known for the \"individual size\" deep dish pies, both fruit and cream ones.  I took an apple pie home.  It was full of baked apple slices with only a lattice crust -- just the way I like pie.
