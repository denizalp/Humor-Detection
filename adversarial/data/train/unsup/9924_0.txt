My throat still hurts from screaming for an hour and a half. It was great that we were encouraged to boo and hiss at the other countries, particularly France (we were in Ireland, woot!). Poor King of France, at some point he must get sick of taking the brunt for a country that most patrons don't like anyway.\n\nOur beer wench was a Mexican dude named Hector, and he wasn't dressed like a medieval serf (which bummed me out). The food was alright, I dig eating with my hands. I recommend getting beer, because they make you drink a lot throughout the show (oops, I had a Sprite).\n\nThe kings were seriously hot. I'd rather see a bunch of hot guys dueling on horses with swords than waving their cheesy banana hammocks around in middle aged woman faces, a la Thunder from Down Under.
