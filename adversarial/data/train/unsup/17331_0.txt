I only live two miles away from this place but never would have known about it without Groupon! It was an unpleasant surprise to find they were no longer accepting the deals, but the meal itself was so much better than expected that I didn't count off a star for it as I normally might.\n\nAppetizer: Yucca is amazing, if you haven't had it before this is a good place for a first experience. The garlic sauce makes the dish. \nEntrees: Palmilla steak was thin cut with grilled onions and served with a rice-bean mixture that was understated and simple but so tasty. Cuban sando was huge and perfectly toasty with melty cheese and plenty of meat inside, served with basic fries.\nDessert: Flan was creamy and that espresso alone would make me come back- tiny, strong, sweet, and flavorful. \n\nThe space is odd, with dark wood floors and high-end-looking tables with topped with glass and cloths, but dollar bills and writing covering the walls like a low-end club, and a small bar to the side of the entrance. And outdoor seating. A lot going on, but great things happening in the kitchen! Working it into my regular rotation for takeout.
