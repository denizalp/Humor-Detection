Cutting edge Italian food presented beautifully in the perfect contemporary setting of the Cosmo.  \n\nScarpetta's food is about building and layering flavors from a few ingredients to produce a harmonious dish.\n\nFor starters, raw is best.  The tuna \"scusci\" is excellent.  The tartness of the marinated veg pairs perfectly with the fish.  The raw yellowtail dish, with its pure simplicity brings out all the subtle sweetness of the fish.  Finally the wagyu tartare.  Wow, the use of the hazelnuts and Parmigianino cheese creates a totally unexpected flavor!  \n\nFor pasta, its gotta be the duck and foie gras ravioli.  Other yelpers said they loved it.  It really is good.  The pasta is perfectly cooked and works well with the sweetness of the marsala reduction.\n\nTop mains include the branzino with pine nuts and green garlic gremolata that totally brings out the naturally nutty flavor of the fish and the pancetta wrapped veal loin, served with sweetbreads.  The flavors are very subtle and absolutely delicious.\n\nThe wine list is very good with a nice balance of Italian wines (not just super Tuscans).  Vintage depth is OK.  Prices are in line with Vegas resorts.\n\nService is very efficient.\n\nOverall prices are very good for a restaurant of this caliber.\n\nRecommended.
