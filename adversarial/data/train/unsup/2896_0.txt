Have been a regular here ever since they've opened! This is my number 1 go-to restaurant whenever I'm craving Korean or Japanese food!\n\nThey've had quite a big staff change since they opened but food is still good!\n\nGal's offers some of the best deals for sushi, especially lunches! I usually get their lunch bentos which are around $10, size is good and taste is good! Personally, I think that L4 is the best deal. High quality fish and very filling. \n\nIf you want to change something in your bento, it's free of charge (as long as the things you're changing are the same price)! If you're not sure, you can ask your server! \n\nAll dishes come with soup and salad. You only get the side dishes if you order a Korean dish. You can ask for kimchi too! Also, the side dishes are refillable!\n\nService is usually good, never experienced anything really bad before so keep it up! I remember there used to be this super cute Korean waiter though, but he doesn't work there anymore *cries* \n\nANYWAYS, it's one of my favourite restaurants of all time! Good quality Korean and Japanese food, so give it a try if you haven't!
