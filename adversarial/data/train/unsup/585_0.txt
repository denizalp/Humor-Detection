I can't remember if it was Iain or Joel who told me to order the cheesesteak after my pizza experience... but whoever it was is my hero. I freakin love it. My friend and I went the other night and he loved it too! Flancers has made my round in places to eat that aren't freaking far away from my dang house. I tested out the curb side awhile back when it was raining and I just loved that. I gave my car hop a little bit extra for having to bring it out in the rain.  She brought it out quickly and my food was piping hot. I think I will try the french onion soup next time i go.
