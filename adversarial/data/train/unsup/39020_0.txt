They broke the mold when they made this Platonic ideal of a doctor. He asks brilliant questions to narrow down and ascertain a prognosis, which he does lightning quick, orders tests to rule things out. Profoundly knowledgeable with a superb bedside manner. A truly caring human being who works his butt off for his patient. He kept me off the dialysis machine for years and has seen me through many trials in the nearly 20 years I've known him. I can recommend no one more highly.
