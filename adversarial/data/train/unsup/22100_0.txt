When I first heard about the title of this new show at Rio from my family. It instantly got me thinking about the, Wonderful World of Color Show at Disney California Adventure. I was excited and curious how this show would turn out to be. Considering there is not a lot of advertisements about this show. \n\nMy family and I got the opportunity to check this show on Sunday 10\/29. We were quite surprised that the venue is smaller than most theaters on the Strip but we were pleased that they created an intimate setting with large HD screens that made up half of the venue along the stage and walls. Making images appear larger than life and visually stunning.\n\nEach performance was great and a lot of talented performers from acrobatic stunts, juggling, roller skating and various other acts that keeps you engage and entertained. The use of pop culture music and visual aid provided a nice backdrop that immerse you in each location as if your transported to various places throughout the world. We had a lot of favorites but I don't want to spoil the show for any future viewers. Another aspect of this show was how attractive the cast was, a lot of \"Eye Candy.\" Overall a great show with awesome visuals and music that everyone can enjoy.\n\n2017 Yelp Review #49
