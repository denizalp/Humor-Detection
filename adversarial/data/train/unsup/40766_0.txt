Food: Delicious. Great chips and salsa. We ordered the queso fundido appetizer and then the fajitas for two with steak and shrimp. We also had a mango and a raspberry margarita. All tasted great and we had leftovers to take home. \n\nAtmosphere: Great decor. Comfortable booth seating. Friendly staff. Our waiter called us amigos which was a nice touch.  \n\nPrice: we thought prices were a little high. We went during happy hour and when we got our check we noticed none of the discounts were taken off. We had to remind them, which is not enjoyable. \n\nOverall we liked the restaurant and would go back.
