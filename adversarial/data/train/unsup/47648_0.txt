I never fail to have a Fat Tuesday in one hand and a Jalapeno Pretzel from New York Pretzel Co. in the other every single time I'm in Vegas. Maybe it's because they are in close proximity with each other but I'm glad it is. I sporadically crave their Jalapeno pretzel, which is a lot better than the pretzels in Wetzels Pretzel but maybe that's the Fat Tuesday talking haha.
