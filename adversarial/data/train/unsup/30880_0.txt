I LOVE this Ben & Jerry's! Settled in the quaint little downtown area in the college town of Davidson.\n\nAs most Ben & Jerry's are, they're not very big inside. This one has a nice little patio-type area & several small tables inside.\n\nCheerful employees & a clean store.\n\nOf course, you can buy \"by the pint\" flavors, which may or may not be found in the frozen section at your grocery store.
