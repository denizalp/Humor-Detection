Upper Las Vegas Wash Trail is becoming one of the places that I go for my AM walks\/jogs.  Located off Centennial and Lawrence Street, this trail runs approximately 3.5 miles.  The trail is quiet during the early mornings and late nights, but somewhat busy between 3 PM and 6 PM.  I like this trail for walks and jogs in the mornings since I am usually the only fool out here.  Every once in awhile there will be a few runners and bikers, but that's okay.  Sometimes I can use the company.\n\nSince this trail is only a few years old, it's still fairly clean.  There's not too much to see on this trail besides some parks, the wash itself, a few homes, and a few businesses. My only gripe is that the trail runs perpendicular with side streets which means you have to stop and make sure it's clear before you cross.  \n\nEventually this trail will meet with the Lower Las Vegas Wash, which will total about 15 miles of trail to run, jog, and walk.  \n\nTIP:   Even though Centennial Parkway\/Lawrence Street is the official starting point, you can start the trail off Deer Springs.
