A group of us had dinner here and really enjoyed it.  \n\nMake reservations weeks in advance.  \n\nThe view of the strip is awesome and we could see the Bellagio fountains.\n\nWe started with Veuve Clicquot Rose.  Later we had mixed drinks which were strong and good.  \n\nI recommend the Tasting Menu.   We tasted a little bit of many different dishes.   If you don't pace yourself, it is easy to fill up on appetizers long before the main courses arrive.  Everything from drinks to dessert was delicious.\n\nPrices are expensive but Giada is a celebrity chef so this is expected.  I definitely will be back.\n\nOur waiter and assistant waiters were very attentive and came around often.\n\nWe also had fun in the Giada photo booth.  \n\n\nHours\n\nMon 8:00 am - 2:00 pm\n5:00 pm - 12:00 am \n\nTue 8:00 am - 2:00 pm\n5:00 pm - 12:00 am \n\nWed 8:00 am - 2:00 pm\n5:00 pm - 12:00 am \n\nThu 8:00 am - 2:00 pm\n5:00 pm - 12:00 am \n\nFri 8:00 am - 2:00 pm\n5:00 pm - 12:00 am \n\nSat 8:00 am - 2:00 pm\n5:00 pm - 12:00 am \n\nSun 8:00 am - 2:00 pm\n5:00 pm - 12:00 am
