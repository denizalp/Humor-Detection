I knew the reviews were pretty bad for this place, but I was at the Linq for my first time ever and I had to check out the cupcake ATM. I was surprised there was no line on a Saturday night walking up to Sprinkles. The store is small, one side is cupcakes only and the other side is just ice cream. I chose the triple cinnamon cupcake because the description sounded good. A lightly spiced buttermilk cupcake topped with cinnamon cream cheese frosting and dusted with cinnamon sugar, yum! The actual cupcake left something to be desired. The cupcake was dry and flavorless. For something that is supposed to have triple cinnamon, I barely tasted any at all. I love cream cheese frosting but this one was bland. How can a cupcake that sounds so yummy, be a total fail??!?! \n\nMy friend got a double scoop of chocolate fudge almond ice cream, that was pretty tasty. I decided to get a kids cup of the Captain Crunch ice cream, and it was good, but I am glad I got a kids cup. The employees were friendly, but I don't understand their ordering process. It is quite silly to take my name when I am the only patron in there, and the same girl walk over to the other side of the counter and put together my order and collect payment. It's also weird that you can't get cupcakes from the ice cream side and vice versa. A sign would be a nice indicator of that, so people don't get confused. I wouldn't come back here again, but it was definitely cool to see an ATM that dispenses cupcakes!
