If this place was nearby my work in SoCal, I'd just about eat here on a daily basis for lunch. I'd go here over places like Subway or Quizno's in a heartbeat. Prices are inexpensive, especially for being in Vegas, and the food comes out quick. You look at the workers in the back, they are efficient and churning out sandwiches left and right.\n\nI had the Montagu sandwich, which has roasted beef, turkey, swiss, lettuce, tomato, and mustard. By first glance, it looks flat and relatively small when you unwrap it. But once you dig into that soft, pillowy bread, it was pretty satisfying by the time I finished. All the ingredients were fresh. The secret is that bread. Slight exterior crunch, perfectly fluffly on the inside.They must have a secret recipe or something. \n\nI even tried their frozen lemonade, which had just the right amount sugar. There's nothing like over-sweetened lemonade to make your brain freeze even worse, right? We'd definitely stop by again, if we need an inexpensive lunch or dinner. Plus, you get a 10% off coupon here from the booklet for signing up for Planet Hollywood's rewards card. Hmm, I wonder if they franchise out in SoCal.
