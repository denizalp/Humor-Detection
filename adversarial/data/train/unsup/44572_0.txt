Ok- so, I am updating to give Davidson Pizza Company a 5 star rating.  I splurged a bit this past few months, and ate their gluten FULL pizza, and garlic knots.. wow!\nI haven't had pizza with bubbles in the crust since I left NY ( only someone from the north would know what I mean perhaps...) This pizza is so delicious, I would highly recommend this pizza for anyone looking for quality! (Additionally, they own Hawthornes, so this now makes sense!!)
