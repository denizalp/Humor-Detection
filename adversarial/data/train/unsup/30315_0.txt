Do Not Order Take Out here.  I recently ordered dinner for delivery, which was an absolute rip off.  Here's a pic of what you get for $65.00.  Each \"dinner size\" portion is $17-$20, and about half the size of any standard entree.  It also does not come with rice or naan, which you have to buy separately.   \n\nDo yourself a favor and go elsewhere.  I would never eat here again.
