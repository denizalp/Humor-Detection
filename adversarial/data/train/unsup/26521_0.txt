the opera house is a really fun venue and convenient on a few fronts.  firstly its home to an enormous proscenium stage at the back that is even better viewed from the multi-tiered balcony.  that last sentence really combines a couple things.  the room itself is intimate enough to easily get within a couple feet of the performers to cry your eyes out and scream if you like.  the floor before the stage is pretty large; if this place were not as much of a rock venue, it would have the potential panache of an event hall for a wedding, or the grand presence for, i dont know, let's say...an opera.  and putting those two ideas together is a no brainer.  i often find myself staring up at the ceiling when im there to look at the ornate embellishments carved out many years ago, when im sure this was an opera house.\n\nthe other thing about this place is its balcony which is great when you dont want to be moshing in the mosh pit down below, but just want to dance with your head lets say.  it has a bar up there too - easier to get to then the bars that lie on either side of the stage.  actually, theres a bar at the back bottom too. \n\ni always remember the sound being great here and i look forward to my return.
