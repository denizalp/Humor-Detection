I have to admit that I have a HUGE crush on Chase Field, the Diamondbacks, and together, what they've brought to Phoenix and to my life.\n\nBACKGROUND \n\nFew structures are as integral to the overall history and economic vitality of Phoenix as Chase Field, formerly known as Bank One Ballpark. \n\nAlthough truly hoping that the project would be a success, I remember being very skeptical of the whole process. \n\nAs a baseball park located in Downtown Phoenix, home to the popular Arizona Diamondbacks (a Major League Baseball franchise), Chase Field has been drawing in tourists, sports fans, and local residents for community comradery since 1998 when it first opened its doors.\n\nBuilt during a wave of new, baseball-only parks during America's 1990, park designers wanted to find a way to make the stadium hospitable given the constant temperatures common in Phoenix, known as America's hottest city. \n\nWith average temperatures at 99.1 degree Fahrenheit during the season, temperatures had been clocked at over 100 degrees during the summer practice months.\n\nToo dangerous to risk heat exhaustion in the Phoenix weather, that's where the ingenious retractable roof idea came into play through intuitive architectural design.\n\nMore than just a simple stadium, Chase Field was actually the first stadium in the United States to be built with a retractable roof over a natural-grass playing surface.\n\nAlthough other stadiums have since copied the structure, Chase Field is an architectural victory that required years of planning and perfecting by local talent. \n\nAlso the first stadium to feature natural grass within the retractable roof structure, which had only ever been done in Canada, Chase Field was in international news for the remainder of the season.\n\nConstruction began in 1996, and was completed just in time for the Diamondbacks' first season to begin.\n\nEstimated to cost $279 million in 1995, the stadium went over budget, causing it to come with a final price tag of $364 million. \n\nAll in all, the stadium construction timeline was able to stay on track, with no major setbacks thwarting the opening. Today, the stadium resides in the Maricopa County Stadium District.\n\nOur family had season tickets for the first few years, and therefore we went regularly. Those were the days of teal and purple, and even the colors choice made me wonder about their future success.\n\nI was at the game in 1998, when Sammy Sosa became the first player in Cubs history to hit grand slams in back-to-back games, which was his 41st home run that kept him within four home runs of Mark McGwire.\n\nChase Field was famously home to Games 1, 2, 6, and 7 of the 2001 World Series between the Arizona Diamondbacks and the New York Yankees.\n\nAlthough I was away at Medical School that season, that series meant everything to our country in general, to Phoenix, and to my family specifically. I watched the last game of the series with my family on the phone. \n\nThe 2001 World Series gave hope to a world that was experiencing despair from 9\/11. \n\nWinning all four games, the Diamondbacks emerged victorious, denying the New York Yankees a fourth consecutive championship. \n\nIt was the first time in a decade the Diamondbacks had clinched the championship, enlivening the city and putting Phoenix on the map for travelers and baseball fans for years to come.\n\nLast year, I went to the playoffs, and for the first time, I tried the All-You-Can-Eat seats. I was determined to set some hot dog eating records; sadly, I could only eat four.\n\nWe always have a fantastic time, regardless of where we sit. There's not a bad seat in the house.\n\nThe staff has ALWAYS been EXCEPTIONAL.\n\nCONCLUSION \n\nToday, Chase Field is a popular tourist destination in the city of Phoenix, opening new restaurants within the structure this year that boast a variety of tastes and cultures.\n\nMore than just a seated stadium, the structure is serving as an example of what can be done with a sports facility, single handedly responsible for bringing money, economic vitality, and investors back into the city of Phoenix.\n\n5\/5 RECOMMEND \n\nOF NOTE\n\n*Three new restaurant openings occurring this spring: Portillo's, Dutch Bros, and Gonzo's Grill.\n\n*Parking: Good Luck\n\n*For more information: chasefieldevents.com
