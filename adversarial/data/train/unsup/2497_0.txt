I came here with my brother because I had a coupon that was about to expire. The place is pretty small, but there are lots of places to sit. My brother ordered a pork combo burrito ($5.75) and a pint of beer ($1). I ordered a chicken ensalada ($6.95). The burrito came wrapped in foil. It was so huge it looked like it was going to explode in my brother's face. He took his first bite and said, \"*%#! yeah, this is dank!\" Translated into normal English, that means it was delicious. He was also very pleased about being able to get a pint of beer for a buck. That's a pretty sweet deal and I think it's all day everyday. My ensalada wasn't what I expected. I was expecting it to be a salad in a tostada BOWL, but it was actually a big salad on top of a flat tostada in a foil bowl. All the juices of the huge salad made the little tostada all soggy on the bottom, so I didn't eat it. The salad itself was good though, I was just expecting to get it in a crunchy tostada bowl that I could tear apart and turn into chips. Even though I wasn't too fond of my salad, I am still a fan of this place. My brother loved his burrito, they have lots of specials, and the prices are cheap!\n\nTips:\n*Monday night sliders - $1 Santa Fe sliders 4-9pm\n*Taco Tues - $1 beef tacos 4-9pm\n*Wed - 1\/2 price breakfast burritos til 11am. $6 Roadrunner pizza 4-9pm\n*Thurs - $6.50 bottomless bowl of green chile stew 4-9pm\n*Fajita Friday - %6 chicken, $7 steak, $8 shrimp fajitas 4-9pm\n*Sat rib night - $8.95 Red Chile Pork Ribs Adovada w\/ green chile cheddar mashed potatoes and Calabacitas\nSunday - 2 for 1 breakfast burritos all day long\n*Carlito's Special Lager $1
