My husband and were just handed the keys to the purchase of our second home. We sold our first home in August of '17 and since then I thought it would take much longer for us to buy another home. Well, Pedro Rachet made it all possible. With the first house he showed us, we fell in love, and he really put everything in gear and in about a month, we had our keys. I am so greatful and honored to have worked with such a talented and committed person like Pedro. He really does care about his clients at all times of the day. I would highly recommend him to anyone.
