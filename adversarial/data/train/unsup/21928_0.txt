I needed to do an update on my previous review of this place from 2011.\nI am super glad they are still in business HOWEVER! even though I love the fact they have the variety of sweets and treats that we have back home, I have now on a number of occasions bought many sweets that are past the Best Before Date.\nI went there yesterday to get some comfort candy and noticed well over 20 sweets that had June\/July as the expiry date. \nThey do have a little basket that has out of date items that are cheaper but these were still on the shop floor at regular price.\nI also wanted to mention that the lady with glasses there was very nice and friendly and when I asked for a soft serve she was surprised however it was 30 degrees and I didn't want Dairy Queen. After waiting 5 minutes for the machine to work, she tried it and the ice cream came out all sloppy and runny, so I said that was ok and i'll leave the ice cream, she said she was gonna talk to the owner as the owner was the one who said to keep the machine on a slow standby and not regular as they don't sell ice cream much. Just a tip Sell the machine!\nAgain, great selection, friendly staff but they NEED to keep an eye on their expiry dates. I would say to anyone, go visit this great little shop and check out the great sweets we have back home in England BUT CHECK THE DATE before buying.\n\nCheers
