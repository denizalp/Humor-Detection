I'm not being cheeky here, but if you like dives, and you like karaoke, this is the place for you! \n\nIt's a Chinese restaurant that turns into a karaoke bar at night. You won't hate the food but you won't love it either.  Now for the real reason behind this review... \n\nIt's been a while since I've been there but from what I recall, they have a number of drink specials - tequila and jager shots for $4, think bar rails are $4 or $5, amongst others. The crowd is a mix of weird regulars, local students, and random working professionals like us who enjoy making a mockery of themselves in a dive where you're unlikely to encounter people you know. That said, I've ran into work colleagues here more than once, so perhaps people actually do enjoy this place but are not wiling to admit it due to the dive factor. I have no such reservation.\n\nThe karaoke equipment is outdated but for the most part sufficient, and song selection is what you'd expect at a dive.  There's a small patio in the back. Honestly there's not really anything great to say about this place other than that we ALWAYS have a blast here. Probably thanks to the amount of alcohol consumed. The people watching is pretty good too, actually.
