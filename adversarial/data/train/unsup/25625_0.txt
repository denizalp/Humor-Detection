Great staff, nice place and great food! Been there over 100 times and never had a bad experience!!!  YUMMY!\n\nBest Penne Ala Vodka and since I don't eat bacon, I had them make it without and add chicken.  Simply amazing!  Their salads, their sandwiches, their pastas and pizzas are all made with LOVE. YUM
