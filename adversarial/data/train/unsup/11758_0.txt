I'm not a buffet person but when it's complimentary why not? I ate here twice once for lunch and once for BF.  What a decent spread for brunch during the week! \n\nStarted off with a Bloody Mary which was included on the brunch. Some of the items in the buffet - Korean short ribs, Dim Sum, Sushi, slab bacon, shrimp cocktails, mac and cheese, Ham, turkey, fried chicken, cooked to order omelets, pizza, salads and yummy Tri Tip just to name a few. My favs in the dessert area the peanut butter cookie and Gelato. \n\nI did like the idea of the specialty items are in small portions which is a good thing. The waiter we had was friendly and really accommodating.\n\nOnly con here I felt was that the brunch buffet should open earlier for the working people like myself. Hours are from 8:00 am to 2:00 pm Monday - Friday.
