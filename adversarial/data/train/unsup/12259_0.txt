a solid 3 1\/2 with a round up to four because I LOVE COMING HERE ON WEDNESDAY!!! 65 cent oysters absolutely can't be beat.  I usually get the calamari appetizer too, which all together creates the crunch i'm looking for as well as a mix of salty, savory, lemon, and seafood all together in one tasty meal!  The service here is pretty sub par.  It takes forever for drinks of any kind to be refilled-maybe its just a little too relaxed of a bar for me.  The food is good though and with happy hour specials like crab cakes and daily specials like oysters, the prices can't be beat.  I may or may not have ordered 2 dozen one time and the waitress looked at me like I was crazy.  The cool vibe and great specials make this a place I would come back to during happy hour, other times I might pick somewhere else to relax.
