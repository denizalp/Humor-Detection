Came in for a quick lunch while I was in town and I was lucky to get the Executive Chef at the sushi bar. I started with the spicy miso which was excellent. Perfectly prepared miso with a touch of spiciness made it an innovative take on a staple.\n\nI then had the toro carpaccio which was rich and unctuous. The toro was ultra-fresh and minimally topped so the flavor of the fish stood out.\n\nFor my entr√©e I went with the Matsu special which was 8 pieces of nigiri each with it's own special toppings and\/or sauces. I particularly liked the toro and salmon offerings which were dressed with ingredients that completely enhanced the flavor of the sushi. \n\nService was great and while it is indeed pricey you are having your meal prepared by a classically trained sushi chef who puts care into each preparation.
