I've been coming to this location once or twice a week since they opened three years ago.  \n\nThis Dunkin Donuts has a friendly bunch, who work very hard at giving you what you want... a hot cup of coffee at 6:15 in the morning.  I also like the birthday cards that come in the mail and all the new sandwiches that Dunkin Brands has introduced.  \n\nFor those of us who haven't traveled to Michigan or Canada, (yes that is two different places); may I recommend you try Tim Horton's if you get the chance.  The similarities abound and you can see where Dunkin is going with their concept.  It will be very interesting when Tim Horton's opens more stores here in the US.\n\nIn the meantime, \"It's time to make the donuts!\"  \n\nEnjoy!
