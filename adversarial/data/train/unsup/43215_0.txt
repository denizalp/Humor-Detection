Finally!\n\nAroma Espresso Bar finally opens up in Markham. Thanks Chris C for the location tip as I was wandering around the mall with my bags and could not find this new coffee place. \n\nFast Efficient Service. The order taker is just so sweet and friendly. My Double Shot Long Macchiato ($2.50) was perfectly made. Love the milk froth. If you want to be really caffeinated, you won't be disappointed with Aroma coffee!\n\nOpens at 8 am. Perfect to come and pick up a coffee and a baked treat which is all made in house.\n\nI know I will be back as there are not too many good espresso bar up in this part of Markham that makes a decent espresso drink.
