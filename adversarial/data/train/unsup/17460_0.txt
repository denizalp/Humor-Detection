I am going to pay for this meal, but I don't care.  I will run a few extra miles because it was so worth it.  My shawarma chicken was to die for.  The chicken was marinated to perfection.  I also had a side of baba ganoush, omg, so delicious. I also ended up eating half of my hubby's lentil soup.   I wish I had enough space for the spanakopita.  I had the baklava \"to go\" for later.  It didn't even make it to I 17.  It was freaking delicious, the honey and pistachios were so prevalent in the taste.  I am still dreaming about it.  I also shopped for a few items at the market.  What a cool place.  Can't wait to take the hike back to the west side.
