Went to Coach outlet looking for a specific type of clutch in mind,  was looking for a small over the shoulder clutch that could hold a small wallet\/passport traveling papers, that wouldn't take up much room and can have under a jacket, unfortunately I did not find what I was looking for this time.  \n\nWhat I can say, I walked in at 6:50pm and the store was set to close at 7pm, they did lock the doors, but not one customer clerk gave me the feeling that I should rush my shopping trip, my questions were answered and was given time to browse around.  \n\nEven though I walked out empty handed, I have to say customer service was excellent and I will back, I need\/want more purses and clutches haha.
