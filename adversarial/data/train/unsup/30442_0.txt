Stopped in here to get some breakfast. The food was very good! Only thing that was annoying was the line moved pretty slow to place the order. It's one of those places you walk in, look at a large menu up on the wall, and place your order as soon as you approach the cash register. Sorta like a typical fast food joint. But yea- the line wasn't very long and it took quite a bit before I made my way up to the register. I guess since where I'm from everything is so fast paced and I'm used to that. The customers were too chitty chatty with the register people and held the line up. \n\nAnyway, I got a table outside which was nice. The weather was 80 degrees and gorgeous out - so why not sit outside. You put your little number on the salt and pepper shaker thingy and they come over wih your food when it's ready. \n\nFood was very good! Place is big! Indoor and outdoor seating so check it out!
