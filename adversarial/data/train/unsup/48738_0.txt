My boyfriend and I came to Charlotte from LA, and were looking for a good bar to grab some drinks, some food, and some fun, and we were not disappointed at all. We found the back patio, and had a great time drinking well priced beer and playing ping pong. Dinner was also great. I had the crab cake sandwich on a croissant, and it was delicious. \n\nSounds like when it's super busy the service get bad, but we were there early on Friday, and had no trouble getting drinks and service with a smile.
