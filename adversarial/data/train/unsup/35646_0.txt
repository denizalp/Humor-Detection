This place is pretty good! All you can eat. It is deceiving on the outside as you think it is a little restaurant but it is actually a huuuge space inside. Booths tables and a lot of staff busily buzzing around like worker bees.\n\nThe staff is important because something to note was that during this visit, we didn't wait long for our food. The all you can eat comes in two prices as you can opt for the deluxe that features some of their premium items which I think is worth it.\n\nThe portions are small but that is good for buffet addicts like me that want to pay for selection and variety rather than solid big portions.\n\nI'd go back again.
