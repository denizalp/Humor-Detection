I'm not a huge fan of any of the Target stores, but when something appears on a loved one's wish list, you go where you have to go.  So off to this \"vertical mall\" and their amusement-park escalators.\n\nI imagine that people really like parking inside, out of the weather in that parking deck, but in the name of Frank Gehry could you have made it any less driver-friendly?  I'm surprised anyone ever makes it out of that hampster wheel alive or un-dented.\n\nThe store is staffed with people who make it clear they would rather stand around than offer assistance; I asked two red-clad Target robots for help finding an item, and both times they just pointed and said, \"Over there.\"  Great, thanks.  I'll just continue walking around.  \n\nThey get two stars because their marketing and level of merchandise, as well as pricing, are all pretty decent.  K-Mart and Sears deserve to go out of business, thanks to their top-level management scheme of squeezing out every drop of profit by axing thousands.  Good work, guys.  Third world, ho!
