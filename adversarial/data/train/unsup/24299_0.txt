I'm hesitant giving this place a good review, because it'll become too busy :P\n\nThey currently have a 2 drinks for $8.00 special going on - refer to my Tip with the pic for the particular drinks. My friend and I wanted this deal, and they were nice enough to let us pay separately. The bbt they serve is Presotea.\n\nI got the Panda Milk Tea - gimmicky regular milk tea w\/ black and white tapioca pearls. I've had Presotea before but this time the milk tea tasted very bland - hopefully just a one off.\n\nThe one thing I liked about this place was the comfy chairs, which facilitated a chill ambience which allowed for optimal chilling.\n\nI'll def be back to chill and try their waffles\/desserts.
