Don't believe the hype like I did. I've since removed all of my positive feedback regarding this company because of how they treated me as a customer and how they treat their employees. \nI used them over 7 months on a 3 wk rotation. So this review is not based on 1 or 2 services. This is an observation over time. \nSometimes they didn't show up on time (no big deal), no call no showed me twice and rarely sent 2 people (a very big deal). One housekeeper doing the work of 2, while you are paying for two is no good. In my opinion, the housekeeper is being overworked as Im sure the housekeeper is getting the same pay whether they have another set of hands or not. I did NOT like that. The work should be divided properly between 2 people. Like other companies. \n \nI hired another company (see my review) who ALWAYS send 2, they are cheaper, they clean the windows and blinds without charging \"extra\" and  have never \"no call no showed\" me. Both ladies are in and out in 1.5 hours TOPS with more completed.\nEverytime Superb Maids no called no showed or couldn't send 2 people, I always got a bunch of excuses (Mostly using my square footage as an excuse to not consistently send 2) \nAs a client it's no fun waiting 3- 4 hours at home on your day off to:\nA) Have one maid show up to do the work of two which takes twice as long. (Basic things would get missed, like cleaning the floor around the toilet, top of the range and fridge, bathroom mirrors, etc.) I don't want to pay for a service, lose 4 hours of my day, so I can go over and clean missed things after she left. \nB) Wait at home for NO ONE to show up. (Also very frustrating).\nThe impression I got is, if you have a small house\/condo, they arent really interested in your business and will skip you on your scheduled rotation for a bigger, more expensive, client.\n\nEdit: You have a bot auto posting  for you? Elena, I wouldn't call a 1 star review anything to be excited about.
