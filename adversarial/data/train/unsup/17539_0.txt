At least there is a Tim Hortons in here! Donuts!\n\nJust a basic gas station and convenience store located across the street from Hotel 10 where we are staying. So easy to walk across the street to pick up snacks, soda, bottled water, beer, etc, at a cost much cheaper than what the hotel charges for these items.\n\nCheetos \"Puffs Souffles\" was a must buy to snack on. And the name made me laugh too.
