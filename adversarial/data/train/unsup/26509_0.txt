Went with my wife and a friend for lunch.  It was OK.  The food ideas were good, but everything was just OK.  It all needed a little more spice, a little more flavor, it just wasn't anything to get excited about.  The service was excellent, but this is not a place for a quick bite, it was slow paced.
