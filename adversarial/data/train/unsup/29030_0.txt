Went here for breakfast on a Wednesday and it was good grub. They have an omelet bar and other basic items. If you get the players club card they give you $1 off per person, but I am not sure how many people that is good for. The ham was a bit too sweet for my son. The peach cobbler and fresh pineapples were good according to the people in our group.
