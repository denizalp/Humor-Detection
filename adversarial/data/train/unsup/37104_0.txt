A tad scary... (yes, I've seen women of the night at this establishment), and pretty expensive for burgers... but this place is a solid greasy option for your late night burger fix on the strip. I'm always glad these guys are around when I bust out of the poker table or craps game at 3 AM and want something yummy to eat.
