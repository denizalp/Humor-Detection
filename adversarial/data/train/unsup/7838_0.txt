All the food at Panera's chains are pretty much consistent and I always stick to same order I know best.\n\nPick two: bacon turkey bravo & lemon orzo soup with an apple\nThis visit I also ordered their newly showcased Power Passion Smoothie.\n\nBacon Turkey Bravo comes with such a lovely tomato-basil bread, cheese, turkey, bacon, lettuce and tomato. I typically get a tomato soup, but went with their lemon orzo soup for something more simple. It's more of a broth with orzo, instead of a lemon orzo chowder. The smoothie was really good, it was refreshing ! Green from the spinach, fruity and light from the mango and peach I believe. A bit pricey for such a small portion-- might want to stick to smoothie orders at Jamba Juice.\n\nService can be a bit slow and hectic, but the servers do with what they can with those problematic pagers. Pretty busy location during lunch, but they do have a drive- thru.
