A friend and I were looking for a great, off the strip experience. We found that and more at honey salt. From the fantastic drinks to the delicious food to the impeccable service, we were very happy we had come. The servers and bartenders were amicable and eager to please (and went above and beyond to correct a steak that came out a little more rare than I was comfortable with). The manager, Monica, stopped by and made some excellent recommendations on not only dessert but also other bars we should be sure to check out while we were in Vegas. All around, it was one of the best eating experiences I've had in a while, and I would recommend it strongly to anyone living in or visiting Las Vegas.
