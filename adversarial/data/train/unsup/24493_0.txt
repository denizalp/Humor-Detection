Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue. JUST DO IT!!! Seriously the best thing on their menu. Total foodgasm.\n\nWent out on a double date Saturday night. Pro tip: make a reservation. I absolutely LOVE the decor, ambiance, vibes, and music in this place. Definitely a place with heart and soul. I dig it.\n\nService: We arrived late (sorry!) and were still seated rather promptly. Staff and service and great. Shoutout to our awesome server who's from Napa, CA. The dude was wearing a green t-shirt...but so was everyone else on St. Pattys Day :P He was top-notch. I'd give 5 stars for service. He was friendly and really attentive. Drinks refills were appreciated. \n \nAPPETIZERS:   \n- Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue: giant soft pretzel bites that have the perfect amount of sea salt and flavor perfect for dipping into your cheese fondue pot. A bajillion times YAAAAAS! Super filling you'll feel fat & happy.\n- Hot Wings: Culinary Dropout, you shouldn't include \"Hot\" in the title if you can't bring the heat. We both know they can be hotter! They're good, just not hot.\n\nDRINKS:\nY'all don't mess around here! Definitely worth a shot.\n\nENTREES:\nI was bummed to find out you ran out of grilled steak tacos :'(\n- Meatloaf served with mashed potatoes and green beans: good stuff, especially if you are a meatloaf lover\n- Tuna and chicken salads are both VERY GENEROUS portion sizes. Honestly not sure I necessary liked the taste and flavors of them, but there's a lot to eat if you do (-1\/2 star)\n- Steak: nicely cooked, fabulous plating and presentation. Too bad it was served cold (-1\/2 star)\n\nDESSERT: \n- Monkey Bread: Sooooo good! I wish I had left more room in my belly to enjoy and finish all of it by myself!
