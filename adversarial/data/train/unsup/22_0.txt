Wish that I had read the reviews before going to see the show.  Great on TV, ehhhhh, not so much on the stage.  Nothing spectacular or extraordinary. Penn and Teller, the show that I saw last night, blew Chris Angel away. Actually, the Freemont Street Experience pretty much blew Chris Angel's show away. Should have walked out and asked for a refund after 20 minutes but I was with my wife and daughter. Found out that they would have walked too.  Judging by the level of enthusiasm with the audience applause my guess is that we were not the only ones in the audience who were blown away and amazed - blown away that the show is SO BAD and amazed that this show is still running!  I may have to call American Express, tell hem that I was defrauded and ask for a refund.  Did I mention that THIS SHOW STINKS?\nUPDATE:  I called the Cirque Du Soliel head office in Las Vegas 702-352-0221 and very nicely explained that the show was sh*t and that it did not live up to the level of quality that I would expect from a CDS show and asked for a refund.  I was offered complimentary tickets to a future CDS show. When I said that that was not acceptable and that only a full refund would be a satisfactory resolution I was given a FULL REFUND!  Don't be a victim - get a refund!
