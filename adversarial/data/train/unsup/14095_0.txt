Main Points: \n-Delicious and unique cake flavors\n-Friendly and helpful staff, set up an appointment for best experience\n\nReview:\nCake is my favorite food group, and as someone who has indulged in many a slice, I can confidently say that Robert's has some of the best cake around.  They have a huge variety of different gourmet flavors, but my go-to flavor has always been the vanilla almond cake with the strawberry rum Bavarian creme (as in yummy Vanilla rum Bavarian creme with big sweet chunks of strawberries in the cake layers).  It's sure to please everyone, since there's no chocolate, nuts, or anything else that people might be picky about.  \n\nWendy and the rest of the staff are very friendly, and they will advise you on designs and flavors.  It is a small place and stays busy, so make an appointment to ensure you get to taste their flavors of the week and customize your cake with the staff.  \n\nI have not had the chance to try their non-cake catering menu, but I've enjoyed their cakes both at my own and others' events.  You can expect your cake to be delicious, just the way you ordered it, and well worth the money.
