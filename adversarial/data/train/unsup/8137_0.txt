Perfect park to come skate if you're looking for trouble. It's a park we all love. But you know what's good when you come here. Just make sure you keep a burner on you cause your board to someone's face won't do justice. *protect yourself at all cost* \n\n\n\nP.S. If you don't want your kids getting tossed across the park for getting in some ones way then this isn't the park for you. \nGood year is right up the street
