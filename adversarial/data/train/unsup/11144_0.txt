Michael Symon is by far my favorite Iron Chef!  So, two hours to Cleveland is a walk in the park.  Both my husband and I love to go on one day trips to Cleveland to eat at his restaurants.  If for lunch we love to go to B Spot, Michael Symon's burger joint, for dinner we love to go to Lola.  The amazing food combinations and the carnival of flavors are out of this world! \n\nThe Beef Cheek Pierogi appetizer is a must!  These juicy savory delights simply melt in your mouth.  The Smoked Berkshire Pork Chop is another big hit.  It is tender and succulent, layered on a bed of creamy and rich polenta.  The first time I had this dish at Lola, it was the best pork I had ever had.  Guess what... it is still the best pork I've ever had.  Michael Symon's specialty is pork... well... it shows!  Check my full review to learn more about Lola and the other 6 exquisite dishes and desserts with pictures that we've ordered during our many visits to Lola, such as the Fois & Figs, the Beef Hanger Steak or the Pumpkin Pie to name just a few: \n\nhttp:\/\/simplyromanesco.blogspot.com\/2011\/10\/b-spot-lola-cleveland-and-four-hungry.html
