Interesting array of light food on the menu. Wonderful selection of reasonably priced wines from around the world. Tuesday evenings at 6 PM wine tastings $10 cheese crackers and appetizers are included. Great way to expose yourself to many types of wines. The atmosphere is absolutely beautiful a completely renovated old house read done with mahogany rich dark colors fireplaces very well done! In addition to the regular seating there are leather easy chairs and loveseats to relax in. I highly recommend you give swirl a try. I am betting you will love this place too!
