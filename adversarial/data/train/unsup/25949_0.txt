If you are going to use this business...BEWARE!  I am currently using them to move my son and daughter across country...CA to Indiana...They promised they would have their goods delivered in 7-14 days.  The driver who picked up their \"stuff\" let me know it would probably take the whole 14 days....I had a three day buffer built in just in case they were a day late. I CALLED THEM on day 13, my kids \"stuff\" hasn't even left NEVADA!!  IF YOU DON\"T HAVE 30 DAYS...DO NOT USE THEM!!  I am living a college nightmare now with flying to Indiana to move kids into dorms\/apartment and none of their \"stuff\"!
