Found this place on Yelp a while back, and it was so close to my house I thought I'd try it out. I've gone to other salons in Etobicoke and was never fully satisfied with the outcome of my style or colour, especially considering the price. Nina at Classica is amazing, and she knows what she's doing! Prices at Classica are affordable and reasonable. I've gotten a better job done here for much cheaper than at very high end salons in downtown Toronto. Worth a try! Friendly staff, clean salon, and nice to see that the owners really care about client satisfaction.
