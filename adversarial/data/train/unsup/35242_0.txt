This place is pretty cute. Had the skinny margarita which was really good. Had the fajita salad with shrimp diablo. It was a generous portion with mixed greens, sweet corn, black beans, tomatoes, avocado and shrimp diablo (also available with chicken or steak). My friend had the fajita bowl, also with shrimp diablo and also commented on the amount of shrimp served was nice. We sat on the patio - good ambiance. I saw they gave happy hour everyday from 3-6 so I'll definitely go back and try some $1 tacos!!
