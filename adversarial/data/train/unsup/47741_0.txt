This is hands down one of my favorite Hawaiian BBQ places in Vegas. Thank you always Mom for wonderful food and a wonderful atmosphere! The food is always amazing we ordered the small number 36 and the kalbi is true authentic flavor! The side order of kimchi is definitely worth and macaroni salad is a wonderful side to the meats. The shrimp crunch roll is one of my favorites on the menu and it even comes with the plate! Small is a good size for one and it will fill you up. The sauce that comes with the salad appetizer is one of the best salad dressings I've ever had. They need to let me in on their secret. Mom gave us a sample of this poke spicy tuna with seaweed salad and crunchy topping and it's so much better than most poke places I've had. I always visit Mom's Teriyaki whenever I visit Vegas from Reno and they never fail to impress. Thank you Mom! See you soon.
