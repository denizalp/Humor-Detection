Shortly after I posted this I got an apology from the GM and he seems like a smart enough fella to help turn this place around and promise to give it another try someday.\nHi Peter, Thanks for the note and wish I could have had a different experience to report. You guys will always be 2nd fiddle to the Gallo Blanco unless you can do something uniquely different. It's too bad you can't use your north patio for the hundreds of locals to walk up and pickup some late night take out in a timely manor.
