I'm updating my review because I have been here a few times now. \nI just wanted to mention my super nice servers Genie, Yenny, and Jing (I apologize if I spelled them incorrectly). These ladies seriously do their jobs well. \nI've had a good experience every time I came and the ramen is pretty good. There's always room unlike other ramen places and the orders come out very quickly. Also at the end of your meal, they give you a piece of candy. \nI also finally tried the takoyaki and it's super good. I don't think I'll be able come without ordering at least one plate. \nOverall, I would definitely recommend this place.
