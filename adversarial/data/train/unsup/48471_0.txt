We had planned our family lunch at Red Robin since they usually have no problem seating our family of 16. This particular day we were told by the\n hostess that the wait for Red Robin would be 1 hour if we wanted to all sit together or 45 mins if we were willing to split into 2 groups. A few minutes later the manager came to us and said it would be at least 1 hour 45 minutes if we all wanted to sit together.  Understanding it was a busy Sunday we said ok but walked over to BJs to see if they would have a table sooner.  The hostess immediately called the manager up to see how long it would be since they had just sat 2 large parties.  The manager was very pleasant and genuinely wanted to find us a place, not at all like Red Robin's manager. She quoted us a wait time of 1 hour but said she would try to get us seated sooner.  We were seated 30 minutes later- all together.  The food was very good and the service was excellent.  This will be our new spot for large family dinners.
