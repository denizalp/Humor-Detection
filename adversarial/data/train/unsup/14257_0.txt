They have a nice display and everything looks delicious, however it doesn't taste that good. I had a cassata cake and it wasn't fresh. The homemade bread is probably the best thing they have going for them. Also during both of my visits the workers were arguing with each other which made it awkward. Sometimes it seems like you are bothering them when they are helping you.
