The wait was about 30 minutes which was to be expected it's in the casino, how ever I was shocked to see there was not a better way to reserve tables. No tooth picks I know your probably thinking really tooth picks? Well if u ordered chicken wings or pork you will need it so yeah! Service was okay food is what earned the stars! Chicken wings had a lot of BBQ sauce I loved it the garnish was edible a plus! Staff was not organized which is why our wait for food and table was very long. I was also surprised that there was no complementary bread for us after waiting 1 hour and 20 minutes total for food and table. His other restaurants do. Lastly there is not a bathroom in this place , the staff said its because there are casino bathrooms which to me is cheap and was very difficult coming back in from the casino to my table. Not good guys not at all. Portions from appetizers were bigger than the actual entr√©e plates strange! Price is high but use your total rewards card to get a lower price complements of Linq hotel!
