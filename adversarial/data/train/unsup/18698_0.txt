Standard teppanaki fare. I really like that you don't have to pay for their combos and can get the teppanaki a la cart. The chef's have many tricks but it's hit or miss as to which ones really have the flair. The food is good but not very healthy considering the amount of butter and oil in everything. Still for a once in a while treat the kids love it!
