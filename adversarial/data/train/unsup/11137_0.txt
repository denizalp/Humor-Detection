TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE.\n\nAfter looking at reviews and pictures, we decided to try this place while we had friends visiting from out of town. Since we had a large party, we knew we would need to make a reservation. So we did. We realized we would be running a little late, so we called ahead and let them know we were running late, to which they said they would accommodate us. However, once we arrived to the restaurant we were informed another party \"pretended\" to be us and took our reservation. There was a group of 14 of us. How can a restaurant not ask to verify name at the time of seating? I'm still so confused how a place can let this happen. And for whoever claimed to be our group, shame on you! Stealing someone else's reservation is just messed up.
