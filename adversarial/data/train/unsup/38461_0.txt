I was referred to Westside at Christmas time when my dentist office was closed. I was in terrible pain and needed an emergency root canal. I saw Dr. Steinbrunner and he was confused on which tooth needed the root canal as the whole side of my mouth was hurting. So he told me to 'pick which tooth I wanted the root canal on\" (his words). At that point I started crying because I knew he was not going to be able to help me. I'm sure he is a good dentist, but I can't imagine telling a patient to pick which tooth they wanted to have work done on. I had no idea where the pain was coming from and I assumed since he was the professional that he would be able to help. Unfortunately, I was wrong. The bad part about it all was that I had my two little girls in the room with me and they had to watch me cry in the dental chair while he just sat there and waiting for me to pick which tooth to work on. I left without any work done and went straight to my father's dentist (Dr. Benso at West Valley Dental) who did the root canal right away.
