I went through the drive through and ordered four Rally burgers with no cheese and a kids chicken and fries kit. The order taker said, \"Do you want cheese on those Rally burgers?\"  I loudly and clearly said, \"No!\"  When I got home, all four Rally burgers had cheese and no one in my house, except me, eats cheeseburgers. That's not good because the cheese was melted onto the burger so much that it could not be removed. So my wife took my daughter to Burger King while I combined the four Rally burgers into two double Rally burgers. The Rally burgers were pretty tasty to me!\n\nI looked at the receipt and I was charged $1.49 each for cheese burgers instead of $1.00 each. That kind of pissed me off, but oh well. Since when does \"No\" sound like \"Yes\"?  Don't answer that.\n\nTwo stars for service.  Three stars for food.
