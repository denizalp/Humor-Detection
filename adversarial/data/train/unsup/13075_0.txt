I STILL don't see what the hype is all about even with the second time around. It was OK.. I guess it's one of those clubs EVERYONE and they mama's talks about so you HAVE to go check it out. We had no problems getting in which is a plus, zipped through the line but strangely enough we went through this side door and upstairs to where TAO beach is located and then roamed around got a few drinks up there then decided to go downstairs, LMFAO was spinning that night so it was super crowded, so there was a line to get downstairs, thankfully it wasn't too much of a wait. Certain rooms were spinning some goooood music, and we found ourselves enjoying ourselves but as usual TAO is way overcrowded and packed like a sardine can. I don't think I need to check it out anymore after the last time.
