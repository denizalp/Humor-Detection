Johan is Cuban. Cuban is good. Johan in a white navy uniform? Very, VERY good!  \n\nHe took care of our bachelorette party and especially the bride to be. He was amazing, nice and definitely sexy as hell. \n\nOG as a whole...cheesy. However, when you must, you must! I didn't like when the men horded our table upon arrival.  That was a little pushy. They are kind of in your face at first about lap dances. The drink service was also very slow. Get tanked ahead of time and take the free limo. Save money for g-string stuffing :P\n\nIt was a ton of fun and if you just go with the cheesy flow you'll have a blast!
