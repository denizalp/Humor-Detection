The fall of a once fabulous buffet, have not been here in years the rio and the buffet seem like they have fallen on hard times hotel it self fell a little but the once grand rio buffet has to be the laughing stock of all the other buffets or genius for what they charge for a scaled down Denny's of the buffet world.\n33 bucks for really old dry lousy food or a 20 upgrade gets too a hand stamp and entrance to  a poorly stocked seafood section it's crazy your better off at hash house and that place sucks \nYour best bet is to avoid this place food bad service worse and everyone's unhappy\nThe place including hotel looks likes its fallen on hard times. What's going on Vegas your grand old lady's are fading away to late for the rio buffet it died and no one cares
