This place was close to our hotel so we decided to check it out after reading great reviews. The ordering process was a little confusing, but I managed to order some delicious tacos. My bf originally ordered enchiladas but somehow ended up with tacos. Other than that, great food and good service. Need a place like this in Chicago (hint, hint) :)
