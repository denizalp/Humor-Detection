What a pleasant surprise - the kind of place one would never know about without yelp and other review sources.  Very friendly staff - had some almond cookies, a mr. kim roll and honey bread.  All were excellent, and the almond cookies were particularly excellent.  Great place to grab some pastries, and they did a nice job of making a little inviting cafe out of their space.  All pastries were very well merchandised - had a french bakery quality to the packaging.  Highly recommended.
