Gorgeous view and comfy seating at the bar and seating area.  Couches and rainbow drapes, hiding the phone charging outlet located on the floor.  Steve Wynn knows classy and doesn't forget one detail.  I love that being a detailed oriented person.  \n\nServers are dressed in a bedazzled black ensemble and bartenders in all black.  Rick was my bartender today.  I have a few usual bartender friends here from throughout the years since they've been opened.  Today I've seen all newer people, very courteous, clean and attentive.  Snacks are always good and from a clean enclosed container.  Nuts, sweet pretzel type things that remind me of those Gardines or whatever they're called lol and usually ketchup chips.  \n\nLooking out, onto the fountains, the electric drapes just now closing, probably cause the sun was blindinga customer.  Always accommodating.  Great place to meet-up with friends before dinner or the club.
