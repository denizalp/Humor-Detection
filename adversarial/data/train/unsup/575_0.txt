I like this place! I go there to pick up rocks \"geodes\" but also to feel the positive vibes of this swap meet.  We got about 20 geodes today, we're super happy!   Now if you need to get make up, toys, clothes, baby stuff, phone accessories, a lawn mower, chili pepper, perfume, an area rug, grab something to eat or whatever, this is also the place for you! It is all covered, dont worry about the sun or the rain, just come on over there for a happy sun ray of Mexican charm.
