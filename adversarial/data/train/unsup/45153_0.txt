I normally do not leave reviews but I feel compelled to give a review on this nail salon. I was a few minutes late for my appt approx 4min. I walked in- they said 30  min...I said no, I have an appointment.  They said sit in the pedicure chair .....with my feet  in water and cold ....I sat and sat and sat.... I dried my feet and left. No apology, in fact indignant nasty comments to me and people I know in the community. \nI did return because I thought it might be an off night. I had my eye brows done. The girl dropped wax in my eye. The day before I was to leave on a business meeting. $400.00 at the walk-in clinic.  Again, no apology . Upon my return I spoke with Hai who was rude, belligerent and a bit scary. \nThough the decore is pleasing the people are not. I think they are scared of the owners Van &Hai. \nI learned my lesson and will not return. I will  go where the staff and patrons are treated with respect.  The Pedicures and gel does not stay on...there is a constant rotation of new people. I now know why.
