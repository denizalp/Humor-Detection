OK it seems I have become a fan of Uber, that's right, I love using Uber any chance I can or need too.\n\nKnew I was headed out to a party and that I didn't want to drive. Whipped out my handy Uber App and got me a ride. I have also learned Uber has apps for Android & IPhones but not for window phones, sorry window phone users, missing out on a cool thing!\n\nOn the app you have the choice to pick between UberX, Black Car or SUV, just slide the little bar whichever way to the car you would like, then it will show you how many cars in the area & how far away, also before you go any further double, triple check your pin location, that's your pick up spot,  only speaking from experience, I didn't double check my pin location and saw my car drive the other way haha, so check your pin! Now you're ready to either order your car or check out a fair quote and get your ride.\n\nI have used UberX and the Black Cars all over Europe and now in Phoenix too. Yep I'm a fan for sure.
