Yesterday afternoon, tried to stop in the open store for lunch. An employee said we were not welcomed there because we were wearing Trump supportive shirts. The outside seating was still there, the door was open and people were coming and going, but we were refused service. \nThe manager posted that they were closed, and they were in the evening, however, he is incorrect that we were turned away. His employee refused us entrance, I have the pictures. Please do not make us post the pictures and please do not say it is not politics.  \nI will never return to your store.
