This place is so tasty! My husband and I stopped here for lunch and we weren't disappointed. We had the guacamole appetizer and it was so fresh, you can taste the quality in the chips and the guacamole. \n\nFor our entrees, my husband got the chicken with chimichurri and I got the braised beef. Both dishes were expectional.\n\nFor drinks, I got the watermelon mojito which had more ice than drink but it was delicious and my husband got a Malbec.\n\nThe prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is fun. They play great music which makes the energy up.\nI would come back next time I am in Vegas!
