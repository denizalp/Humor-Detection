Walking in, the front bar area is very tight and narrow. Lots of people congregating around the bar, which makes pasage to the back room tables or the upstairs a challenge at times. The bar is quite long with ample seating.\n\nNever had a problem with outdated bottles or beer that did not taste quite right on tap.  The bartenders and waitresses, they are really nice and quite knowledgable about beer, the problem is, there are not enough of them, especially when it is late at night or during a Pens\/Steelers game. So the service is good, just not enough of it...\n\nThere are a ton of bottled beers (200+) and beers on tap (at least 40) here. There is no shortage of varying style of beer. They do quite well keeping up with the seasonals as well.  Average bar food...nothing going to blow you out of the water here. \n\nA great bar for beer quality and quantity. A must stop when on the Southside, beware of the crowds at night and during sporting events.
