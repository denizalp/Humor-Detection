Today was the first bad meal and customer service experience I've experienced at any cheesecake factory. I had my usual dish of cajun jumbalaya pasta and it was obvious my portions were reduced and the care taken to prepare the dish was not evident.  The usual food presentation was gone.  My rasberry lemonade was awful.  They have even decreases the portions for cheesecake as well.  Lastly our waitress was very slow. We will not be eating at this particular\n cheesecake factory in the future.
