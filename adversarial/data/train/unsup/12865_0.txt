Well hello friends\n\nBeing a (2002 NFL SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONS) TAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS FAN\nPOW!!!\n\nI can only give this place 3 stars = OK. I can't bring myself to give 4 (YAY! I'M A FAN) just because I'M NOT a fan of anything Panthers. lol I love the hate. lol\n\nAnyway, since I live here this is the local team. The prices are high, the crowd is your tea & crumpetts, leave by half time, sit down i can't see kinda crowd. EVERYtime i come here I ALWAYS support my team. (TAMPA BAY) and NEVER feel like i may be risking my life. Any NFL fan would NEVER do that If going to:\n\nCOWBOYS \nPHILLY\nRAIDERS\nKC\nPITTSBURG ya know... real SPORT die hard fan city's. I think thats because Charlotte probably has more ppl from other cities than they do locals, so there is no REAL sense of HOME TEAM.  In fact, I never had a comment or anything other than smiles (maybe some mubbles under their breath but, what i don't hear won't hurt me right????? RIGHTTTT!!!!!!\n\nI've had the pleasure of seeing games from the 500 section as well as the 100 section. Its not ONE bad seat in the house. As Trey S said... you can find cheap tickets. \n\n\n** If you are still reading this and havn't said what a complete idiot I am by now.... Cheers to you!! There is hope. I'm not hating on the Pampers.. I\"m just NOT a fan. I still have that right don't I... ??? well.. don't I??    lol\n\nGo have yourself some fun...maybe stay for the whole game even!
