Gorgeous leather wear for playtime, although there are many pieces that will work for a night on the town (even if that night doesn't include spending a little quality time in a dungeon). I like that there's a large selection for men AND women (most of these types of places tend to skew one way or the other) in a variety of sizes.  Decent corset selection for tightlacing enthusiasts as well as for corsetry newbies and those who prefer a little less rigidity to their corsets. There's a small selection of toys and videos, but really -- come here for the clothes. What they don't have, they will custom make. \n\nThe store is huge and seems to go on forever. Prices here are high, as to be expected. Best part of the store, though: a sign near the stiletto heels that reads: IF YOU LICK, YOU BUY.
