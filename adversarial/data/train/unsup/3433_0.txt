$7.50 for a margarita with the whole shaker.  Pretty sweet deal.  Not the best margarita in the world, but it was cheap.\n\nOther than that, the bar is weird with the short chairs and the chips are alright.  I wouldn't stop in here for food, or drinks for that matter.  But when you're on campus and need a marg within walking distance after being bored to tears by your professor, this place will do.
