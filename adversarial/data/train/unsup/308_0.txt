First of all let me just say the customer service in this store is absolutely horrendous. Finally I get to try stuff on - after a 30 min wait - and everything feels scratchy n cheap. Then after making final decisions, I have to wait in line to pay for another 45 min. The girl said they had several people call out and that's why we had to wait so long..... While they stand around doing nothing.
