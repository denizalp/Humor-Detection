I heard good thing about this place and thought I will go try their dim sum, so when I went there on a friday afternoon for my dim sum crave ... \n\nGrowing up in Hong Kong, I can tell what good dim sum is ... and this place is definitely not. Ordered the 'Ha gow' (shrimp dumpling) and 2 other dim sum ... and it was just bad ... the skin was way too thick and too sticky that you can not even bite it in ... and the seasoning for the other dishes simply not right ... It was so bad that me and my friends decided to get the bill and go to another dim sum place (China King) to continue our meal.\n\nBeside the food, the service was not good either ... I can hear the waitress was making comments that we only ordered 3 things (good\/bad thing to know a 2nd language sometime) ...  Definitely won't come back to this place
