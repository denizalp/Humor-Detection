Worst Chinese food I ever had.\n\nI eat Chinese food 5 - 8 times a month.\nWent to this place with family. Ordered 2 appetizers and 5 entrees. Every single item we ordered was either burst or under cooked. Sent three dishes back to the kitchen to cook the shrimp more because they were raw. \n\nThe food had NO taste whatsoever.\n\nI complained to our waitress and commented to her that this was the worst Chinese food I ever had. Her response was \"our Chef quit and the person cooking in the kitchen is not very good at cooking Chinese food\"\n\nI commented to the waitress why are you guys serving this kind of food to your customers and charging for it when you know it is no good? In her response she just shrugged her shoulders.
