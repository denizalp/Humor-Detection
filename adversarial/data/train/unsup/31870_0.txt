Gotta say, AGAIN, this place is absolutely incredible!! I don't understand the comments about the staff being sullen or uncaring....every single time I've been in, the staff have been welcoming, friendly and knowledgeable! And the food simply cannot be beat. BEST enchiladas I have EVER had. If they sold the half corn\/half flour tortillas by the dozen, I'd be in heaven. The guacamole is ALSO the best I've ever had, but by far my favorite thing on the menu are the smashed jack potato enchiladas! Perfect Mexican food with a modern twist! And I'm not a huge fan of spice or food drowning in sauce, so recently when one of the staff recommended I try it with just cheese & crema....let's just say my whole world was rocked. I'd eat there every single day if I could! And oh my goodness, the pumpkin cookies that are by the register are worth the trip in and of themselves!! If you have not tried this place yet, do yourself a favor and get there asap!!! This place is an absolute treasure in the Valley!!!
