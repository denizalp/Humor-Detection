After the doctor told me about my hormonal imbalances due to PCOS, she told me I needed to do a 1400 calorie diet. I said that was unhealthy and unsustainable so she proceeded to fat shame me and tell me I \"didn't want it bad enough\" if I couldn't follow through. That is completely illogical based on what she said about my hormones and it's unethical and dangerous to tell that to someone that with an ED, which was clearly stated on my intro packet.\n\nThere is plenty of research on the dangers of VLC diets and their unsustainably. I guess if you want a \"quick fix\" that won't last more than a few months, this is your place. But if you want serious long-term weight loss, I'd find a place that helps you build habits and encourage instead of break you down with pseudo-science and fear-mongering. Too bad this is the only place my insurance covers.
