This Staples location is decent. I wish it were closer to my home.\n\nI tend to visit the clearance items section. This store had mini containers that were perfect for my needs. I have been using salad dressing containers that leak. I have had it with them! These new ones serve my purpose nicely.\n\nI also like the cute lemon, pineapple, and other fun badge reels. My local Staples store doesn't have any of them! I bought the pineapple one and am contemplating getting the lemon one for work.\n\nThis store also has a decent selection of travel items. I bought a three-pack of refillable travel bottles. Again, there seems to be a trend here with my various items that I own leaking. I have a bottle that I fill with facial toner, but it leaks. I gave this product a try and my toner does not leak. Yay!\n\nI realize that staff here are trying to be helpful when they ask whether you need any assistance. However, my friend and I were asked that question three times by three different associates within five minutes. Perhaps easing off on that question would be great and you can save your chops! Other that this minor irritation, this store has everything that I need and more.\n\n(368)
