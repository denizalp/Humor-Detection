I finally heard back from the BBB complaint yesterday, so I'm updating this to add a star for at least that. I was assured that the company doesn't take such behavior lightly and they apologized for their manager not acting after the first few reports. They assured me also that this particular driver would never be delivering to my house again, even if anything changed at Amazon in terms of deprioritization. So hopefully this awful experience is now behind me. My suggestion to anyone having a persistent problem with their Ontrac deliveries is to leave the complaint on here solely for the benefit of others, but file the complaint with the BBB if you want something done about your problem.
