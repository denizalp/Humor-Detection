Had a great experience here. I came at a good time - no wait at all. My technician was very thorough & quick. I have absolutely no complaints about the quality of my gel manicure. Also, it was $30 & took less than an hour. Pretty amazing! \n\nThe salon itself is pretty basic, not many frills. But everyone was very friendly and the experience will make it worth a return trip next time I am in town for business. Also, many of the other clients appeared to be regulars which is always a great sign. Highly recommend.
