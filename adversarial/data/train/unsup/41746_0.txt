At the risk of being redundant (and that wouldn't be a first for me), Border Brunch is a Las Vegas must-do.  I really, really enjoyed the outstanding service -- and mimosa selections -- from  cute-as-a-button Diane.  It was also a pleasure to meet manager Melody, who treated me like a king and gave me the inside scoop on all the great stuff going on within the growing Border Grill empire.  And I would be remiss not to mention new Chef Jamaal, who was firing on all cylinders -- especially on his barbecue brisket sandwich.  Said it before and will say it again -- Can't wait to go back!
