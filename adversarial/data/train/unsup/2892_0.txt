Love love love this small place. My boyfriend's parents live down the street and whenever we're over this area to visit, I always asked to make a stop here FIRST :) everything here is so pretty to look at it and most importantly, so so yummy! I can never remember the names of what I got because I always choose what I want on how it looks.. so the name is just a blur to me, especially with sweet pastries (ugh, so bad I know) \n\nParking on butler can be a pain sometimes because of how busy this road can get but I never seem to have a problem with it. So it might just depends on the time you come in. Other than that I'm definitely coming back to try some of their sandwiches because I've heard great things on it too
