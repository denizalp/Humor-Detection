I had an estimate for a bath exhaust I was quoted 850 dollars too expensive . The gentleman offered explanation of why stating code and ground wire cause obviously these old houses have the round wire . A new circuit may have to be added and so forth. I didnt have an exhaust at all but I looked into it and got two qoutes 600 dollars if it was done per code with the groind wire etc.  But interacted well .
