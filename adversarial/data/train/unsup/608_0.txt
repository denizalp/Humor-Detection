So, I gave Mandalay a shot after my not so good stay at Monte Carlo 8 months ago since I'm an M life member. I was guessing this would be better since it's a higher end hotel.  First, Monte Carlo had outdated furnitures, Mandalay looks like it was just renovated. It takes about 30 mins to get your car at Monte Carlo from valet and about 1 hour at Mandalay. Monte Carlo didn't have coffee machines, Mandalay has a petite Keurig-like machine but no complimentary coffee. You need to purchase it. I'm a coffee drinker and this is a biggie for me. How much is a K-cup nowadays? Costco has it around 30-50 cents for different flavors and they can't even comp'd it? I guess I will no longer stay at this group of hotels.
