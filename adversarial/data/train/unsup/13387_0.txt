Don't get sucked in like my husband and I did!  Looks can be very deceiving!  It was not too bad when we first moved in however it just keeps getting worse and we can not wait till our lease is up.  These apartments were made extremely cheap.  The walls are paper thin, the air conditioning sounds like a dang jet and doesn't even work properly because no air gets to one of the bedrooms, and the appliances are crappy.  They also have bugs and it's really bad if you are on the first floor and I am a very clean person but we have gotten tons of crickets, spiders, and roaches in our place which has never happened to me before in our other apartments which we were paying 600 less for.  Overall, I feel these are way too much for what you are getting.  To add to my hatred of this cheap crappy place, our neighbor's toilet water overflowed into our apartment the other day really bad and it took almost an hour to get ahold of the emergency maintenance which came by only to tell us they would come back in the morning since it was clean water that had been leaking.  It was not clean water and we had to stay in our smelly sewage water, outrageously expensive apartment. This dang lease cannot end soon enough!!!  To add, it is now 3 days since the flooding happened and they have only sent an appraiser to look at the damage but yet they haven't even checked to make sure the water is not a Biohazard which to me water from a toilet bowl is a Biohazard no matter what and our unit is smelling really bad...like I said before, definitely not worth the price!  Oh...and the Manager started getting an attitude towards my husband for writing bad reviews and tried to say we stole their spare key to our unit.
