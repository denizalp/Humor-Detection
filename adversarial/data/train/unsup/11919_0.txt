I really wanted to like this place. The place is quite cute, and its nice to have some variety in Markham. BUT the waiting time to get food once you sit down is ridiculous. They really have to work on whatever cooking system they have going on, because it is not working. \n\nYou would think it would be pretty easy to do a restaurant where all they basically have is donburi and udon, but apparently not. \n\nI waited over an hour for a tempura udon, which is basically just noodle soup with a few pieces of fried seafood on top. And by my observation, I was clearly not the only one in this situation. In fact, most tables I saw, one customer would finish eating and then their companions dish would come, after a 10 minute wait. Pretty hilarious to watch actually, but not so much when you're getting annoyed\/hungry. \n\nSo my two companions got their food 40 minutes after we got there. I got mine about an hour in, after asking both the waitresses where my dish was. I guess they felt pretty bad, so they told me my dish was on the house. Which is nice in theory, but GUESS WHAT, they gave me the WRONG dish. Nice..\n\nAnd though they took the dish off the bill, they charged us for a dish that never arrived after an hour and a half....so...yeah. \n\nThe food is mediocre at best. Lots of places do the same mediocre Japanese food. Also, don't understand why there's apple in the donburi. \n\nOh the Matcha Latte is not bad. A bit too sweet but not bad.\n\nSo maybe, if you have 2 1\/2 hours to kill, but otherwise I wouldn't recommend coming here. I don't think i'll ever come back.
