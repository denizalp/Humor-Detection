One word. SLOW. I tried this place when it first opened around a month ago. It was slow and about 1\/3 of the orders(as I was sitting there) were wrong. I chalked it up to everyone being new and decided to wait a bit before I came back. Today it took 17 minutes for an iced coffee. I am very patient but this isn't good.
