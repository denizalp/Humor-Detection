Spoke with Allen on the phone and he was very polite and helpful. The next day I dropped by and he took care of my computer right away. The diagnostic was free and he was able to solve the issues very quickly. Waited no more than 1.5 hrs. He advised that the best thing was to dbl the ram. After I said not today due to a low budget, he offered about 500mg of ram free of charge to help me along. After everything the fee was surprising low. All in all, he is a very nice and friendly fellow. I strongly recommend him for all your repairs. If I ever need to repair my computer again or if I decide to increase the ram, he will most definitely be my first choice.
