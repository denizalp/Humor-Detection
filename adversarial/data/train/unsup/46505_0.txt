Came here last Saturday with a friend for dinner. Lighting was dim and remiscent of candle light. Servers were all very friendly and enthusiastic. The atmosphere and vibe seemed casual, laid back, chill and had an old tavern, country look to it with string lights and wooden accents. \n\nI ordered the black and blue burger ($12.50) which comes with sides such as salad\/fries\/etc at an extra cost. To my own negligence, I was a bit disappointed my burger didnt come with fries but realized after that I had to order them. Nonetheless, my burger was very juicy and filling. Definitely not first date food as things will get messy but sooo good! The patty was a bit too salty for my liking but the blue cheese chunks and caramelized onions balanced the burger very nicely. I also ordered 9 oysters ($3\/each) from BC and PEI but they had a deal for a dozen at $30 that day. The mignonette tasted fantastic and the oysters although on the small side were very delicious and fresh. \n\nOverall, I liked the ambience of the place and how friendly and comfortable it felt. Looking forward to $1.50 oysters on Mondays and Thursdays!
