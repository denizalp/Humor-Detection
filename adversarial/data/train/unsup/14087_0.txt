I had to come back and update my review after this weekend. What an exceptional dentist and practice!\n\nBeen having some pain on the left side of my jaw \/ face for about a month now. Usually, it would go away after a few hours. \n\nWell, not this Sunday. Teeth couldn't make contact with each other without a world of hurt! \n\nCalled the emergency line; heard back from Dr. Morales within the hour. Phones in an antibiotic (in case it was an infection) and some pain drugs to my pharmacy. \n\n*Update 8\/27: Found out today that Dr. Block was actually the one that got the message and passed it along to Dr. Morales. Obviously, never been to him for anything dental, but seemed like a nice guy.Thanks so much!*\n\nWHOA.\n\nTo top it off, Kokopelli was able to work me in this morning, no sweat. \n\nDoc takes a look. Teeth are pristine, no decay. No infection to be found. . . Whew . . . Wait, what's up with your jaw?!  \n\nTurns out I have TMJ - Guess a decade plus of Olympic \/ General Weightlifting has finally caught up to me. \n\nAthletes know what I'm talking about, that \"Oh-Holy- $#!+-Clench-My-Teeth-No-Idea-How-I'm-Going-To-Get-Up-Out-Of-This-Super-Heavy-Full-Clean-or-Back-Squat!\" type of jaw\/teeth clenching.\n\nPossibly grinding my teeth in my sleep as well. \n\nGot some impressions done for night and sports guards, and some muscle relaxers for the week while I wait for them to be made. \n\nUnreservedly recommend Dr. Morales and Kokopelli Family and Cosmetic Dentistry to all of my Yelp friends - Since my whole family already goes here, haha! \n\nCome here for all your dental needs if you want to be treated with compassion and as a human being - Not just another insurance claim or dollar sign.\n\nIt's worth the drive to Ahwatukee. :)
