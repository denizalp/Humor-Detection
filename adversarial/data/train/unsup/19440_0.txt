It's never a bad thing to see the local craft beer community expanding. Astronomy Aleworks adds to the various reasons to drive all the way to the Henderson auto mall area. I usually only go to one place though, so this makes the decision that much harder.\n\nWe made an impromptu visit on their second day of soft opening. The taproom is a few doors down from Crafthaus. It's bright and barebones, though it might not be 100% finished. The seating is comfortable and the guy serving us was super friendly.\n\nAt the time, there were six of their beers on tap, along with a few guests. We chose to try the prickly pear enhanced versions of their hefeweizen and pale ale. Both were quite tasty with the pale ale edging out the hef. The only baseline brew we tried was their stout, which was solid.\n\nKudos to them for sticking to the astronomy theme in naming their beers. I didn't actually know the meaning of perihelion until I coincidentally watched a Smarter Every Day video the next day. Learning through beer. I like it.
