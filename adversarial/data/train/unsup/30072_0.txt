I'm posting this because I know Starbucks won't suffer as a company from negative reviews.... But this location is extremely frustrating. It's convenient with a prime location but the employees don't really care about that (I'm just guessing). Long wait time inside and out , no matter how busy. And you rarely receive genuine positivity from the employees.
