I loved this place.  They have really good drinks with an awesome ambiance and great music.  They don't have many things to eat in the vegan department but it's a nice little cafe\/bar.  \n\nToday I went for a meeting and the place was jam packed as usual.  I had just sat down in a corner spot and was setting up my laptop, notebook etc. when a very abrasive man asks if we're holding the two seats next to us.  We were not but it was a very tight space so I had my laptop bag and notebook there.  He answers for me and says no, you're not, takes the two seats and then a woman with an infant and one or two other kids join him.  He left us no choice but to pick up our things and move to another table.  He was so entitled and unapologetic.  I kept seeing him throughout the restaurant engaging with the staff so I figured he worked there.  After a quick google search I found out that the rude man was the owner.  I cannot believe that an owner would be so rude to customers.  I hate that this happened because I will not return to a once favorite neighborhood spot.
