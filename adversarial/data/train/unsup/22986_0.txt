I've been here a couple times now. It's a fun and friendly place. The flavors aren't very plentiful in my opinion but they do have the dual pouring spouts so you can swirl your flavors! I've tried the German Chocolate Cake and Mocha Fudge along with the Coconut Caramel Cookie which is taken from Girl Scout Cookies-Samoas. Toppings are ok. Again, as far as selection, it's just kind of standard. But they are very friendly and helpful and they have a points card so you can earn free yogurt. It's kind of tucked away so look for the Starbucks and it's a few doors down.!
