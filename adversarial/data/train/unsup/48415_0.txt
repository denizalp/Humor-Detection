I wish I could give 6 stars. The instructors, class formats, and studio set up are all doing their job at helping every woman (regardless of age, body type or experience level) feel confident, sexy and fantastic. I've taken several levels of pole dance classes here and have enjoyed multiple lap dance\/strip tease workshops. In addition, me and my girlfriends have loved having a few private parties here where we can choose from pole, chair, or lap dance classes. The studio is a little hard to find, but well worth investing the time in yourself!
