Extensive sushi choices with great portions and very reasonable prices. The quality and freshness of the food is...acceptable, but let's not complain here - there's clearly way worse. In any case the taste is quite agreeable, everything looks visually appealing, and the sizeable cuts of fish and excellent filling to rice ratios were a pleasant surprise. All containers also come with miso soup. :)\n\nService is unfortunately not the best in my personal experience. I've never been greeted coming into this store, although the lady at the counter has apparently taken to staring at me expressionlessly while I browse through the selection every time. Nevertheless, this is a grab and go kind of place, and I'm usually too busy thinking about fulfilling my sushi craving anyway to care.
