Terrible insurance company.\nStarted with them in 6-2010 for motor home insurance. Sounded to good to be true.\nThey insured me for the purchase price including sales tax in case of total loss.\nWOW sounds great for the life of my policy with them.Also had diminishing deductible with no claims on comp. or collision excluding glass.\nSuper WOW. \nPolicy started out at about $1050. Okay not bad for an expensive coach.\n2011 about the same. 2012 slight increase.\n2013 increase to $1,170.00 Okay still not bad.\n2014 WHAT? $1942.80. What the hell. I call and got fed a bunch of BS.\nHere is the deal. The coach is not nearly worth the insured promised value. This year I would have met the criteria for $0 deductible.\nI guess their take on it.\nJack the price up so high the guy will not renew. Well they got their wish and I hope they go out of business.\nWent to Progressive and got a locked in value for what it is worth now which remains until I stop the policy for $650 a year same coverage except not the huge value of when I bought it.\nPLEASE BE ADVISED THIS COMPANY IS FULL OF SCAMMERS.
