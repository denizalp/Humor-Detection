Minh-Anh Ahhhhhh. That is what it should be called.  This place is really good. This place exemplifies all things great about mom and pop establishments.\n\nEverything is super fresh,as it should be, there is  Vietnamese market on the premise.\n\nEgg roll is to a different level at this place. I think the human body only withstand so much fried food, this is one of those items that warrants the self abuse and self loathing of a grease fueled binge.\n\nI think this establishment can be in the conversation of best pho's in the 216. I shared the pho with one of my close brown eyed friends.  Oh they have this chile paste\/oil they doctor up that is off the hook good.  So good  would like a half body massage with it.  Split this with my friend. The broth was rich full of flavor, including a burst of cinnamon. Noodles were cooked perfectly along with a decent amount eye of round and meatballs. Limes are getting expensive,  the condiments were, jalapenos, bean sprouts, and lemons. Good stuff. \n\nNext, I ordered the beef lemongrass.  It was beef stir fried with onions, in a brown sauce,  served with cucumbers, sweet pickled carrots, and diakon radish(guessing). I mixed it all up slathered the chili oil an proceeded to inhale. My partner in gluttony took a healthy helping and proceeded to tell me the sauce was too thick.  Keep in mind she reminded the sauce was too thick after she started scarfing her second healthy helping.  She then said \"well maybe i should stop eating this because I'm sure you want t take it home.\"  I said \"bit*h  you know it will never make it that far\".  \n\nSo at this point my hands could barely touch the steering wheel, neither could hers. hmm were to go for desert.
