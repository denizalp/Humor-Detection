Went for dinner with a few friends on a Friday night. Our server, Mikey, was fantastic. We ordered a bunch of apps and a few entrees to all share. The timing of delivering all our selections was great. Of the 12 menu items we ordered almost all were amazing. A couple we were the biggest fans of, but that was just our tastes, not the quality of the dishes. Highly recommend the corn dogs, mac & cheese and shrimp & grits. Will definitely go back here again.
