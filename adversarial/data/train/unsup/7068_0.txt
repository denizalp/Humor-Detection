Enter at your own risk: increasing chance of contracting a contagious condition called Hipsterphilia with each minute spent at this VV. Oh, also, you might start developing respiratory tract irritations.\n\nI like this location better than the Lansdowne one for its selection and prices. The store is very congested though, so you may want to opt for the other location if you have a severe case of claustrophobia. But if you are a digger, you shall be rewarded with a great selection of old grandpa sweaters and LMFAO-looking metallic waistcoats.\n\nYeah... we knew it was time to book it out of there when I became convinced that the purple metallic coat was a real statement piece on my girlfriend. Walked away with a huge santa-claus bag full of stuff for the cost of lunch money! Hipster win.
