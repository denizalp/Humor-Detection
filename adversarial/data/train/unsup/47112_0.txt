Incredible Southwest Fusion Cuisine. Everything made fresh.  Staff is attentive and made me feel welcomed. Say hi to Nikki, Roberta and Art.  Great for breakfast lunch and dinner. Their salsas are fantastic.  Great specials afforable.  \n\nLocated inside the Clarendon Hotel, the is not you typical hotel operated restaurant. Locals were frequenting each time we visited. \n\nMake sure to taster the fresh squeezed lemonade.
