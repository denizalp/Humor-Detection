68 is located in a food court and owned by a family, the mom and son work out in the front and the father is at the back as a chef.\n\nOverall, the price is pretty good, we ordered two dishes for a total of $13 and they were LARGE portions. One of them is an old pork rice with hainanese chicken. The hainanese chicken was on a separate plate cause the rice with the meat filled up one of them. The old pork rice tastes like shredded pork. In addition, there was a cup of soy milk and a complimentary soup with it. This dish was REALLY good.\n\nThe second portion was a massive bowl of noodles (the noodles were the size of Vietnamese bowls. In addition, they added a complimentary drink, which we got the Chinese Ice Tea with it. This dish was average.\n\nOverall, 68 Kitchen is a pretty inexpensive place to go, come visit here for large portioned meals for a lunch.
