Very nice gun shop.  It's fairly large and they have a ton of AR-15's, some AR-10's, and what surprised me was that they had a .338 LAPUA for sale...that's not a common gun to see in a gun store.  Hell, I only saw 1 for sale at the last gun show.  I was so tempted to buy it....but I'm saving up for a different model.\n\nThe guys here were super helpful and allowed me to check out several guns.  I'm not one who will buy right away, so I didn't leave with a firearm, but I did get several magazines and other accessories I was shopping for.\n\nI'd definitely come back and give these guys my business.  \n\nReturn Factor - 90%
