Rio Casino will be one of my favorite Casinos for many years to come. The shows are spectacular, the scenery is unique, the restaurants\/ buffets are one of a kind and the architecture is simply beautiful. I attend the Micheal Jackson live show which was amazing. The impersonator was excellent , his costumes  were good replicas of the real thing. A little pitchy at first with the high notes, but after awhile he began to look and sound like Micheal Jackson. The dancers were energetic and the band sound great. I recommend this show to everyone . It was nice listening to the sounds of Micheal Jackson  for one night.\nAW
