Best pizza in the valley, bar none! Having come from NY many years ago I can honestly say that all my efforts to find a genuine NY style pizza in the valley have finally been met for the first time. I've tried NYPD, Sal's Pizza and others, and while they were good they just didn't have it all like Cassonava Bros. The pizza was brought to the table hot, the bottom a perfect blend of soft and crusty, topped with delicious cheese and sauce. I had a regular slice and a Sicilian slice and both were wonderful. As I placed my order at the register, the cashier asked if I had been there before to which I replied no. She immediately introduced herself, extended her hand for a shake and shouted over to the owner who also welcomed me. I was also given 6 free garlic knots! I've never experienced such a warm reception at a restaurant before. Later one of the owners, Tony, served me and stopped to chat. Very nice guy. When I asked him why he hadn't opened more locations he said the most important ingredient is hiring the right people and he's not sure a second location could match what he has going at this one. He's right about that. His employees are all fast, efficient and very friendly. I'm ready for another visit....!
