We stopped here because it was one of our favorite spots back n the day but not anymore . Its way over priced for mediocre food . I got the chicken bowl . It came with beans , Spanish rice , pieces of chicken and a pico de gallo salsa . It did not have any flavor and the chicken was dry . To many onions in the salsa . I'm not very picky but the food was not good . And the Combos don't come with drinks so you have to pay extra . Parking lot is kinda small and the cashier had a bunch of hickies all over her neck and her customer service sucked . She brought us 3 entr√©es then yelled at us from the counter to get the last 2 .
