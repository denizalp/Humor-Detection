Real good, authentic Mexican food. Good vibe. I had the carne asada taco and mulas. I'm now a huge fan of mulas. Next time I'll order my drink first because by the time it was made, my food was cold. Still tasted great. I think the lights could be turned down inside just a little to give it a really nice atmosphere.
