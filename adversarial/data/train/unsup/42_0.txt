Bad. The overall experience was mediocre at first, disappointing in the end. First of all, when you get in, no one greets you. \"Do I seat myself anywhere? Yes.\" So I first sat on the patio waiting for my boyfriend, then we moved to the bar. The blonde bartender is mostly why I have to give one star to this place. No smile, no enthusiasm. Way too many tattoos to display. Her shorts were the classic night-club type. Her cleavage showed too much. I understand it's a casual place, but during the day that's not what employees should wear, in my opinion. It took awhile before she asked for drinks and she didn't even come back to take the food order. The manager took our order. My boyfriend wanted some sweetener for his iced tea and he asked for some sugar or simple syrup. Now I used to be a bartender too so I know you guys have simple syrup. But apparently cordiality is something she doesn't know about. A first bad impression, don't you think? \nFood: I'm not a connoisseur of the Mexican cuisine nor a big fan on it, but my beef enchiladas were not good. The chili sauce was too spicy and had no flavor. My boyfriend, who knows better Mexican food, agreed with me. His tacos were good though. Even the dessert we had, I don't remember the name of it, perhaps sopaipillas, was good for me cause it was the first time I had it. But again, my partner didn't find it good at all. Cleanliness of the place was another turn down. The chairs were dirty, the salt and pepper all greasy. Who knows how many people with dirty hands have touched those salt and pepper before us. \n\nConcluding we won't come back. You people should learn what good customer service with a professional appearance is like.
