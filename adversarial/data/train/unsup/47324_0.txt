I was traveling through Las Vegas on a road trip with my friends when all of a sudden my alternator broke. I had to shell out 280$ for the part. But i didn't have any tools to put the part in and this was at 9:00 PM at night. The shop across the street from the auto zone saw my truck was dead and they told me they could change the part for 400$. I was stuck 350 miles from home with a dead truck and no tools with no money and i was truly stranded in the desert. I was going to have to have my family wire me emergency money so I could make it home. But then came The autozone employee Paul Jenkins. He saw I was stranded and he was starting to panic and had nowhere to go. Paul came over on his lunch break and changed my alternator for me with his tools. I truly could not believe he did this. He would not take any money or anything I offered him. He said he's just helping someone in need out. Paul saved my butt and he deserves one hell of a raise!!!
