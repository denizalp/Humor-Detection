I think some reviewers are missing the point of this buffet. I've seen complaints about the salad bar. Really? You're at the buffet; why are you making a salad?\n\nFor starters, the shrimp cocktail here is pre-peeled. Many buffets have \"U-Peel\" shrimp, but here, you just pile it up and eat it, and it's good.\n\nFor your main course, there are crab legs. Unlimited crab legs! Plate after plate of them. They're steamed, whole--many other buffets only have them chilled and pre-halved, which isn't nearly as good.\n\nPerhaps you'd like a tasty beverage to wash it down? Well, beer and wine are included, too. Not just some fixed amount per person, but as much as you want. FREE BEER, you guys.\n\nAt this point, everything else on offer starts to look like a waste of stomach space. Unlimited shrimp cocktail, crab legs, beer, and wine? Sign me up.\n\nUPDATE: They've changed the pricing so it's cheaper now, but beer and wine aren't included any more. Naturally, they didn't reduce the dinner price by the price of the beer\/wine package, so the combination is now more expensive. But the beer they had was only good if it was free, anyway. Now it's thirty bucks for all-you-can-eat crab legs and shrimp and prime rib if you want it.
