My god daughter had her 2nd birthday here and what fun RPF was!\n\nEntered the place when Star Wars theme music on the loud speaker. That alone lead me to believe that there was good times to be had that day.\n\nPlayground had numerous slides and jungle gym type stuff to climb. The favorite of mines (yes, I'm a child!) was the ball pit. I love ball pits, minus all the assumptions on what's at the bottom of it. Granted, it was a small pit.\n\nGreat playing area for big and small kids alike!\n\nBackroom for the food was HUGE. They catered the event so, Island Sushi it was.\nLots of room for numerous kids tables, chairs, a photobooth, and chairs along the sides.\n\nStaff were friendly and easy going yet, aware of the kids and rules.
