This In N Out Burger is the best thing about this rather depressing part of Phoenix. I stayed in the area for two nights solely based on the proximity to an In N Out Burger. \n\nThe place is spotlessly clean, and everyone is extremely friendly. We ordered cheeseburgers and fries and chocolate shakes. Everything was great, I was stuffed. It's always fun to eat fast food you can't get at home. A great first time visit!
