Stopped in in a Monday night at 9. No one there. The bartender warned me they were changing the menu and were out of a few items.   Well, the first one was orange juice, so that changed my drink selection. I ordered a cheesesteak sandwich, which was Cheez Whizzed, which I'm not used to since I'm now from the East coast where we usually use a white cheese. I also ordered it without mushrooms, which was good as that was one of the items they were out of too. The sandwich came with fries, some of which had a metallic taste-maybe freezer burn??  The food was very reasonably priced, so that was a plus!\n\nNow the good news. Julie, the bartender was great. Friendly, and an intelligent conversationalist. Drink prices were reasonable so if you're looking for a good drink, stop in.
