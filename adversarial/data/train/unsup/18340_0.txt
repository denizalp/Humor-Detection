My husband surprised me by making a reservation and taking me here for some celebratory news and we were both disappointed in every aspect. \n\nWe had a variety of dishes from each section, we had the Bread, Cured Meat Plate, the Spicy Fried Squid, Crispy Tongue & Kale, Smoked Sweetbreads with Tuna, and 1\/2 Grilled Octopus. \n\nThe bread and cured meat plate were good but nothing special, we were somewhat excited to try the cured horse on the plate and it was good, the rest were ok.\n\nThe Spicy Fried Squid was very underwhelming, the squid was soggy and kind of greasy and the \"crispy tongue and kale\" was chopped very finely and did not really add to the dish in the way of texture or flavor. Disappointing.\n\nThe Smoked Sweetbreads with Tuna was good, nice flavor but again I have had better sweetbreads in other restaurants such as the Black hoof in Toronto or Murrays in Ottawa. So meh.\n\nThe 1\/2 grilled Octopus was excellent. It was the only dish that impressed us. The octopus had a nice smokey flavour and was tender, the accompanying potatoes were meh, all I can taste was lemon for the potatoes, but I loved the sauteed dandelions that came with it. The dandelions accompanied the octopus very well.\n\nWe had to wait very long more than 15 minutes between dishes especially the octopus (probably over 20mins from the dish before it). We considered cancelling to eat elsewhere (I wish we did!).\n\nIn addition to a somewhat mediocre meal and service for such a hyped up restaurant we sat next to the most obnoxious man ever. The seating there is somewhat cramped, but this RUDE man decided to sit on the \"bench\" side next to his lady companion. So they were both on the bench side seating, because he had to sleeze her up (this guy looked like sleezebag level 1000). This is ok if the seating spaces actually accommodates this, but it doesn't at Bar Isabel. IT IS NOT OK TO ENCROACH ON OTHER PEOPLE'S PRIVATE DINING SPACE.\n\nHe did not ask me if it was ok, but just sat on my stuff and expected ME to shift to the person next to me making us more cramped. Additionally he knocked down my husband's cycling cap and stepped on it later on and no apologies. Obnoxious dining neighbors makes everything worse. The servers saw I was uncomfortable and didn't care. My husband logged a complaint later on with the front of house, and basically they apologized but didn't give two craps.\n\nOverall, I really did not enjoy my experience there at all, I was so looking forward to trying this place for months and it was super underwhelming. For an over $100 bill for two for food only, with the generally mediocre food and service, it definitely does not live up to the hype. Two stars because I actually enjoyed one of the dishes a lot.
