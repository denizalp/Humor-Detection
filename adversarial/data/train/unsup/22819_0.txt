Guu was very guud. I went the day after opening, and fearing a line, showed up at 5:30pm. There was no line at all. Perfect. Yes, it's loud, but that is what you expect, right? It's loud in a fun way.\n\nThe sashimi salad was excellent (as it was when I went to Guu in Vancouver), as was the black cod with miso. I'd recommend the Sake mojito as well. I probably wouldn't order the deep fried lotus root again. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't exciting either.\n\nPro: Our meal for two with 4 drinks and 6-7 plates came to only $65. \nCon: I was hungry 2 hours later.\n\nLesson learned. Order more.\n\nOh, and gentlemen. If you're seated at the tables at floor level towards the front of the restaurant, and are not sitting with your back to wall, please be aware of your low slung jeans. I saw MANY butt cracks. A wide variety even. It was funny, but it did not add to my dining experience.
