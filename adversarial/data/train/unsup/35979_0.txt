Great food..Great drinks..slightly higher priced but...its not a regular dinner place 4 us.  \nManagement has more issues i think than the servers & other staff..\nOur waitress Kristen was awesome!  \nI saw 1  customer walk out w o paying and another table of ppl who did nothing but complain.\nLighten up ppl.
