I had breast augmentation on one breast due to unevenness and liposuction on abdomen. Dr. Gawley may be okay with breast augmentation but stay away if you want liposuction. From my experience he is not a specialist in this. I was not a large person to begin with but now hate my results.  It is as if he didn't do any lipo.  His attitude after 3 mos. was that this is my body shape and that's it.   It's like all communication broke down when he got my money and did the surgery.
