This is one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas and now a must-visit when I'm in town. Everything that I've had on the food and drink menu is delicious! I would highly recommend the green bean tempura to start off with. And the samba rolls, which are their latin-asian fusion sushi selections, are great culinary combinations. As others mentioned, it is a little pricey, but I think it's totally worth it. I would highly recommend making a reservation in advance if you plan on going. They can get very very busy.
