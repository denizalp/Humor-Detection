I remember back when Arctic Bites first opened and there were lines going out the door. Now that the hype has died down, I decided to pay a visit to satisfy my ice cream craving before it got too cold.\n\nThere were a few customers inside already but we didn't wait very long to place our order. I decided to get blue haze, which was a lavender-infused blueberry flavour. There's a glass wall between you and the staff, so you can see how they make the ice cream rolls.\n\nRight off the bat, the presentation of it was really pretty. They put a lot of care into how it looks. Taking my first bite, I really liked how it tasted. The ice cream isn't excessively sweet and the lavender  pairs nicely with the blueberry flavour. Wasn't really a fan of the whip cream since the ice cream is already rich in itself but I guess it's just there for presentation.\n\nOverall, I'd definitely recommend making a stop here!
