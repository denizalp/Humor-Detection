I needed to come down this way, and my cousin was in search of something sweet, like a cupcake of something, so Krispy Kreme was the decided alternate.  OMG, what a good choice.  Sometimes I forget about the sugary goodness of the Krispy Kreme.  My fave remains the original, but they had a number of other choices, including creme and custard filled options and some key lime varieties.  A cute place to visit, and there were a few chairs and probably even wifi.  If I were more local, I'd come in more often.
