This place is FAR as hell from the MGM casino. They need a freakin shuttle service because you know what?? What you're in an itty bitty dress and some high ass heels, YOU JUST CAN'T DO THAT TREK!! At least provide us with a damn golf cart please.\n\nIn addition to that, the service here is BULLSHIT. When you call in for help on the phone it tells you how many people are ahead of you and your wait time on the phone. Okay zero people ahead of me and zero wait time, YET I'VE BEEN ON THE GOD DAMN PHONE FOR 17 MINUTES WAITING!! Geez people, quit twiddling your freaking fingers and DO YOUR JOB!! Bring me up my damn bags!! There was a miscommunication and my bags were at the MGM hotel.. Blah blah, crap happens and I flip the fuck out. The manager (I think??) comes up to the room to personally get the baggage ticket from me (umm, you could have done that when I first passed the lobby) and tells me my bags will take AN HOUR to be brought over from MGM to MGM Signature. Okay sweetie, I know I said it's a far ass hike from MGM to MGM Signature but it aint no hour journey!! Screw that, I walk away before I rip someone's hair out and have my friends deal with the situation. Thankfully my Fiancee and some of the guys in the group are kind enough and go down and get my bags themselves (in less than an hour might I add).\n\nWorst customer service at a hotel ever. Whoever's in charge should SERIOUSLY be ashamed. I've worked in customer service before and even I was embarrassed for them. \n\nAside from the crappy ass customer service I will say the pent house suit was pretty nice. Two rooms, 3 bathrooms, full kitchen, errthang. It was nice, but def. not nice enough to make up for the customer service. I won't be returning- - EVER!!
