You have got to be one hungry heffer\/cow to give this place 5 stars!?!\n\nIf you're dumbfounded why the average cud chewing American women weighs 160lb (men probably put this number to shame), you can thank Hash House a Go Go because this place is all about SIZE. So if you're a size queen, then you'll want to get your big ole' booty down to the Hash House.... oh, and don't expect a Vegas style lounge with \"go go dancers\". It's just a breakfast joint with feed sack sized portions.\n\nI prematurely ordered the chicken and eggs, and I should have read \"Karen Y's\" freak'n review cuz she got it right about the chicken being dry which brought out my \"O\" face! \"Ooooh, wtf! Why did I order the chicken because I can't stand dry overcooked chicken! The chicken was so dry I would have gladly taken some supermarket fried chicken over it any day. Even the side of chipotle sauce couldn't save this overcooked bird.\n\nMy other biggest pet peeve is to plate food with huge chunks of herbs if it's not intended to be eaten. Hash House is one of these perverse offenders because they serve up their dishes with a big ole' sprig of sage. Isn't that classy.\n\nThis place isn't just a total hog farm cuz even though the interior is awkwardly designed with angled steel\/diamond plated elements blended with antique looking wood pieces, they do have some decent mashed potatoes and the bacon was decent. I just highly doubt I'll be going back for seconds..... I'm sure there's some heffers up for thirds.\n\nI didn't see the Man vs. Food episode with Adam Richmond, but I'd just like him to know how it went down for me:\n\nCows 1 vs Greg 0
