I came here for an outpatient test procedure.  If it hadn't been for the supreme competence of the male R.N. who performed it, I would have given this place one star, only because zero isn't an option.  I don't think I've ever seen such chaos at a desk before.\n\nBut kudos where they belong:  I walked in to the main hospital entrance, which was wrong.  The lady (volunteer, I think), left that desk and walked me all the way to the desk I was supposed to go to, which was in the connected medical building.  There were a few ladies manning it (womaning it?), but they simply told me to take a seat, where I proceeded to wait.  And wait.  The waiting room was filled with waiters (this is starting to sound like a restaurant review, but believe me, there was no food). The women at the desk were just kind of standing around.  When the R.N. came to get me, he couldn't believe that I hadn't even been checked in yet.  The ladies seemed confused, but apparently, all the staff who check people in were not at their desks (that's a different bunch of people), and these women had no idea why.  The R.N. started to kick ass, and while this was happening, a guy who claimed to be waiting over an hour got fed up and said he was leaving.  \n\nBecause of my R.N., some supervisory-type appeared, got someone into the check-in rooms, got me checked in, and off I went for my test.  The R.N., whose name I think was Joe, was great, explaining everything before every part of the procedure, and did everything he could to make it a piece of cake.  Wish I could rate him separately from the pathetic staff I had to slog through before the test.  That would be a high five.
