Entering this establishment, I have no idea what to expect, I heard there were decent sangrias and it looked like a regular pub to me. I opened the menu and wow, I saw a lot of familiar dishes. This place has an unsuspecting Asian fusion menu. Ok...\n\nI decide to try the udon stir fry and my partner orders the chow mein. Not only did it take more than 30 minutes for the food to come, this place was NOT busy, but when my order came is was not the udon stir fry but the Singapore noodles. When correcting the waiter, politely, the  response was, \"Oh well, that's what was written.\" Hmm, no kidding Sherlock but that's still not what I ordered and thanks for apologizing. \n\nThe PITCHER of sangria came decently quick and as I'm not a red wine drinker it was a bit...underwhelming to say the least. The taste was bland but it did come with a bevy of fruits in it that did not do much but float at the top and becoming increasingly annoying when pouring. My partner then informs me that maybe we should crush the fruits to get some flavour out of it, ok well it's not supposed to be MY job to make the sangria taste good. But after we did that, it tasted phenomenal but still watery. \n\nThe food came and my udon noodles were decent enough, very thick goopy sauce though. And my partner's chow mein was disgusting. They literally took egg noodles, floured them and DEEP FRIED them! OMG! That is NOT chow mein. Disappointment all around. I'm kicking myself for leaving such a large tip...must've been the 3\/4 of a pitcher of sangria I drank...
