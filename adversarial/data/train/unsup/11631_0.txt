This is such a funny place. There's hundreds of thousands of items and it's all organized by color, cheap as hell and trendy, and I can never find anything I want to actually buy. \n\nWhen I find something I want to try it on, either my ass or my tits don't fit in it. I'm pretty sure it's because the clothing is designed for preteens without a smidgen of body fat. Humph.\n\nI have stocked up an arsenal of gym tank tops though. They're so cheap, I don't even mind if they get destroyed in the wash. I'll just buy some more. I ain't mad.
