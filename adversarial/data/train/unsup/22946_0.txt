I never really buy anything here because it's overpriced.  First I hit up the Dollar Tree for the party decor that will make it's way to the dumpster by the end of the night and then maybe I'll swing by here to see what I'm missing.  I think the last thing I purchased here were some shot glass necklaces which continue to prove useful time and time again.\n\nIt's clean.  The staff is alright, I mean they are teens working there part time and we all know how shitty teens can be when you ask them for something.
