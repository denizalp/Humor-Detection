This past Thursday I finally checked out the drake one fifty and well it was... meh.  I am a huge fan of the drake hotel and have had several great nights out on the roof down to the underground.  Also I have had great company functions at the drake hotel.  Unfortunately I am severely disappointed with one fifty.  The minute we walked in it screamed douche-baggery.  I'm sorry but the suits and massive pick up joint killed it for me.  It was just like any other bar in the area.  It was amazingly loud. Like too loud but nothing that could be controlled I guess.  Food was ok.  Seating was cramped. Service was decent.  Washrooms... The button flushers are behind the lid to the point where you have touch the lid of the toilet in order to get to flusher.  GROSS.  Then I had to touch a faucet to wash my hands.  I don't know but in this day and age why am I touching the faucet for water? \n\nOverall, every minute I was there I was sad to have cancelled my reso's at Chase.  Won't be going back. unfortunately it's just not my scene.  Thanks god for the original drake hotel!
