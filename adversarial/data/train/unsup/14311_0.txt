UNETHICAL \nLived at this complex from 2007 to 2011, I never had any complaints with the neighbors, staff or property.  I had to change jobs and move to Colorado several months after renewing my Lease.  They CHARGED ME $4,100 to break the lease, EVEN FOR A JOB CHANGE IN A DIFFERENT STATE.  I talked with management before having to do this and after, to try and work out a deal, but they will NOT MAKE ANY EXCEPTIONS.  I now have a $5,000 debt over my head that is RUINING MY CREDIT to the point where I will now have to file BANKRUPTCY to try and rebuild it.  I would look elsewhere for a place with more reasonable policies so that you do not get stuck in the same situation I'm in; $5,000 in debt and now have terrible credit!
