Yeah I'm reviewing this watered down Filipino restaurant.  Reason why I came to eat here was because I was in the mood for a Filipino breakfast and this was the closest one to my gf's house.  What a bad choice. Sorry babe. Lol\n\nI ordered the tocino breakfast, which came with like 6 small pieces of pork, garlic fried rice and fake scrambled egg with a tomato slice on it, and let me tell you... The tomato was so good! And that's it.  My gf ordered the spam breakfast.... The spam was cut the wrong way. How do you cut spam the wrong way? If it has squared edges you cut it the wrong way!! It has to have the rounded edges.  Spam lovers, YOU know what I mean! \n\nOur meals came with free coffee by the way and tasted horrible.. no wonder why it's free.  Good thing I got a cup of water too.  And the service was annoying, no kind of personality or enthusiasm, when I asked for ketchup, she gave me 3 packets.. I looked at it as she placed it in my palm... I said, can i get more please, she grabbed 2 more.. paused to think.. and grabbed another 1 packet.  Ay yi yi!  2 stars for the tomato, and good water.  Next time I come here is probably because I want something from Red Ribbon which is unfortunately, conveniently located inside Jolibee.
