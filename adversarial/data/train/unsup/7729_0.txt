The wife and I were visiting Vegas for a few days and looked at every hookah lounge in the area.  This is by far the best. The owner is pretty awesome and knows his shit. They only use the best hookahs(KM) and flavors. No over price marked up BS like rumbar($35 for a standard hookah and ONE coal!) just because it's Vegas.  This is a real hookah bar for people that love hookah.  \n\nWe went on a Sunday night so it was quiet which was what we were looking for.  This place definitely has the club vibe. So if you're not into that come on a slow night. \n\nIf I had any constructive criticism for the owner....  I would say do the club vibe on a few nights a week and on the other nights,  turn off the smoke machine and strobes and just let it be more of a relaxed vibe, and more of a lounge.\n\nAll and All I will be back!
