Like many other Chipotle's this location gets incredibly crowded during lunch. I highly recommend ordering on line. This will allow your food to be ready when you arrive, allowing you to pick it up at the cashier and check out more conveniently. \n\nThis location is well-maintained for how busy they are and systematically and efficiently handle the high-volume. Chipotle now offers brown rice, but I hate to admit I still prefer the white with cilantro. As with other locations, there is a secret menu. I highly recommend the guacamole!
