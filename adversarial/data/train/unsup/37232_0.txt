This bar is my default whenever I'm looking for something to do on any night of the week. \n\nThe friendliest crowd in a bar in southside, the best bartenders in the southside, the most eclectic and highest quality of DJs and music from every genre imagineable. \n\nPrices are high, but drinks are strong and well made. Decor is very funky. Space is very intimate. Highly recommended if you like House, Trip Hop, Underground Hip Hop, 80s, Soul......anything like that. What you won't find: Top 40. That's a great thing, and something that's increasingly hard to find in the south side anymore.
