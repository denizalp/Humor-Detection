Im writing this as Im sitting here.  They bombard me with emails and deals.  You CANNOT use them unless they are printed off.  Waste paper and ink i guess.  They say they open at 10am.  At 10:05 we were still standing in the dark and waiting.  Who cant open a place by 10am?  I work 2 jobs and shuffle a kid around to all sorts of stuff and I can do 10am even after a night of drinkin 40s with my hoodrat friends.  No apologies or anything.  Take it or leave it.  They rely on leagues and if your not in one you can eat a big fat one...
