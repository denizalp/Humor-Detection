All of UPMC was elated when we got a Starbucks in the hospital. Walk down and back up cardiac hill just for non-cafeteria coffee?? No thank you! The line can get long, but it moves pretty fast. They've got breakfast pastries and sandwiches, little salads and snacks, and a wall of retail. Be warned, though, that this location commonly does not participate in regular Starbucks promotions.
