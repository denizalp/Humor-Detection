I was expecting better from the Buffet at the Bellagio.  When I'm halfway through eating my first plate and I'm already thinking about the buffet we should have ate it's usually a bad sign.  Food there was so so but they don't offer that many different types of food as one of my favorite legas buffet has.  About the only good thing they had was the prime rib.  Another thing is usually I enjoy playing keno at buffets, it's helps create some type of break while snarfing down all that food.  That night the keno runner was no where to be found although our waiter assured me that he was there.  When the runner did come by I had to about tackle the guy to get his attention.  All in all...I would skip this buffet for someplace else.
