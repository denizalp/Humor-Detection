I'm convinced I'm not using the search function correctly because I'm shocked this place isn't on Yelp yet!!!\n\nI love Town Square.. I really do. So many fun spots to have a drink or shop.. or catch a movie.. etc. I love Yardhouse and Blue Martini, but they get so freaking packed! When I go out I'm usually not looking for a \"scene\". I'm looking for more of a place to relax.. have a drink.. and enjoy the company of the people I'm with. If you're looking for something similar Bar Louie might be your spot!\n\nWe escaped the insane mobs at Blue Martini and stopped by Bar Louie to check out their free \"luigi\" (roast beef sandwich) promo. We barely made the 5-7 PM happy hour and were able to try some half price martinis and appetizers. \n\nThe downside of the happy hour is (and why I'm taking away a star!) that it doesn't include their awesome sounding \"specialty cocktails\". The promo was something like 1\/2 off all wine, beer, appetizers, and \"martinis\". I wanted a mojito.. damnit.. Anyways, the martinis were good, but honestly the selection of 8 martinis here doesn't compare to Blue Martini. \n\nFood was good, but not amazing. We had the pretzels (YUM! But I'm a pretzel freak and really easy to please), loaded cheese fries (again they are freaking cheese fries.. how do you screw that up!), and the Luigi sandwiches. They were solid Roast Beef Sandwiches, but honestly I prefer the processed garbage at Arby's (ok, at least I'm honest!!). The french buns they were on were superb, so I'd like to try other sandwiches there in the future!\n\nAll in all a great spot to try if Yardhouse and Blue Martini are packed to the gills and you want to just get away and actually get a table somewhere instead of being packed in like sardines. I loved the chill, yet upscale, atmosphere.\n\nPS - Tuesday is $1 burger night.. maybe someone can make it out there and check out how good these $1 burgers are!!
