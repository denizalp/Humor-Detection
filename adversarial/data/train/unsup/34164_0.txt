I am SO sad that we found this place on our last day in Montreal! It was such amazing food and service that I would have gone back every day if I had more time. My husband had the smoked salmon, mushroom risotto, and beignets. I had the grilled romaine salad, tomato and basil pizza, and maple pudding. All of it was fantastic, but I'd say the mushroom risotto was the winner overall. It's a little pricey, but for the quality and taste I'd say it is actually a steal!
