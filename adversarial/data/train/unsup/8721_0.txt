Food!  Glorious food!  You're going to stuff your face at Maggiano's. \n\nWe dined at this location for a team luncheon. It's not quite beneficial to have a family-style feast of carbs, sauces, cheese and meats if you wish to be productive during the latter half of the day...But it was SO worth it!\nAppetizer:  stuffed mushrooms, bruschetta, and the tomato caprese. These dishes are on the oily side (in this case, oil=flavor), and it's way too easy to have one (or four) too many servings. \n\nFirst course:  spinach salad, caesar salad and freshly baked bread. The salads were fresh, generously dressed and highly addictive. \n\nSecond course:  fettuccine alfredo, homestyle lasagna, chicken piccata, baked ziti, and chicken Parmesan. All of these dishes are on the heavier side, but were absolutely delicious. A little bit goes a long way!\n\nDessert:  chocolate zoccatto cake and apple crustada with caramel sauce served a la mode.  Who doesn't love chocolate cake or apple pie?   I could eat the apple thing alllll day long. \n\nIs there such thing as too much deliciousness in one meal?
