Stopped in for lunch on a weekday with my son and there were only about 5 tables occupied.  We started with the Hummus appetizer and got way more than expected - hummus, pita bread, tortilla chips, pico de gallo, and cucumbers.  It was easily enough for 3 or 4 people to share.\n\nMy entree was the Green Chili Chicken sliders and I really enjoyed the spicy flavor and juiciness of the meat.  My only suggestion would be to use a heartier bread as the buns became soggy.  It didn't keep me from eating them though!  My son had the kid's chicken strips and they looked a little strange when the waitress brought them out.  The breading was very dark, so they appear burned.  I tasted one and thankfully they were not burned at all, the breading they use actually has a nice flavor and the chicken was moist.  My son ate them all up!\n\nI hope this place gets busier or has a big enough crowd on the weekend to keep them going.  The food is much better than typical bar food and they have a lot of unique twists on old favorites.  The staff is also wonderful.  While I was waiting for our bill, the bartender took pity on my impatient son and showed him how to play darts!
