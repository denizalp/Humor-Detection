I love love love this park! I take my children here all the time for a morning hike. It is actually challenging. The park sits on a big steep hill. The park is nice and spacious. The jungle gym is nice and classic. There is even a teeter totter! There are also grassy fields and you can bring your animals here. I like this park because it isn't so \"regulated\". There is room to move around and you actually feel like you are outside in your own personal space. They also have events at this park quite often with invitations to the whole community. If you live in the mountains edge area I would recommend coming here.
