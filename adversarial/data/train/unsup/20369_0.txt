Well, well...another overpriced LA restaurant makes its way to the valley. \nFirst, the positives: excellent coffee and our server was very pleasant.\nAnd now the other shoe: exactly 1 week before, we ate at the Grand Cafe at Red Rock and paid a full $20 less for our meal (3 people, comparable orders) AND the food was twice as good there. I mean, a tri-tip and cheddar with barely 3 thin slices of meat and not enough cheese to fill a mousetrap for $14? $4.50 for a tiny slice of pie? \nThis place belongs on the Strip, not in a locals casino. Bad move, Boyd Gaming. I don't give this place a year, judging from the number of empty tables.
