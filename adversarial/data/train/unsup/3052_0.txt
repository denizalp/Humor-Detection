It has been three days since I witnessed all that is Absinthe, and in those three days, there hasn't been one in which I haven't reminisced fondly about the vaudeville-esque variety show. \n\nIn fact, I've put off writing this review because it almost feels like if I Yelp about it, then slowly, the bits and pieces of this fan-fucking-tastic show will compartmentalize and get lost within my brain's coils; like, if I hit \"submit,\" the green glow will fade.\n\nOut of the 10 years I've been visiting Vegas, I've never seen anything like it. Rose.Rabbit.Lie tried, but failed. Absinthe is Vegas to the tenth degree; it is the hooker calling cards scraped off the sidewalk at 3:30 a.m. mixed with enough \"fucks\" and derogatory, boundary-pushing jokes that your face will ache from laughing or being slack-jawed. It mixes absolute anxiety-inducing stunts (roller skating duos whose heads nearly hit the bricks during dips and twirls) with aching sensuality (the Green Fairy, the tassels, the lesbian act, the muscled men holding up other muscled men.) \n\nThere isn't a word to describe Absinthe that hasn't already been used. It's obnoxious and gross. Repugnant and rude. Abhorrent and outrageous. But, it's incredible and fascinating, stunning and unbelievable, ravishing and remarkable. \n\nIf you're looking for a slice of Vegas that is truly unlike anything else the city has to offer, buy a ticket to Absinthe. And then, bask in its glory for days to come.
