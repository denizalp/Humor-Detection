Went in again and tried two different kinds!  The Cheese&Pepperoni as well as the Toasted Almond were quite scrumptious.  This time around the saltiness and sweetness levels enhanced the already delicious dough.  I do feel like a blimp since I ate them pretty fast, haha, but this is definitely one of my favorite random snack slash random lunch venues from now on.
