A long time customer here. The members of the Haas Farmers team have exceptional work ethics; professional, dependable, and knowledgeable. Whether it's to an email or phone call, Allison, Rebecca, and\/or Stephanie respond promptly; consistently. They regard me as a person and not just another \"number\" i.e. just another customer who denotes dollar signs. Most recently, I sent an email inquiring if they can help a relative of mine, who is not their customer, and they not only responded expeditiously, but went above and beyond. Thank you for all your hard work. I truly appreciate each and every one of you.
