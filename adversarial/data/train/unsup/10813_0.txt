Honestly, such a disappointment and waste of time and money. The service was bad and the food was worse. I should have known this pho was going to be bad, and nowhere close to being authentic since there wasn't any Vietnamese people in sight. It was incredibly overpriced and I wouldn't pay a single dollar to eat there again. As if having bland food wasn't bad enough, the service made me want to shoot myself. They ran out of spoons...at a pho restaurant.  like seriously? Go wash a spoon! They just looked at me like sorry, share a spoon with your husband. Everyone just looked blazed out of their minds or something. Worst experience EVER.
