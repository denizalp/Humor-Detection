Extremely disappointed with the service here.  Made a reservation online for Mother's Day Brunch for 10:45 am.  Got there early (10:30) and realized I probably didn't need to make a reservation since there were only a few people there.  Checked in and they said it would be about 10 minutes ... I understood we were early, but so weird since there were a ton of open tables that they wouldn't just seat us.  After 10 minutes they walked us over about 10 feet to a table that was right in front of us as we stood waiting ... no clue why they didn't plop us down there when we got there???  Took a while for our waitress to take our order, which was strange since it wasn't busy at all.  After our party of 5 chatted for a bit we realized it had been quite a while since we ordered and still no food.  Our waitress finally came back to refill our drinks and said our food would be out in a few minutes.  It was 40 minutes from the time we ordered until we got our food (don't know why it took so long to make scrambled eggs), then it was all COLD!  I'm not one to complain about food at restaurants, but I've never gotten food that was so cold like that.  I'm guessing it was ready for a long time and our waitress never got it.  Again, it wasn't busy at all, so I have no clue where she was or what she was doing (someone else brought the food out).  We called the manager over to tell him about our food and ask if there was a reason for the delay and it being cold.  All he said was \"I can get you new food\" with no explanation.  My kids already started eating because they were starving.  Eventually, they brought out new food for two of us.  In the meantime, the place still wasn't crowded, so I can't imagine what it would be like if they were busy!  Our waitress finally came back to refill our water and never said a word about anything.  They did comp one adult meal and one kids meal, but there was never an apology or explanation.  Very disappointed I chose this place for my Mother's Day brunch.  The food was decent, but the service was horrible.  We will never come here again.
