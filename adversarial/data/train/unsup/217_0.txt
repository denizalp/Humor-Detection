One of my favorite Hotels in Vegas. \n\nThe rooms are awesome. Always clean and the decor is really nice. I love the Italian theme. \n\nThe casino is on the high end. \n\nHas a ton of shopping and eating spots here.\n\nTao is an awesome club. I love the music they play here.\n\nGreat place to stay.
