My father died in May, I was his major caregiver for the last 3-months and found myself out of sorts - energetically once he passed.  Upon meeting Doris, Chun, Laurie & Pat via various Tao Healing classes over the last 30-days. I have learned and am learningHOW TO speak to my body during every class. As for my energy flow today? It's only been more than a month that my dad passed and I am happy to report I am healing up nicely from the inside out. I feel better in body, mind and spirit after every visit to this center. If you're finding anxiety and\/or stress is riding you like data cookies in the background of your browser -- then you're an excellent candidate for the Tao healing center. Perhaps I'll see you there. I have quite a bit of Self Preserving to do.
