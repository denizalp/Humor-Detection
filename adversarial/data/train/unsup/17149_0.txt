Yelping proper etiquette be damned because I'm going to give Capriotti's 5 stars. Fuck it. It was Thanksgiving and I had the blues. The 49ers had just been destroyed by the Seahawks (note to self, don't watch football on Thanksgiving). My husband and I had absolutely no plans for the holiday and waited until after the game ended, which was around 8:00PM, to figure out what to do for dinner. Procrastinating will be the end of me. I settled on the Medley Buffet at Aliante because I thought they were going to have the butternut squash ravioli like they did last year. I was wrong. By this time, I was hungry and mad at the world. \n\nAs a last resort option, I walked up to Capriotti's and ordered a Veggie Turkey sandwich with stuffing and the fixings. I had heard people rave about Capriotti's turkey sandwiches before, so I figured what the heck? Turkey=Thanksgiving. Once I tasted that sandwich, all my frustrations and woes dissipated. That sandwich was amazing! It was a Thanksgiving dinner in a sandwich. \n\nWhat can I say? Capriotti's saved my Thanksgiving. \n\nP.S. We got our sandwiches in like 4 minutes and took advantage of the Yelp check in offer of a free beverage. The cashier was super nice, too. We left with full bellies.\n\nTHE END.
