Part of the four-star rating is the value, which was wonderful. We booked through Expedia and got a really good price that included two queen beds and a pull-out sofa. We slept 5 in the double sized room with ease. The hotel is clean, the kids enjoyed the pool, and the breakfast was as good as a Hampton Inn breakfast. The only big knock was the comfort level on the pull-out sofa, which my daughter said was hovering around a zero.  We would book it again at the competitive price.
