5 stars just for the nostalgia !!!!!\n\n\n   This was one of my best Vegas activities on my trip. If it weren't for me telling my date this is one of the things I wanted  to do in Vegas my trip with him would have been a complete snooze fest til  a lovely saved me from this trip a day later LOL. I don't mess around, if you bore me, I will leave and have fun with someone else. \n\n\n    Anywho,  ever since the announcement of this particular Cirque show , I knew I had to go. But my PIC at the time of their US tour, was not having that GRRRRR. So it only made sense to watch staying on the same property.  Now this was my first Cirque show , so I can't compare to the others. All I know, is I enjoyed this show A LOT! So much, I want to watch this again!  Just the nostalgia alone will have me come back. I've never seen Michael Jackson live and I'm sure if I did, I would be wowed more than watching this show.  I was thoroughly entertained  from beginning to end.  I even had a moment where I started tearing up, because its sad to see such a talented person come to this demise :(  My date even had a great time and he admitted to me that he didn't even want to go to the show and he was happy that he did. DUH, anything I want to do is going to be fun LOL :p\n\n   I won't go into great detail of the performances, because I believe everyone should experience this Cirque show at least once. Make sure you get the middle tier seating and sit at the end row against the wall because the first tier seating left room to be harassed by the fake \"paparazzi\" and your pic would show up on the wall. F that LOL. Good looking out on my date picking the perfect seats. \n\n I will be back!!!!
