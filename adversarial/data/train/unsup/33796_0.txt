Girlfriend\/Mom\/Bae\/Boo\/Wifey\/Side chick\/Baby mama (?!) tired of your 90's grunge, slovenly appearance? Well you've come to the right place! \n\nI wish they did appointments because like any decent barbershop you (still) gotta wait like 2-3 hours but hey where else are you gonna find a quality haircut and get your pomade on this side of town? All and all, they're a great group who remain active in the barber community with a regular presence at events and throwing carshows throughout the year. Keep doing what ya'll are doing guys (and gal)!
