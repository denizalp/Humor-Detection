Gorgeous Paris Baguette in the Venetian Canal shops! You can go upstairs and see a great view of the shops from up high!\n\nThe cream cheese donut we got was small and didn't have any cream cheese in the middle. We frequent Paris Baguette at home and was disappointed in how the cream cheese donut was made. Also, the guy who heated it up overheated it and it was super dry and not like our usual cream cheese donut.\n\nWe got an iced tea too and it was pretty good.\n\n\nDo a Yelp Check-In for a free cup of coffee!
