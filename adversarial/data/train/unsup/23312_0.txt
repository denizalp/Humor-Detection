I wasn't even that intoxicated when I arrived at La Banquise but even my sober self-knew that I was hungry and in need of some late night authentic poutine eats! We walked a fair distance in the middle of the night to find LB but man was I happy when we finally arrived. Admittedly, we couldn't see a sign for the shop, but the massive lineup(s) were definitely a beacon you could easily rely on to assure you, that you were in the right spot.\n\nYes, I did mention lineups plural because if you didn't know that this spot was a restaurant you'd think that between the two separate lines (one of takeout, one for dining in) and the 2-3 massive black t-shirt wearing bouncers, that you were outside of a popular nightclub.\n\nThe wait time to take out took forever. Not because they were slow, in fact, they were turning out orders pretty quick but the lineups were lengthy. After about 30-45 minutes it was finally my turn. Keeping it simple, I went with the Poutine Classique, just cheese curds, fries and gravy. I was so hungry by the time I ordered that I blacked out and ended up ordering the 'grande' aka large - big mistake, that is a massive 2 pounds of poutine.\n\nI chowed down as much as I could but had to leave the rest sitting on my countertop once I got home. It was massive,\n\nThat said, the next morning should have been gross to even consider looking at the poutine leftovers, let alone eating them, but they totally held up and were friggen delicious!\n\nBig fan of the food these guys are doing and looking forward to returning for some of their more intricate poutines!\n\nEatcrest Out!
