This review is for the location on Royalton Road in  Strongsville in the Great Escape Plaza. Let me tell you what a nightmare this was!!!!! My husband's pants ripped on the left  side of the leg down by the hem and the hem came out completely!!! He was walking around all day with his pant leg dragging on the ground! Also as my husband is a bigger guy, the style vest he had to wear was a bib style, it broke! We tried to hold it together with a safety pin but it didn't work and the vest was hanging out from underneath his jacket and the strap was hanging out the back so he just had to take it off! \n\nI called them today to let them know what happened and the woman on the phone apologized. After my husband calmed me down, I apologized to the woman and told her we would like a full refund for his tux. She explained that she would like to say yes but she had to ask her manager first. When she came back on the phone she explained she could only give us HALF BACK!!! As I didn't want to argue any longer, I told her that was fine (even though it's not AT ALL) and politely thanked her, and the bitch hung up on me!!!! Not a fuck you, not a have a nice day........NOTHING EXCEPT ''CLICK!!!!!!!'' Very rude and unprofessional!!! \n*This is an update to the review I left earlier. \nUpon returning the tux's, I talked to a different store manager, I showed him the the damages to my husband's tux,  and he told me he was going to override the previous manager and refund the whole amount for my husband's tux. He was very polite and professional unlike the bitch I spoke to on the phone (I pointed out to him that he should teach her proper phone etiquette) , which I greatly appreciate,however  I will still never do business with them again.
