Great place, great food, great wine.\n\nWe went on a Sunday where it was half-priced night for wine bottles - an immediate great start for any meal.  The food was also above board - my father made the comment, \"man, this is the only place I've been that can make a chicken breast without giving me a dry piece of meat.\"  High praise from dad who is rather culinarily challenged and measures food on a scale of \"MMMMM\" and \"tastes funny.\"  I personally enjoyed my meal and will definitely hit that place again when I go back.\n\nThe biggest attraction though, the service.  Not only did the waiter explain everything to my father rather patiently, but he also knew exactly what wine to recommend with each dish.  Oh and the desserts at the end - awesome.  It was even better that when the waiter heard my parents were leaving that night, he packed more into a to-go box for my pops whose face lit up like a Christmas tree upon eating some of the candies.
