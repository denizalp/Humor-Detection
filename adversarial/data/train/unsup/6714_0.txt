I think my expectations were a little too high for this spot. But, I mean, if you tell me gourmet mac and cheese, my mouth is going to start watering... We ordered 'The Best Seller' with pork and bacon and the 'Smoked Chicken' with, well, smoked chicken and gouda. Both were pretty one note -- lots of bland meat piled on top of lukewarm elbow noodles, doused with overly sweet BBQ sauce and swimming in watery cheese sauce. To add insult to injury, it took about 15-minutes to prepare that. \n\nDid it cure my Sunday morning hangover? Sure! Would I seek them out or even order from them again? Probably not.
