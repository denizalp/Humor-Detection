I am always to humbled by all the amazing opportunities that Yelp has provided me over the years... So when I saw that Hayley was organizing an event where I could give back to the community it was a total no brainer that I had to attend. \nThis was my first experience with St. Mary's Food Bank and it won't be my last! I was astounded to see how many families rely on organization's like St. Mary's for food assistance to supplement with their EBT benefits (each box provides a family approx. 3 days worth of meals). It was really a bit of a reality check for me, I think sometimes we all get caught up in our own lives and don't truly realize how lucky we are. \n\nHere are some astonishing statistics for you to ponder...\nCurrently nearly 1 in 3 children, 1 in 5 Arizonans, and 1 in 7 seniors in Arizona live in poverty.\n\nArizona's hunger rates are higher than national averages: 17.8% of Arizonans are food insecure, compared to 15.9% nationally, and  28.2% of Arizonan children face hunger, compared to 21.6% nationally.\n\nArizona ranks third in the country for high child food insecurity rates, behind only New Mexico and Mississippi, with 456,760 children facing hunger on a daily basis.\n\n2 million Arizonans are considered working poor, living at or below the Federal Poverty Guideline. This is the majority of those served by the Food Bank's emergency food box program.\n\nMore than 40% of the households receiving emergency food assistance have at least one person who is working.\n\nSo, I encourage all of you reading these reviews for our amazing event at St. Mary's Food bank to go sign up to volunteer or donate donate donate! \n\nAlso, friendly donation tip! They LOVE protein powders, Rice (enough to feed a family) and beans. \n\nSo a huge THANK YOU to St. Mary's for hosting us, Chompies for the delicious bagels and Power Crunch for the awesome swag and samples... and as always hats off to Hayley for all the hard work she does!
