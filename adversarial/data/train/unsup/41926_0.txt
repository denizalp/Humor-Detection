I hardly ever give reviews but felt this needed to be said. Hopefully UNOs will fix the problems they see in their reviews. We live about 40 minutes from UNOs and try to get there whenever we can. Our entire family loves deep dish pizza. We always get 2 so that we can have leftovers for the next day.  \nToday we stopped in and ordered 2 pan style pizzas, Chicago classic & pepperoni. Got home and sat down at the supper table to a pepperoni pizza and a black olive\/green pepper pizza. Imagine the disappointment driving all that way and then only being able to eat one of the pizzas(kids won't eat black olives & parents can't eat green peppers). Very disappointed family tonight. \nSo my experience prior to this was about a month ago. The restaurant was busy for a Sunday afternoon. It was raining so everyone was inside. We put our name on the wait list and decided to sit in the bar. The bartender didn't acknowledge us. She was too busy talking and joking around with the waitstaff. We waited 20 minutes before our table was ready and no drinks. We decided our visit today that we would order pizza at the wait station and go sit in our vehicle so we wouldn't have to sit in the bar. We didn't want to risk another disappointment.  \nI think we will be searching for a new pizza restaurant. Sorry UNOs.
