I am writing this review with part excitement and part middle finger to Whole Foods for thinking the westside of CLE couldn't support this type of a store.\n\nI like their layout much better, and the prices are comparable.  \n\nThe staff there is really helpful.  The people in the cheese department went out of their way to offer me some samples to find the best combination with the wine I was purchasing.  They also have some great cured meats, too.  \n\nAs I was checking things off of my shopping list I was adding new items to my list for my next visit....which will be very soon.\n\nTo sum it up I'll quote something I overhead another shopper say, \"so long Nature's Bin.\"
