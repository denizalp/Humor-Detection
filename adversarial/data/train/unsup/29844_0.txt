The food is actually really tasty, which is why the review gets two stars. Got wings and nachos as appetizers, and I do have to say the sauce (garlic parmesan and teriyaki) were really good!\n\nKids meals were typical of any burger place. My husband ordered the bison burger medium rare and it came out so well done it was impossible to eat. When the new burger came out, it was so rare that it was dripping blood when my husband picked it up to eat.\n\nThe service was atrocious!!! While our server was nice when she was around, the issue was she was never around. Never brought refills, didn't clear plates even though they were stacked at the end of the table to make it easy for her, had to flag her down for everything!! And it's not like they were busy, there were two servers and three occupied tables. \n\nThe \"BEST\" part of the experience is later when I checked my bank account there was an additional $25 charge to my card, like she accidentally swiped my card for another table. Again let me mention how NOT busy they were. While the charge was credited, the was no mention of this happening. No apology saying what happened. At least have the courtesy to tell the customer!!!
