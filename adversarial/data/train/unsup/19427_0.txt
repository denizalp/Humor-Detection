Last Sunday I went to eat.  I was pretty tired and not in a great mood and thought it would be fast and easy for me.  I have eaten here at least once per month since this place opened and always enjoyed it.  But... It had been awhile since we had been there.  Like I said when I went I was pretty dis-satisfied.  I am a tough person to dis-satisfy at a buffet as I am pretty versitle when it comes to eating.\n\nFirst off I love their fried chicken.  Always fresh and crispy.  But I only like white meat.  They had two trays out and although one said white meat, all of the chicken was thighs and legs.\n\nNow they have breakfast for lunch and dinner.  I do not eat breakfast food.  Ever.  Because they had to make room for breakfast food, that took some of the selection away from what they used to have.\n\nI always like to drink chocolate milk when I eat there.  This time, when I asked the busser (or waitperson) told me I had to pay for it when I bought my meal.  I have never been charged before, and if they decided to begin charging extra for chocolate milk, they should tell you when you pay.\n\nI made a taco.  With all of the taco fixings I took a plop of what I thought was sour cream and placed on top of my lettuce, salsa and meat.  Turned out it was whipped cream.  Ruined that taco.\n\nThe rest of the food was good as always, just don't think it will be worth it for me any longer.
