Burger Brasserie curious.~ \nI got to try this Burger joint after the recommendation of a Paris employee from the players club as she recommended this place as a sports bar with good food after asking her about different options in the area. This restaurant ended up being the perfect spot for a casual lunch for burgers and more! \n\nUpon entering this is located on the edge before the split between Paris and Bally's. The female servers are dressed up semi scandalous in the lingerie like outfits, but still semi-classy and professional staff. The area we had dined in was the corner which was nice and spacious. \n\nThe ambiance is nice and casual at the same time. Pricing here is about average and a good variety to satisfy cravings and cater to burger lovers along with plenty of drink options! =] \n\nFOOD:\nLemon Garlic Parmesan Wings, Hot Wings, Paris Burger, Almond Joy Dessert\n\nDRINK: \nCab-arita and Caramel Macchiato Smoothie \n\nThe food was plentiful and served fresh! My Paris Burger was excellent with brie cheese, caramelized onion,smoked bacon.. MmMm brie  cheese! Both drinks I had were awesome from my alky and non-alky drink, and the ending with the dessert was a nice close to all the tasty food! \n\nOverall, Burger Brasserie has fab service, a fun ambiance, and most importantly delicious food and drinks. =]
