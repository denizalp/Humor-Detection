It's my favorite place to stay in Scottsdale (well, for non-resorts, that is).  It's the best location in Old Town Scottsdale.\n\nIt has really nice suite-style rooms, super clean, and the lobby features a grille, a coffee\/Starbucks, and is very modern styled.  I love Hyatt Places throughout the country, but this one rocks.\n\nThe one downside (or upside?) is, the NE side of the hotel faces 2 or 3 loud bars, and at times, plays the music super loud.  Whenever the club doors open, BOOM BOOM BOOM goes right up to your room.\n\n(Pssssttt...I kind of like it!)
