This place is a nightmare in the mornings until mid-afternoon. Parking is a disaster in the winter as they probably lose 1\/3 of the parking spaces due to people not being able to see the lines and just seem to haphazardly line-up their vehicles in something close to an organized fashion. The line inside is long and the staff aren't great.
