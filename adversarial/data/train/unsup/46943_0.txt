I received my vehicle with a cracked windshield. They didn't inspect it for me so I drove off the lot without noticing it even though I inspected my vehicle myself (I don't normally inspect vehicles so I sucked at inspecting it). The deductible was 250 dollars, my new windshield cost me 240 dollars.\n\nBasically, if they crack any windshields, they won't replace them. What is also of note is that the bill of lading receipt they gave me when I dropped the vehicle off, didn't have any marks on it to prove what dents and scratches were already on the vehicle. It was a poor carbon copy. Either way, the deductible is high enough such that scratches,dents, broken windshields, etc. will not be covered. Only if your vehicle is completely totaled will it be covered.
