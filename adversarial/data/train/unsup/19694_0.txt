One of the best poker rooms in America. I'm a tournament specialist. I enjoy the atmosphere and the game play here. They have friendly staff and very competitive players. While I don't play the cash games here, the stories I've heard... aggressiveness is the key. I would like recommend if you have the money to play in one of their WPT tournaments, especially the WPT World Championship. Great place to play.
