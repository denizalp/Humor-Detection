This is why we can't have nice things: because of corporate coffee chains like CBTL and Starbucks. I did have an enjoyable experience during my first (and so far, only visit) to CBTL but allow me to delineate:\n\nPROS:\n-nice ambiance with ample seating\n-quiet compared to Starbucks\n-nice patio\n-friendly staff, relatively knowledgeable\n-easy to find right off Bell Rd.\n\nCONS:\n-closes at 9:00PM\n-ridiculously priced drinks (just like Starbucks)\n-also noted that yogurt\/cottage cheese (like Oikos, etc) is severely price-gouged. Think $4 for a cup of yogurt... when you can get the same product for $1 at the supermarket.\n-chai tea does not use milk\/soy... seemed watery and bland compared to most chai I've drank.\n\nNice for an occasional stop-in to chat with a friend, but not a daily (or weekly) must-do for me.
