Get your passport photo here! \n\nThanks, Yelp for helping me find this place. It's right downtown and yet I wouldn't have known about it otherwise, since it's on the basement level of the Sheraton Hotel complex. \n\n2 photos for $9 (or $5 on saturdays with an online coupon http:\/\/www.rapidphototoronto.com\/passport.html, but their saturday hours are variable... you have to phone on friday) which they guarantee will meet requirements for whatever you are using it for. I was in and out in 5 minutes. It doesn't get much better than that! My not-smiling facial expression turned out a little dazed, but that's not their fault...
