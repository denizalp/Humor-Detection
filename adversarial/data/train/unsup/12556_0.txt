Dropped my Chinese Huawei phone today and it smashed into a million pieces. Didn't want to get an iPhone because everyone has one now, and it just makes me look too generic. So, I came to the conclusion that I was gonna get the Galaxy Note II, but ended up buying a Samsung Galaxy s3. Who knew that breaking my phone would be the best thing to happen to me today! My Yelp App looks really nice on this phone. I'm a big Apple fan, I love my Mac Book and iPods, but the Galaxy s3 is just light years ahead of the iPhone 5. \n\nI like this T-Mobile store the best out of any of them. The one at the Boulevard is great as well, but on some days you get those lazy workers who do nothing but watch videos and play video games on their phones. Here at the Meadow's T-Mobile you get non-stop service, and everyone is nice. I'm a big fan.
