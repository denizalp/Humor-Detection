Very fresh tasting burgers that actually taste like hamburger.  Buns and cheese and other toppings are top grade, fries actually taste like they're made from potatoes.  Service is very friendly, seating is very comfortable (very cushy booth benches, I love that).  Smoothest most flavorful custard (ice cream) around!
