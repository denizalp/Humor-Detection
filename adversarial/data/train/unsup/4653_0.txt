This is embarrassing to write about but it's that important for everyone to know this place is a huge scam!  First you have to pay $33 cover for out of towners which is expensive since other clubs have free admission and a limo ride. \n\nNot to be mean but the girls are not as hot as other places, which my group immediately noticed. Also I WANT TO WARN EVERYONE that 2 of my friends got hustled here so be very wary of anything extra they offer.  If you come, avoid anything extra but the smart thing is DONT COME HERE
