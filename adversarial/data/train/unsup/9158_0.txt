Man, I'm getting too old for this. \n\nNot for the seemingly endless number of rides or things to do, but sheesh, I used to be one of those people who'd be there from 10am straight on through to close. \n\nI only lasted about 7 hours this time around.\n\nHowever, the operations at Wonderland have definitely stepped up their game. Despite a couple of flash thunderstorms, ride operators were extremely efficient, safe, and all around on the ball when it came to ensuring that all rides were up and running again once the weather cleared. I didn't even see the notorious Bat get stuck!\n\nThe food options are also much better now. We went to the food 'station' (Backlot I think it was called?) right by the former Top Gun ride (damn those name changes!) for some late lunch. The inside was actually very warm and welcoming, setup cafeteria style, offering surprisingly average prices! Go for the Angus burger with a side of onion rings for about $11 total. You will be stuffed and the onion rings are arguably the best I've ever had. Incredible, I know. The feller next to us had gone with the spaghetti, which was heaping on his plate and also looked pretty darn satisfying.\n\nOne thing though: if all these rainy summers start becoming a \"thing\", they should probably make their tarps water proof instead of just plain.. mesh? People were fleeing screaming from the Behemoth line when the first storm hit. Thereby moving us up to the front. Wait, that's a good thing.\n\nAnd on that note - Behemoth is the most terrifying thing. Ever. As in I actually felt fear underneath all that adrenaline. Way to make us Canadians proud!
