Who doesn't love them some Chipotle?\n\nEverything is good here, and portion sizes are huge--come hungry.  My personal favorite are the Burrito Bols which are a kind of salad-burrito hybrid.\n\nThe Cilantro lime rice they serve here would make any dish taste good.  Green tomatillo salsa is outstanding.\n\nThis place gets super crowded, so be ready to wait in line.
