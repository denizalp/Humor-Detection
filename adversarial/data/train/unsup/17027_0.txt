3.5 stars \n\nThe are a new NY style pizza joint. Great family run place that makes a good pie. \n\nI tried a slice before traffic school yesterday and it was good. I am just not a huge fan of thin crust, light sauce and light cheese. BUT \n\nThis was a good slice, the crust had a nice crunch and flavor with some garlic butter at the end. The toppings were fresh and sauce had a good flavor. You can tell when someone cooks with good ingredients. \n\nThe building and surrounding areas are a little on the sketchy side but some of my favorite places are like that. i would like to go back and order a whole pie, try it hot and fresh. \n\nThe son was real nice, asked if I enjoyed the pizza and was genuinely interested in my answer. I clued him in about Yelp and expect to see Yelp love by you all.
