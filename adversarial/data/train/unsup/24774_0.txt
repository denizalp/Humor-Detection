Use to Love this place. Its become obvious the new owners have no clue. First of all, youre here because of people enjoying sunsets. You dont serve Daquiris?? WTF i know ice machines would break you. \n\nSecond of all. Its now a dog park with tables and drinks. Dogs all over pissing and shitting. Think im kidding? Come try for yourself and see. Cannot wait until someone gets bit. If you get bit, SUE THESE MOTHER FUCKERS UNTIL THEY ARE BROKE. \n\nWho ever is managing this place now. Have insurance because your ass is going to need it. \n\nIts a summer bar you idiots. NOT A FUCKING DOG PARK FOR DRUNKS... \n\nIdiots...idiots idiots. Bring back the old owners please.\n\nP.S. Huge dogs just walking thru dining area begging for food. Its just a shame. \n\nBTW we are dog owners but we respect people that are trying to relax.
