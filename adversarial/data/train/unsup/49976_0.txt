My first time here. Customer service was immediate; almost as if there were expecting me. Both waitresses (Hanna and Hiely), working had great customer service. My waitress was Heily. She was very interactive, makes great eye contact, super attentive and gets to the point of getting exactly what you ordered in a timely manner. \nHalf price apptizers and drinks from 4-6pm! \nFood was great! Please was decorated very well! And most of all, customer service was smiling\/helpful faces!
