So while it's off the beaten path, I actually kind of liked Sunset Bowl. I particularly liked the surly remarks from counter guy.  He was funny.  \"Yes, you need to leave one shoe of your up here, because you know people really want these stylish bowling shoes of ours,\" he deadpanned.\n\nIt's cool. That's how they do it back in Cali. No biggie.  I did really like the bar area.  It's clear that they remodeled many parts of the facility from the front counter\/shoe rental area to the U-shaped oak bar.\n\nBig props to the bartender\/TV controller who was with me on the whole Desperate Housewives thing if it was to show - which it didn't.\n\nThe minuses I have to say are the lack of tables at each alley and the archaic ball retrieval machine thingy - which lacked an air dryer.  When it comes down to it, Sunset Bowl just doesn't do it for me like Christown.  They have the perfect balance of retro-old and modern new.  3.5 stars.
