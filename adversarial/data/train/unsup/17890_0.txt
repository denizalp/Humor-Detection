Firstly, I will say that I am a world traveler and have experienced numerous types of clubs, lounges and bars, especially in the LA\/Las Vegas nightlife, seeing as I lived in Los Angeles for 8 years. \nI was extremely disappointed with the whole operation at Haze nightclub during my visit to Las Vegas in June. \n\nMy boyfriend purchased a table reservation for upwards of $3,000 for him and our friends. They were told to check in\/arrive  very early by 9 p.m. (um, ok). I was flying in around 11 p.m., and my boyfriend left the club to come pick me up. He was told by the staff that re-entering would of course not be an issue.\nWe arrived an hour later to a huge line outside the entrance, which is normal for a weekend night. Naturally, we assumed entering would not be an issue, seeing as we had a TABLE with bottle service. \n\nInstead, we were made to wait for over an hour outside the entrance, even after telling numerous staff members that we had a table reservation (where our friends were already inside enjoying). We were treated rudely and ignored. My boyfriend produced his ID and his name for his reservation many times, but they did not care to validate. \nOn top of that, the staff tried to swindle us and say that to re-enter we had to pay $100 PER PERSON or we were not getting in. Are you f@%$ing kidding me? \n\nBy the time we argued enough with these lame bouncers and finally got in to the table, our friends had left and the fun was basically ruined for the night. Not only that, $3,000 only gets you the table in the back corner bar area, where you can't even enjoy the crowd or the ambiance of the club. \n\nON TOP OF THIS whole situation, they double charged my boyfriend's credit card, only to re-tract it a few days later. Someone from the club did call my boyfriend and offered him some kind of returning discount, which was laughable, as if we would ever want to step foot into that place again. \n\nI have never been treated so disgustingly awful by any establishment in my club going years. I made sure to mention this occurrence to my numerous contacts in LA\/ Las Vegas, because frankly, this place does not know how to run an elite, classy and enjoyable establishment.
