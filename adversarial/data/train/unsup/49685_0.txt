This is place is one of many gelato places on College street, but it has one particular flavour going for it that I haven't seen in other places - Ferrero Rocher Gelato.  I must agree with everyone, the Ferrero Rocher flavour is a MUST TRY.  In addition, I liked the salted caramel and vanilla flavour, take your pick depending your mood.
