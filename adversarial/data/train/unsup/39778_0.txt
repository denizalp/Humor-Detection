Decided to drop by and grab a burrito from here before going to Scotiabank theatre for a movie and that turned out to be a great decision. I ordered at the front, grabbed a number and they brought my food to me when it was ready. The sitting area was a little cramped but I got my food to go so it didn't really affect my experience. \n\nI ordered the beef brisket burrito, which came out to around $10. I personally really like their tortillas because it's freshly made and very chewy. My only complaint is that the beef was a little on the salty side. The portion was huge and I was completely stuffed by the end of it.\n\nI would come again to try the tacos.
