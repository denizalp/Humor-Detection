We use Yelp all the time to find places to eat. Saw the rating for this place and thought we would give it a try. Unfortunately the Yelpers got this one wrong or we caught them on a bad day. Lived in the Middle East for 5 years and really like the food but this was a real disappointment. I do have to say the lady at the counter was very friendly and genuinely seem liked she wanted to serve. We ordered  gyros sandwich combo, two falafel sandwich combos, chicken kabob plate, humus and baba ganoush to go. We were home in 10 minutes and began to eat.  The gyros was good, the chicken kabob was flavorful but dry. We had ordered an extra side of Tahini for the falafels  but for some reason there was none on the falafels themselves. They must have forgotten which added to making them pretty tasteless and dry. I love falafels but not these.   Fries were good to dry depending on the batch you ate from. The absolute worst was the pita bread they included for the bland boring hummus and plain baba ganoush.  It was some of the driest and chewiest pita bread I have ever tried to eat. Just terrible! They were pulling the pita out of bags at the diner so none of it is made there. Any way, not a great food experience. Certainly not a 4 star. Maybe 2 or maybe 3 stars if you give consideration for friendly staff. Not far from my home but I doubt we would go back. Too bad. Would have been nice to find a good pita place nearby.
