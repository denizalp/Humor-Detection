I give this place four stars mainly because of the entertainment factor...nothing like eating frozen custard in your car while watching strippers go into work at the OG ;-) \n\nI think I need to go back and have the custard alone without topping because I didn't care for the topping really...it tasted low quality and blah to me. I focused on the toppings so much I didn't really think if I even liked the custard itself. \n\nI shall go back because like I said the people watching is great, the weather is wonderful now for a evening frozen treat and I need to give the custard a fair try :-)
