I don't know how Frederic Da Silva performed his mind reading acts. Each act was unsolvable unless mind reading really is a thing! Volunteers are chosen by throwing frisbees into the audience. I was determined to get a frisbee, so after some jumping and diving, I got one! I was asked to be on stage for a number and time revealing act. First, I chose a number from 1 to 100. I repeated 99 in my head several times as Frederic gazed into my eyes. He wrote something on the paper behind his back, asked me to reveal my number and tadaaaaaaa: the number he had written was the same number I had chosen in my head! For the second portion of my task, I was asked to choose a time. I chose 6:13 and crossed the stage away from Frederic to write my number on a piece of paper, folded the paper and sealed it in a small Manila envelope. There was no way that Frederic had a glimpse of my number. I had the paper in the palm of my hand and close to my body. I returned to my seat and repeated 6:13 in my head several times as Frederic gazed into my eyes. He then went into the audience and took an anonymous man's watch and gave it to another volunteer on the stage. The volunteer was asked to turn the dial until I said STOP. Frederic wrote my time on his whiteboard and I said STOP--the arms on the watch miraculously stopped at 6:13 and the time he wrote down on his whiteboard revealed 6:13!!!!! I don't know he did this, but he didn't flinch or hesitate one bite. Overall, great show, but he relied heavily on audience participation. I wish there were some acts that did not call for volunteers, so that the spotlight was solely on him.
