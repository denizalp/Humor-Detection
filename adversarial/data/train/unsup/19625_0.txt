YUH-UH-UM!\nAwesome Peruvian food tonight at an assuming east side locale. \nDon't drive by it though, there's delicious inside. \nOur server was spot on making awesome recommendations from start to finish, including an intriguing take on tiramisu made from lucuma fruit... a sweet complex fruit that's somewhere between pumpkin and sweet potato with a tinge of maple and cinnamon. GET THIS!
