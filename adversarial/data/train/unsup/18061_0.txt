Aye Dios Mios!  I think I have died and gone to carne asada heaven. The reviews were right, Sonora Grill is astounding! I was so impressed with everything I ordered. The carne asada, hands down is the best in the valley. The shrimp was plump and flavorful, the tortillas were fresh and the guacamole... Oh the guacamole... Mas deliciosa!\n \nWhile the chips may not have been fresh they were still the perfect vehicle to scoop up the 3 salsas I devoured. I was even impressed with the rice and beans and usually these seem to be an afterthought in most Mexican meals. At Sonora they paid as much attention to the flavorful sides as the rest of the menu. Qu√© bueno!\n \nThe girl that helped us behind the counter was friendly and helpful and really knew her stuff. If I owned a restaurant I would try and steal her away! This is a new favorite that is now in my regular rotation.
