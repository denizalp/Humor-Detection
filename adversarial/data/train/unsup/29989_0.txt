I loved this place till just now. Hosting a big party for10 people, so I called to reserve a spot on Sunday. Over heard staff said \"I think we should be okay but advise me to email them to book instead\" okay email. email at 2 pm, got response 11pm, saying priority list has been booked but feel free to drop by..\nYou just don't \"drop by\" with 10 people!!\n\nI understand it is for the weekend but this email booking thing I just don't get.
