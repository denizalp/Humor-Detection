WOW . . . I mean. . . WOW \nNot many places make me say WOW in a review with all caps, but Gordon Ramsay achieved that twice in Las Vegas! This was one of the two amazing meals thanks to Chef Ramsay!\n\nThis is seriously the absolute best fish and chips I have ever had! \nWe ordered the three piece fish and chips with a side of artisanal ketchup, curry mango, and sriracha aioli. \n\nThe fish...spectacular! Amazing batter, thin and crispy, golden brown perfectly fried! The fish was flaky, light, and not fishy at all!\nThe chips..oh man those chips! The crispiest, crunchiest fries I have had! Lightly salted, and amazing with the ketchup \n\nThe sauces were fantastic too! not too spicy with the sriracha, and the curry mango was not too sweet, both thick, flavorful, and perfectly paired with the fish!\n\nAbsolute best Fish and Chips
