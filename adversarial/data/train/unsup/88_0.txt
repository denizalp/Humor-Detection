Called to schedule my second appoint with Janell at this salon and got a rude receptionist that said, \"You need to call her directly...I DO NOT schedule her appointments...Here cell number is:xxx.xxx.xxxx!\"\n\nCalled Janell and made my appointment - got there before any of the stylists were there.  Was rudely told by the receptionist to \"wait back there\"\n\nJanell came in all smiley and we had my color and cutting consultation and off she went to mix it up.  I was chewing my gum (I snap it when nervous) when the RUDE receptionist came over and stood 5 feet behind my chair, spoke to me via the mirror in front of me and told me, \"Would you PLEASE stop snapping your gum...I can HEAR YOU on the phone with clients!\"  My response, \"Yep!\"  Got up, grabbed my purse, found Janell in the back and told her I was leaving.  Told her what happened, bought the hair products for my neighbor, paid her $20 for the wasted color she had mixed and $20 for her time and left.\n\nGot home and told the story to my neighbor and she told me she is treated very rudely by the receptionist as well.\n\nLooking for a new Curly Hair Salon in Scottsdale\/Phoenix!!!\n\nNOTE:  Would give this situation 1\/2 Star if I was allowed!!!
