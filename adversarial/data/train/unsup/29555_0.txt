We ended up here on a Friday night and it was pretty darn good.  Friday night happy hour from 4-8 included $4 pints and $4 glasses of wine.  My spouse can't drink beer anymore (*tears*), so being able to get wine that doesn't taste like you were thinning out blood with vinegar, to feed it to a vampire, is a huge win.  The fact it didn't cost $8 a glass was also amazing.  They also don't care if you order another two or three drinks each as happy hour is coming to a close.\nThere were forty cent wings on Friday night, which was great, they were quite respectable for wings at that price point.  The buck a shuck oysters weren't fantastic, but did come with a good selection of sauces and shredded horseradish.\nThe bar was busy, but not so busy our service suffered, our ear drums pounded or our shoulders were jostled.\nThe hand dryer in the women's washroom has the force of an octogenarian asthmatic blowing on your hands, so hopefully you're not wearing khakis and can dry your hands on your pants.\n\nNothing to rave about, but I was happy with the prices and atmosphere, especially for a Friday night.
