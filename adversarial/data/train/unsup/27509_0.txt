The fried chicken here is amazing!! I love the little spice packets you get with the chicken. Its practically the Asian version of KFC and it is amazing. The chicken is very tender and definitely not as greasy as KFC. Also, the bubble tea here is probably the best I've ever had. Their Taro Bubble Tea surpasses the one a TenRen and is cheaper too!\n\nedited: ive come in here multiple times since my first review (originally 5 stars) lately the service is very slow and the food is sometimes slightly undercooked
