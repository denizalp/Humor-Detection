We thoroughly enjoyed our supper at Battista's! Free wine at each table with fun miniature glasses to drink it from. Delicious salad and garlic bread to start. I had the meatballs with ziti which were delicious! I couldn't finish the pasta but made sure to eat all of the yummy meatballs. My hubby had the chicken rio and loved it as well. Wasn't sure we would like the cappuccino at the end but it was amazing. Kind of just want to go back and get that again! Highly recommend checking this place out. Reasonably priced and delicious.
