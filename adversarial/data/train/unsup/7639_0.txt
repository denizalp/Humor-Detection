ANY PARTICULAR REASON WHY CRUISE AMERICA IS NOT ON BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU'S ACCREDITATION?! CEO OF CRUISE AMERICA PUTS THE LIVES OF ITS CUSTOMERS AT RISK! DO NOT CARE FOR THE SAFETY OF ITS PATRONS!! DO NOT RENT! WASTE OF MONEY! SPEND THE EXTRA MONEY TO HAVE A NICE VACATION!!! \n\nCruise America left me in tears...literally!! my husband and I rented an RV from the Alum Rock San Jose location two days ago so that we can take our 23 month old son to Disneyland  for the first time. Once we hit the road, one hour into our trip, the air conditioner stopped working. So we called the customer service number and spoke to Elena who apparently is the catcher for ALL calls, she takes the information down and relays it to an agent. We informed the agent lucas about our problem and he was helpful in attempting to resolve the problem by sending us to Fairway Ford in Placentia to get it diagnosed and fixed. Russell at Fairway Ford tested out the air conditioner by running the generator that WE pay for by the hour to find nothing wrong with it! not to mention, left us with NO gas! I had to wait in the hotel with our son while my husband had to take time from our son's Disneyland time to go get this taken care of. \n\nIn the middle of our day at Disneyland, Kara called to inform us that the dealership found no problem with it and that we MUST return the rental car IMMEDIATELY! We contacted Hertz and they said don't worry about it, bring it back tomorrow. So we got it back, and initially the A\/C was working en route to San Diego to for Sea World which was 100 miles from Anaheim. \n\nOnwards to San Diego, the A\/C stopped working AGAIN.....the problem was intermittent. So we were proactive, and called the customer service number again to inform them that the problem returned, and that we were headed to a Ford Dealership in San Diego to have them diagnose it. Once we arrived we were greeted by an angel Jennifer at Mossy Ford who was the Service Manager, and before turning off the RV, we had her witness the problem and sure enough, she recognized there was something wrong immediately. Not to mention, there was hot air coming out from the floor vents. Our son is only 23 months old, he gets grumpy when it's too hot...we were sweating in the cabin! Once we got in touch with Kara again at Cruise America, she told us that we had to wait an hour for the dealership to diagnose the problem!! An hour at a dealership with a 23 month old running around!!! Kara said the diagnose would ONLY take ONE HOUR, when the Service Manager (as helpful as she was) told us it would take at least 2-4 hours! I told Kara to explain to our son that we weren't going to make  it to Sea World today because we have to wait for the RV to get fixed! Kara expressed ZERO COMPASSION, ZERO UNDERSTANDING! She said she had to follow protocol. Cruise America would not authorize a rental vehicle for us until the RV got diagnosed....so I asked her, what if it took 3-4 hours?! She said it should only take 1! So, I hung up on her and called the corporate office in MESA, AZ to speak with Mr. Smalley, the CEO of Cruise America. Sabrina, the RECEPTIONIST, said I cannot speak with him, all complaints go to an Email address, there is not even a phone number...just the 1-800 number that we keep calling and the same person who picks up! \n\nI was so upset, that I spoke to them in tears.....the fact that NOBODY at Cruise America cared for the well being of its customers is beyond comprehension. The people they employ are heartless and won't think outside the box to help us! We have a 23 month old son, and I asked Kara to show some compassion and that I needed to speak to a supervisor or manager, she responded with, we don't escalate calls. So for all mechanical problems, it's the customers fault...\n\nI WILL NEVER RENT, NEVER RECOMMEND, NEVER MOUTH THE WORDS \"CRUISE AMERICA\" AGAIN SO LONG AS I LIVE. They DO NOT CARE IF THEY PUT YOUR LIVES IN JEOPARDY, THEY ALLOW THEIR AGENCIES TO RENT OUT THEIR RV IN THE POOR, UNSAFE CONDITION THAT THEY ARE IN WITH ZERO CONSIDERATION FOR YOUR LIVES!
