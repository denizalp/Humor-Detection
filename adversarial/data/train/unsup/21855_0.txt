This ranks with the best steakhouse dinners I've had in Las Vegas.  We came here before the Elton John concert last night.  I ordered a New York strip (a 12 ounce steak) and my wife got the 9 ounce filet.  We got an order of fries as a shared side.\n\nThe bread basket had a nice variety but I didn't want to fill up on that so I had two small slices of two kinds.  The steaks were both cooked perfectly.  Mine, blue, was cool and red on the inside--just perfect!  The fries were nicely seasoned although I didn't taste much garlic as I had expected.\n\nFor dessert, my wife had the seasonal berries and I went with the single size portion of carrot cake.  I would like to see the double portion for sharing just to see if it needs two people to carry it to the table.\n\nService was excellent!  Lopez was our server and he was very personable, polite, and efficient.  I never asked for an iced tea refill.  It was automatic.  Next time, we'll sit on the patio and watch the people walking by in the Forum Shops. We found that the air conditioning inside was quite cold and it was a bit warmer on the patio.
