Do NOT come here!! This place sucks!! I went with my husband to purchase a vehicle that WAS NOT a VW and these people pretty much conned us into purchasing a VW! They asked us if we wanted to set up a payment plan which would charge us every two weeks half of the payment so that it's not one lump sum every month. Well, two weeks after purchasing the vehicle, they had charged us a FULL payment!!! From the 21st of May to the June 4th is not a damn month and they had already took the money from our account. After we call Autopay (which is the company that they use) they said we had to contact VW because that's how THEY had set it up. We call VW and to speak to the asswipe AUSTIN who's the sales manager. Well, this asshole said he would call us back to let us know what was going on since they had charges us 1 full amount and then 2 weeks later they charged us the other half of the bill. \n\nWe called AUSTIN SEVERAL times to get this handled .... and this DICK hasn't called us back whatsoever! At this point, the only reason this review has a star is because I can't leave 0 stars. Stay away from this place. They just want to con you into purchasing Volkswagens in order to make money. They have used cars available, but then tell you that the bank isn't answering and it would be a cheaper route if you were to purchase a Volkswagen instead.
