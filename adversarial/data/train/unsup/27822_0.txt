Awful. I was so excited to have a coffee shop must down the street from me when barriques opened, but every experience I have had here has been so disappointing. The staff seems young, inexperienced, unprofessional and disinterested. Every cappuccino I've ordered here has come out as a bad lukewarm latte. The glass case of baked goods is always swarming with fruit flies and it is really disgusting (the staff seemed really unconcerned about this when I pointed this out). I just don't even bother going anymore, i will actually drive a mile away to get coffee somewhere else. Terrible!
