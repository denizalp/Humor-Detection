We ambled over to this cute little joint to pick up dessert after having dinner at Sushi Nagoya (see review).  Staff was friendly and courteous and our order was ready within minutes, perfectly packaged.\n\nI am a big fan of the nutella\/banana combo and Cafe Paris does it just right: not skimpy on the nutella, but not so much that it kills the bananas.  The crepes here are also excellent: good texture, slightly sweet, and hot off the griddle.\n\nAll in all - an excellent place to stop for a sweet bite.
