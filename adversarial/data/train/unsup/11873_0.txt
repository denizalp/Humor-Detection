I came here EARLY Saturday morning around 2am. We were able to sweet talk our way to free entry for 7 seven girls which was pretty awesome. \n\nThe music was still awesome. But where did all the people go? The place was clearing up at 3am. Perhaps it was getting late and that's normal now, considering that the Wynn's neighbor building Encore, has a new, HUGE club named XS now?!!
