Bust out those vintage Nike sneakers that you haven't worn since high school and impress your fellow urban dancers with your Dougie, the Robot, the Carlton, or better yet, the WORM. \n\nAt any rate, Bar Smith is your destination for your Hip-Hop dancing needs!  \n\nThere is absolutely nothing fancy or pretentious about this venue.  It is clear as mud once you enter this urban night spot.  People come here to dance, groove, bounce to whatever lyrical rhyme that spits out of those loud, rumbling speakers!\n\nIf you are looking to battle, there is no shame in doing so! The vibe here is incredibly welcoming to all levels of dancing! If you see somebody pointing and laughing, it's probably because of your poor fashion sense.  Not hip-hop enough or something.  Or those green skinny jeans clashed with your blue socks.\n\nIf hip-hop isn't your thang, head up the stairs to the top roof where you can hear the electronic beats of house and trance music.  Don't be surprised if there's a giant circle formed to see who has the most creative techno moves.\n\nFor once, a place where you don't have to dress or have the best moves to impress.  \n\nQuick Facts: \n\nx $5 cover.\nx Downtown.\nx Free Parking at the CityScape Garage or Metered Parking.\nx Light Rail nearby.\nx Sandwiched between 2 other dancing venues.
