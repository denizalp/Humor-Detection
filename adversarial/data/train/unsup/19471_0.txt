Yelp 100 Challenge 15' * 12\/100\n\nThey say you can only joke about a bad experience after a certain length of time. It's been a month since I paid over $100 for an all-you-can-eat for 2 and looking back, it taught me a few things.\n\nMy friend and I are currently on the hunt for great sushi places in town and this being the closest to our homes, we made it our first stop. I have fond memories of the previous sushi place that took up this space and for some reason, I was expecting the same quality food and service. \n\nAfter having waited about 10-15 minutes for a seat in a half empty restaurant, we approached the hostesses in haste when we saw more recent customers led to a table before us. We had a young female server that busy Friday night. Famished from work, we were ready to go on a devouring spree which started with a plate of edamame. The fun began with their specialty rolls such as the red rock, red dragon, and surf 'n' turf - my favorite. The surf 'n' turf consisted of a thin slice of rib eye steak placed above the roll and a shrimp tempura tucked inside. Great combination topped with eel sauce, if I remember well.\n\nThings went downhill from there. We should've just eaten all the sushi we wanted before getting dessert. Back then, I didn't know if 1 dessert per person was the rule of thumb for all sushi buffets but it certainly shocked us when our server gave us our check after crème brûlée. We gave over half in cash and said to charge the rest on my card but the whole amount was charged on my card and the cash was also taken in. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and thought it might have been a flimsy mistake. After getting in touch with the manager, our cash was refunded, but only after much hassle to the restaurant and ourselves. \n\nThe food quality was good but some improvement could be made to service. Might come back again.
