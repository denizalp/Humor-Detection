LifeMark Physiotherapy acts like the Statue of Liberty to whacked out tendons, atrophied muscles and ruptured menisci. While the Statue of Liberty's treatment of the huddled,  homeless, tired and poor masses is uneven at best, LifeMark's care of a banged up body is anything but. \n\nA few family members have been visiting LifeMark for a while now, to take care of inflamed joints and to recuperate from tears and other ruptures. It's amazing how little thought we give to the complex mechanics underneath the dermis.\n\nThe care and treatment that the physiotherapists have meted to my family is exceptional and each time after a visit, it's like their bodies have gotten a new lease on life. Needless to say, the people working at LifeMark are incredibly professional, well trained and excel at their craft. It's impressive, what the physiotherapists are able to accomplish in brief 30 min appointments. \n\nI recommend LifeMark to the wanna be Nadals with tendonitis in their knees, wanna be Michael Jacksons who want to lock and pop but can't and to the few sensible persons who act in accord with the dictum that one is supposed to treat one's body as though it were a temple.\n\nThis location has crazy long hours, so you can pop in at 7 am before work or at 8 pm after. Speaking of locations, LifeMark is spread out across the country a la Swiss Chalet but with infinitely better products. They specialize in a whole range of services to make your body feel less aggravated.\n\nLifeMark is a tad pricey, but the relief that your body experiences is priceless.
