We ate here last night and really enjoyed it.  We'll be adding Ling and Louie's to our restaurant rotation.\n\nThink of this place as a step up from Pei Wei and you'll be just about right on the money.  We started with the potstickers which were definitely better than what you get at Pei Wei.  My wife had the meat loaf which I tasted - it was excellent.  I had the sizzling chicken and pork which was also quite good.  She had a Mai Thai and I had Kirin Ichiban draft.  Both drinks were great.\n\nFun atmosphere.  Casual.  We sat next to the kitchen and really enjoyed the smells.\n\nCons:  The fried rice wasn't anything special, though it was ok.  The brown rice wasn't *good* brown rice - was dry.  Next time I think we'll be happy with the white rice.\n\nIf you're sick of the same few places like we are, and you're looking for something a bit nicer than Pei Wei with full wait service, a full bar and better food, this is a great spot.  The prices are a bit more than Pei Wei as well, but not much.\n\nI'm looking forward to going back to try some of the other dishes.
