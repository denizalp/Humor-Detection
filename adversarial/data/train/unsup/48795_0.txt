I had my first cut at this barber shop yesterday. I came prepared with cash. I went in on a Saturday morning, which was pretty busy. All four barbers were working. I ended up waiting about an hour, but it was worth it. (If a place is busy, it's usually a good sign, I say.) Jorge cut my hair, long on top, tapered on bottom, natural part. It was excellent. He also introduced me to some good pomade.\n\nAtmosphere is great. Traditional barbershop, great music, ESPN on TV. I was very pleased with my haircut, and I'll definitely be back. Downtown Henderson is a long drive for me, but this barbershop makes it worth it. Great work!
