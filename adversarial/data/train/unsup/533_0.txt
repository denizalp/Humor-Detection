New location alert!!!\n\nThe official grand opening is on May 9, 2018! I stopped by today, a few days before the opening, when I drove by and saw people in line. Whoa, had to stop and check it out... turns out they had a soft opening and I was able to get my favorite coffee. Bonus that I also saw some of my favorite Dutch peeps who transferred to this new location.\n\nI was told there will be $1 drinks on the day of the grand opening!\n\nThis location has more parking and more room for cars to line up in the drive through. I did not see posted hours but I have heard this location will not be 24\/7. No worries, Dutch Bros takes care of their customers and I am sure they will have hours that accommodate early risers.\n\nEnjoy... the super friendly service, caring folks AND delicious coffee!
