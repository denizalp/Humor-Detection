**~THE GOOD~**\n\nIf you love bubble tea and tired of drinking it from the same old boring cups, Royaltea managed to bring it to another level - by serving it in custom lightbulb containers. \n\nI tried the Lightbulb Matcha Bubble Tea with Mousse. It didn't taste artificial and the mousse added a rich creamy salty flavour that made it a unique drink. The tapioca pearls were chewy, big and not gooey.  I also love that I can bring home the plastic  lightbulb cup souvenir as it was pretty cute.\n\nYou also have the option to customize your drink based on sugar (no sugar\/less sugar, etc) or ice options (no ice\/less ice\/half ice). \n\n\n**~THE BAD~**\n\nI paid $7.68 for the regular lightbulb matcha bbt which I think is overpriced. Normally a regular matcha bbt with mousse will only costs you around 6 bucks in other stores. So basically you're really paying for the lightbulb on top of the regular bbt price.  The portion in the lightbulb is also smaller \nas I still wasn't satisfied after. \n\nThe place is small and tucked away downstairs. Came around 2 pm on a weekday and despite being the only one, wasn't greeted by the 2 staff. They were busy doing something and talking and it took a long time before they acknowledge my presence and asked for my order. After taking my order, took another 10 mins before I was finally given my bbt. The staff here were also unfriendly and unhelpful when trying to ask some questions.\n\nIn spite of this I will still come back to the store as they have unique flavours and I want to try their Galaxy layered tea next time.
