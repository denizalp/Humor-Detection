Went here with 2 of my best old school yelper buddies for a Shrove Tuesday pancake feast.\n\nI had a small order of blueberry pancakes ($6) with a side of delicious bacon (cured in house!) and a fried egg. Pancakes were quite good, bacon was awesome and the fried egg was just a fried egg.\n\nOur server was delightful and gay.\n\nI would go back for bacon.
