I went here just after Christmas so I didn't think I'd be able to stuff myself anymore with such rich foods - I was wrong. The only reservation we could get that night (this was a Thursday) was for 9pm. Because it was so late, a lot of their dishes had sold out for the night  (tip: reserve early!) but the foods we did end up ordering were simply amazing. I had ordered the 'Wild Boar, Spareribs, Tripe and Meatballs on soft Polenta'...didn't think I was a fan of tripe, but you can't even taste it in this meatball goodness. If there was a model for meatballs, I think they should use Campagnolo's as the model. It was thick. Juicy. Big. Melts in your mouth goodness (who knew I'd say that about a meatball!). My aunt ordered the 'House-made Spaghetti a L'Amatriciana', which if I could remember correctly (meatball brain!) had oysters and home-smoked bacon. This too was such a homey and rich dish. My cousin ordered the risotto, while it tasted pretty good I didn't think it was tooooo special (like the other two dishes). Portions were pretty big. They also have a a fully stocked bar, and lots of specialty cocktails available. Good selection of wine and beer as well. \n\nI don't even like Italian foods that much, but this place just gave me faith.\nThey change their menu every few weeks or so, so I think the only solution here is go. And go often.
