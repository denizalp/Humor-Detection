I've been to Topgolf about 3 times now. I love going it is so much fun. Just being able to go with your friends and play a game at a \"driving range\" is fun. I love finding an excuse to go.\n\nYes I am raving about this place and only give it 4 stars. It's cause service is slow. If you don't order drinks right away, don't expect to see your server or any drinks for 10 minutes. Considering that people are paying by the hour 10 minutes is 15% of your time (if you are there for an hour). I usually go in the middle of the day, so I don't think its too crowded eithere to where this can be warranted. \n\nYou don't really notice that when its your turn to hit, but if you are sitting there waiting for your turn, its nice to have a drink in hand.
