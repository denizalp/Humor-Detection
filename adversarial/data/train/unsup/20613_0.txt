There's only about 18 seats at the Oyster Bar, so come early unless you want to wait for a seat to open up.  Not that waiting is an issue with Oyster Bar...waiting is just a necessary prelude for a dynamic finale, namely the food.  Any wait time for good food is excusable.  It's better to wait for good food for an hour or two then to eat at an establishment that serves mediocrity.\n\nMy brother found this place on Yelp.  I really want to thank my brother and all the Yelpers that submitted honest reviews of this place to make us come here.  The food is simply...amazing!  Thanks everybody!  I really want to keep this place hush hush but seems like I'm too late, the word has already spread around Yelp that Oyster Bar is the real deal.  Surprise, surprise, we sat next to some Yelpers and people who came because of the Yelp reviews of Oyster Bar, today, during lunch.  It's a small world after all...\n\nFirst off, do yourself a favor and order the reasonably priced Fanny Bay oysters for $16.99.  It's hard to see that price for Fanny Bay anywhere else.  Secondly, as you're waiting for whatever delicious entree you ordered, munch on that awesome bread they gave you.  Ask for more bread for later to dip on your Palace Pan Roast ($22.99).  They offer you a heat level of 1 through 10.  Don't go showing off now!  A 7 is pretty hot already.  The cook and waiter told us stories of many people who couldn't handle a 10.  Don't be that guy!  We also had the Seafood Jambalaya ($23.99) at a level 6.  Just enough heat without losing the overall flavor.  In a nutshell, the food here is awesome, especially the Palace Pan Roast.  Most people usually lose when going to Las Vegas, don't you lose out by not coming to Oyster Bar!
