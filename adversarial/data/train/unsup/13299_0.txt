Had to try them -- after so many years in Charlotte with a dearth of quality donuts. Verdict? They taste wholesome, insofar as a donut can. The raised dough is a good texture, the chocolate on the chocolate donuts is super-chocolatey. The salted caramel was actually a little more salty than caramel-y. That said, I might just be getting too old for foods like this, because I ate two donuts and felt like I might really have damaged myself. They're big, be warned. Would (cautiously) eat again, though!
