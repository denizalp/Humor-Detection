By far, the worst internet cafe I've gone to. I hate the smell of cigarettes and in less than an hour, The smell is all over my clothes. I even asked for the inside smoke-free rooms. There was a cigarette holder inside the room? Like wtf? The chairs are all broken too. The ventilation is horrible. I would never want to go back to this place. It dried out my eyes and now I am having a difficult time breathing. All the lights are shut off too. I can't even see the keyboard.
