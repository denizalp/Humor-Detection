WHAT TO TRY??\n\nIf you're a fan of lamb, try their house noodle because their house noodle has braised lamb and fried egg on top of the sliced beef, tripe and chicken! Quite a load of goodness. \n\nI also recommend the beef brisket noodle if you're a fan or beef brisket because of briskets' tenderness! And you get quite ALOT of beef too. \n\nEach bowl is pretty big for one person. ALOT of noodle too!! (I couldn't even finish the noodle!) and the best thing yet is you get to choose between hand pulled noodle, hand shaved noodle or rice noodle. \n\nIf you pick the hand pulled noodle, they pull the noodle on the spot fresh for you :O. Generally speaking the broth has a nice flavor that you may or may not have had at other restaurants. \n\nThe popcorn chicken was tasty too but the size of the popcorn chicken was on the smalle. \n\nThe scallion fried pancake however didn't have much taste though. There were bits of green onion in the pancake but not much flavor.\n\nLAST TIP?!\n\nRmb to test around the different noodle size to see what size you like. Typically the standard size is a good size to go with in terms of balance between chewiness and texture. But if you want to go thinner than that, you can or if you want to go thicker than that, you can too!!! Up to three strands thicker. There's also different widths of noodle to choose from too. A bowl is a good size for one person but if you can get by with sharing with another person too if you don't think you can eat the whole bowl!
