Excellent, friendly service.  Unpretentious menu.  They have very good fish.  \n\nI don't know that I would call it \"new American\" dining though.  It has a very old school vibe and while the food is good, it isn't extremely inventive, which is part of the appeal to me.  I don't know that I would go out of my way to dine here with my husband or a younger crowd, but it is a great place to go with extended family for a nice occasion.
