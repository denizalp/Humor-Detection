This place is awesome for dessert. They a huge variety of different popsicles or \"diamond bars\" and fun toppings you can add to them. It's perfect for a hot summer day in the valley. The staff is very friendly and can help you make a decision when it comes to deciding on a combination. After the first bite you can tell the popsicles are made fresh. We ordered a hazelnut diamond bar with chocolate drizzle and peanuts. That combo was foodgasm good!!
