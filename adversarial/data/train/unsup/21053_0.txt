Our server was Pedro, his service was really good. We couldn't find him to get refills for my husbands drink one time but he did get our quick service for our favorites; filet minion and lamb. Pedro was professional, attentive. He always had a smile on his face, thank you Pedro. Pedro gets a $30 tip. Be like Pedro.\n\nThe salad bar is phenomenal. I especially loved their jasmine rice and sushi. Everything is fresh and delicious.\n\nThe meat were all very tasty. Tender, juicy and just so mouthwatering (orgasm in my mouth type of deal) I fasted all day just for this. The leg of lamb was a bit rare for me, but everything else was delectable and outstanding. \n\nWe had a little room for desert, as for chocolate lovers we had the chocolate mouse, it was dark but not too dark it was perfect.\n\nI have enjoyed every one of my visits here. Thank you for making my husbands first time here enjoyable and making our date night memorable. Spending the money in this was so worth it.
