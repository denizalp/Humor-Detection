I have been to this UMC location at least 3 times since moving here to Las Vegas. 2 out of the 3 visits have been very quick, and from the minute I walked in to the time I left took under an hour (both happened to be when I dropped in in the morning). My first visit, came in the early afternoon, was the one that took what I felt was an excruciatingly long wait time in the lobby (might have also been the middle of flu season). Based on my limited observation, I would still recommend (if possible) timing your visit for as early in the day as possible, to avoid spending 3 hours here waiting for medical care.\n\nThe staff in the front may not be the friendliest, but I was never treated rudely, so I have no complaints. Can the front office staff be better? Yes, there are much room for improvement.\n\nThe nurses and doctors working here are friendly, knowledgeable and caring. If you have questions or concerns, they still take the time to address them. So as much as I hate having to visit a doctor's office, coming here and being treated professionally and with dignity by the medical staff here is as pleasant of an experience as one could hope for.\n\nDo they always get the diagnosis right?  That would probably be no. But for the basic medical emergencies, you should be in good hands here.  For the tougher medical conditions, they will always refer you to follow up with specialists.\n\nOverall a 3.5ish rating.
