The food is good but the service was horrible the guy making my taco made 3 mistake because he was too busy dancing and playing around and the cashier was very rude she has no customer service I had to repeat myself 4 times to tell her what I had also she did know what a plastic bag was until the bar lady told that I needed a plastic bag very rude. I will no return there any more.
