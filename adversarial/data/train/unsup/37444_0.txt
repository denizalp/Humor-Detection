What an amazing Italian bakery! They have numerous dessert options (cakes, cannolis, cookies, croissants etc.).and hot food items but last week, I really wanted cannolis from here and their arancini balls stuffed with meat. \n\nTheir cannolis came in regular and large sizes - of course we wanted the large size and it seems most customers do since one of the staff offered to make large ones for me since there weren't any left in the display case. The cannolis were delicious - crispy shell filled with luscious cream that wasn't too sweet. Even my non-dessert craving husband really enjoyed them!\n\nTheir arancini meatballs were also delicious, even though we had them the next day for lunch. It was stuffed generously with rice, meat, some veggies and savoury tomato sauce. \n\nHighly recommend this place and will be back for sure next time we're in the area!!! Can't wait to try their other desserts and hot food items!
