Just had lunch here.  Food was decent. I suggest the French Onion Soup, best thing we had. The red sangria was decent... a little sweet, but decent. Rest of food was pretty good but not life-changing.\n\nService was slow... very slow. It took us 2 hours to get through a simple lunch.\n\nAlso, they didn't take AMEX.  This is a pet peeve for me at this point. If you're a business who doesn't allow customers to pay with whatever their preferred form of payment is, I'm not coming back to give you my business...  who the heck doesn't take AMEX in a high tourist area these days???
