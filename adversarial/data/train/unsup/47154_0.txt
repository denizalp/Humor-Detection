Complete lack of customer service. I came in 20 minutes before closing to get a quick pair of glasses before the new year. With 5 minutes I had narrowed it down between 2 $320 -$350 glasses and the manager told me she would pull up my information to ring me out tomorrow. Mind you they still have 15 minutes before the store closes. This is the place for you if you like lazy associates that don't care about making a sale.
