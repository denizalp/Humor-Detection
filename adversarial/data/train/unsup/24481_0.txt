I love the look of this place. So open and fresh. The indoor\/outdoor bar seems so perfect with their relaxed, dog friendly patio. Complete with bags! The servers are friendly and their music is good. The menu looks tasty and slightly higher end. \n\nThen you sit down on their uncomfortably tiny chairs. Is my butt supposed to be that tiny? I'm not a large woman, but we did see two couples attempt to be seated at similar tables to ours that were... as soon as they were down, they were being resat. In the meantime, we ordered two drinks and an appetizer. We had been looking forward to a good happy hour all day! Oh wait, it's Friday, no happy hour here. Dang. The drinks came out quickly, so we entertained ourselves by watching the employees clamoring behind the food counter while we waited on the Caprese Grove Style. We had a lot to watch. I think the employees may have equated the customers, so I'm not entirely sure what they were running around or chatting about. After too long, we asked about our caprese and it appeared. The balsamic was very tasty, but the prosciutto was surprisingly dry. I was disappointed. The mac and cheese bites were just as dry and bland as the prosciutto, though their cheese sauce did help. But along with our tiny chairs, we had a tiny round table. With our two appetizers, we almost had to take off the salt and pepper shakers and decorative flower in order to eat. WAY too cramped. It made us have second thoughts about ordering a meal. And so, we were out.\n\nI think if the food quality went up and more comfortable seating arrangements, this place could soar! I'm thinking your cooks are still getting used to the menus, so I'll give you that as reason for your slow ticket times. Please, please make me want to come back, Modern Grove. You're in the perfect location for me. I'd like to see you succeed, but not like this.
