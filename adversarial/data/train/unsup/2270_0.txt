I have used Truly Nolen for a couple of years already. I have not seen one critter in or around my house in Scottsdale. I even got a $25 debit card from them for referring a neighbor to them. They will send you a postcard in advance as a courtesy when they are scheduled to treat your property. The technicians actually have people skills. So if you got scorpions or other such critters, give Truly Nolen a call.
