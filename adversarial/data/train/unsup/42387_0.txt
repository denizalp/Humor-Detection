Really weird experience.   Tom Jones owner and rep came to give an estimate and it seemed up front. But I asked about financing and he told me to hit the link on their website.  Turns out they were NOT an approved vendor, also turns out they only do owner occupied (he knew I didn't live there- talked about other owners of investment properties that used their services).\nSo I applied .. Took a hit on my credit and was of course denied because they have no agreement with them. Contacted Tom Jones.  He said it's a mistake ...you can apply again by Monday..  By Tuesday I asked if he had straightened anything out.   He declared he had dealt with this company for  7 to 8 years with no problem.  i contacted  them by phone.   They had NOOO idea who this company was!   \n\nSooo I said ok..I will find other financing , but Tom Jones said NO...  We won't continue.\nIt was a $6500 contract.  Not chump change in most people's budgets.  Not sure what kind of scam operation they are running, but it is definitely a scam!!
