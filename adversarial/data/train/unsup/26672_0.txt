What an amazing time. Came here with a large group of friends for my brother in laws birthday. We did the 'mad scientist' challenge. \n\nThe employees are very attentive to your progress and slip clues under the door right as you need them. Really nice too - they all seem genuinely excited about your victory at the end (or, perhaps, imprisonment?)  I would recommend this place to *anyone* wanting a great time and to explore their brains a bit. :)
