I have been stalking 9091 Taco (a play on the Korean \"gogi\") since they first started revamping the old Sexxxpresso location.   I noticed that they finally looked open for business today when I came into work, so naturally I had to stop by for lunch.\n\nRight now, it's walk-up or drive through (possible seating area to come) and their menu even says that they deliver!\n\nThey do tacos, burritos, tortas, and bibimbap (listed as Bi Bop Salad on the menu).  Some items (at least the Bi Bop and Torta) appear to be served with a side of sweet potato fries.  And to clarify, I mean sweet \"potato fries\" not \"sweet potato\" fries.... more on that later.\n\nAll items come with the protein of your choice (beef, chicken or tofu) and can be regular or spicy.  \n\nI asked about the veganness of the bread for tortas, but the guy wasn't sure and suggested I get the tofu Bi Bop Salad, which definitely had no animal products.  (The burrito has sour cream and cheese, but that could probably be left off.)  So, several vegetarian options, and a few vegan ones. lots of meat choices, of course.\n\nThe Bi Bop came with rice, lettuce, carrots, mushrooms, spinach, zucchini, sprouts and marinated cubed tofu.  Served with a side of gojuchang and a sweet soy sauce and oddly, salsa.  All sauces were very good.  The \"salad\"didn't look like a whole lot of food, but along with the side of fries, I was pretty full at the end ($8.99 for Bi Bop, comes with fries).  \n\nSo, the fries - tasty but weird.  They are super super thin cut, like matchsticks.  They are pale yellow like regular potato fries, but very sweet.  Almost like they took regular potatoes and added sugar.  It's probably some kind of yam or something though, because that would be really strange to just sugar up some potatoes.  \n\nMy friend got the meat torta ($6.99)and gave it a thumbs up.  \n\nBottom line - it was tasty and provides a nice vegan option for a quick lunch that is within walking distance for me.  I will probably be a regular customer.
