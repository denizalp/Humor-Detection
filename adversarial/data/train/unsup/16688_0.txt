The word is orgasmic. If Tuna Melt at Fran's will make you forget your mother's name... Nadege will make you forget your name. I ordered cafe americano and Nadege's is one of the best. There's a bunch of mini dessert  you can choose from - everything is delicious. \n\nThe ambience is heaven-like... literally. The all white concept provides an aura of cleanliness and of huge halls. Looks like a MOMA installation. Is this Toronto? Yes it is! \n\nThe service is also impeccable. Once you place your order and after paying at the cash, they bring your order to the table ... on a plate. Servers are all friendly. \n\nI will definitely come back.
