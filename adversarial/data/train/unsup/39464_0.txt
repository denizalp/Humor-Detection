Since I moved to Charlotte I've been looking for an all you can eat sushi lunch special. I loved the one in my college town and I haven't found one like it yet, but this is a pretty close second. I prefer the made to order all you can eat style but this buffet is pretty good! Usually people hear sushi buffet and immediately think yuck I'm gonna get sick but that's not true with this place. Lunch is always busy and the sushi never sits on the buffet longer than 10 minutes, goes like hot cakes. They put out a good variety including specialty rolls and the quality is good. This isn't 5 star gourmet sushi or anything but it's definitely good for the price of 11.95 for lunch. Definitely give it a try, might have to wait for a table and the service is ok,but considering it's a buffet there's not much to do unless your ordering off the menu. I'm excited to try it for dinner sometime!
