I got the chicken kabob and they were very small pieces of chicken.  Way tooooo many tomatoes in my salad.  Wanted to sample the salad and was told they don't do samples.  Mind you we just brought two platters.  We asked for a water cup and he told us the bottle water was $1 but u have water on the fountain????
