Horrible place. The servers Always stand around gossiping and I think the manager, tall blonde, has the most annoying laugh, it echoes throughout the restaurant, especially after her shift when she drinks at the bar. Doesn't make your dinner very enjoyable. Also, the conversations at the bar and the language used when all the servers gather after shifts is pretty nauseating. All they do is trash talk other staff members and swear. \n\nDon't come here if you want to listen to trash mouths and irritating laughs. Go somewhere else if you want to enjoy your night out.
