3-times to Ox & Angela for 3 different reasons and each time was solid, solid, solid!! Here's 3 different situations where Ox & Angela is going to be the right place for you.\n\n1: Family Birthday Dinner - Went here with my two sisters to celebrate all of our birthdays as they're all somewhat close to each other. We wanted to treat ourselves to something nice, eat great food and buys lots of wine. Ox & Angela has a dividing wall through the middle and sections the restaurant into a more lounge style right side and a more restaurant style left side. It was a dinner so we opted for the left. For food we went with the Spanish Table. It's $45\/person and has way more courses than I can remember. I'm so happy that we ordered this for a few reasons. Everything was fan-freaking-tastic, is one of the big reasons, and the second is that we got to embark on the food adventure together. D'aww! You know when you're out for dinner, everyone is having a good, the food arrives and the conversation come to a complete halt with everyone stuffing their face with their separate, massive orders. O&A isn't like that. With everyone eating the same thing at the same time, you get to \"ooooohh\" and then \"ahhhhh\", and then \"mmmmm\" in unison. \n\nDinner becomes a conversation starter instead of a conversation ender. From family meals to dinner dates, the social style of eating at Ox & Angela makes for a truly enjoyable experience. Oh, and did I mention the food is fan-freaking-tastic!\n\n2: First date!!! - Did you know this internet thing has ways of introducing you to other people that you can meet in real life (or the \"RL\" as all the cool kids are calling it)?! Fancy, right? And now you find out that you were apparently charming enough to get someone to meet you in person, but they still don't know much about you - where you choose to go can speak volumes. Where do you go? \n\nYou want to go somewhere with character, maybe a touch of class, but still casual enough for you to come as you are (I'm speaking as if my choices are reflective of most people and I can assure you they are not, but read on..) that is decently low commitment if things aren't working out, but will be enough entertainment if they are.\nCheck out the right side of Ox & Angela and check out their cocktails. They're delicious, creative, and make for good conversation starters.. especially at no less than 2 oz a piece to help you up your people skills.
