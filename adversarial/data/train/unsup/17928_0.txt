Let me start by saying I am a huge fan of the Dave and Busters concept.. my issue comes down to the way I was educated on the best solution that fit my needs .. they have this power play combo that is a \"special\" here is the thing I was told it's a Great deal! After the damn worker at front counter took my $25 for the power card I purchase plus I tipped her $5 .. after which she mentions the special and made it out as if I can just pay $10 to get the deal..\n\nEnter in my date arriving , sitting down and we got Phil as our server .. he's awesome if you're in there and here is too definitely seek him out .. he sat down next to me to explain the process and promos ... problem is what I was told at the front didn't work the way the First Lady explained .. now remember I'm a female on a date I am not looking to escalate or rock the boat but Phil did try to remedy and fix my issue by offering to seek a manager to adjust it but as I said .. I'm being taken out and trying to enjoy my company so I figured I'd save it for the review but I did advise Phil ( who was awesome about taking the feedback and offering to pass it forward ) that it really turned me off to the idea of eating food or sticking around . So what happened because the girl at the front made me feel scammed ? \n\nWhen my date offered to add more money on the power up card , I was ready to leave .. they could of had a huge meal and drinks plus more money spent on games had full disclosure and proper training and team work been in place..\n\nI hope next time I go they have it together and make sure their power card sales folks educate about the combos...\n\nThe games are fun especially the 3D game but.. yeah I can't speak to the food yet
