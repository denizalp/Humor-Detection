Lunch time is now good munch time at Kyara! When I heard they were open for lunch, I was there the next day. The menu is very simple and very cheap (everything is under $10). They have teriyaki, katsu, Japanese curry, sashimi, and they are offered in a combination lunch that comes with rice, miso soup, salad, and tempura (including two large shrimp). For $8.95 this is a delicious steal. I had the chicken katsu, and it was perfect- golden and crispy. I almost felt guilty for spending so little in such beautiful environs. Service was kind. If you do lunches, add this to your list.
