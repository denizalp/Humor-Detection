I do have my own mechanic but due to the distance, I looked up one closer to my work and having driven around to \"shop\" for pricing, I ended up calling them for an appointment. Spoke to Greg and booked the appointment same day. Dropped off the car didn't expect much except for what needs to be done. Mind you I am very particular with my cars so I'll know if they have done a good job or not. \n\nWhen I picked up the car, Greg actually told me they have done more than what I've asked for as there were more needed, but billed me the same price and he put down what else are having deficiencies so I'm aware of what may come next. \n\nOverall, super friendly, know what they do and don't scam people. I wish there are more mechanics like them!
