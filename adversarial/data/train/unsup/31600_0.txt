Fun 'n' Jump came through for my son's High School Homecoming event at the last minute. They were easy to work with, very professional, accommodating, and most of all gave the students  memorable  days. There equipment was very durable and good quality able to with stand high schoolers.  \nI would HIGHLY recommend!!!
