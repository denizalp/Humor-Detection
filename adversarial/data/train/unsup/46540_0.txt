Great gelatos. \nThis is one of the best spots in town. \nThey have a great patio for a nice and relaxing chat on a summer night. \n\nGreat flavors and the quality is superb. \nMust try the pear flavor which is hard to come by. Hazelnut is to die for. \n\nThey are also open during the winter with a welcome addition of hot choco. \n\nThey only get 3 stars because some of the younger employees need training in customer service and manners. But aside from this, the quality of the gelato and the flavors they have available is second to none.
