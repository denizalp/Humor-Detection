It was the first best ramen restaurant in Vegas before Jinya and sora. Those 3 can compete. \nI love their cold noodle with miso dressing, can't get it anywhere else, the pork belly bowl and their fried rice is to die for. \nTalk about service, it was ok, never special. Anyway, for me it just about food.
