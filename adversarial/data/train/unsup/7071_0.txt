3.5 stars Solid little coffee spot near OCAD\n\nWith mostly white washed walls and soothing interior, it has a bit of a zen vibe to it.  The tiles on the floor say standing room only and ... it's kinda true.  There are 4 little wooden stumps re-purposed beautifully and sit around small little tables.  There's another little spot in the back for another 2.  I would say its more towards take out but you could sit for a little while to enjoy your cup.\n\nWith much attention to ingredients (they even mention the farm with the milk comes from), they do try to provide the best cup for you.  They source directly from a dairy provider, use Sweet Bloom for their beans, and a matcha from Japan.  I think this is quite good but I do have to wonder why they didnt source from some very good Canadian roasters.  Toronto has quite a few and I do know there are many good ones across the country.  Service here is prompt, polite, and thoughtful.  Our cups were immediately made and with care.  \n\nFlat White - Less sour than our most recent flat whites, this one was more fruity but still carrying a decent amount of sourness.  I would say it was not as rich tasting or smooth as I would like it.  I think the very strong fruit flavour made it taste more citrus sour than anything else.  3.5\/5\n\nMatcha Latte - Rich with matcha, this lightly bitter latte was a nice vivid green.  Definitely not on the watery side and frothed nicely.  It was quite creamy and richer in texture compare to other places. 4\/5\n\nCute spot and if I'm in the area again, I could see myself trying it again.
