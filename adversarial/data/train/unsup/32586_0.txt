I only head to this mall because they are the closest Rue 21 store.  Right now the mall seems to be torn up due to some construction of the floors.  Maybe they're upgrading?  What I really like about this mall is that there are plenty of stores that offer plus size options all in one place (Torrid, Maurice's, Charlotte Rousse, and the department stores, of course).  I don't mind making the trek across town to check out this mall every now and then.
