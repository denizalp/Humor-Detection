Located on McDowell Road just off the highway, this restaurant has absolutely zero curb appeal. It is very unassuming, located in a dingy, uninteresting lot in central Phoenix. \n\nSo come without your assumptions and preconceptions. \n\nLa Barquita is a lovely neighborhood Mexican restaurant rooted in southern Mexican flavors and style. And you know that when the table tops have plastic covers, you are about to get some delicious treatment. \n\nThe menu carries breakfast, lunch and dinner options, including: huevos rancheros, huevos divorclados, chorizo, nopales, taquitos, flautas, sopes, quesadillas, chimichangas, mole, carnitas, steak picado, chile verde, camarones, 7 mares and so much more. Several large pages of options. \n\nThe restaurant is seemingly known primarily for its Molcajete a la Mexicana (a sort of Mexican stew) and its b√≠rria, which is made with actual goat meat. Amazing flavor! \n\nFood servings are ginormous. For $10-15, you will have enough to feed two adults. But you likely won't want to share a plate. The flavors are fresh with a lovely complexity and depth. That goes for the birria, enchiladas and beans. \n\nOnly dings: Yes, the mole was a bit more spice-forward than chocolate, but it was hearty and luscious. The queso con carne was very cheesy and bursting with flavor, but it did not hold well when we tried to reheat it at home later. \n\nOther than that, great food, excellent service and a lovely time. Bonus: the space is large enough to cater to sizable parties, so bring your family and friends. But know that this place has no romance, so best not to go for a first, second or third date.
