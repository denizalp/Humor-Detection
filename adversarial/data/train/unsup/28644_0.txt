Great looking place, the food was OK and the service was below borderline.\n\nWent in for their breakfast, seated quickly got our beverages (ice tea and coffee) came quickly as well.  The food was... OK, but my breakfast companions eggs which were order over medium came with runny whites, and the \"hot and ready biscuit\" on their menu was like a brick.  \n\nI do not know if our server was just having a bad day, but she seemed rushed and primary concern was anything but waitressing.  She was non-existent after just dropping our plates off at the table and we could hear her talking with someone else about txt'ing schedule changes.  This conversation went on for 10 minutes at least, at no point did she come back to check on us or refill drinks.  \n\nWe waited another 15 minutes for our server to reappear and mentioned the rock hard biscuit, which she comp'd our drinks (a small carafe of coffee and a large ice tea which were $5!!!) on the ticket.\n\nI appreciate the customer service at the end but it was a little too late.  Food was nothing to be excited about, beverages over-priced and the staff inattentive, will not be going back.
