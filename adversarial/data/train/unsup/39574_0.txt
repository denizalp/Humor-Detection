My boyfriend tore his ACL and had been seen by a physical therapy for a few sessions. Because he was unhappy with his precious physical therapist, we decided to look into Anthem Physical Therapy and we do not regret it one bit!\n\nEverything about this place is amazing. The staff and Dr. Snow are extremely helpful, supportive and friendly. They truly care about their patients. \n\nI would definitely recommend this place if you are in need of physical therapy!
