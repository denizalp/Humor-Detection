Thanks to Lamborghini of Las Vegas (this is a not accurate when they are based in Henderson!) I sold my 2010 Lamborghini 560-4 Spyder to a Lambo dealer in CA and I will never own another Lambo.  Terrible and arrogant sales manager basically laughed at me when I called him about a trade difference on a new Aventador LP-700 saying there was no market for my car and he did not have any Aventadors unless I paid him $80,000 over the already absurd list price of $400,000 range.  I own a new Ferrari California I bought from the Penske-Wynn Las Vegas dealer and Tony  the sales person and Rich the service manager are beyond awesome, opposite of these jerks.  Also the Ferrari is far superior compared to the Lambo with better dual clutch transmission, far nicer interior, vastly superior technology in the GPS, monitoring LCDS and far superior sound system plus a hard top conv for about the same price as my prior Lambo.  I will never sell or trade my Ferrari California but when I decide to buy another amazing sports car it will be a new Ferrari when they come out with a new model to blow away the Aventador!\n\nWayne Gorsek
