Downsview park\/parc is a place in transition.   There is construction, community gardens\/greenhouses, a huge market, waking\/running\/biking trails, soccer, basketball, Etc. the new-ish park is lovely and I have enjoyed it many times.  Walking or running its also just a beautiful place to hang out and have a picnic and j have done all 3.  Lovely views and full of people enjoying it.  The bathrooms are always clean which is a huge plus.
