Been here with my sister quite a few times , but i experienced the worst service ever today . We got our table fast , but after we done look at the menu and kept waiting and waiting for our server to stop by to take our order, end up we had to call 1 of the server was busy cleaning a table with no one waiting in line . He came to us with an attitude like \" what u want today?\" . We ordered our food plus a togo later . The whole time, no one come and check on us, they missing my soup , my sister water cup was empty the whole time, and after we done eating, we tried  to get  our bill and i made eyes contact with 2 of the servers and they looked at me then look away ... We were continuing waiting for another 10 mins till the point i had to come up to one of them and ask can i talk to the manager please and with in 1 minute , the manager arrived our table . I told him what happened and all he said is , oh cause we busy so its the way how they work here ... Me and my sister have nothing else to say anymore.... \nWe asked for our togo an they said \" oh its not ready , you have to wait for it. We ordered it before we got our food and now we done eating and it still not done . \n Will not come back to this place ... Horrible services and poor management skill.
