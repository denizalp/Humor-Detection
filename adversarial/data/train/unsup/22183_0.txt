Great food choices with many different items you will not find everywhere. The fish and chips were very good and they give you the option of Cod or Seabass. I had the Seabass and enjoyed it very much. Service was a bit rushed but good. Many restaurants ask if you want dessert before you are finished with your dinner and I do not like that. I want to go back and try the Lamb stew. Worth a visit. Three bars in a large multi room restaurant so seating is quick at rush time if you are willing to sit at the bar. Give it a try!
