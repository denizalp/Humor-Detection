This has to be the most POORLY MANAGED rental car center in the country (deserve 0 stars)!  \n-Name was NOT on the Fast Break board, as a result no car ready.\n-Had to wait to speak to Fast Break counter person, he was nice but did not have a car to give and could not find my contract!\n-Finally told contract must be in the car, went to car, NOTHING THERE!\n-Spoke to an assistant manager who agreed to help (after the second ask).  She realized I was not getting anywhere.\n-She had me sit in car and drive up to booth to wait, after 25 MINS! I finally got to leave and was told manager would call me and \"take care of the rental\" due to the \"unacceptable\" circumstances.\n-Upon checking car back in I was told that I had to go to the counter because they COULDN'T CHECK ME IN?! (WHAT??!!).  I took one look at the Fast Break line that was 10 people deep and went upstairs, that main line was out of the Budget area - I left, not wasting more time on this establishment that clearly does not care about me.\n-NO phone call from manager, NO discount on the rental.\n-On line with customer service as i write this, they had the nerve to offer me COUPONS!  Haha! no thanks, they will not be getting my business again. \n-Ultimately the customer service person gave me a 25% discount on the rental and some coupons (that I won't use). She was nice enough, but wow, bad spot for her to have to deal with.
