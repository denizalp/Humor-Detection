The pizza here is definitely quality. We had two pizzas when we came. Nice thin crust with the wood fire taste. Delicious! My only gripe is the prices. While I'll pay extra for good pizza, they also charged $2 for two tiny Cokes. While that's typical in Italy, that's not what I expect in Avon. But enough about that. Come here for this pizza (not the Coke) and you definitely won't be disappointed.
