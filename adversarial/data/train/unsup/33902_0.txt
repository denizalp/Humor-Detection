Cleo stood out when I was looking for a nicer somewhat more upscale dinning place for a fast birthday dinner. We made a reservation through open table for 645 for two, and when we got there the place was pretty empty. \n\nThe hostess is the reason why I gave this place a 4 star, there were probably 4 tables taken in the restaurant and she sat us right by the entrance in a small table. When we asked for a table towards the back for more privacy she gave us the unwilling look, and the other employee saw her and gave her that same face back like \"they are one of those customers type of looks\". \n\nThe server recommended about 4-5 dishes to share for two people. \n\nWe got the babaganoush with the pita bread, calamari and Brussel sprouts to start. The pita bread is fresh out of oven very soft and chewy, definitely one of the best pita breads I have had. \n The calamari was delicious too, the sauce goes great with the calamari. \nIt is a must try. Brussel sprouts is my favorite food already, the way they fried the sprouts really brought out the flavor and the texture of it. \nThe second round we got the moussakah,  wagyu beef and chicken kabob, the chicken kabob was ok, but the beef one was very tender and juicy. \nIf I had to pick a favorite it would be the sprouts and least favorite would be the moussakah, it was baked and tasted very creamy. \n\nThe dessert was fig and almond panacotta. The figs we got were dried figs, weren't  fresh like shown in some of the pictures on here, but the panacotta itself was delicious.\n\nThe GM also stopped by personally to check on us. Great food place to check out if you want quick upscale food
