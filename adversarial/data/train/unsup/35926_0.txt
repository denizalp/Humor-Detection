As a customer, it is hard to know whether what you are being told is correct. I purchased a car that had an issue that I was told was fixed...and then the car stopped shifting. I called kens this morning and they said to bring it in and they would work me in. Already 3 stars for answering the phone, being quick about asking the issue and determining if they could help over the phone and then offering to work me in without an appt needed. I drove the car down and was asked what was going on. I explained the issue and what i was told previously. Instead of working me later in the day, he grabbed the scanner and told me to pull the car up front. That earns another 3 stars for starting on the problem right away and saving me an uber trip. He hooked up the scanner, went through all of the gears, turned it off and on and went through a full diagnosis right there in front of me. When he was done, he said it looks like the issue was fixed, he reset the code and said it may just need to sync up. I was satisfied with that answer, but he went further to tell me that the issue is not an internal issue, it would be external and referred me to another shop that is honest and could take a look at some other problems i am having. This gets another 4 stars because instead of letting me leave thinking if the issue starts up again, i will be out $2000, he put my mind at ease that it is an external transmission issue in one of the components and probably a rebuild will not be in my future. All of this and i was in and out within 10 minutes. I cannot believe any business would be this helpful, quick and kind. I cannot say enough good things about kens transmissions. I think i have them at 10 stars but am limited to 5 through yelp. If you are having transmission issues, please take your car here, you will not be disappointed!!!!!!
