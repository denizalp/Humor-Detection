After attending the Yelp Event, I was so impressed with Make Meaning that I thought I would bring my daughter here to try her hand at soap making.  \n\nYesterday we dragged the neighbors the 40 minute hike up to the Scottsdale Quarter with us to try it out.  \n\nMy daughter chose to make 4 oval bar soaps.  The neighbors chose to make 4 cupcake soaps.\n\nZully helped us get started, but she was a little hard to track down once she left.  At one point we waited just shy of 15 minutes after making eye contact with her before she came over.  She was VERY busy, but we just had a simple question and everyone else was helping customers.  I think it would be helpful if there were FAQ table tents.  That way customers could sort of help themselves instead of waiting clueless for no reason!  \n\nOne thing I think could also be improved is the way the cookie cutters are organized.  It would be helpful if the alphabet cookie cutters had their own 26 compartment box.  Also, having duplicates or triplicates of letters could help.  We spent several minutes looking for a particular letter only to come up short.  When we asked Zully, she said none of the kids ever put things where they are supposed to go and so it is hit or miss whether or not you will find what you seek.  That's really disappointing given what people pay to make these crafts.  \n\nUntil August 31, Experiences are 1\/2 off before 1 p.m.  This does not include the additional cost of POPs, which are priced at $1-$5 each.  They also waive the session fee of $12.\n\nWith the discount, the cost of the 4 soaps was $10 plus any POPs.  My daughter chose $5 worth of POPs, making the total pre-tax cost for four soaps $15.  Very reasonable.  \n\nI have to say that without the discount, the price is very high for this particular activity.  My receipt showed we were comped for TWO $12 session fees (meaning they would have charged me to sit there and assist my daughter as needed).  Without the $10 discount on the soaps and the $24 discount for the two session fees, the price for making the four soaps would have been $49 pre tax!  OUCH.\n\nRight now you can buy a family pass which waives the session fees for $119.  That would be worth it if you lived near enough to go often.  The pass also gives you $50 off birthday parties, 10 percent off experiences and some other perks.  \n\nWe will definitely come here again during the Summer to try candle making and jewelry making.  However, if the price point remains as high as it does, we will not be returning after the promotion is over - unless a new one starts.  \n\n5 STARS for the concept, but the place is so cost prohibitive at regular price that I have to bump it down a star.
