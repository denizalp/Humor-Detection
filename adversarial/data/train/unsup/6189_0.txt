This place has been around for several years! I'm excited Yelp is now here to leave a review!! I went in here after grocery shopping one day to get a pizza to go, mind you I said to go! Plus they are located right by Fry's grocery store! I was informed they had a dress code! After I paid & was given my order. Had someone told me before I'm sure they knew I wouldn't have bothered to spend my money on their establishment! I was 9 months Prego in summer I wanted to grab something quick & go home. I was obviously dressed well enough to be in the grocery store shopping. (I'm not the person running around in my pj's) NEVER WENT BACK NEVER PLAN TO !!
