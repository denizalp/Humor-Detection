Normally, I Love Native, but this must have been an off night for the Native, because I didn't like anything about the night. Rude non attentive waiter(can't tell you his name because he never told us). The fish(which I went in for), was not very tasty(it wasn't a Friday, so I guess that makes a difference on how the fish should taste‚Äç). Drinks tasted watered down and my beer wasn't cold. Just a bad night all around. But I Love the Native so I will give them another chance!!
