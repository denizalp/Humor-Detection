i swear, if on curb appeal alone... this place always scared me when i drove passed it... but something had to keep the peeps coming back... so i decided to try it...\n\nso i walk up to the window, 2 big dudes (definitely east coasters too with their accents and attitude) asked what i would be having... i said gimme what everyone here is ordering - hes like ok: Italian Beef with peppers, onions and provolone cheese, a bag of fries, and a soda...\n\ngood laaaaawwwwddd... seriously, thats a a beef sammich - 5 star quality, it was awesome... and they arent shittin you either, it was literally a brown sack lunch bag filled with hot fried steak fries... whoa.\n\nit was awesome... so why not 5 stars? well... its on the street, and there is no sit down places, they have 2 outdoor tables but it isnt even worth it to try and sit down, crowded and dirty... cant sit on the curb because its at the intersection of lake mead and boulder, so its a real busy street with alot of dirt kicked up... the hours are what ever the two guys running the joint wants it to be, sometimes they are open late \/ sometimes they arent open at all - wtf - but thats a serious ITALIAN BEEF sammich, and well worth it if \/ when you can get it.
