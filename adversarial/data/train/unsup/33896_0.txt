Eating here is not bad. I came into this place once and had A good meal. \n\nDelivery however...BLAH AT BEST!!!\n\nI've ordered several times from these guys. Never had my food in less than 75 minutes and I'm literally across the street. EVERY TIME I order from them (which I refuse to do anymore) the food has been a mess and cold. \n\nImagine a heaping portion of garlic fries that were literally ultra soggy from the condensation in the container and cold to the touch. I never even had a single bite. \n\nThe sandwiches come soggy and falling apart due to being wrapped too loosely. Garlic Cheese bread was decent...once it made it into my oven to reheat. \n\nAgain...this is a consistent issue, not just a one time thing. I hate to write negative reviews as is evidenced by my other reviews, however in this case is warranted.\n\nHopefully upper management will read this and other reviews during the same issues and take steps to correct these things.\n\nIf the meal I ate while I was there was actually what gets delivered, I'd be a fan...and edit this review. I will not accept any free food or discounts, that's not what this is about. Just want this place to be great lol
