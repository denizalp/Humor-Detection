I have been to Reptilia with both adults and little ones and it is always fun and informative. It's worth the trek from downtown Toronto in my opinion. \n\nMy favorite exhibit is probably the first monitor you see on entering (pic of this guy attached!). \n\nThe place isn't huge and you can go through it in 20 minutes if you're in a rush. That said, the exhibits are satisfying and worth the cost of admission. Staff are also quite friendly. \n\nThey have feedings you can view (I haven't viewed one myself), and a variety of reptiles to see as well as turtles to pet for kids.  \n\nThe gift shop is pretty huge and you can walk away with quite pricey little toys for the kids.\n\nTip 1: I suggest coming closer to closing or on a weekend when there is no school class tour going on. I have been here when there are classes and it gets super crowded. Exhibits can be tied up for several minutes until the tour moves. \n\nTip 2:  I believe they offer discounts for those with different abilities, such as the visually impaired. So call in ahead to inquire.\n\nIt's definitely worth a visit!
