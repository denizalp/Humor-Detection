HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE ! My husband felt like he may be having a heart attack so we informed them right when he walked in. The triage nurse took him back and said that she wasn't in any hurry because the chances of a 27 year old having a heart attack was slim. She hooked him up to the ecg machine then yanked the cords off him and said that he was fine and it's probably drug related! we were steriotyped for being young! Then they drug tested him, which obviously came back normal. He was discharged after they did blood work. They didn't even attempt to find out what was wrong. Will never go back there!
