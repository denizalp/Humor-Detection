595 Craft And Kitchen is a fun local bar not too far off the Las Vegas Strip; serving excellent craft beers, fun menu items, fast Wi-Fi and super friendly service. My first visit included a quick stop before nearby lunch plans. I tried the Marshmallow Milk Stout (from Garage Brewing in Temecula) on draft and a plate of their popular chicken and beef Nachos. So good. Five stars for 595 Craft And Kitchen.
