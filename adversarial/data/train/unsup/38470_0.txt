Best wings in the world, period. Great people, friendly vibe and good music too, which make the wings that much better. The bee sting wings are amazing, as are Donnie's blackened wings (cooked crispy). The rest of the menu is excellent, but if you consider yourself a wing connoisseur, you will find the best ever at Moosehead.
