Man you just CANNOT beat Manzettis, one of the best places to eat in Charlotte year in, year out......when you think of all the one time HOT restaurants that have come and gone in the last 15-20 yrs, or ones that are still here but not good anymore, and then you have this place and it still has kickass food\/service...well, thats a RARE thing today...you can go and close your eyes and point and an item and always get a winner..plus the same bartenders that've been there for decades can make a good stiff drink.....STILL the place i default to when company comes to town and we go out to eat after 18 years of living here
