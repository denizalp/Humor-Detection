Perhaps the most overrated Thai restaurant in Vegas, Pin Kaow was a disappointment for me.  I ordered the Rad Na (Lad Na).  It was very bland, even with chili added to it.  I tasted my friend's yellow curry, and it was generic with sweetness and no real character or authentic flavor.  The crab rangoon was pretty good, very sweet and fried well.  However, I've had much better Thai food at numerous places in Las Vegas. Prommares kills this place, and even though Thai Grill isn't as good as it used to be, it is still better than Pin-Kaow and is just down the street on Lake Mead and Decatur.  \n\nWe had to wait 15 minutes outside before we were seated, and we were only seated after we went *back* into the establishment, asked for tables again, and split up our rather large party of 8 people.  The place was packed... with non-asians.  This doesn't always mean anything, but after tasting real authentic Thai food for years at Thai Grill when it was good, I can safely say that the food at Pin Koaw is geared towards Americans who probably don't know the difference.
