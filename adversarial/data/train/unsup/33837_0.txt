Anthony's has the best steak in town and it's worth the trip to the south edge of town. Their Prime bone-in filet, from the Marnell family ranch, is not to be missed. Always perfectly prepared and fork tender. Oh my! The chef there (sorry to say I don't know his\/her name) is incredibly talented. If you hear a special that sounds interesting, go for it, it's likely very good. We love their chopped salad: tons of fresh veggies and not over-dressed. And the service is always outstanding - friendly and warm without being intrusive. The entire property, and this restaurant in particular, is gorgeous. The view after the sun goes down is fantastic. But it's the food you'll come back for.  It's a locals secret (which I guess I just let out of the bag).
