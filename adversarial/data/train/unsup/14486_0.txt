A Tiki Lounge ... in Toronto? Surprisingly, yes! What's even more surprising is that it's authentic and a completely amazing experience.\n\nWhen you walk inside type greeted by a blast of tropical air, sound, and vibe. It feels like it was picked up from the tropics and dropped in the middle of Toronto ... crafted Tiki drinks included. There are tables aplenty and standing room near the bar.\n\nThe Mai Tails and Grog both come with a hit of fire, which makes for a dazzling drink display. As does the Mystery bowl... but for this, the order is marked by a loud gong and a ominous chat ... \"MYSTERY BOOOOOWL\".\n\nThe food are more snack's than dinner, but everything tasted great and was delivered in good time. Overall, this was an amazing experience that was a surprise hit with everyone!
