I'm just here for happy hour! LoL However, this place is cool. Great drink selection, cold draft beer and big tequila list. Happy hour runs 2:00-6:00 with nice margarita specials. The service is wonderful and the food being served around me looks dynamite! \n\nBar tender gives you chips and salsa which helps the Corona go down. Big place with plenty of seating and friendly atmosphere. I will definitely be bringing the family back for dinner.\n\nOk....went back for dinner and it was good. Large menu of great Mexican food! Soon as you sit down they bring your table chips and salsa. Along with the salsa they give you coleslaw (different but good). Everything is fresh! My wife got the steak  fajitas that were awesome. I got the chimichanga and son had a chicken quesadilla, both just as good. The guacamole and refried beans were ok. \n\nThe atmosphere is friendly and the establishment was very clean, including the bathrooms. Waitstaff is on point and restaurant is kid friendly. We live close by and this will be our stop for Mexican food!
