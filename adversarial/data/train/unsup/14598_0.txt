This company is very unreliable and they out right lie!! Appointment for Susan was set on 1\/14\/16 to arrive at my house on 1\/18\/16 at 12 noon, at 12:10pm no Susan. I then called the office and they said she could not find the street and my voice mail box was full!! Total B\/s. They said she can't come now and we have to reschedule. What poor customer service as I was going to be a first time client will not use them going forward and I will continuously cautions others from using their services also. Really needs zero stars!
