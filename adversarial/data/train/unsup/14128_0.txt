Let me start with the positive...the food was delicious!  \n\nUnfortunately, we had a less than perfect experience.  I am extremely hopeful that these were new opening problems (to be expected) and I am very excited to return and hopefully update my review.  \n\nI went in with my family (7 adults and 2 kids) on Thursday at 6:30.  It was very busy!  The secret is already out.  The decor is very contemporary.  It's not what I expected from neighborhood Italian, but lovely.  Chic enough for a nice date night but casual enough for the family.  \n\nWe had 2 plates of calamari, garlic bread and meatballs.  The garlic bread was crispy, buttery and SUPER garlicy with big clumps on top.  Yum-o!  The meatballs had great flavor but the texture was dense.    The calamari was cooked nicely and had a light crispy cornmeal coating.  They tasted fresh and delicious.  The are served with spicy jardiniere sprinkled over the top for good flavor.  Easily avoidable if that's not your thing though.  \n\nA few in our group had a house salad which was a step above your average house salad with 2 types of olives, dark greens, thinly, sliced cucumbers etc.  It looked very nice.  \n\nI got the chicken sorrentino.   It was outstanding.  It was a great portion, piping hot and so flavorful.  Nothing needed seasoning.  It came with a side of spaghetti which was good too.  \n\nOur food took FOREVER!  We were there for over 2 hours with 2 little kids.  The courses were about 30 minutes between each and many people who came after us got their food first.  Again, I am hopeful, they will work some of this out.  Our server was a bit MIA throughout.  We were fairly discontent by the time we got our food but were assured it'd be worth the wait. I don't know if I'd go that far but it was very tasty! \n\nOur bill was $215 for all of us so about $33 a person.  Not cheap but not bad at all.  \n\nI will return and I am eager to try their pizza.  I looked good.  Might just try take - out next time. \n\nRegardless, a welcome addition to our area!
