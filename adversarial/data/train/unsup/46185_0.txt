Stopped by here meaning to get a mocha but the hot chocolate menu captured me instead. I got the french caramel hot chocolate and it's so freaking good. It's not too sweet and they actually steam caramel chocolates into the milk, none of that powder\/chocolate sauce nonsense. Only problem: I've gotten it twice so far and I think they over-steam the milk - probably because the chocolate has to fully melt, so watch out during your first sip!
