\"Quite possibly the culinary center of the universe\" is what was printed on the front door. I'm not too sure about that. At all.\n\nPicture this: Take some WW2 nuclear ration canned spaghetti sauce, 3 types of left over hodgepodge noodles, make sure it's barely lukewarm and literally throw it all on top of a wood table. Insert fork and knife, a gross salad soaked in Italian and room temperature bread straight from the super market down the road and you have the recipe for my Saturday night. I didn't get the chance to order off the menu but I will most definitely not be coming back to test my luck.\n\nI have 3 reasons for my one star. 1) Once again, I cannot give it 0 stars. 2) The bartender was a good dude who served a quick Spotted Cow. 3) The decor was a laughable mix of a pirate ship's hull and a 60 year old woman's fake art collection.\n\nThis place is definitely the center of some universe but one that I live on and I think later on tonight, my stomach will agree with me.
