I want to like this place so bad. It's right around the corner from where I work, plus I'm a wanna be vegan once or twice a month. \n\nEvery time I order my burger I request \"NO SAUCE\".... I usually have to tell the person this on the other end of the speaker 2 or 3 times. When I go to eat the burger it has SAUCE, yuck! See photo of receipt, \"no sauce\" and the sauce on the burger.
