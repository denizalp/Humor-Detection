Ordinarily, this In-N-Out is a 3.5-4* experience for us, usually we hit them up late night. Today, we went during a slammed lunch rush and I was already hangry AF. Scott has 0 idea what a carb is let alone what Keto is etc, so he literally handed my order to the friendly kid expediting for the drive thru in the car park to add to his Double Double no salt added & vanilla shake; my order was:\n\nFlying Dutchman with grilled onions, pickles, chiles on side, and a side \"salad\" with a couple of spread packets. \n\nHe questioned me on the salad and I had to explain  it is just their veggies in a fry bag, he nodded, and we proceeded to window, grabbed our food, and off we went. By the time we arrived home a few minutes later my hangry state had turned to sad\/shangry as my Flying Dutchman had few grilled onions, most of the cheese was stuck to the paper, there was no spread, no pickles, no \"salad\"...le sigh. We go to In-N-Out because they make the burgers and fries without salt upon request so Scott can enjoy them as a treat from time to time. I rarely eat burgers, and for me this was disappointing, but I'm glad he enjoyed his lunch. We will return, it is close, clean, service is friendly, and it's open late, but I'll be sure to go inside rather than use the drive thru, and check my order before leaving.
