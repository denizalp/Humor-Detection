I had the worst auto repair experience I have ever had in my life (I'm 54) here.  I had always heard that Fletcher's took care their customers.  Since I needed a costly repair, they are very close, and they had financing options, I decided to give them a try.  \n\nFIRST THING...WARNING ABOUT THEY'RE EASYPAY FINANCING!  There were no details about interest rates or monthly payments when applying and being accepted.  I called both Fletcher's toll-free number and this location and was told they had no idea what the terms were but I would find out after the repairs were completed and the charges were put through.  Really?  Unfortunately, I needed my car fixed.  I didn't have any idea it was even legal to charge 96% interest (I have decent credit).  \n\nI was assured that my car would be ready the next day or, at the latest, early the next week.  I brought my car in mid-day on a Friday.  They definitely over-promised.  My car was ready the following Thursday.\n\nOf course, the repairs got delayed because they left my car outside Sunday night and my driver's window was broken, and my battery was stolen.  They did pay for the replacement window and battery, but they didn't even vacuum the broken glass up.  Additionally, whomever put the new window in, did not remove all the glass from the frame so it won't even roll up completely.\n\nSince I picked up my car, I have a vibration in my front end that was not there previously.  I am afraid to go back though.  I'm worried they may do more damage.
