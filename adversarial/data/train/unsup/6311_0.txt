Lotus of Siam is one of the best .  It's definitely been a while though as the last time i visited was at the old location.  The newer location is a lot nicer.  Years ago we came to lotus of Siam because of the unknown parts episode.  It's also quite sad that there is a tribute to Bourdian at the front with a very nice message thanking him for everything he's done for the restaurant.  And he def put them on the map\n\nOn to the food!  If you get only one thing let it be the garlic prawns.  They really can't make it any easier than you with the way they shell the prawns so that you can just eat the meat in one or two satisfying bites.  Get out of your comfort zone and try the shell.  It's fried to a crisp so yes very chewable and actually quite delicious.  \n\nThe duck Penang is also our go to.  It's amazing for reasons beyond comprehension.  You will want to likely lick the plate clean!  \n\nYou can get your usual go tos at thai restaurants as they are also also delicious, including the pad Thais to the pad see eww to the Tom yum soup.  But don't just stick to those as you would definitely be missing out on some amazing items!
