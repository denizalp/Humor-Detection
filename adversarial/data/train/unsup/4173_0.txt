I had purchased a poster at the Museum of Art and this UPS is right near the Contemporary Art Museum, so it was a perfect stop to see if they had a shipping tube. And they did! It's a small shop that was quite crowded with boxes when I stopped in, but the gal working the counter was helpful. And my poster survived the journey home!
