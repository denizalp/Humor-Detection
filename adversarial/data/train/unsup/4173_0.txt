Being the math nerd that I am, I'm going to start this with a lame math joke.  \"Absolute\" in math will turn a negative into a positive and keep a positive positive.  Absolute comedy does exactly that, it will turn a negative mood into a positive mood or if you're already in a good mood, it will  maintain\/extend that good mood.  If you understood that joke, then let's have a math party and if you didn't, can I please hang out with you because I want to be as cool as you.  :-)\n\nSeriously, here's the breakdown:\n\nLikes - much cheaper than Yuk Yuk's and Second City.  Will still keep you laughing. For an entertainment venue, drinks and food aren't totally insane prices.  Food is served relatively fast, as is food and the servers are always walking around to make sure you are satisfied.  \n\nDislikes: Not many, but kind of odd how they will take credit\/debit for the food, but not for the box office.  Find it odd\n\nVerdict: Great cheap night out.
