Our first time at the Modern Vegan.  The food here is very tasty. We had the \"meatball\" hero and the Ruben sandwich, a falafel with sweet potato fries and salads.  Their Ruben is a very good facsimile of the real thing.  They use a great marble rye bread, real sauerkraut, and a vegan cheese.  The \"meat\" had a sweet smoky note like a tad of BBQ sauce was used to flavor it and pull it closer to real corned beef.  I would have loved some russian dressing, and also a critical detail that was left out... deli mustard.  French's Yellow mustard just does not get me there. Now the \"meatball\" hero, sub, grinder or whatever you want to call it was great. I loved the sauce and the \"meatballs were delicious. Its super messy but so what? Dive in and enjoy. The falafel is a solid choice. Its not  heavily seasoned so you may want some hot sauce. The sweet potato fries initially came out cold. But our server replaced the basket with some awesome super crispy piping hot fries instantly. I also saw the \"chicken\" and waffles and they look downright insane. Salads are fresh too.  The service here can be a little slow but thats ok by me.  Settle in with a drink and relax. All the servers are super friendly, knowledgeable about the menu and responsive.  Overall, this restaurant is a significant advance for the Vegas vegan community and deserves a serious look. We will be back soon. Free parking in the lot out front. Highly recommend.
