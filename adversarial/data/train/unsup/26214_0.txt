Went here for the first time lasy February, loved it. Food and drinks were great, service was great. Fast forward to this year. We went again in February and got into town just in time for dinner. I immediately wanted to go here because all i could think of was those trash can nachos.\n\nSo we checked in and headed down to Guy's. 10-15 minute wait.. not bad at all. We were seated outside. Also seated outside was a group of already wasted loud and obnoxious AF group of people. So im trying to ignore that hot mess looking over the  menu. Servers came and went to other tables. We waited 10-15 minutes for someone to come. Out in the cold (there was a heater but it was still cold) I was almost to the point of walking out. Finally someone comes. No personality, no apologies, no small talk. Just asking what we wanted and left. We asked about the seasonal shot... apparently they ran out. He didnt reccomend anything in its place. And half way thru our meal we had a different server. Usually they tell us theyre going on break or something but nope. And it was a server who passed us multiple times without saying a word. So yea there wasnt going to be a good tip. Sorry not sorry\n\nNow to the food. Maybe i was buzzed last time and now i wasnt but the nachos were subpar. The cheese tasted like melted kraft singles. We also split a burger i forgot which one tho. It was aight.  Nothing special. I did like that the fries were a hodgepodge of types. There were waffle, steak fries and shoestring.  I love fries so this was a pleasant surprise. \n\nIts sad my last visit left a bad taste in my mouth. I doubt i'll go back.
