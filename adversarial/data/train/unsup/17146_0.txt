This place is straight up the best sandwich place you'll ever go. Theres one in vegas and one at downtown disney and theyre both ridiculously amazing. GOOOOO! What are you waiting for. Go now, right now just do it. Its the best. There is nothing on the menu you can go wrong with, unless your allergic to something and lets be honest, havent you lived long enough already?
