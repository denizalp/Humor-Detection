my car was t boned and required 2 new doors. The doors were replaced and repainted. However the doors were dented up and swirled in certain areas...almost like they chose a bad quality door to be placed on my car or they had the doors leaning on some rough material before they mount it on my car. A few years later I had to repaint the doors because it was peeling. I will not bring my cars to this place.
