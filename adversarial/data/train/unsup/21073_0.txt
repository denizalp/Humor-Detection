The casino:\n\nI didn't see any half naked girls walking around on a Thursday night...I was disappointed. \n\n\nHotel room hall way:\n\nLooked haunted, grimey and reeked of cigarettes. The lighting was bad and made the place look really cheap.\n\nThe rooms:\n\nGave us double beds but I thought we were supposed to get queen beds. The interior didn't look bad but the bathrooms needed to be touched up and the beds were really lump and uncomfortable.\n\nThe verdict:\n\nThis is a cheap place to stay and you get what you pay for. This isn't a good value in my opinion. Could've stayed somewhere better for the same price.
