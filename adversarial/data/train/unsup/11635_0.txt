Tonight was the last straw. I've been a Selmas die hard for a long time. But the service has gotten to the point that I'm done. The food has never suffered but the inconsiderate treatment and inconsistent hours have made the trek elsewhere more of an option. I hope management comes to their senses and figures out they're not serving the customer. You aren't doing me a favor, I'm here to give you my business.
