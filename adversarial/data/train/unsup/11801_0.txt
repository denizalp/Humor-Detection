First to those that have negative comments in regards to sighting a rifle or pistol. Talk to Amanda, she well zero your firearm with a bore laser.\nSecond, for those numbskulls who think you can get a firearm with out a photo ID are not the sharpest knife in the drawer. It's federal law!\nAs far as prices for firearms or ammo, I do not know what these people are smoking. I go to the internet and gun shows. Ted's matches or beats their ammo prices (yes it's reloads) but if I get a FTF the staff replace the rounds no problems. Oh by the way, out 500 rounds so far I have had 3 FTF. Plus its very clean.....\nThird, I drive out of the way to go there. I know Ted's would not like this comment but you nay Sayers thank you, because maybe somebody believes what you are saying and that will make this place less crowded.\nGo ahead and pay more to other ranges that treat you like the way you deserve....
