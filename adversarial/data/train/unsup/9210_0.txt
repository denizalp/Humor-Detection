Yelp's 365 Review Challenge 2014 #152 - #365\n\nOh how I love Shell gas, especially when I'm driving long back and forth to California. I want premium gas that will last me longer on the road compared to Arco.\n\nSince I'm always staying on the strip, I always stop here to fill up before the long drive back to California. What I also love is that it's way cheaper than Socal gas because Nevada doesn't add that much taxes to the gasoline. \n\nThe store has an abundance of cheap drinks compared to the strip, so it's great to stock up before heading back to the hotel. I have never had a problem with the staff and are all smiles. \n\nThis is my Go To place for gas!
