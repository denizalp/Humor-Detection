Was craving for some xiao long bao. The menu is entirely in Chinese so you may have to ask for translations if you're not fluent (I am not). EDIT: Apparently they have an English menu but I was not privy to this - so ask (I'm used to seeing bilingual menus, like many dim sum places have). \n\nWe ordered a ton of food but the xiaolong bao themselves were pretty good. They had lots of soup and didn't break when handling, though the dumpling wrap was thin. Be careful of the direction you bite it as it may explode with hot liquid. This can be a great gastronomic experience or a disaster. They have a display window for you to watch them make it too.  Also, the black sesame tongyuen was delicious. They had a ozmanthus sugar broth with flower petals suspended in it - Really light and refreshing.
