What else can I say - Dr. Gombert is simply the best!!  He is a perfectionist and extremely meticulous in his work.  I have never worked with a better staff - they are capable, efficient and friendly.  The office and facilities are all high end with soothing music and serene scenes playing on large monitors in front of the dental chairs. On your way out you can grab a coffee, water and a cookie!
