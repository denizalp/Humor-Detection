Beautiful restaurant and the grilled octopus was outstanding but given the inattentive service, high prices and just average food beyond that, \"Meh\" is about the right word.  I had to choke back a laugh when the selling point was the fish were \"no more then 30 hours off the boat\".  \n\nthe worst part was I got sick and not from the fish, from the cous cous.  3 bites and my stomach started gurgling then 30 minutes later I was praying to the porcelain god!  Flavor was actually good but I did bit into 2 lemon seeds.  I'm guessing I got sick because someone's improperly washed hands were the strainer for the lemon juice.\n\n*gurgle, gurgle* not the way I want to lose weight.
