Not bad, but not great.  Portion sizes are out of control, so its definitely a quantity over quality type of place.  Smoked chicken wings were enormous, but were tough and had little to no flavor, which was disappointing.  Loaded fries as an app were good, and the enormous portion was enough for 4-6 people.\n\nPrime rib sandwich and 1# hot dog were alright, but nothing to write home about. The menu is very large and would probably go back to try some other items.
