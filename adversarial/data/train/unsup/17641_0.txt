Was here about a month ago. Wish I could tell you how the food was, but my friends and I spent an hour waiting to be seated. And just when we were told a table was ready, a group of people who'd arrived shortly after us were given the table. The manager told us that she thought we'd like a table near the A\/C. (Maybe she believes Black people are more warm-blooded than others?) In any case, we wound up at a Qdoba next door. Also, if you're traveling around Madison with a large group of black people? Prepare to be stared at. A lot.
