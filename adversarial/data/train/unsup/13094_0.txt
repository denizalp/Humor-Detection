We had a reservation for 8, and was seated outside patio without AC, it was a bit uncomfortable.  Service was impeccable!!!\n\nMilos serves family style dinner, each portions are big enough to share. \n\nWe started with the Milos special -- slices of Zucchini and eggplant fried crispy with a cream sauce.  It was delicious to snack on.  \nGrilled Octopus - very good\nsquid stuffed with cheese - very good\ncrab cake - very very good\ngrilled calamari - very good\nTomato salad, garden salad, and Milos romaine -- all three were sour but good\ntwo dozens of kumamoto oysters -- fresh and small, just how we like it\nMediterranean spreads with fresh baked pita bread - couldn't have enough\nBone in Ribeye - just perfect to the taste, but we're all full by now\ngrilled fish - half of us didn't even try\n\nMust try!!
