If you're spending $150-200+ per couple at night and want to throttle back on food spending, check this lunch place out.  Wife and I were staying at the Palazzo so on a suggestion we wandered over to the Fashion Show Mall and up to the Food Court (3rd floor).  Food Court just a slight level above most but not that much to look at.  The Habit was our destination.  I wanted to try the Santa Monica burger they were known for.  It didn't disappoint.  Good sized burger (I only finished half) w\/ advocado on grilled sourdough.  Wife got the salad that was a special seasonal item (edaname, added tuna, etc).  She really liked it.  All sandwiches come with fries.  Soft drinks are all you can drink.  Service was quick and pleasant.  Restaurant and seating area was very clean.  Price for lunch was under $25 for two people.  Very good by Vegas standards.
