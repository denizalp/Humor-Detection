The food was delicious ! They have many many many choices to choose from Asian to Italian. For Pho lovers , they had a make your own pho. ( don't add pho sauce , it will make it very salty ). My favorite section out of all was the desert section. The cheesecakes & tiramisu are a must ! Also many many many ice cream flavor to choose from. I recommend not getting the macaron it was stale ! The staff was also alright.
