This place is unique. They offer a mix of Hawaiian and Korean. But, it's not as confusing as it sounds. I love to read reviews on yelp and had to express how awesome this place is.. From the service to the the incredible food they offer, I  feel obligated to write such a review\n\nLike everyone else has said, the owner is a hard working guy, and takes pride in his food....and I can taste it. \n\nI am grateful this place is thriving (they have been open for 20 yrs +) and I'm  fortunate that I've had to the opportunity to experience it.\n\nI have never a bad dish here....the free starter dishes are amazing, and if you are new to this style of food I recommend the combo hands down. \n\nI could go on and on, just try it for yourself and you will not be disappointed.\n\nPS\n\nBoiled peanuts.... So good\n\nAndy
