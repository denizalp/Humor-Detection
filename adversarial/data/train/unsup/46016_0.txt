I'm so happy this studio opened up, and that they are so close to my house. I loved doing spin classes at the gym, but I hated having to show up 20 minutes early and fight for a bike. I can reserve my spot online and know that I'll have a bike to ride even if I am walking in right as the class is starting. Another good thing about reserving my class, is that it helps me to go on the days where I'm not really feeling like riding. I can still cancel my class, but if I wait for the last hour I'm paying for it anyway so I might as well drag my butt in there and ride.\nI've been to three different instructors and they're all professional, prepared, and each a little different. The bikes are great, and the facility is clean and cool. Big flat screen TV's that some instructors use to show race footage during the class, which I enjoy. \nBottom line, no contracts, reasonable rates, frequent specials, lots of classes and instructors, and a very friendly staff. Thanks for opening up, I'm looking forward to my next class.
