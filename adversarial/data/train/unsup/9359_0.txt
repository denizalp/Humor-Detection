I am not a bagel person. Or at least I wasnt until now. I could never understand NY's obsession with them, when there are perfectly good Pop Tarts and Toaster strudel's or breakfast sandwiches.\n\nI was wary when i bit into it, but there was no way he'd let me leave toronto without this right of passage. And just like that I was hooked. It was perfectly crisp on the outside, but so soft and pillowy on the inside- if you are a fan of Kim Kardashian's ass you'll love these- it brought tears of joy to my eyes. This is why Canadian's are so laidback and happy.\n\nI will never forsake bagels again. Kellog's deprived me.\n(tip: go early sunday for the fresh ones to avoid a wait, but they sell their bagels to local cafe's as well, so everybody's happy)
