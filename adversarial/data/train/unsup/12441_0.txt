Instructions for a \"funtabulous\" happy hour in Scottsdale: \n\n1. Go to Cafe Zuzu. \n2. Have the delightful Lacey be your server. \n3. Order any of the speciality cocktails on the $3 happy hour menu. \n3A. In particular order the Bourbon Smash and Bramble! \n4. Order a couple of noshes off the happy hour menu or even a \"supplementary\" item off the lounge menu. \n4A. In particular order the barbecue mini pork shanks, the grilled artisan cheese mini sandwiches and the apple, endive, pomegranate salad. \n5. Enjoy people watching in the crowded bar that magically empties out as 7:00p (the end of happy hour) approaches. \n\nIf you are visiting Scottsdale, as we are, and are not regulars at Cafe Zuzu, here are a couple of tips that might be helpful for you before you go to Zuzu. \n\nFirst, web site ad aside that shows a young woman sitting with legs and dress askew, have no worries...you will not be offered a lap dance with your cocktails. (Although, my husband who wondered if this might be so based on the marketing photo on the web site may have been a tad disappointed. ;-) ) \n\nSecond, you do not have to use the Valet parking at the Valley Ho to get into Zuzu. Self parking is available around the side of the building, a little hard to find but it's there. \n\nThird, yes you really ARE going the right direction from the gate at the parking lot in the long walk through a sort of dark \"tunnel\" of buildings to get to the pool area of the Valley Ho where ZuZu is located...trek on intrepid traveler. \n\nLast, if there is seating outside (not on the night we were there due to inclement weather) it looks as if that could be as much fun as was the inside seating! Even for those of us who are...ahem...more \"mature\" happy hour fans for whom the retro design at the Valley Ho and Zuzu reminds us of our childhood.  (And remember, all those younger people have to go to WORK the next day and we are blissfully retired. :-) )
