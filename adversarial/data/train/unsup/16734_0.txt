Came here for a team building event with my co-workers and we had some changes where not everyone was able to attend as expected and we also found out one of the girls was pregnant. We went to let the staff know and they let us know that they would still be charging us for the full amount even though all the expected people were not going to race. I thought this was policy was a way for this company to make money at their expense regardless of changes. We decided to cancel and still they charged for cancelling which is understandable, but it was way more economic than to have to pay for everyone even though not everyone was racing. We wasted an hour of our time. \nThe racetrack itself looked small and it did not look as fun it does on the website. I'm not interested in returning especially after the experience that we went through which by the way the price difference was $500.
