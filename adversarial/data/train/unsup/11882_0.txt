Someone say Beef Brisket and Rice Noodle Soup for brekkie?  Oh ya!  Tasty yum yum.  The restaurant is open at 6am and offer all sorts of Noodle soup dishes.  It was approximately 10am as I watched people walk into the restaurant.  I hadn't had anything to eat all morning and was starving so I decided to check the place out.  The restaurant was almost packed full of people eating noodle soup.  The space itself was very clean and what I liked most about the kitchen was that it was open concept.   I love restaurants where you can see the chefs cooking the food. The Beef Brisket Noodle soup was deliciously good.  The broth was tasty and the noodles were perfectly cooked. The beef was soft and tender and had a really nice flavour to it.  They didnt skimp out on the beef either.  Their pepper oil was a nice addition to my soups flavour. 10 bucks for my dish was money well spent.
