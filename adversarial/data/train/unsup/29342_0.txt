Before hopping on the road, we had breakfast at Cora's since it was only right across the road from where we were staying. I was slightly hesitant after reading some of the previous reviews, but it turned out to be just fine. The table seating was a little tight with the chairs back-to-back. We asked to be seated at a booth but were told those were reserved for large groups (there were 3 of us). Completely understandable. Our waitress was pretty helpful. She offered getting cheese on our roasted potatoes which proved to be a great choice. I don't know if we were just hungry, but our food did seem to take awhile to come. To their credit, it was rather busy so that's understandable as well. \n\nI ordered the Spinach & Cheddar Omelette; it came with rye toast, a bed of fruit, and roasted potatoes. I also ordered a side of bacon. I finished off the potatoes before really touching anything else on my plate; they were so tasty! And the cheese just enhanced everything! The fruit looked good--it was cantaloupe, pineapple and an orange. I only ate the orange though. The main attraction: the Omelette was a little dry. I could see that as soon she put my plate down. However it got better once I moved towards the inside. \n\nOverall, it was a great experience. I'll definitely recommend this place to others who visit Toronto or just return myself. It was a breakfast and wait well worth it!
