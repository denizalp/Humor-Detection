Tried out Massage Heights (Warm Springs location) for the first time and I can't say I was very impressed. The massage itself was decent and for an intro-rate of $39.99 for 50 minutes, I guess I can't really complain.  My therapist, Kim, did an awesome job and provided very firm pressure where I needed it.\n\nHOWEVER...I've never been to a spa that didn't offer ice cold water with the slices of cucumber or lemon in it after the session. This place? They handed me a plastic bottle of lukewarm no-label water. Tacky.  Who knows, maybe this is what's offered to non-membership customers and they have the \"fancy water\" somewhere else for members?\n\nThen it was sort of high pressure sales at checkout, trying to get me to pay for the membership (again, not too bad, $49.99\/mo which gives you one 1-hr massage a month.) Like Jessie B. suggested, perhaps they should let you know what the membership prices are before hand so you can still enjoy the lingering feelings of the massage afterward.\n\nBut sheesh, I still can't get over the lukewarm bottled water.  I didn't join.\n\n4 stars for Kim.\n2 stars for Massage Heights.
