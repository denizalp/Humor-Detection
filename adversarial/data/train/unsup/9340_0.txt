Be warned, parking here is a challenge. Don't park in the Drug Mart parking lot, they WILL tow you. Sure, the hotel next to it makes it look like prostitute alley.....but you gotta get past all that yo! The food here is truly amazing. Fresh salsa, crunchy chips and the best refried beans this side of the Peso. I am in love with the fajita platter here and their guacamole here is a religious experience. The interior of this place is colorful and hand painted. The staff has been pretty much the same as long as I can remember it....which makes the experience even better. The restrooms? Well.....they are small and kinda scary looking. Use at your own risk. The food and service here makes it all worth it!
