3.5 stars and not worth the hype in IMO. I've been here before a few years back, and I recently came to try it again. \n\nIf you're stuck at the Cosmo and don't feel like venturing out too far or just ended your ratchet night of clubbing at Marquee and you're dying for some pizza\/post club grub, then yes, by all means go here. It's located on the third floor down a hallway of record labels (next to Jaleo). They have a few bar style counters and a couple of stools, and the rest of the people usually end up standing and eating or taking it to go. The pizza itself is good, especially the pepperoni. I like how the dough remains crispy and crunchy and doesn't get soggy at all. They have this garlic seasoning that you can sprinkle on your pizza, and it really enhances the flavor. I also tried a slice of their veggie pizza and sausage with pepperoncini, but the pepperoni was my favorite. \n\nA slice of pizza goes for about $5 a pop, more with additional toppings, and a whole pizza starts at about $30. Soda is $4. I wouldn't say the pizza prices are outrageous, because the pizza is decently sized (about the size of a Costco pizza). You could say it's all about the experience here, but especially for Vegas locals, I think convenience plays a big factor. I don't know if I would want to come back again having to go through the Strip traffic, parking, up the elevators, and possibly have to wait in line just for pizza :\/
