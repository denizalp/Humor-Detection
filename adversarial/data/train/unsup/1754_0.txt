Went with my good friend for brunch this morning. Very busy!! Free coffee while you wait, but we were taken in and attended to pretty quickly given the number of people being served. I ordered the protein plate with salmon, egg whites, avocado, zucchini, and cauliflower mash, and my friend ordered the chicken with eggs, broccoli, asparagus and avocado. They give you a large-sized portion!  She didn't care for the chicken or asparagus, said the latter was soggy. I enjoyed my plate but it's pretty bland. Really great if you're looking to eat super clean though. Favorite part was the cauliflower mash- the flavor depth is impressive. $14 for salmon plus $2 upgrade for egg whites. Expensive for a brunch at $20 without alcohol. There are better priced options though for sure. There was a breakfast burrito that looked awesome! And they had lots of unhealthy choices I'd love to try if I wasn't attempting to be healthy. Nice patio and outdoor eating experience. Will likely go back!
