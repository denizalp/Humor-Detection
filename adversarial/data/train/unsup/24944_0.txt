Honestly, the only reason this place is getting ANY stars is because the bartenders are super nice and quick to serve you drinks. I have no complaints about the service we received from our bartender, Tina. She was awesome!\n\nBut, we sat by the window looking into the kitchen a few nights ago, and I honestly wanted to throw up. The workers were constantly walking by with food in their mouths, munching and crunching on everything back there. The grill looked like it hadn't been cleaned for a month, and I saw one of the servers actually pick off some pepperoni on someones pizza with her bare hands, then handed it to someone else to serve it. Another larger woman was digging her hands into the chip bucket and grabbing handfuls and eating them right there! I hope she washes her hands after using the bathroom! You'd think that a restaurant where patrons can see where their food is made would actually want to strictly enforce health codes, obviously not. I will NEVER eat here!
