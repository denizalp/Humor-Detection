Something about watching a long line meander up a staircase into a room hidden from street view makes Vintage look much cooler than what it actually is. Sure, you might have caught a free admission + shot promo, but more often than not you'll just be paying a cover for:\n\n-Drinks smaller, weaker, and more expensive than comparable establishments on the same road. This isn't just one Yelper's opinion, pretty much every other review points this out. Looks like they've earned the bad rep.\n\n-Virtually no tap selection. Not that that's mandatory, but it sure does help when everyone else does it.\n\n-Lame crowd. Not as much debauchery as you'll be guaranteed to find nearby. No one stays here; people just kind of warm up for a minute and take off to their next destination. I'm totally guilty of that.\n\n-Lame patio. Virtually nonexistent.\n\nIt's not that you can't have a good time at Vintage. I really like their dance floor, and the bartenders are full of smiles. If this bar were in a different area, it would probably get 3 stars. I just can't in good Yelp conscience hype a place that's been consistently mediocre.
