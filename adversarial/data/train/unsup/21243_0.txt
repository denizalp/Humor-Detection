I know I'm a dork for writing another review of QuikTrip gas stations, but I really do love them! They are fantastic for having competitive gas prices and FAST, FAST counter service, and best of all...very clean restrooms!\n\nI will drive out of my way to fill up at one (that I conveniently found on my YELP droid app)....paper towels are never empty, the windshield water is always full and sudsy (like they just filled it before I pulled up!), and lots of gas pumps! \n\nI have even had a grab & go sandwich, which are pretty decent for a gas station sandwich. Good coffee too!
