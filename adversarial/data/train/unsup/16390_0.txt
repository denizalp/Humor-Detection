I've come here a few times because my husband's family is Taiwanese and they like these places when they come into town. If you come on a weekend or at night... WOW WOW WOW. This place is busy. Don't expect an atmosphere where people won't bump into you as you eat or that you'll be able to have a conversation. It is so cramped and you'll be elbow to elbow with strangers (literally, they put 2 of us at a 4 top with another couple because they had run out of room the last time we were here a few weeks ago. Grossed me out because the guy was hacking snot into his napkin and looking at it while we ate.) \n\nThis place really needs a bigger location. As is, it's too cramped for comfort. The do take cards now, but you will wait a long time for a seat and the soups are nothing to write home about. I did like that I could substitute out the noodles with a different type as I don't like traditional beef noodle soup noodles.
