I went this weekend for a bachelor party. We bought the $60pp deal with a limo ride and a $40 bar tab.\n\nThe limo was a bit dirty with a broken sunroof, whatever. We tipped the dude $10 for a 5 minute ride. He said call him with a half hour notice for a ride home. We did, then when we called him he said \"I'm busy\" and didn't pick us up, really pissing off our groom.\n\nThe bar tab: We weren't told the cost of the drinks until we asked. They would ask me if I wanted another while I had a full drink. And actually, they once brought me a drink without even asking me (seriously? You don't get to take my money without me consenting to that). I found the drinks a bit weak\/small. They ranged from $10-$13 per.\n\nThe actual club: I'm not a big strip club guy generally, and went without wanting any lap dances or anything. I sat in the middle of people facing the table. When a girl asked me to move so she could sit on my lap I said no thank you politely, at which point she stared at me like she was disgusted at me, made a huffy noise, and walked off. A few girls came by and tried to do the same, despite me obviously not wanting this (not looking at them, reaching for my drink when they came by, being in an impossible to sit on my lap position, etc). One even told me \"you should relax\". Clearly this wasn't all of the girls, but the ones that were like this made me feel like a wallet. One or two I said \"I can't\", or \"I don't feel well, so no thank you\" and were cool about it. The bad apples really make you hate life though.\n\nOne stripper sought a dance from my friend, then said he should guy the groom a dance, then went to the groom to try to get our friend to buy it, making it a \"he's cheap\" or \"I got mu $20\" situation, which we didn't appreciate. Then she also said our friend should buy the groom a shot, and her a shot, and.... yeah, just a ridiculously uncomfortable money suck.\n\nAnother friend was taken into the back room (he assumed for a lap dance) and was asked to pay $700 for some \"package\" thing, then $300 for something else, then $140 for 15 minutes. He thought he was just getting a lap dance in a less public spot...... not the case. In general I think that's a theme here, the patron doesn't always know WTF is happening, and is made to feel uncomfortable for rejecting the girls seeking money thus getting the girls more money.\n\nAs for the dancing it ranges dramatically. There was a thin\/fit girl with tattoos dancing to metal'ish music who was doing all sorts of tricky things and generally being a great stripper. There were also girls catering entirely to one rich drunk dude, who just sort of giggled their bits for 30 seconds straight, crotch pointing at said male.\n\nOne man, a loud drunk, was ruffling girls hair, and throwing dollars at their faces. This guy literally fell down drunk and was picked up by OG staff. They didn't kick him out mind you, and strippers then catered to him. I felt bad for the guy, it seemed like he was too drunk to consent to large ticket item dances and the like. I see this sentiment on other reviews.\n\nThere were some girl groups having fun (in the women dancer section), who were hit on by some club patrons. They seemed to have fun other than that (motorboated the strippers, etc). \n\nSo there you have it. I'm not coming back, but maybe you'll like it more than I did. My advice to OGs is to have some way of filtering out girls who make our experience there awful. There are plenty of great girls, but you get enough girl who won't leave and makes you feel like a jerk for not dropping a ton of money, or limo driver who shines you on for a tip then leaves you high and dry, or falling down drunk patron allowed to go past the line, or watery required drinks, and it sort of takes you out of a good vibe.
