So this place used to be called Wongs place. They changed their name, however it is still the same owner. \n\nI used to loveeeeee Wongs place! So we wanted to try it out again hoping that they still had the same menu. They no longer have the garlic fried rice. Nooooooo!!! Lol. I always ordered the crystal shrimp when I went to Wongs place. It tastes completely different now. Like there's not enough sauce on the shrimp. We also ordered the crab puffs which tasted different as well. Instead of the garlic fried rice we ordered the egg fried rice. However, it tasted really bland. \n\nI'm assuming that they have a new cook now because everything tasted different. Wongs used to be my favorite Chinese restaurant. However, everything tastes completely different now. I'm not sure if I'll be back.
