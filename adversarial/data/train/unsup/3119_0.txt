Had high hopes for this place... thank you for squashing them. First, everything looks good. However, not sure what the chefs were thinking.  Everything is bland and so so. The best tasting thing I found was the very small salad bar.  Even the steak was iffy. Sorry Billagio no bueno. At least you can wear shorts in this restaurant.
