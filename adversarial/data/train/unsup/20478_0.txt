Ale Haus reminds me of a bar called CJ's in Pleasant Hill, CA in the East Bay. This is a great place to come and drink for cheap. Come to Ale Haus and live a Bukowski-esque dream. Beer is $1.50 at Happy Hour. Ninja Sushi is next door. Take a date to Ninja and venture to Ale Haus. She will be impressed or depressed. I saw a girl on Instagram this morning post a picture of her and her friend sitting on beach chairs in Thailand with the caption \"Life is rough.\" It is and will flip on you. People probably laughed at life on that same beach until a cyclone came. Come to Ale Haus and position yourself in the middle of the storm. I leave you with words from Ice-T:\n\nThis is not supposed to be positive\nThis music is negative, because the streets are negative\nYou know; so.. in the records\nYou're gonna hear violence, you're gonna hear aggressive behavior\nby individuals that lived that lifestyle out\nYou know; that's why I tell them, it's not like Steven King\nWho makes a horror movie with a happy ending\nThey don't have happy endings, it's a horror movie\nIt's supposed to end horrible, you see!\nAnd this is what I do, so.. people that are gonna.. that did like me\nAre gonna be.. really shocked when they hear my new record\nCause it's going to scare the **** out of people
