I have a little chihuhuha with a BIG personality and everyone at Dawg Days has always welcomed her with open arms. The whole staff is wonderful and my pup is always so excited to get inside and play with her friends. She has been going for the or for years now and I don't see that changing anytime soon! \n\nI have left her for boarding a few times and I'm always so comfortable leaving her. Sometimes they take her home with them and I trust that 100%! I love that they're a cageless facility unlike other boarding places! The boarding might be more than other places, but daycare is included and I know my pup loves it there! Also, Dawg Dayz is out of my way, but I couldn't think of taking her anywhere else, so the trip is completely worth it!
