If you get the 2 bedroom villa your in LUCK. \nJacuzzi tubs  in both bathrooms AND a jacuzzi on the balcony. \nSo lavish \nGreat pool view\nVERY SPACIOUS \nI mean wow \nNice big flat-screens with a DVD player, Surround-sound ^_^ (only negative was the remote was so confusing to use) \nEven have a bar for entertaining!!\nLike seriously it gets better, \nNice kitchen fully loaded with a dishwasher and all the cooking and baking utensils you will need! \nI am telling you this place had it all! \n\nEven the slides at the pool were pretty damn amazing. \n\nONLY negative is this is not a hotel where housekeeping comes daily. But you can order room service, and towels and material that you would need. \nThey service all needs!
