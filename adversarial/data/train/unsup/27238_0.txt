The atmosphere right away was very welcoming and our waiter was awesome! The food portions were a great size and I recommend the shrimp as the appetizer and entree! We had the pineapple mojitos and they were amazing! If you are a local you will receive a free dessert. The lemon pie with blueberries was gorgeous and super tasty!
