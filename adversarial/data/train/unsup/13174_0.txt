I like Coal Burger!\n\nI've been here a few times, and never really had to wait for a seat. The food is good.  You place your order at the cashier, pay and they give you a number.  It normally takes about five minutes or so, unless they're busy. \n\nHere's the skinny, your only big decision is weather you want 1\/3 lb, or 1\/2 lb.   The basic is their Coal Burger for $4.99 or $6.99 depending on what size you order. \n\nTheir best burger by far and away is the Bacon Blue Burger for $7.49, or $9.49. It's delicious. It reminds me of that old Drew Carey joke \"Okay boys, come on now, next stop is the heart!\"  \n\nIt is the best blue cheese burger west of the Mississippi, and Hackney's in Chicago.\n\nEnjoy!
