Wayyyyy better than hot n juicy and boiling crab. The flavors of the urban mix burst in your mouth. We usually get the combos on the back of the menu rather than order a la carte. The Cajun fries are very flavorful and crispy, but the zesty waffle fries are a game changer.\nWe get great service 90% of the time. And the owner is super nice every time we run into her.
