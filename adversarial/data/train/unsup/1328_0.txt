For all the hype and the price you pay, the visit here wasn't worth it.  The fries are the cheap type to make and they're not that good.  You can make the same quality of fries by going to the grocery store and buy the cheap thick fries and fry them at home yourself. You'd pay the same price or less for a bigger quantity, too.  And the cheese they use on the fries was so artificial, one fry from my friend's plate was enough for me.  I thought the shake would stand out in taste, but I was wrong.  It tasted like melted ice cream.  Nothing special.   What a waste of money and calories. I should've listened to my sister...\nI spent $36 on 2 strawberry shakes, 1 regular and 1 cheese fries, and 2 special Octoberfest burgers (super greasy burger that came with a patty and a sausage).
