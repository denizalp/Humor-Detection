I've been to several shows and taken friends.  We have all loved it.  What these ladies and gents do is fun, body positive, and a credit to continuing the art of burlesque.\n\nAs mentioned in other reviews, the show is held in a small theater at Boomers.  I don't think that the bar is horrible (but see my other reviews for my love of dive bars).  The bar itself is spacious, the drinks reasonable, bathroom clean, and the bartenders very friendly.  The theater is small and cramped, but that's part of the charm of this show.  The crowd is always great.  Get in line early for good seats in the general seating section.\n\nI've never had any issue with buying advance seats through Brown Paper Tickets.  The volunteers manning the entrance to the show have always been pleasant and helpful.\n\nEach month the show has a new theme and usually a different host. The stage may be small, but the lighting and sound are excellent and I appreciate the non-smoking atmosphere.  The production quality isn't going to be that of a strip show (who has that kind of cash?) but it's still well done and the attention to details of the props, costumes, and makeup are fantastic.  There is a mix of the burlesque school students, teachers, and out of town guests performing.  If you are lucky, you may even get to see a burlesque legend perform!  We saw Dusty Summers at one show and she was amazing.\n\nThe comments on the shape\/size of the women in previous reviews disappoints me, and I'd like to address that.  Absolutely folks are entitled to their opinion and they have different preferences.  \n Yes, you are going to see all shapes and sizes of women and men perform.  I think that may be part of the beauty of this particular showcase.  It's all in the eye of the beholder.  I love seeing all ages\/sexes\/sizes because \"sexy\" and \"burlesque\" shouldn't belong to any one type of person.  I definitely applaud Live Burlesque in Las Vegas for boldly breaking down stereotypes and barriers every month.\n\nI recommend this show and have put it on my \"tour list\" for out of towners.  If you go with an open mind, I think you'll have an excellent time.
