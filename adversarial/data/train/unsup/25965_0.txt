just ate at mooyah and I'm very irritated at we were treated when we came in to order. The food was fabulous by the way I enjoyed my burger and fries very much my wife enjoyed her Shake. The guys who brought our food we're very polite. But (Katelynn) who took our order seem to be bothered by life as she knows it her hand in her face the whole time we are taking our order it took everything in me and my wife did not walk out of the place at that point but we really wanted a burger so we stuck it out. it's really interesting that in today's day and age customer service seems to be so lackluster everywhere you go.\n\nForgot to add the fact that the floor is so greasy my wife and were slipping all over like it was a freaking skating rink.... I need to put down a sacrificial wipe mat for the cook's as a walk from the line.
