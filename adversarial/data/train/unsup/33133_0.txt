I love Uber in most places I travel. I may even continue to use uber in Montreal. But be warned. The cars are all dirty, the drivers rarely speak good English, and the quality of service is terrible. \n\nTonight I arrived at the airport. I requested a ride. The estimate of arrival was way off and the driver took off. Problem is he was charging the ride. So I called him. He picked up the \"wrong passenger\". Claimed he would cancel the ride and it would be okay. I got a charge of $12. \n\nRequested the next driver. He pulls up. But ignores me. Apparently too cold to lower the window and ask if I am his ride and too cold to get out and open the trunk. I complained and he canceled the ride. \n\nLove my third driver.  Great guy. But his car is filthy and smells. \n\nHmmm. Sad since uber had to really fight to get into this market.
