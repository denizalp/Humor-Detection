One of two great places my ex-pain in the butt took me for dessert, and I then became a big fan of this bakery,  Even after putting her on a B-52 ejection seat out of my life, I still frequently this bakery for their mini cream puffs.  Damn, those little guys kick some ass, and I rather eat a set of three mini puffs than a Beard Papa cream puff any day of the week, and twice of Sunday.  I better stop writing about these puffs, or I might get a call from one of my friends in Henderson; telling me to get some for her. \n\nAs far as bakeries in the Chinatown area, I really like this one because of a very good selection of sinful food porn, and Korean shave ice.  The owner and employees of Crown bakery are very friendly to everyone, and take pride in keeping the entire business nice, tight, and clean.  This is refreshing because the other bakery in the next door always gets nailed for health violations by the SNHD.   \n\nCrown does make one of the best unsliced white toast in the Las Vegas valley, and all of you know what that can make....A oozing sweetness of a Japanese Honey Butter Toast. I better slap myself, because I'm now thinking of driving down there tomorrow, and making a couple of them for the hell of it.        .    \n\nOne final thing, thank you Alyce for finding this place for me.  I should have known something was wrong with you, because how on Earth does someone slam the side panel of a brand new Camry into a concrete pillar in a totally empty Clark County downtown parking lot?   It was your idea to get the license on a Sunday afternoon.  LOL!  Oh well. at least, I can still get my cream puffs, and eat it too.
