DAS was a nightmare. We signed up with them to move the car cross country and they gave us a three week estimate. After three weeks they had no idea when the car would be moved. No idea at all! They had not offered us the insurance which would allowed us a rental car if they were late and would not let us pay for it at that point. The wait times on the phone were horrendous. The staff were nice but helpless. We used another auto moving company and still were charged $100 which they will not refund. I feel like they stole from us. We were grateful to get our car out of the lot and out of DAS.  If I could give negative stars I would.   Sad.
