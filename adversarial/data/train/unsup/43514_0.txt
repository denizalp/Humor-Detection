Nunez did a GREAT job and very pleased and was very competitive in their pricing and the only one that offered a longer warranty wanted several hundred $$ more.  Lorena and her team were efficient, attention to detail and for our home they were in\/out in 2 days. Can't recommend Nunez Painting enough and may get more work from us another home we own.
