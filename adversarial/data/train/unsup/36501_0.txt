Very nice store with knowledgeable owner\/staff. I stopped in while on a road trip so I didn't have much time. I only shopped the \"miniatures\" side of the store. They have a lot of inventory so it would be nice to browse awhile. The prices are in line with similar stores and range from very affordable to total splurge. I will definitely try to return.
