Last night I received a deep laceration on my foot while in the Hershey store, by no fault of my own. I was left sitting on the floor bleeding for quite a bit of time before seeing a manager or any kind of first aid. Still bleeding, a security team member wheeled me to the security desk where I was left under the care of Diana. She was rude and showed no proper first aid training when it came to dressing the wound or giving information on treatment options. My understanding was that I could receive a bandaid or pay for ems to take me to a hospital. She gave off the impression that my bleeding foot was an inconvenience to her.\n\nTo add insult to injury, I was wheeled from a small area to the open casino floor rather than a private room to wait for bleeding to stop. I have attached photos. I absolutely cannot believe that such a large organization leaves first aid to a department with horrible customer service, has no area designated for first aid, and does not offer to pay for professional medical assistance when a guest is injured on the property.
