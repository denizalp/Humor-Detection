Neat to be shopping underground at this massive mall which reminded me of Tokyo Central station where everything's underground and there isn't a tremendous amount of natural light and you have to follow the signs to get to where you're headed lest you take the wrong exit and end up halfway across Montreal!\n\nLots of retail shopping options, tons of restaurants of all sorts and prices.\n\nI wasn't planning on buying anything and I managed to stick with it. But it was a close call.
