The Saddledome hosts a variety of events including the Calgary Stampede and professional sports teams including the Calgary Flames (NHL Hockey), the Calgary Hitmen (Western Hockey League) and the Calgary Roughnecks (Indoor Lacrosse). I came here recently to enjoy a Roughnecks game. \n\nMy hosts (Jim and Kathy) also took me to dinner in one of the \"member\" dining areas within the bowels of this facilities. That would be the more casual one featuring sandwiches and such, along with a cold one. The food was tasty, my friends were engaging, and there was a lot of happy energy in the room. \n\nI came in here wondering when the Saddledome might be replaced. It's a very functional arena that is clean and well maintained. On the other hand, it's on the older side and I don't think up to modern owner money maximization standards. The conversations are probably out there and I'm sure the Community is struggling with what kind of owner subsidy they're comfortable. In any event, I enjoyed my night out and the hospitality of my friends and the good folks who run the Saddledome.
