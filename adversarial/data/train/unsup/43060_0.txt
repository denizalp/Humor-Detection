Food=yummy. I liked my house-made pumpkin tea and acai bowl, and my friends enjoyed their sandwiches. They raved about the juice, too. It's fairly vegan friendly and very vegetarian friendly, though there are some meat options as well. \n\nService=slow! Our food took a while to come out and our waiter disappeared once we had it, though he was certainly working his hardest, as the place was incredibly understaffed. It's a cute spot with great eats, they just a few more folks working there!
