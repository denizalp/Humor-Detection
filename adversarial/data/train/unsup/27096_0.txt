Burrito was pretty good. Whoever says these burritos are like the ones in the Mission either haven't been to the Mission or are just liars. The burrito had pico and sour cream but those were the only similarities shared with its Nor-Cal cousin. I like all the SF pics, but the burrito was meager just like all the other burritos in this dessert. I was so stoked too! Bummer.\n\nAnd good price? I paid $7 for a carne asada \"super\" burrito. Not bad, but with no leftovers not cheap either.
