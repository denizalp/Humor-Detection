At first I was a little hesitant to try this place because of a few negative reviews.  That and the previous two restaurants here always seemed to struggle with customer service.  So naturally I thought oh here we go again...  I couldn't be anymore wrong.\n\nThe service was top notch.  Our food came out promptly and the servers checked up on us frequently but not over the top.  Needless to say our drinks never went empty. \n\nWe started with the wings which came out pretty quickly. Had a nice tangy bbq kick to it. \n\nMy wife had the Foo Burger.  She said it reminded her of Bachi burger but slightly better which speaks volumes because it's one of our favorite spots. \n\nI'm not much of ramen fan but I'm sold on anything with Pork Belly so  figured I'd give the Pork Belly ramen a try.  I was pleasantly surprised and will look forward trying the other noodle dishes. \n\nI think the service alone is good enough for us to come back and from what I understand they're also known for their sushi so will have to come back and give that a try.
