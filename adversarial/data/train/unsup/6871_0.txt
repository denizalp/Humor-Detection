7-11 stores are terrific (for the most part).  This particular store is located on the corner of Paradise Road and Twain Ave.\n\nI stopped here to fill up the tank, and to pick up a case of water.  Gas prices were reasonable.  When I walked into the store I was surprised with how dirty the interior was.  The floors were filthy with spills that obviously had been there for a couple of hours.  They had 3 employees on duty that evening.  There was no line at the counter.  One staff member could have easily made the time to mop the floor.  It is hard to miss such an obvious mess when it is in the main traffic area of the store.\n\nOther than the filthy floors, everything else about the store was fine.  Shelves were well-stocked and organized.  The girl who helped me was kind and helpful.  \n\nSolid 3 star convenience store.  Just clean your floors regularly.
