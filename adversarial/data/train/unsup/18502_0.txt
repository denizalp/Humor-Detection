Surrender Club...\n\nWe came in around 1am (we saw the Thunder from Down Under guys - oh yeah) and just danced the night away. The place was packed especially near the stage and stripper poles. My girlfriends know me and this other girl have been taking lessons but come on now... In a club? \n\nOkay, so I just did some spins bc I was wearing pantyhose and that prevents you from climbing the pole well.  But security took us down. Come on! \n\nPros:\n* you can go across the pool and sit in the casino\/club area.\n* bar near casino not busy\n* has pool area\n\nCon:\n* crowded at dance area\n* a lot of security had stuff up their... Noses, yeah...\n\nNote: get on guest list if you know ome one or not. We were 10 girls. No problem.
