My wife came home after having her car washed at Quick C rather distressed.  For a $30 car wash plus tip they really didn't do a good job.  The outside of the car was fine, which the machine did most of the work for them.  It was the lack of attention to detail on the interior that was disappointing.   They didn't vacuum out the back hatch at all, nor the back seats.  The back seats were obviously covered in dust and they were not wiped down, and the cupholders were not cleaned at all.  The small cubby area under the radio wasn't touched, and obvious places where they chose to vacuum and not vacuum.  \n\nOn top of that, the attendant that did the cleaning not only got a tip, but he asked my wife for a cigarette, and did not ask her to look at the work done for her approval (which they usually do).\n\nI really wanted to contact the manager or owner directly with pictures I took so they could see, but there's no corporate website or anyway to contact them via the web.
