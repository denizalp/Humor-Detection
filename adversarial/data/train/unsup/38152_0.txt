Really disappointed with this place. Looks great when you go in. Well staffed and expected great produce to match. First thing that should have concerned us was the staffs replies to a lady at the counter. She asked if the meat was organic. A reasonably simple question. The staff member first didn't answer but then replied no. When she then asked about antibiotics\/ any information, all he knew was that it was all Ontario chicken. For a place that specializes in poultry, you would expect some more information. \nAnyway bought some of their sauce for wings, a pound of wings as and a butterflied chicken- which was vacuum packed and had a use by date of nearly two weeks after. \nThe next day, we realized the wing sauce had a best before date of the day before ie day we bought it. I have a big issue with this not being highlighted or reduced. Sauce itself and the wings were good but half the jar wasted as I wouldn't have used it any later then that. Today I went to used the butterflied chicken. There is still 4 days before it supposedly goes off, however it stinks. No way could have even used it a few days ago. And no way to return it as no one will walk around with gone off poultry to show them\/ keep receipt from week ago. \nWill never use again- cheap products with a nice store front
