I came here with some friends for breakfast because I heard good things about the place.\n\nI ordered the pecan sticky bun, because it looked delicious.  It tasted, however, terrible.  It was hard like a rock, not like a sticky bun ought to be.  I had to ask for another one, and the lady realized all the other buns were hard too, so she had to take it back to microwave it to soften it.  Didn't help too much.\n\nThe chocolate croissant tasted like chocolate bread.  NOT a croissant.  Bread.\n\nThe apple turnover was decent - it had some crispy texture to it with an ok filling.  McDonald's makes better apple pies.\n\nThe twice baked croissant with almonds was pretty good - probably the best thing I tried that morning.  \n\nSalted caramel brownie was very dense.  It had good flavor, but there's no way I could eat an entire thing, or even half of one, in one sitting.  Maybe I just don't get the salted caramel craze.\n\nAt least the coffee was pretty good.  And you get a free refill.  A little bit of redemption there.\n\nI'm just not sure why this place has such great ratings.  Some may say decor, environment, convenience of it being 24 hours, etc.  But if the food is no good, why should any of that other stuff matter?  Just go to Waffle House.  It's cheaper there.
