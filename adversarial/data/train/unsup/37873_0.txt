So this Panera bread is surrounded by other restaurants and shops. And if you have eaten out of narrow bread before it is just like every other player bread there is :-). The service was good prices were the same as anywhere else. There was ample indoor and outdoor seating.\n All in all it was a good experience. The service was rather slow and there was not enough individuals ordering or eating there to warrant slow service. But the service was done with a smile and that is always appreciated.
