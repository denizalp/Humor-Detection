There's so many ramen restaurants in town and this is one of my fav, indeed this is my fav! \n\nSpicy miso & tonkotsu shoyu are my favorites.  Lately my hubby is addicted to spicy tonkotsu ramen as well.  All the ramen tasted delish, the broth was rich but not too salty, the ramen was al dente.  Yum! \n\nI love their takoyaki, it's lightly crunch and crispy. Texture was amazing!\n\nThe seating there is very comfy and inviting, very authentic Japanese style, parking usually is easy.  \n\nI like the other ramen places too but most of them have a hectic parking situation or the line is ridiculously long.  \n\nThey have happy hours during the weekday, 3-6pm, almost half price on the alcohol & most appetizers.  Love it!
