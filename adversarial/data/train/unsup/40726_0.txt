This was my first time at Papa Nick's.   I had lunch with a girlfriend who grew up in the neighborhood and thought that I would enjoy this place.  I must say, I did enjoy my lunch.   The place is small & cozy.  We were warmly greeted upon entering and chose a window seat.   We both ordered pasta meals which comes with salad and homemade italian bread w\/butter.   I ordered the rigatoni with mushroom sauce ($7.00) and italian sausage (+$1.50).  The house salad consisted of lettuce, slightly spicy whole pepper, pepperoni and lots of fresh mozzarella cheese.  I opted for the house dressing, which was tangy and very flavorful.   The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce, mushrooms and sausage, paired perfectly.  The serving was more than ample, I boxed more than 1\/2 to take home (probably ate more bread than I should have:-).   All in all, this was a great meal and I would definitely go back.
