This is a comment to kelly.  your response is over a month late to even consider to be serious.  you dishonored a veteran on veteran's day. shame on you!  if you do so many good things for vets, then why would you humiliate and show disrespect to one on veteran's day. This is not personal-it's for all the vets who should be aware of your on this special day. !!! you should not be allowed to treat vets in this way.  Shame on you again!
