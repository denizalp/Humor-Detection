For my daughter's 1st birthday, we decided to get our cakes at Robert's based on the high rating it has here on Yelp.  Today, I picked up the cake, quickly observing the baby's \"smasher\" cake, and not the main cake.  I was not blown away by how it looked, but if it tastes good, then I could easily forget it.\n\nI brought the cakes in and wife opened them to check them out.  Immediately, she said, \"What the heck, is this nuts?!\"  The outside of the normal sized cake for my family and my 8 year olds to enjoy had some sort of crushed nuts rolled all around it.  My wife was furious, but decided to give Robert's a chance, and called just to make sure that we had been given the correct cake.  The conversation proceeded as such:\n\nWife: Hi, my name is Kim, my husband just picked up our cakes, and I was calling to make sure that we got the correct cake.\nBefore she could even explain what the issue is, whoever answered responded:\nRobert's: They are just pecans, no one is allergic to pecans, there is no problem.\nAgain, my wife didn't even state that she was calling because of the outside of the cake, which is suspect.\nWife: When I ordered the cake, he didn't say there would be nuts on it, and I asked for plain, simple vanilla.\nRobert's: I understand that, but they are just nuts, don't worry about it.\n\nIf my wife had made a stink over the nuts, I can understand the gentleman's attitude, but to preemptively dismiss an error in the making without admitting some sort of fault is just poor business.  Maybe I could forgive the issue if the cake turned out to taste awesome, but my 8 year-olds, whom the cake was intended for, do not like nuts.\n\nRobert's will not get any further business from us, and we will be sure to let others know that they are not pleasant to work with.  For $40+ for a cake, the disgusting attitude that was given over their error is definitely not acceptable.
