Had a nice time here,  food was good,  salad bar was ok.  Service was fast. They bring your steak out on a very hot stone and the steak is  raw.  So you cut it into pcs and it cooks.  They have seasoning  at the table its a cool idea.  Now can i make a better steak at home  yes. But i cam say that for 90% of the steak places out here.  The  real fun started aftre i finished my steak. Cause the rock stays very hot for a long time. Kids and i had fun  putting cubes on it and seeing how fast they melt.    Put a left over tomato on it watched that cook. A onion.   Place is  fun kids had a good time.   I would go back for that reason.
