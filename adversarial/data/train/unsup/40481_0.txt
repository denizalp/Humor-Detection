Local hardware store in Cuyahoga Falls. I've driven past it for 8 years but never stopped in. A project led me to needing black pipe. The owner special ordered the pipe (the big stores didn't have what I needed), opened the store on the 4th of July for me and cut\/threaded the pipe exactly to my needs. Best customer service in my book!
