New favorite vegan italian! Id feel better giving a 5 star if they were 100% vegan, but their menu was fantastic. Baked ziti and soy sausage was incredible, and their calzone was one of the best ive ever had in general. Patricia visited our table and offered us to try their angel bites as a desert, which was scrumptious. Since my experience was based strictly off of their vegan menu, they definitely earned the stars. This was my first time visiting and would definitely stop by again when i get the chance.
