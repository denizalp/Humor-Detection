Aura Cleaners is tucked away on the P1 level of the Aura building (where Marshalls and Bed Bath & Beyond are).  It's closer to the College Park entrance, and just next to a convenience store. I stumbled upon this place while walking through the area and decided to try to hem a pair of shorts here. The woman who works here has a degree in fashion design and it shows - she did an excellent job and I fully intend of bringing all of my alterations here in the future! Their prices are very reasonable and the location is convenient.
