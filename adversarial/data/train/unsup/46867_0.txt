I love Oregano's, I tried the ricotta filled pasta, it was supper yummy, I personally asked for sundried tomatoes on them and I swear they made the dish extra yummy! My family and I went to celebrate my sister's graduation. We waited about 10 minutes then were seated in a  booth. I really don't have any complaints besides there being a ton of flies inside, must have been because they had the door open... But other then that I will def come back again!
