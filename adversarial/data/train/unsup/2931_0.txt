First, they don't answer their phone. Next, they are closed between lunch and dinner. Finally, it is ridiculously OVER PRICED for the area and quality. $43?! I literally pay $24 for the exact same order at another pho spot very close. I'm not opposed to paying out the nose for great food, but it better be just that. And it isn't.
