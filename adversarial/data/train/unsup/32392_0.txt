Breakfast this AM. Tempeh with potatoes , onions green peppers and eggs was a disappointment!! I think I found two pieces of tempeh which would both fit on my little finger nail. A spec of green pepper, same for onion. Lots of diced potatoes. Good flavor. \n\nMy friend had the zucchini potatoes pancakes which were incredible.\n\nWould return but would no order the Tempeh. Again.
