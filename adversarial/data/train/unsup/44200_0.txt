Nice spot. I spent an excellent afternoon watching the Euro game this past weekend. Bar was crowded, but service was great. Excellent bier on tap, including some for as low as $10\/litre. Owner was friendly, cleared space for our big group, and gave us some recommendations of other places to visit in town. I could use a Bitburger right now.
