I have very mixed feelings about this place after visiting the first time last night.\n\nPros\nThe food was fantastic! We ordered chili con Queso to start. It tasted like a good mix of nacho cheese with pice de gallo on it. As well very well at the complementary salsa. I also ordered the shrimp jalape√±os. They were surprisingly better than we planned! The had great flavor and just enough heat. Highlight of the meal definitely has to be the fajitas though. We ordered the beef fajitas for one and split them, it was plenty of meat only thing we needed was extra tortillas. The carne asada was super flavorful and the veggies were grilled perfectly. \n\nCons\nWe ordered the small chili con queso but got charged for a large one.\n\nWe ordered 2 shots of Correlejo rep at 9.95\/per shot. The shots were no more than .75 ounces (pretty sure they were only .5 oz) when I mentioned something to our server about how much it would cost to get a bigger shot he told us those were 2 ounce shots. Me being a bartender for many many years knows the difference. He then brought us 2 more shots on the house. But I feel totally scammed. Had I not said anything they were charging me $20 for less than 2oz of tequila.\n\nI then got the spicy pineapple margarita, which tasted as if it had no pineapple in it, so I asked for a small side of pineapple juice so sweeten it up a little. Get the bill and he charged us $1.50 for it. \n\nWhen I go out I plan on spending money, and understand that you have to charge for things, but between getting charged for the wrong appetizer, getting shorted on the shots and getting charged for a small side of pineapple juice I don't know how to feel about this place, which sucks because the food is amazing!
