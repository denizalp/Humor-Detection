Highly disappointing. Not only was it a pain in the ass to get to (at the farthest end of the hotel) but security was hassling us for our room key because you had to use the guest elevators to get there. Not my problem bro! Don't have a restaurant located within the guest room towers then!\n\nFrench onion soup was too sweet and lukewarm at that. Steak frites were good but nothing impressive.  The best part about it were the fries which were crispy & golden brown.\n\nMoules frites were fine but again, nothing spectacular.\n\nTomato salad was the same - nothing spectacular.\n\nOverall, i liked the ambiance but the food did not meet my expectations. I would probably come back to try brunch but not again for dinner.
