Toronto is a very difficult city to shop for anything in the plant and garden category when you don't have a car.\n\nFortunately Davenport Garden Centre is accessible to bus and subway users. On top of that, the service is stellar and the selection is top notch.\n\nOf course, you get what you pay for, and all that good stuff doesn't come cheap. But then again, neither does a car! So there's your trade-off.\n\nWe went today for a wreath and some holiday garland. Ended up with mistetoe too. Ooh-la-la! Not cheap, but the stuff is in great shape and they took care of us lickety-split and with ease. In a town where runners spit on me on the sidewalk*, there's definitely something to be said for service!\n\n*yea, for reals. Toronto is getting just as bad as NY for crazy rude people. I was walking up Yonge Street last week and some deranged runner passed me and (Maybe I didn't move out of his way fast enough?) turned and spit in my general direction. Don't worry! I'm from New York so I of course yelled after him and called him a loser. Which he was. He then proceeded to get into a fight with a cab driver at the next traffic light. So now you see why I am becoming more and more appreciative of polite and kind service. Have a nice day!
