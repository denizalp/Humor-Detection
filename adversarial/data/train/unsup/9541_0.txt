Oh Mario how I hate to give this restaurant 3 stars which I would rate as 3.5 because of your exceptional Octopus dish. So many years idolizing you and trying to get reservations to your restaurant in New York Babbo but to no avail so I was so excited in trying your Italian cuisine. First the seating was horrible. I sat on the booth side and there is a definite flaw in the design. The seat is too low and the table to high making it uncomfortable to eat.  I was not the only person to comment on it. Another party sat beside us and they quickly commented how odd the seating was and asked to move.  The seating was just the beginning, the service was not great.  The waitress forgot the side dish altogether and didn't even let us know about the chocolate budino (souffl√©) which usually takes 20 minutes and is customary to ask if you would be wanting so they could prepare beforehand. We ordered the orecchiette with lamb sausage and rapini. The dish was good, but nothing out of this world. The octopus was the only dish we had that I considered to be worthy of a four and five star restaurant.  I had the rabbit porchetta which was different, but wouldn't order again. We also had the Veal Chop which was  good. Not even the dessert was pulled off.  We ordered the chocolate cake served with a peanut butter shake. The chocolate cake was hard as if it was frozen, on the other hand the milk shake was phenomenal. The seating, service and dishes that were average contributed my 3.5 stars. I am disappointed since I have been a fan of Mario Batali for many years and I refuse to believe this is all there is so I will be going to Lunch at his other restaurant Otto. Hopefully this will help restore my vision of him as a master of Italian cuisine.
