Hawthorn Grill is a new favorite. I go back regularly because of Kit, the bartender. He's quite the mixologist, and remembered my favorite cocktails at each visit. We've been several times for dinner, lunch on the patio, and twice for brunch. Service is usually good, but the whole brunch experience needs to be re-worked. There's so much potential, but the egg service misses the rest of the brunch buffet. I want my eggs with the rest of my meal.\n\nWe were there last Sunday for a birthday brunch. A large group of us wanted to sit in the bar to have brunch, watch football, and have Kits incredible cocktails. Poor Kit was trying to do everything himself, with not a bus boy in sight to bring us water or coffee. The shift manager was standing across the room watching from a distance. Not jumping in like a team player, and helping. Just watching. When I approached and asked if she could have someone bring us 3pots of coffee to leave on the tables, she managed to reluctantly assist. She didn't send bus boys to clear our plates, or anything. She wanted the bartender to make drinks for the entire restaurant, bar and our table of 15. Mind you, I had reserved this table more than 24 hours in advance and she didn't have a full restaurant. I believe that she could've gotten someone to assist. I later heard her reprimanding the bartender for not bringing us coffee. I didn't ask him for coffee. I'd asked HER for coffee. It seems to me that trying to sabotage one of your most talented team members is counterintuitive to the success of the restaurant. I will not subject Kit to that kind of aggravation. I found a great bartender, close to home, and I want to keep him there. I highly recommend giving Hawthorn Grill a try. The steaks are terrific, and patio dining in the warmer months is nice. Beautiful room and most staff are friendly. Except that brunch manager. She rubbed me the wrong way.
