After we moved to this side of town, I had to find a closer nail shop. After reading the reviews, I decided to try them out. I am so glad I did. I don't know how anyone has had a bad experience with them because I really could not be any more pleased. The shop is pleasant and clean. I had a 3pm appointment and arrived early. They had me in within minutes, pretty fast considering there were four other people already being worked on. I had to have my old nails taken off and a whole new set put on. The young man who removed my nails did use a nail tip to remove them, like another review stated. But he was very gentle and even though I have scar tissue from a botched set a few months ago, it did not hurt. Sadly I did not catch the name of the lady who did my nails and design, due to a rude customer who came in, but the nail tech did a great job. Plus she kept her cool with the extremely rude customer. I brought in a picture I found on pintrest of Valentine's nails I wanted. The nail lady asked if I wanted gel or regular, I asked her opinion and she was very clear and helpful in her opinion. I ended up getting the gel and her design was spot on. She was EXTREMELY  gentle and VERY quick. I have had full set take hours with designs. I was in and out with everything in a little under two hours. She was very polite and even made sure I was comfortable, such as asking if I wanted water. I will gladly be back and recommend them to everyone I can.
