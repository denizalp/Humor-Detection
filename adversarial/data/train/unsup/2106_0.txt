New Hawaiian restaurant that replaced the former House of Aloha. The location just opened yesterday so it still looks similar to the setup of the restaurant it replaced. There was someone measuring things around the restaurant so I'm sure there will be some renovations coming. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by staff and even Baba B himself was hanging out. Everyone was super friendly and attentive. \n\nWe ordered a mini teri beef plate and a mini garlic chicken plate. Each came with a side of Mac salad, too. The teri beef was delicious! The beef was tender, juicy, and both sweet and savory. The garlic chicken was juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. The garlic sauce, served on the side, was the perfect accompaniment to the crispy chicken. Everything came out piping hot and pretty quickly. The portions were generous, too. The Mac salad was good, but could use a touch more seasoning. For dessert, we ordered the banana cream pie. It was light and creamy, with plenty of bananas and filling. So comforting and a great way to end the meal. \n\nThe staff informed us that the official grand opening will be on April 28. There are tons of items on their menu so I'm sure we'll be back on the 28th...and plenty more times after that.
