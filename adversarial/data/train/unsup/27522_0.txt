Went here for PJ's - Breakfast for dinner night.  I like this place.  I was glad to have a good excuse to visit.  Hang out with friends, help those in need, eat some good food.\n\nI went pretty plain on the Denver omelette..  I may have tried the chorizo, but I had hit my chorizo quota for the week already.. \n\nThe place is clean.  Servers are friendly.  They have funny quotes on the walls (love the Steven Wright one...)\n\nI will return..  Maybe even for actual breakfast.
