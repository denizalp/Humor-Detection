I came in based on reviews and the fact that I was in the neighborhood. The bar is located in the middle of the room for easy access to all patrons. If you love to dance, this is the place for you. I went on a Saturday night and I'm guessing it was a Latin night because all the music the DJ played was in tune with that theme. I'm a terrible dancer but even in Chinatown it's hard not to enjoy and get into that Latin beat! It was a little empty at the start of the evening but by 1a, the place was alive with music and dancing. If you're in the neighborhood, don't be put off by the emptiness. Give it an hour and you'll be hooked!
