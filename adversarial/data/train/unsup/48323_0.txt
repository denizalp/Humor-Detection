While the location of this restaurant is superb, the food is pretty good and the service average.\nI saw \"Wicked\" at the Benedum and we ate here first. It was about 5 degrees outside  when we got there and they make you take you coat off at the door. We stood by the door waiting for our table with door opening and closing for people arriving. \nTables are really tight. If you don't speak really, really softly, tables nearby can hear you. Young girl beside me was texting and I could have read her texts if I wanted too.\n\nChicken Piccatta was very good. Veal special was equally good. House salad dressing was described to me by the waiter as \" a balsamic vinegrette with dry bleu cheese crumbles\". Perfect for me and my guest. When the bill came they charged us $1.50 each for dry bleu. I always order dry bleu and I always pay extra for it with no problem. But he described it as part of the dressing and that bugs me. So if I had ordered the Sun-dried tomato dressing on my salad, would I have been charged extra for sun-dried tomatoes?\nAll in all, a decent place to eat before a show simply for the convenience. But there are many places to choose from and I will try somewhere else next time.
