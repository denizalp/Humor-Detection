Perfect, again.\n\nCame back here with friends to enjoy brunch. I can't get over how quaint, beautiful, and nice the atmosphere is here. We were seated at a large table to the side of the bar and the setting is perfect to begin a relaxing day. \n\nThis time, I tried a Bloody Mary - delish! Look at how beautiful this thing is (pictured). For my meal, I enjoyed their brisket benedict. These were cooked perfectly -- the poached eggs, the crisp bread soaking up all the deliciousness, the tasty and perfect textured brisket -- all great! I also couldn't pass up an order of their crispy date-glazed bacon! I also had some of their ruby red grapefruit segments with candied ginger and seriously, look at how beautiful this thing is. \n\nThe coffee is hot and delicious and the service is stellar.\n\nYears and years later this is still one of my favorite places for breakfast\/brunch on the strip!
