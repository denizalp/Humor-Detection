For those who idolize this brand, this is a sanctuary. Plenty of people having never ending conversations on how god-like Apple is. Meh! I bought the new 7plus only to make my boyfriend happy. Long waiting and no podium to sign in. The sign in guy is one of the 20 floor sales agents wearing a red shirt. But it is a one-stop-shop for this brand.
