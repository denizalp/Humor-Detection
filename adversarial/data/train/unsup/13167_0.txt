Dessert has been a new love of mine. I don't really have a sweet tooth and I don't crave chocolate like most girls do. But at Payard, they make chocolate look and taste so luxurious, decadent, and rich. \n\nBut the dessert I come here for are the macaroons!!!! So crazy how these cute, little pastries are the new thing - like how cupcakes were 8 years ago. But man, why do they got to be so expensive?!\n\nMacaroons were breed from France. Payard is a french patisserie....get your macaroons from Payard!
