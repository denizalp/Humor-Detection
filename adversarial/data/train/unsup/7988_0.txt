Boltini is the bar with a sexual orientation crisis.  The staff is mostly gay, the clientel is mostly gay, the music is gay, the decor is gay, etc.   When I'm home in the 'Paign and I have extra money to burn I love to sit outside at Boltini and watch the people pass by in Downtown Champaign.  Boltini is pretty much the bar you go to when you \"graduate\" from C Street so I'm always bound to run into someone I know.  Sitting outside isn't as amusing as it used to be when \"Three Dollar Margaret\" used to roam Neil Street hitting people up for money, but it's still fun to watch everyone thinking Downtown Champaign is Chicago....it's not.  If you're in Champaign and want to avoid Highdive (do so at ALL costs) and don't want to deal with the high school reunion at Guido's go to Boltini.  You'll leave broke but you'll have a great time!
