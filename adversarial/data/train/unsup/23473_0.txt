Yes, Harris Teeter costs a bit more than other grocery stores.  This is part of their business plan.  Harris Teeter isn't here to compete directly with Food Lion and Walmart.  Have any of you actually compared a trip to the Walmart on Dave Lyle with one to the Harris Teeter on Celanese?  Sure...they both sell food, but they sell entirely different experiences.\n\nYou don't see a \"People of Harris Teeter\" website do you (www.peopleofwalmart.com)?  Buttcracks, body odor, women in slippers, bellies hanging out, crackheads, greasy mullets, swimsuit wearing shoppers, bad tattoos, muffintops, Camaro hair, the overweight scooter crew, pajamas, people with really bad tattoos and meth mouth are all common sights at Wally World. Not Harris Teeter.  (Okay...so yes...they are direct competitors...but you see where I'm going with this)\n\nSure, those sights may be amusing from time to time...but not if you have a busy life.  Most of us want a hassle free experience with a selection of great products.  Harris Teeter offers both.\n\nThis store is clean, the management is nice and helpful, as are the workers.  The sushi here is surprisingly good and the pizzas are way better than anything that's being delivered to your door.  In fact, the pizzas rival most of the pizza joints in town.\n\nThis location would get five stars if they were bigger.  I realize that I'm not going to find everything I want since this is the Rock Hill location.  \n\n*Adding the \"special item request\" online would be nice...FYI.\n\n\nTry:  The East Coast Fresh Cuts Salsa (It's fresh, and it doesn't get better unless you make it yourself.\n\nAvoid:  The deli's mac'n'cheese.  I'm not sure how many calories this stuff has, but if I didn't have clogged arteries before...I do now.  If cardiac arrest sounds appealing to you, the mac'n'cheese is an excellent side to help you along.
