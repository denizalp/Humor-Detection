I took my Pomeranian to get her first groom yesterday. I was super terrified because I didn't know how she was going to act because she is a very scared dog. When we got there the lady showed us around, made us comfortable, and talked to us about exactly what we wanted.. They even brought us to their computer to look at some examples and pictures. The groomer, Barb, really let us take our time deciding exactly what we want and didn't rush us at all. She told us that our pom's coat might not grow back the same after getting it cut, and I liked how honest she was about it. After dropping her off, it took about 2 hours and they called us that she was ready to be picked up. When I looked at my dog for the first time after being groomed, it brought tears to my eyes. Barb did such a great job, and had such a great attitude. I am going to continue to bring my pom there, and even bring in my other dog! They even have nice baths you can use there if you ever just want to come in and wash them there! They are leveled up high so you dont have to bend over or get on your knees to wash your animal so I thought that was pretty cool.
