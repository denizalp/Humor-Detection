Been here twice and liked it both times.  \n\nThe first time I went I had the crying dragon.  It was steak that came on a sizzling hot plate with spinach, onions, and bell peppers under it.  It also came with this special sauce that was very good with the steak.  It came with a bowl of rice. Yum!\n\nThe second time I went I just go the beef pad thai.  I ordered it hot but I should have ordered it medium hot and added more spice to it if I needed to.\n\nYou get a lot for the price here.  The service is good the waitress we had both time was very nice.
