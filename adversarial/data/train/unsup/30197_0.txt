TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!! We ordered spicy rice cake and half of chicken. The chicken came out about 20 minutes but spicy rice cake didn't come out about 40 minutes. So i asked one of the servers and she forgot to order the rice cake so we waited another 20 min.\nbut the chiefs forgot to add extra noodles and cheese. Me and my boyfriend were about to explode and die out of hunger (the chicken was half) and we waited another 10 min. GUESS WHAT. There was small piece of fried chicken inside of spicy rice cake. Disgusting. Never ever going back again.\n\n              1
