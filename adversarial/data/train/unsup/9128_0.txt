We did not enjoy being harassed by some guy with a pit bull when our nice husky was just sniffing his dog. He harassed us for 5 minutes straight-to leave even though we had just as much a right to be there as him. Our husky was not doing anything but playing and it was really dumb so we just left. It made my wife feel unsafe to be harassed for nothing. What a dick. Quail run is the way better dog park and you won't get any bs that comes with bringing your family member around.
