I hate poutine.  \n\nSo this may not be a fair review.  This was our first stop in Montreal, as a \"must-do.\"  I don't dislike must-do lists in general, unless they include things like poutine.\n\nArtless.  Soggy.  Flavorless (unless you count grease and salt).  All quantity and zero quality.  \n\nI tried to keep an open mind, but I thought I might throw up anyway when the \"small\" orders of poutine were put in front of us.\n\nI did like the creme fraiche delicated speckled throughout my poutine, which otherwise had heavy bouts of some kind of processed meat in it.  \n\nI like my fries crispy!  I like texture in my food.  I do not want my food to taste or look like the way all food ends up in my stomach -- half digested.\n\nAnd cheese curds - what the hell are cheese curds?  The droppings of other dairy products as they go through their processing factory?  Are they collected, packaged, and sold as cheese curds?  Yes, dairy-product-poop masquerading as an edible treat, the perfect crap to top your pile of crap with.  Is it possible to have taste-blindness -- or does everyone assume they are the unfortunate few who have it for cheese curds?  Do we now enjoy densely-packed calories tasting of nothing?  Models eat tissue paper to stay full, you know.  There's another option.\n\nThis is turning into a rant against poutine so I will stop discussing that here.  I did walk away with a nice stomachache despite eating 1\/4th of my small plate.   \n\nThere's a nice mosaic mirror thing when you first walk in.  It's pretty.\n\nPS. If any Montreal residents are offended by this, please feel free to come to NYC and crap on our lox bagels, pizzas, hot dogs, reuben sandwiches, Halal carts, or anything else we are \"known\" for.  I really would not mind.
