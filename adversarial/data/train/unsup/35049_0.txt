I've been to saddleranch twice now. The first time was OK. The food was excellent and they give huge portions, but the service was sooo slow! We had to wait an inexcusable time to get our order taken and to get our check. And there were only 5 tables in the whole place. The second time was after a cardinals game, so it was busy. We waited 15 minutes for someone to come take our order. No one came so I went and asked. They said they would send someone. I excused it because they were busy. But we waited even longer and no one came so we left. After two bad experiences, I doubt I will go back.
