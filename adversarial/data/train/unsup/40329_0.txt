I called Kenny two weeks prior to our trip, was assured that a cab would be on time for us. I called the night before, confirmed a 4:45 am pickup in San Bruno, needed to be at the Cow Palace before 5:30. Kenny assured me the cab would be there at 4:45. Ten minutes late, I called and Kenny assured me the cab was on its way. It arrived at 5:20, I missed a very important commitment, and was unable to reach Kenny because he had apparently turned off his phone and my calls went to voicemail. I sent a text later in the day to find out what had happened, no reply. I sent a text when we returned from our trip, no reply. I sent a text today mentioning a potential Yelp review and got a fumbling \"I don't remember...\" reply. Very disappointing. If something goes wrong, just own up to it, answer your phone, reply to the texts, clear the air.
