This was the worst customer service I've ever received. My wife and I frequent several restaurants and bars. Our friends had a marriage reception at San Tan brewing (which we absolutely love) and everyone wanted to know where to go after hours. So we had cocktails and dealt with the rudest manager (don't swing the lights). My wife complained and her manager was even worse. He made the statement that he will always side with his employees over his customers. \n\nNEVER GOING BACK.
