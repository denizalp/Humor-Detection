Omg this place is so good. I can't handle it.  I got the burnt toffee Ice cream with the oatmeal and macadamia nut cookie and I almost collapsed in a fit of joy.  Then the other night I walked by and saw that there was not much cake left so I got a butter tart and it changed my life.  I never knew what love was before that tart.  All Butter tarts carry that convenience store stigma cuz typically the best you can hope for with a tart, is that it'll be just \"okay.\" HBC tarts are like finding a $50 bill on the ground.  Its the same feeling a squirrel would get if you dropped a box of pizza infront of it.  Twas quite the jackpot. Even the hype of this review doesn't illustrate how great the tarts are.  \n\nOh and also I had more carrot cake; its just so good.  And the people are so friendly.  I haven't tried everything yet but rumor has it there's a red velvet\/coconut situation with the cakes that I look forward to investigating.  I'm so worried that my taste buds will explode from the flavor overload. Best desserts everrrr\n\n5 stars!!!!
