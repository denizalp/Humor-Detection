Vegas is definitely a town known for innovation. The Linq is a fairly new hotel on the strip, and this trip I strayed from my usuals (the Bellagio\/Cesar's Palace) and decided on trying out a new hotel. The biggest pro is that this hotel is in the center of it all, right on the strip. Very convenient, as Planet Hollywood, The Forum Shops, Paris, the Fashion Show Mall, etc. are all in walking distance. Also, the small mall in the exit was adorable. Sprinkles Cupcakes and Havianas are located in this little mall, and are some definite go to's. The gym is very bougie and kept very clean, with a nice variety of equipment. I went both nights around 1AM and had the gym completely to myself, which was a big plus. \n\nNow, similarly to a lot of the Vegas tourists, I came with my family. My little brother and I planned on spending some time at the pool during our stay, so we made sure to allot some time for the pool in between our activities. I called to find out the hours, and also make sure that our underage selves would be permitted into the pool. I was told that half of the pool was 21+, and the rest was available to all ages. \n\nMidday we came back to our hotel, put on our bathing suits and sunscreen, and made our way down to the pool. Only to be denied entry. Apparently, the lady on the phone had no idea what she was talking about. Hotel residents have to be 21+ to visit the pool. SO lame. My little brother and I had to waste even more of our day going back to the room and sadly changing out of our dry suits. I wish I had gotten the name of the girl on the phone who told me we would be allowed in. Vegas has undoubtedly become a super popular family vacation spot. Hotels should be accommodating this. :(
