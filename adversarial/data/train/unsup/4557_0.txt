Great support when you are buying. TERRIBLE support after you buy. Only got 1 key fob. Was told that the second one might show up in a couple of days. Never did. Nick told me he could get one at a discount. That was 4 months ago. Tried texting, emailing, and calling. Asked to speak to the office manager. She said Nick would follow up. Nick finally called - 3 weeks ago. Said he needed a copy of my drivers license and registration which I sent to him that day. Haven't heard nothing since. Sent a follow up email a week ago asking how long this is going to take. NO response!  So that you know, once you buy you are on your own.
