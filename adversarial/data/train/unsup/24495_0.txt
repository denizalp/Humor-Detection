It's hot in Vegas this time of year.  Very hot.  Somehow the pool area of the Flamingo found a way to turn up the heat by offereing free 10 Cane rum from 6pm to 10pm on a Friday in a setting where bikinis were the correct outfit of choice.\n\nIt started off relatively bar but slowly but surely the place got packed with what looked like LA chodes and chodettes.  Probably not the best for social interaction but at least they provide something decent to look at.  The music was alright and if I had dressed more appropriately (shorts and wife beater) I would have probably been able to do a whole lot more than sit on my ass and gulp down Jack and Cokes for a few hours.\n\nI really did feel like this place had the potential for a great night of drinking, dancing, and fun in the pool.  A few degrees cooler and I bet people would have been more apt to get up and shake their asses poolside.  If you ever hear about a pool party at the Flamingo I would suggest dressing to impress (poolside) and heading over.\n\nAny place that can inspire Bella to give me an impromptu lap dance can't be all that bad.
