I totally LOVE this place! The art deco flamingo lampshades gaudily clash with the mirror mosaic ceiling tiles, pink and purple neon lights and purple and turquoise seats (are they made of velour?!). There are fake trees and plants. The waitresses are dressed in brightly colored short dresses. What is not to love? The menu is varied with many breakfast or dinner choices. My southern fried steak was the best I can remember having. Ever. And I'm from TX. \n\nWe went with friends for brunch on a Sunday. Call ahead for a table if you don't want to wait. I'm glad I did so. I would love to go there as a last call stop after a night out on the Strip...it's gotta be an interesting place in the wee small hours if it was interesting on a late Sunday morning. \n\nThis is now going to be one of our this-is-Vegas spots for when people come to visit. \n\nLove it! :)
