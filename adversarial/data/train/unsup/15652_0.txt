I was thrilled with Freeway Chevrolet.\n\nI was treated with respect. (even after my deal fell through)\n\nI was treated fairly.  \n\nI never felt pressured.\n\nThe transaction was quick and painless.\n\nI will return here for my next Chevrolet. \n\nFelt like i was a valued customer.\n\n*Note: I purchased a vehicle here, and although I was financed, the terms were not what was agreed on, and after driving their vehicle for a week, I returned it with no problems.  They were professional and treated me very well.  I have NEVER been treated so well by a dealership.  I will return when in a better situation for myself. :)
