Dr. Becky is an Earth Angel! She has been a valuable asset to my daughter's healing! Her office is extremely kid friendly & that alone with an active toddler relieved quite a bit of stress I was experiencing taking her to a group style office. \n\nDr. Becky is so patient, nurturing, and understanding. She is extremely intuitive & just knows exactly what my daughter needs. My daughter loves Dr. Becky! And so do I. When we first started going my 19 month old daughter was not sleeping through the night & displaying aggressive behavior. Dr. Becky took the time to evaluate our lifestyle and suggested an alternative probiotic to what we were taking, that wasn't grown in casein & that the aggression was attributed to her gut. With my daughter's tongue tie that wasn't cut when she was younger we've experienced tension in her body & stomach issues, up until now. \n\nSince being under Dr. Becky's care my child is a different person. It's night & day. I didn't know if anything would change. I cried at our house 1st appointment because parenting had become so unbearable. I have my child back. And my sanity  (somewhat lol now she's 2) I know it's because of the consistent & high quality care we've experienced coming here. I highly recommend Dr. Becky especially for anyone looking for alternative & holistic treatment options to the standard Western medical model.
