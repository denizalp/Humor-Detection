I've experienced many quality massages over the years and having just moved to the area, I am very grateful to have found James at Snapp Therapeutics!\n\nAlong with a skillfully executed massage that targeted all my trouble areas in a wonderful way, I also got to float in a therapy pool and ended my session with a Biomat meditation that left me feeling energized and relaxed! Whether you have some serious issues that need to be addressed or you just need  to pamper yourself (and everyone does! It's good for your health!) , check out his sessions. You will be so glad you did!!\n\nJames was welcoming and knowledgable and really took the time to understand what was going on with me. He made the transition from pool to massage table to biomat very easy and comfortable and I loved that he used high quality essential oils during my massage!\nAs a chiropractor, I appreciate that he really understood the anatomy and could manipulate certain tissue in a way to give maximum release and therapeutic benefit. I can't wait to try his other offerings such as deep tissue, stone, etc.
