Make sure you ask all the questions, apparently they don't think they need to inform you. It was my first visit (new patient) they contacted me a week before as a reminder. The day of, I waited for 30 minutes in the waiting after filling out paperwork and at no time during the week before reminder call or during my 30 minute wait did they state they WOULD NOT clean my teeth if they could not take x-rays. \n\nI was taken back to the room and when I declined the x-rays, due to a possible pregnancy scare, the dental hygienist stated they would not clean my teeth unless they had them. (Which is completely absurd) She took me back to the front desk, where 3 receptionists did not even inquire as to what the problem was or why I had only been back there for roughly 3 minutes. They were not helpful, nor did they disclose that information prior to me being taken back to the room. If you have a job like me, an hour out of your day is a complete inconvenience when you can't even get your teeth cleaned. \n\nNeedless to say, I setup an appointment with my co-worker's dentist (Dr. Moran at Dentistry at Rea Village) the very next day and they indeed cleaned my teeth and did not need the x-rays until a later time when I could confirm a pregnancy. \n\nThis office may look great...but I would recommend basing your decision on more than that. Customer Service should still be the most important factor.
