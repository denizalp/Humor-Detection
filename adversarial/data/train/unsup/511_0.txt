I love a good food mart in any city and the Marche Jean-Talon is a new favorite of mine. It opened in 1933 and still ranks as one of the largest public markets in North America. It's also a true working market (not just a tourist attraction) with lots of terrific produce and food-stuff, alongside some great food and beverage vendors.\n\nMontreal is a food city, and this giant outdoor mart is a must-not-miss shopping and life experience.  We were fortunate to come here in summertime, which was optimal given the entire market is mainly an outdoor experience with some basic overhead covering and lots of stalls to walk around and into and winter here, even locals hunker down and venture out less.\n\nHighlights for us included the following stalls: La Boîte aux Huîtres for fried calamari, fresh oysters at  Poisonnerie Aqua Mare, a sausage snack at  William J. Walter Saucissier, a delicious apple and maple crepe at Creperie Du Marche, maple-glazed candied salmon at the Atkins poissonnerie (fish shop) and a killer latte at nearby Cafe Saint-Henri, which faces out onto the market and has a beautiful aesthetic and outdoor patio seating.  Does it sound like we ate our way through the market?  Oui!
