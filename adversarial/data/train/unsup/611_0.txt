Fancier Japanese sushi restaurant, Wild East is dark and dim and has lots of wood. Well decorated and quite fancy with bamboo inlays for the chairs and tables. The sushi menu had a good selection of \"creative\" rolls and the usual list of regular rolls. As well, some cooked food available for those who aren't into the raw fish (you know who you are).\n\nWe ordered four rolls with a soup and a seaweed salad to start. The soup and salad arrived swiftly and we had plenty of time to enjoy them before our rolls arrived. (Yes, she asked if it was okay that all four were on one plate.)\n\nThe rolls were tasty and fresh. Nicely arranged, nicely topped. Very nice.\n\nA good amount of sushi and while the prices were a little higher than I'd usually go for, it was good. I would return.
