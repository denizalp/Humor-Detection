My wife and I had our eye on a home in our neighborhood that fit our needs perfectly. It was overpriced and had been on the market forever.....the owner had turned down lots of reasonable offers and was just being stubborn. We wanted to make a run at it but had a few challenges, mainly we had to sell our house first. We called the Gluch Group on the recommendation of several friends and were really thrilled at how they were able to work everything out for us. They ended up getting the seller of the home we wanted to take an offer contingent on the sale of our home for 20k less than offers they had turned down in the past (50k off the asking price!). They then listed our house and had it sold in just a few days. We closed on both homes within a day of each other and are now living in our amazing new house. Our situation seemed far fetched but they made it work wonderfully!! We were very happy to have the help of such a talented Group. Thank you!
