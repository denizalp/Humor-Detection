Yelp Eats 2011\n\nWe took advantage of the Yelp Eats 2011 50% off prefixe menu\n\nBruchetta with apples and brie $3\nScallops with cheddar polenta and asparagus $10\nCheeseburger $13 (full price and not part of the special)\nCrab cake $5\nA couple of glasses of wine and lemonade for the little one.\n\nI give the food two stars and extra one for the trendy decor.  Would we go back?  Not for so-so food and service.
