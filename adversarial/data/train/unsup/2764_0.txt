Don't be scared away from the location. I've only been here at night, but the area looks deserted. \n\nThe sushi here is so fresh and good. I completely agree with another poster who said it just melts in your mouth. And let the chef be creative and make something off the menu for you. You can't go wrong. I haven't tried anything here that I didn't like. I also think it's a bit pricey, but worth it if you're looking to splurge on the good stuff. I love funky\/industrial design of the curtains in the backroom. \n\nI must add that I've been lucky enough to never have had to pay for a meal here.  :)
