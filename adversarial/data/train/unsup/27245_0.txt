Amazing production from beginning to end, I highly recommend that people go see it! \n\nAlthough it follows the film mostly they do have new songs notably my new favs \"Shadowland\" and \"He lives in you\" and singing ability of the cast was AMAZING. At times you forget you are in a theatre seat and instead off to the continent of Africa. \n\nOur seats were literally two rows from the stage and although I enjoyed seeing the intricacies of the costumes it was hard in the beginning to focus on the musical itself because I was mesmerized by details in the costumes and how the cast were moving in them. If anything I wish we would have had seats further back. But despite that, it definitely had me humming the Circle of Life the morning after. \n\nGive it a chance, you won't regret!
