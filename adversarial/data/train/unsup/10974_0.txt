I really wanted to like Coach & Willies, it's nice inside.\n\nThe service was terrible - good looking gals with bad attitudes that move like molasses in winter, bleh. \n\nThe food?  I had a loca burger and it came with this thick layer of cheese on top of it that my steak knife could not penetrate.  The fries were shoestring fries that had been cooked way too long and were pointless to eat.  I boxed it up and then carelessly left it in my car for two days.
