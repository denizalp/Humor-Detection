I had breakfast for dinner today!  I've been going here for several years now.  I still remembered when they closed it down and boarded it up.........then several weeks later it was back open again.  Made me think I was in the twilight zone.  Today I just had the basic eggs sausage and bacon today.  It would be pretty hard to mess this up.  It was only two servers working and the cook and it wasn't that busy at all.  I took my father and he had the steak and eggs and it looked pretty good as well.  The server came and checked on us several times and it honestly was a good experience.
