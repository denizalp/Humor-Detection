I have never been a huge fan of Dunkin' Donuts coffee and much prefer the huge coffee conglomerate with the green and white logo, but you've got to do what you've got to do, right? I've got to have my coffee in the morning and, during a recent weekend trip to Sam's Town, DD seemed to be the best option. \n\nI made several trips during the weekend and every time the service was just middle of the road. The first time, the coffee was not very hot. On subsequent visits, the coffee seemed to be a little better. Their espresso was actually pretty good. Of course I had to grab donuts a couple of times. Nothing spectacular, but what you have come to expect from DD. \n\nOne highlight of the weekend was the drink the Mrs. ordered. She wanted the new \"salted caramel pumpkin spice latte\" that was advertised on the sign in the window. The gal working the counter was quick to tell me that was actually two different drinks they have listed on the poster. When I asked her if she could make it anyway, she quickly obliged and made a \"salted caramel pumpkin spice latte\". The Mrs. was impressed, so I was happy. Kudos to the barista.\n\nWith no coffee pots in the room at Sam's Town, you're definitely going to be making a few trips to DD during your stay. And, bonus, they are located inside a casino so they're open around the clock.
