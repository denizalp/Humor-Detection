I don't like Scottsdale much, but I needed to move closer to work. I found this place awhile back and they put me on a waiting list which could hold the apartment I wanted for the current promo price (which was over $300 off of rent a month!). They held this place for me until the lease at my current place ran out, which was about 5 months and at no extra cost. \n\nThe staff is super nice, I especially like Natasha and Lauren, since they answered hundreds of questions I had. I got a newly renovated one bedroom which comes with granite countertops, stainless steel appliances and a laundry in unit. The complex is really nice, clean, and much safer than my old neighborhood. The price I got is a great deal, and even cheaper than some places in glendale which were closer to school. There are a lot of convenient shops, restaurants and stores nearby, and the 101 is about 2 miles in either direction so pretty convenient. \n\nI LOVE their ammenities (pool, jacuzzi, rooftop lounge, 24 hr gym, tennis courts, dry sauna, theater, pool table, dart boards, and weekly community events such as ice cream socials and dinner nights). There's also a no rottweiler\/pitbull policy which I like because those dogs scare me. I just moved in so I haven't had a chance to use all of their ammenities yet, but I'm pretty sure I will be making the most of it!
