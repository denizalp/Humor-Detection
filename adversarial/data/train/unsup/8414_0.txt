This is def a place to avoid if you are at all on a diet of any sort, re:  deli meats, cheese, cakes\/sweets, & a ready-foods counter!  AND it doesn't help that Polish donuts are $0.69\/ea and Krem√≥wka\/Napoleonka at $1.99\/huge square, it's a deadlier combination.  ;P\n\nAnyway, I'd agree with the other reviewers that the cash registers are quite close to the entrance.  You walk in and BOOM...cashiers all lined up, with only 1 direction to go.  Perhaps it's a security issue.\n\nI came here looking for raw Chorizo\/Italian sausages, but they didn't carry them.  I just figured the deli counter was huge enough to accommodate deli meats from other ethnicities, but no.  I finally settled on a \"Chorizo\", which was already cooked, but not spicy enough for my liking.\n\nBONUS:  Tons of FREE SAMPLES which is really good if you're in-between meals &\/or just really particular of finding the right sausage.\n\nWorkers were alright, but not overly friendly.  Cashiers look like they downright hate their jobs.  Apparently, they get paid peanuts, so keep that in mind if you're a shopper looking for a smile!
