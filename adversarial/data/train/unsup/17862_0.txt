This one is a true Yelp mystery to me. I simply do not understand all of the 4 & 5 star reviews for this show. I've been to a ton of Vegas shows and never really regretted any of them because I usually enjoyed some part of it. I can truly say I was bored to tears through this entire show. As time went on I kept hoping something would happen that would make me say \"Well, at least that happened so it wasn't a total waste of time\". \n\nUnfortunately that moment never came. I try to use my time as smart as possible while I'm in Vegas. This show was so bad that I'm actually more mad about the 2 or so hours I lost as opposed to being mad about being out the money. \n\nAVOID THIS SHOW AT ALL COSTS!
