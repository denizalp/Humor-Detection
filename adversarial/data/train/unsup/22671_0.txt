Ok so yes, I am 1 of 3 Asians in Cleveland. Soon to be 2 because I am leaving soon.\n\nTink Holl is not the best Asian supermarket I've been to. I come from the land of Asian Invasion in America (San Gabriel Valley, a suburb right outside LA) that's filled with the best Asian cuisine and markets outside of China. So I may be a little spoiled.\n\nHOWEVER, by Cleveland's standards Tink Holl is amazingly AWESOME! It ain't no Westside Market, but if you're homesick for some Asian-ness this is the place to go reminisce. \n\nIt's right across the street from the largest Dave's Market ever and there's a parking lot in the back. Don't feel scared walking in, embrace the lovely smell of fish and exotic fruits. The market is a little dirty but it's a lot nicer than some of the supermarkets you'd find in China. The prices are actually pretty cheap. This is great if you're looking for that rare brand of Asian spice, soy sauce, tofu, dried mushrooms, pickled veggie, dumpling skins, pocky, guava juice, and what-have-you. The employees speak a bit of English too. Although think twice if you're expecting to brush up on your Mandarin-speaking skills. This is definitely a Cantonese-owned supermarket....\n\nAlso, fun facts:\n-Asian people do not like being called \"Oriental.\" We are not rugs.\n-\"Konichiwa\" is not Chinese. It means \"hello\" in Japanese. Different country.\n-A more politically-friendly way to ask what ethnicity a person is: \"What ethnicity are you?\" as opposed to \"WHAT COUNTRY ARE YOU FROM?!?\" In a loud voice.\n\nThese are just some fun tips that I think people would find useful - as I have experienced some jaw-dropping questions during my stint in CLE
