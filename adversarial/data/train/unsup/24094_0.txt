This may be my new favorite!! Everything is trans fat free 100%. The wait was pretty crazy but it was worth it. \n\nThe whole feel of the place is really cool. I always want to eat healthy but not cook, never can I get both. \n\nLots of places claim to be healthy but after several probing questions I usually find a few things that are tainted with trans fat and high fructose corn syrup. \n\nNot here though!!! \n\nBeing a lesbian I have a lot of vegan\/vegetarian friends. (I guess lesbians really don't like meat) They always want to go out but I find that most vegan\/vegetarian places have less than good food. They almost always seem like the kitchen would be all dirty. \n\nI cant wait to take my non meat eating friends here. \n\nHere's what I got \n\nThe butternut squash ravioli = awesome! The dough is made I think like gluten free or something, which isn't a selling point for me but it was very good. Usually the gluten free noodles are sick, I actually really liked the texture and taste. Its in a yogurt honey sauce, to me sounded a little gross. \nMy gf ordered it but it was delicious, it was the perfect sweetness. It was served hot which I thought it may be cold I guess because of the yogurt factor. \n\nI ordered the root veggies. I did really like it but I thought they flavor could have been a little more herby. It wasn't bland but I think the flavor for sure could have been kicked up a notch. The Farro that came with it, was super good. I wish there was more of it especially for 15 bucks. \n\nThe bathroom was weird, it was really small. The door was thin sheet metal and so was he lock. When you lock the stall it makes the most awefal screechy metal nose. \nThe soap was actually a natural soap which was nice but not antibacterial. \nOk, they habd the coolest hand dryer, I mean this thing is bad ass. You put your hands in it like a car wash dryer. I dont know how to describe it but make sure you check that bitch out :)
