I've been looking for a good wine bar for a while, and this one hits the spot. This is a perfect place to go with a group of friends, hang out, catch up, have a bite and drink amazing wine. At night, they also play fun music, and on a few occassions, have also played some music I requested!\n\nThe owners are usually there, and the service is pretty amazing. Staff is really helpful in terms of picking out a good bottle or glass of wine. Would definitely suggest this bar for a group gathering, or a night out to catch up, drink and relax!\n\nDefinitely will be back again soon.
