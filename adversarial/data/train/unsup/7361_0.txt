We took a number from a number dispenser not unlike one that you'd find in your local license bureau and neatly shuffled behind the hungry Saturday night crowd that flocked to this bakery. It took maybe 10-15 minutes total, which is not bad for THAT kind of crowd.\n\nWe went home with our precious Tiramisu and other baked goods. As far as Tiramisus go, this one was among the airiest, fluffiest and most delicate ones I've tried. I'd say it's up there with the best I had. Easy to inhale.\n\nThis is a great place for dessert and perhaps, paradise if you have a sweet tooth.
