This airport has the nicest TSA staff I've ever seen. \"Belts and shoes off,\" bellowed the security checkpoint guard, \"and if you're wearing different colored socks, you're a homeland security risk!\" It was funnier if you were actually there but it's certainly welcome over the rude, power-trip gruffness TSA is known for. Lots of Hello's and big Hello's to children who probably were freaked out by a grown man in a security uniform smiling big and shouting \"Are we havin' fun yet?!!\"  Still, the effort to be nice is appreciated and goes a long way. I half-expected a high-five as I walked through the metal detector.\n\nPittsburg is a city but a small city so this airport, though an international airport, is a small one--and that has it's Pro's and Cons\n\nPROs:\n*really short line and fast and friendly process through security gate\n*easy tram service to the gates\n*lot of Andy Warhol-esque wall art (found out later that he's from Pittsburgh\n*very calm airport. It just doesn't have the hustle bustle bust your ass craziness\n\nCONSs:\n*really lacking in their food court. Your choices are all greasy spoon fast food places. Not very many bars either. You'll see one and there won't be another one for the next 20 gates. If you have a long layover here, and you're healthy, congrats because you'll fast for the next several hours.\n*seriously lacking in power outlets. Not a laughing matter. Seriousness. I almost passed level 144 of Farm Heroes and my battery died before I could because I couldn't find an outlet anywhere. On top of that, I couldn't check Yelp every five minutes. NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!
