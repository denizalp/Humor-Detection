Me and my wife took my mother in law here when she came down from Sacramento. I have to admit the whole hospital gown and wrist band was cheesy . But the food was great .Me and my wife got the double bypass burger and my mother in law got the single . The burgers was AWESOME with 6 slices of bacon on each patty right there it made it one of mt favorite burgers. But the thick greasy patties and the cheese just dripping down made this worth putting on the gown.The fries are almost as good as the burgers.My wife was not happy because they did not have diet soda but other then that all 3 of us enjoyed the experience.Oh yea by the way Heather the nurse was so damn hot .Her bending over and seeing her cleavage  alone  gave me a fever. lol We will be going back every time my mother in law comes to visit.
