Bibimbap means mixed rice. It's a bowl of steamed white rice, with sauteed vegetables, including cucumber, zucchini, mushrooms, soybean sprouts, daikon and chili pepper, accompanied by meat (though optional) and an egg on top. Oh, take me to Seoul.\n\nOur Koreatown culinary tour guide (aka a good friend who has spent weeks in Korea) took us to this amazing locale for Sunday night dinner. \n\n\"What should we order?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Anything but dog.\" she replied.\n\nDo they even serve that in Canada?\n\nI didn't wait to find out.\n\nThe bibimbap was good enough.\n\nKorean people always seem to look good and now I understand why. Their food is healthful, but tasty. The starter plates were equally pleasing. Among them was Kimchi (a pickled vegetable, in this case, cabbage) We topped the evening off with a visit to P.A.T, the local Korean supermarket. \n\nWhat a fun adventure. \n\n Kamsamnida (or thank you) Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu!
