I've been here on a few occasions, but mostly ordering the same things...\n\nFOOD:\n\"Veggie sliders\" -Roasted corn, Red bell peppers, Portabello mushrooms, Avocado, Pesto, on wheat buns. \n\nDRINKS:\n\"Masterpiece Bleu\" -Vodka, blue cheese stuffed olives [strong, but not very smooth]\n\"Down and Dirty\" -Vodka, olive juice, olives [strong, but not enough olive juice]\n\n(tried once)\n\"Three Chocolates\" -Vodka, Godiva liqueur, White & Dark chocolate swirls [sweet drink, good for dessert]\n\"Blue Martini\" -Vodka, Blue curacao, juices [weak sauce, not strong at all, just PASS]\n\nTASTE: **** [Veggie sliders were tasty & deelish! ...the sweet red bell pepper paste went well with the veggie patty, not dry at all!  ...and I'm definitely a vodka martini gal.  Heavy pours on the vodka with the extra given on the side... ]\nCONVENIENCE: **** [located on the 2nd floor in the Town Square Mall.]\nAMBIANCE: **** [Good music, lowly lit, outdoor patio with heaters or bar area.]\nSERVICE: *** [It's a hit or miss, but at least acceptable.]\nPRICE:  $$ [1\/2 off martinis & food at Happy Hour 5-8pm]\nOVERALL: **** [4-stars.... good ambiance, decent prices, FUN for groups, but it's a hit-or-miss on drinks and service... For what it offers, I'm still a fan tho!]\n\nI wouldn't come here unless it's during HH, cuz if I had to pay regular price for the food & drinks, I might as well just head to the strip.\nNuff said.
