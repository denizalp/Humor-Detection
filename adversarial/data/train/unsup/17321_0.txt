You'll need a little suspension of disbelief to feel detached from the real world, but if you like puzzles, you'll have fun here.\n\nEscape Reality is one of the businesses offering escape room experiences in Las Vegas. I went here once for a Yelp Elite event (my review: https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/elite-event-escape-reality-las-vegas?hrid=6M29FUutOgFziwybU8y6Yg) and had to return to give it another try with a group of my own choosing. It ended up being me and just one friend, which was great because we both felt competent and didn't necessarily want newbies to distract us or outright interfere.\n\n(by the way, no photos because it's not relevant to the lobby \/ waiting area, and not allowed while inside rooms)\n\nEscape rooms are straightforward... at least in concept. You simply follow a series of puzzles to unlock the way to more puzzles (and maybe more areas) via physical keys, alphanumerical codes (for padlocks or keypads or whatnot), or various other mechanisms until you unlock the exit door. Whether you can solve those puzzles is up to you, and I won't spoil too much here because it'd ruin the experience. If you get stuck, you can use hints, including one which seems to be given freely by the employee in charge of your experience, or multiple hints accessible via the QR code reader on the tablet app. By the way, that tablet also serves as your 60-minute timer, so keep it in mind.\n\nAs I'd hinted above, I loved the experience. My friend and I agreed to choose Alcatraz, which shares the highest difficulty rating with another room but has been asserted by employees to be not quite as hard as Down The Rabbit Hole. We were both experienced enough - my friend from several times including as my +1 to the Elite event, and I from just that one time - and we covered for each other when one of us got a little astray on some puzzles. We completed the escape in 37 minutes and 30 seconds to put us in 1st place for this month's leaderboard, and it felt smooth except for some issues with locating the correct place to input certain codes. Our \"game master\" Cheyenne helped to clarify it for us (let's just say it was literally out of sight unless you used one tool properly).\n\nBy the way, the cost is $32 per person, with some 20%-off codes floating around. It's not out of the realm of reason for an hour-or-less \"experience\" if you compare it to something like gun\/bow\/axe ranges, and puzzles are more enjoyable and comfortable for me than real weaponry. It's also cool that $1 of the cost goes to a nonprofit of your individual choice (out of 4 options), with descriptions and donation boxes available in the lobby area.\n\nI had an absolute blast, so it just doesn't feel right not to give Escape Reality 5 stars despite having minor concerns or not having tried any of its competitors. Perhaps I'll return soon to conquer the toughest room!
