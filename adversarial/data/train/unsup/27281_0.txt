Same amazing food as the location closer to the strip but this one is less crowded and is located in a giant strip mall so there's plenty of parking. If you want the giant gift shop, go to the one by the strip but you'll get the same food here and a shorter wait. I don't normally eat fast food burgers PERIOD but this really is worth a try.
