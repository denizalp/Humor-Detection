Met up with some friends for dinner. Passed by Rooster's every time going in to park the car.\n\nFrom the outside it does not seem like much. Do not be fooled as you walk in the entrance. Bar area with several screen TVs to catch the latest sports game. Fire place so warm and inviting on a cool night. There is a whole dining area next to the bar.\n\nAs you head upstairs to the dining area, the aroma as well as the smell from the kitchen hits you. Inquiring minds want to know- What is Today's special?\n\nThe pasta are freshly made and you can not go wrong.\nMac n Cheese delicious as well as the Burrata.\n\nThere is an extensive menu like 2-3 pages on a clip board.\n\nHad the duck confit which was very salty.\nThe short ribs and beets were also too salty.\n\nWill definitely be back for the pasta and happy hour.\n\nVery attentive waitstaff.
