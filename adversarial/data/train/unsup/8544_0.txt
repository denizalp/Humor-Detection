Not at all impressed! \nHave come in twice and each time was highly disappointed with the quality & taste of their sandwiches, especially for the price.\nThe whole place had a rather weird vibe to it, can't quite put my finger on it. It was empty & no other customers were eating there or patronizing the establishment, either of the times I came in.  \nThe woman who helped me was not very personable and I thought she seemed very unprofessional and phony. She claimed to be the owner of the establishment but she was shifty-eyed and wouldn't look me in the eyes, kept fumbling around with her hair and adjusting her shirt and just basically odd. Got the vibe she was strung out on something. I won't be back. Save your money & go elsewhere.\n\n*** In reply to the owner Amber Walter's response to me. She is saying she has been in the hospital June 11-15th, therefore an impostor claiming to be her, is who I dealt with. I never gave the precise dates I was in, but my two visits were not during the 11th-15th of June. I have not been in for a couple of weeks. The woman in the photo, Amber Walter is definitely the person who took my order and the person I interacted with. Her reply is a blatant lie and trying to discredit my review. I stand behind what I originally shared and will not be returning.
