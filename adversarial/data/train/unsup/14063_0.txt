This is one of the poorest shows I've seen in Las Vegas.  My ticket was for the front row (Row CC).  The first two rows are blocked off evidently to shield audience members from the heat of the omnipresent fire.\n\nThe first 7 minutes of the show could be cut and nothing would be lost.  4 characters dressed in black robes move very slowly (and I do mean SLOWLY) on the stage, pick up an object and slowly walk down the steps into an aisle.  This happens on both sides of the stage and minutes later they come back with the objects.  There is only ominous sounding music but the wasted time adds nothing to the show at all.\n\nOut comes Mr. Labero and then Animal, his dim assistant.  For the next 60+ minutes there is a lot of fire.  People hold wands which emit shafts of fire, dancers move about the stage while holding what look like candelabras with lighted ends.\n\nIn between fire scenes, Mr. Labero does some magic acts.  He has little stage presence and his attempts at humor with audience members was lame at best.  He mentions he's from Sweden and then asks some audience members from where they came.  His \"ta da\" moments at the end of tricks were forced and he almost asked for applause.  There were two illusions that were particularly sad.  Since I was so close, I could see the illusion unfolding and it was amateurish especially the airplane engine, the last trick of the evening.  The other was similar.  It was a woman seemingly passing through him.  It was awful!\n\nThe best part of the show for me were the women who do the dancing with fire but this becomes repetitive after a while.  \n\nI'd recommend skipping this show.  Go to something more entertaining.  There are so many choices on the Strip.  I might mention that the theatre was less than 1\/3 full last night but it was a Sunday evening so that might have something to do with it.
