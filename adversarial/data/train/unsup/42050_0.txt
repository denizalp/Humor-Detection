This place was awesome. First time I've been there on a Vegas trip. The shuttles that take you there are large and fit many people so don't worry if it looks like there's a long line, you won't be waiting long.\n\nSpecial shout-out to the shuttle drivers. They were extremely friendly and helpful, by far the friendliest shuttle drivers I've ever seen. I actually felt really bad that I had no cash on hand to tip them with, as they loaded and unloaded all of our luggage for us. Next time I'm going to make sure ahead of time to have a few bucks handy--they totally deserve it.
