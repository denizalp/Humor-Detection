One of the best Indian Restaurants in the Valley. Jonathan is right, really good category! We have had dinner there several times. Lamb saag, chicken vindaloo and chicken tika masala are out favorites. We like it #8 and HOT! Garlic nann actually has garlic on it, unlike so many other Indian restaurants.\nGreat service, we will be back!
