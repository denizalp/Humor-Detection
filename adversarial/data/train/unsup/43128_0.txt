I do love me some Dairy Queen but this particular location always seems to be jam packed with not enough staff to accommodate demand.\n\nThere is a nice patio to sit on outside which is cool, I just wish they stocked the napkin dispenser consistently....\n\nWith that said, try the dipped cone or Skor blizzard - yummy!!\n\nYay!! Dairy Queen!!
