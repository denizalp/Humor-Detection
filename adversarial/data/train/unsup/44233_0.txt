It's good - good atmosphere, good food and drink, good prices. It gets very crowded on the weekends, so it does take some time from ordering at the counter, until your food gets brought out to your table.\n\nIt's nice and clean (it's on the upscale\/trendy side for a breakfast spot), plenty of seating, indoors and out, and it's on Mill so it's right in the middle of the action. I would recommend it to friends.
