This place is too good to keep it a secret!! It is hidden on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel, but just follow your nose and you'll find it. What makes Secret Pizza so good is the crust. It was a NY style thin crust, but it was so crispy and flaky, and not soggy at all. I wish I could have tried the Sicilian deep dish pizza, but they didn't have any cooked at the time. \n\nNext time I'm in Vegas I will absolutely be back!!
