So much fun and I found so many new places to shop that I didn't even know existed! My favorite is the tea shop on stetson and 5th. I bought tea that I can't wait to try. It was fun running all over old town Scottsdale taking crazy pics with my mom and Linda. We ended at Fifth and Wine who had some amazing apps for us to try. Great prizes for the winners...congrats! I can't wait to go back to lots of the shops and spend a lot more time shopping. So nice to learn about all these local places to support. Great job Lindsey and Local First!!!
