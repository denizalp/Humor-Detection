Beaudevin-All the beauty of wine. \n\nGreat place for a quick bite or a more leisurely tasting while waiting for take off.  This is my favorite spot for this in the Charlotte Airport offering wine tasting and tapas\/small plates.\n\nCaprese Skewers- The caprese skewers are served over arugula with a pleasantly sweet balsamic reduction that complements the peppery arugula well.  A simple but delicious and fresh lite plate.  \n\nKnowing the caprese skewers were on the lite side, I also got the shrimp scampi.  Together, these two small plates hit the spot.  \n\nShrimp Scampi- The scampi comes with 8 shrimp in a nice scampi broth with onion, tomato, and a garnish of cilantro. Six pieces of baguette are served on the side for you to sop up the yummy scampi broth.  At first I thought it would have been nice to have 8 pieces of baguette to go with the 8 shrimp, but I was able to make it work and still had some left over to do some broth sopping.  The baguettes are just a little bigger than the shrimp making them perfectly bite size.\n\nOne thing to note: if you're not a cilantro fan, you'll want to ask for the cilantro to be left off.  It's not included in the menu description, but there's a generous garnish of cilantro on the scampi.  I enjoyed the cilantro, though there was a lot of it. \n\nI did not partake in the wine or any of the great sounding cocktails.  There's  a nice selection of them.
