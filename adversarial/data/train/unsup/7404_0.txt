Here's the thing, if you:\n\na) Live in a 5+ household you should probably shop at Costco\nb) Are poor and content with ramen and off-brand spaghettio's, shop at the 99c Store\nc) If you're some kind of tofu-raw-eggplant-Nazi then shop at your non-corporate health food store, or eat the food you grow in your ashram\nd) And if you live isolated in the forest\/jungle and eat the raw meat from the animals you kill with your bare hands, keep doing that\n\nFor everyone else, which is probably 75% of us, Fresh and Easy the best and obvious choice. As far as regular grocery shopping, they are light-years ahead of everyone: in store arrangement, brand philosophy, packaging, price and product selection (I'm talking in terms of what you actually need, if you really want 37 different options for vinegar I'll be glad you're shopping somewhere else and not taking up my F&E aisles).\n\nNo, they are not perfect. A larger selection of unpackaged produce is something they need, and something they are intending to get very soon if you pay attention to their press statements. Fresh and Easy is a very new company. It happens to be backed by the 3rd largest retailer in the world (hence the Trader-Joe-shaming prices), but that company is very aware that they are in a new market. They are eager to learn how to better please their new American customers, and, as much as I love the store now, I imagine the F&E of one or two years from now will be even better.\n\nI highly recommend (noted fruit-fascists excepted) Fresh and Easy to everyone. Give it a try and you will, hopefully, be as pleased with them as I have come to be.
