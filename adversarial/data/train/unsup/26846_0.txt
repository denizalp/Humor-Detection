I love Sammy's but kinda disappointed that they changed their happy hour menu from all tapas to a select amount with limited pieces. My family and I enjoy the duck tacos, truffle fries, and lobster mac n cheese but now lobster mac n cheese is gone from happy hour and duck tacos is only two pieces. I'll still come back and enjoy my meal with family and friends just maybe expand my horizons away from the tapas menu.
