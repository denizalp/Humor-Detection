Here's the scoop. And I can't promise that I can remain calm when I talk about it. I do love a good bargain so. ANY garment, dry cleaned and pressed... $1.99! Yesterday, I brought in my heavy winter dress coat... $1.99  OK, there's more... bring it in my 9 am and it's ready the SAME DAY, after 5pm! After 9 am and it's ready the next day after 5pm. It is amazing! I recently took a dressy dress to our local dry cleaners and they charged me $18! Took it to ZIPS and (come on, everybody, say it together now....) $1.99!!! Shirts are laundered and pressed for... $1.39! What?!? I mean, come on, it's exciting, right?\n\nI'm only an occasional dry cleaner user so since they opened I've been in 3-4 times and have yet to be disappointed. Friendly staff, bright and clean facilities. Plenty of parking. There is only one unusual item you need to know: you have to prepay. When you drop off your clothes, that is when payment is due, not after, non negotiable. They provide you with a little key tag to quickly access your account (or use your phone number) so it is super quick and easy. I consider it a small price to pay (pun totally intended) for cheap, good, fast service. ZIPS accepts cash, visa, MC and discover. And they are closed on Sundays. Also, they are on Banksville Road heading into town. It's a pain to get on the other side of the road, especially in traffic, so I try to plan my trips only when I'm heading in that direction. Please try it. I hope it will be such a success, I'll get one a little closer to my house!
