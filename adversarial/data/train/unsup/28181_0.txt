They have a good burger and the salads are good. I have to say, my favorite things there are the croissant that comes with the dinner salad (I would usually ask for another one LOL) and the spinach dip. :O) You will see lots of suits at lunch time, it is a big lunch spot for the surrounding companies and they are pretty fast with service, so it is good for that. Small bar, but clean and comfortable. Good sized tables and booths for meeting and talking about stuff with co-workers etc.
