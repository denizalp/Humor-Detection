I adore this place! So underrated. Fun festive environment, traditional seating is awesome and cozy under the tiki huts and food is fabulous! Everyone I've ever taken has thoroughly enjoyed it much to their surprise. I recommend getting the combination appetizer and combination dinner plus the Indian beer. Share all of it with someone - it's enough for 2. AND EAT WITH YOUR HANDS! It's all part of the fun and experience!
