I was going to order from here once more before I made a review, but that won't be happening. I ordered delivery through grub hub. The driver was late because he was stuck in traffic and called me while he was on his way to let me know. No big deal, I'm a pretty patient person. I ordered a soup\/noodle bowl with chicken and rice noodles. It was packaged separately. I also ordered the spring rolls, which were great, just needed more sauce. \nWhen I reheated my soup the next day to finish it I found an entire shrimp at the bottom, tail on and everything. It was a big one!! If the chefs let this slide without even noticing, I can only wonder what else they let slide in that kitchen.
