Oh man, there's an ice skating rink in Las Vegas.\n\nO_O!!! \n\nThat was one of the biggest shock for me of this year. Who would of known that Las Vegas has an ice skating?? And the price is the same as  the ones in bay area! $9 total for adults including skates. \n\nSo I decided to head down there with my friend since I haven't ice skated in forever! My mind was psyched the whole time because I thought I'll never be able to skate again when I moved here. However, once I went through the doors of the center, and saw this huge familiar ice rink...I felt immediately at home. \n\nThe rink was huge and spacious, with friendly kids, teens, and adults all skating round and round in circles. Music was EH. Who plays death metal and rap in an ice rink? That was a bit bizarre, though overall it was okay. Having fun with my girl friend made all that just fine. She was having a bit trouble but I manage to stay on my toes. lol\n\nOne thing they need to do before opening to the public is smooth the ice. When I got on the rink, there was so much skate marks on the ground that made it sort of difficult to maneuver for a mediocre skater like me. \n\nOverall everyone who comes here will have an enjoyable time and it's probably one of the best $9 you'll ever spent on to past free time during the weekends. \n\nTIP: Make sure to call the ice center for hours just in case they change it due to seasonal months.
