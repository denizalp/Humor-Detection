There's no coffee machine in the rooms at Vegas the hotels miss no opportunity to take your money. \n\nEvery morning we were either running to the Starbucks on the property or the roasted bean.\nThe roasted bean is located near the entrance to the pool\/secret garden they sell breakfast sandwiches,pastries, oats etc\n\nPrices are reasonable by Vegas standards.\nI loved the interior with little pots on the walls.\nPlenty of seating options comfortable booths and tables.\nThe egg and cheese croissant was nice another healthier option is the egg white sandwich.\n\nCoffee was pretty standard, Service is okay.\n\nCheers!
