I love this place!! The atmosphere is amazing in this place I love the decorations and music it really takes you back to a different era. Misty the server who we have had both times we have been there is always bright and cheery, even though we had been there before she still told us of the specials and apps that we may want to try. The food there is all scratch made and worth the price, my husband has had the fish tacos and the big fish sandwich which is hand battered right before it's cooked not pre-frozen. I myself have gotten the chopped steak mixed veggies and mash potatoes and gravy. These are homemade potatoes and you know this my the chunks in it. Misty recommend the fist and second time we came the fried pickles which are the best I have ever had and I have tried them at many other places. They are sliced thick and batterd instead of breaded and they offer 3 sauces for .50 so worth it too! The fist time we ate there my daughter tried the homemade donuts and she really liked them. I have no con's at all to this place it's that amazing!!
