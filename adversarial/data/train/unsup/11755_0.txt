Mandalay Bay's Bayside Buffet was my first Vegas buffet ever back in 2004.  Eversince then, I've been to the Carnival buffet at Rio, Wynn buffet, Mirrage buffet and many other buffets and was very disappointed that I was not able to enjoy buffets anymore :(  \n\nI came back to Bayside Buffet this past weekend and they did not fail me!  I loved it :D  They may not have much of a selection, but Bayside is quality over quantity.  They don't serve crap just to have a huge selection.  Besides, when there are too much to choose from, I get too overwhelmed.\n\nI loved their oxtail and braised beef.  And of course shrimp cocktail and crab legs :)
