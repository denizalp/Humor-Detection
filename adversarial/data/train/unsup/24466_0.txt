It's not often that I go to shows featuring well-known artists. Venues tend to be stuffy, overpriced, full of rude staff, and with drink prices off the freaking charts. It's usually much more of a hassle than it's worth just trying to have fun for three hours. \n\nFortunately, Club Red made my night much more enjoyable. \n\nPros: \n\n-Great parking. Don't complain about the location, they need all this space!\n\n-Drink prices are fair. $6 cans of average craft beer like Sierra Nevada, $5 PBR tallboys...you could do MUCH worse.\n\n-Staff is nice. Security was always polite when needing to bust through some crowds to grab some idiot. They also didn't even bother interrupting anyone's good time to catch the 100+ stoners in the audience. I have never had someone be cordial to me while running a metal detector over me. Everyone is chill except the guy checking tickets at the door, who really seems to hate his life. \n\nCons: \n\n-Poor design: Venue itself is linear, and all around poorly designed. As others have said, the sound quality leaves much to be desired. The sound\/light controls are in the middle of the floor, instead of the back...because there's no room for it in the back. If you need to leave the building, or even just go to the restroom, the doorways are WAY, WAY too freaking narrow. \n\n-Ventilation: Holy shit guys, I don't have anything against smokers, but there was a cloud billowing out the back door once the show was over. It was way stuffy in there as well. \n\nOverall, I feel as though this is a less-than-ideal space with stellar staff who make the most of it. The booze didn't break the bank, and no one was a dick to me for the entire night, so I'm willing to forgive a lot. I wouldn't hesitate to return.
