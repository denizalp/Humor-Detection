Most people remember their first crush...  Ramen Sora was my first ramen shop in Las Vegas last month.   Since then I had tried 2 others in Vegas and have decided to return here to dine again with my new Yelp buddy! She's just as exited and happy to dine here as I am!\n\nRamen Sora's location on Spring Mountain Road is convenient and easy to find.  The free parking is close, safe, and clean. The ambiance is still authentic, comfortable,  and fun!  The food remains yummy,  memorable and beautiful. ..just like a first crush!\n\nDuring my last visit,  I had the Nori Ramen and the 5 piece side order of gyoza for $3.75 - yum!  This time, I ate the Butter Corn Ramen.  Both times,  I enjoyed the cha siu that just dissolved in the mouth with an edge of salty spice and melty, soft fat in between the tender meat! The noodles were firm and slurp worthy.  The broth was tasty with a just right goodness!\n\nRe: the Butter Corn Ramen this visit...\nI really like corn: corn flakes,  corn chips, popcorn,  etc., so BUTTERED corn for me is a double treat! Yummy!  The half of a hard boiled egg was like a cherry on top of an ice cream sundae! Mmm!\n\nMaybe I'm a bit of a romantic because I can remember my first crush.  It was 4th grade. ..a time when life was simple. ..like corn, butter,  and noodles! The basic food groups!
