This. Place. Is. Everything.\n\nThe noodle wars in Vegas are in full swing and Magic Noodle is a clear winner in my book, and of just because it's within walking distance to my castle.\n\nThe noodles have the right bite, the broth has the the right richness, and the meat is plentiful, fatty and like pure, hot, sex. Yeah...I went there.\n\nI'm referring to the \"Szechuan Beef Noodles\". Get the regular hand pulled.\n\nHungover? Well...let me just say that this brought me back to life after St. Patrick's Day. I had died. I think. So there's that, too.\n\nThe spicy wontons are great too, just add some extra chili oil that is at your table. Unless you're a wuss.
