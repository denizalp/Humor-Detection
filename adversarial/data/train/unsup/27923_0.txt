I love this place! Located in such a convenient little plaza. As soon as you walk in you see how spacious it is and all the wonderful smells drift to your nose! Their pastor tacos with pineapple are my hands down favorite and their elote is also delicious! They have a full bar so you can sip on a nice beer to go with your meal!
