Came here on the last day of the Event with the Lovely Sara KP, Elvis, Jen K, Tony and his awesome friend.\n\nIt was super duper packed with lots of vendors, and lots of visitors.\n\nThere was tons of free samples *mmm shortbread\/cookies\/cupcakes\/chocolates)\n\nIt was a sugary sweet time!\n\nMy fav was the Liqour Lounge...1 dollar promo shots...magic.
