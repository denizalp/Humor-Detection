Breakfast at Hob Nobs was amazing!   We had the breakfast pizza which was foreign to us so we were genuinely surprised.   It was awesome!  Crispy crust with great flavors.  Wonderful cozy atmosphere.   Fun, kind employees.   If we lived here our daily stop would be Hob Nobs.   They serve lunch n dinner also.
