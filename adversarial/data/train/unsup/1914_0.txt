Ladies cut is $30 including tax - cash only.  Been here a couple times because of the yelp reviews.  First haircut was fine - my hair is Asian, straight, simple hair style with layers.  Just went back today since my 1st experience was pretty good and affordable - this time I got a haircutter named Choi - best haircut received in a long time!!\n\n\\over the last 15 years I would say I have had 30 layered hair cuts and this was probably the best cut - unique technique too!  very happy.\n\nSo what if the \"receptionist\" is a bit grumbly?
