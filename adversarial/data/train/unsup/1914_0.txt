I love Brooklyn Bowl! It's definitely one of my most favorite venues here in Las Vegas, hands down. I've seen multiple shows here and I have enjoyed each one. I've seen The Green and a few other reggae bands, Bryson Tiller, and most recently, Kehlani. \n\nBrooklyn Bowl is either really big or really small, depending on who you're seeing. Kehlani was the only sold out show I've been to here and it was packed! If you don't like being extremely close to the other concert goers, you can always stand in the back and watch the show from the multiple screens they have on the walls.\n\nMost shows offer different ticket options as well. I normally go with the general admission which is the bottom floor and standing room only. You can also purchase a balcony ticket if you just want to avoid the majority of the other concert goers altogether. If you're feeling extra fancy, Brooklyn Bowl gives you the option to reserve a bowling lane for the night! \n\nThe main floor has three bars, one on each side, so it's pretty convenient no matter where you're located in the crowd. That is unless you're in the very middle of the floor... Have fun finding your way back!\n\nThe only reason I'm giving four stars and not five is because the security guards checking ID's at the entrance were so rude during my last visit! Yes, I understand that you're just doing your job... But is it necessary to be rude while doing it?\n\nBesides the security, Brooklyn Bowl is an overall awesome venue for live music!
