Oh my goodness! I am not one to rate chains but I felt compelled to after my visit to AutoZone this weekend. \n\nA friend informed me that one of my headlights was out. Oh my god, was I dreading having to change it. The last time I did that was about 8 years ago, and I believe I also went to an AutoZone to get the replacement part. The guy at the counter told me he could instruct me how to do it, because there were rules that didn't allow him to remove the battery or something like that. \n\nI know NOTHING about cars and was truly dreading having to do it on my own. I was on my way to another place in fact when I saw the store and figured, well get this over with. The young man behind the counter, hence worth known as my hero, was very very nice and came out to the car to make sure we got the right piece. After I paid I mentioned something about him not being able to help me and he said sure I can. I figured he'd stand next to me and tell me how to do it while I proceeded to destroy my car. None of that. He told me step by step how to replace it while he did it on his own! There were even some windshield wiper boxes in the trash and I joked that I should be carrying them around so he could help me with that too. He said, sure, bring them back and I'll help you. \n\nI feel bad that I didn't catch his mane nor have any cash on me (lesson learned. Also, bad bad Elite Yelper). But hopefully the store takes notice because he really saved the day!
