The food was good and the waitress was nice. But this restaurant was not clean. We were the first and only people in the restaurant on a Saturday morning and the tables were nasty. The floors had trash all over them. There was dust around the windows and possible old ketchup. I won't come back to this location. The one on east blvd is much cleaner.
