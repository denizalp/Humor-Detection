Good was OK service was brutal.  We waited a long time to get our wine.  We order a red and a white bottle after pouring the wine they take the bottles away and never comeback to refill.  \nI will not be going back mostly because of the service. \n\n\nPlace looks awesome but really noisy so hard to carry on a conversation during dinner.
