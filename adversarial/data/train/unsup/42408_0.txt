One of the first places where I discovered Thai food.  I love the Tom Yum soup and the satays.  Just so delicious.  I wish the portions were even bigger because I became addicted to the flavours.  I have been back here with friends and we have always had a pleasant experience.  Good service and good food.  I have travelled to other countries and was disappointed with the Thai food.  This restaurant was terrific and I am glad we have it in Toronto.
