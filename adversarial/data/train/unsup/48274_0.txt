I have never waited LESS THAN forty five minutes to see my doctor. While the staff are competent and I'm satisfied with the quality of care I've received, the constant over booking definitely soils my opinion.\n\nPeople go to spine specialists because THEY'RE  IN PAIN. Making patients wait for extended periods of time in terribly uncomfortable chairs is painfully ironic.\n\nPLEASE STOP OVER BOOKING. WE ALL KNOW IT'S NOTHING MORE THAN GREED TO BILL MORE APPOINTMENTS PER DAY.
