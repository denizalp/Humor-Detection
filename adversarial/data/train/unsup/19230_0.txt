Absolutely fantastic! This place didn't just ruin any other seafood restaurant for me, but more like ALL restaurants hahahaha\n\nThe table enjoyed a few bottles of Chardonnay and the bread baskets to start. It's not your typical bread, the bread here makes Texas Roadhouse rolls look like the bread you feed ducks at a lake. There's thin crispy bread, cheesy bread, buttery warm rolls, etc. all complimentary! \n\nI enjoyed the swordfish (YUMM) and shared a Mac n cheese side with my friend. All 9 of us were raving about the food the whole time. \n\nThis was one of the best meals I've ever had. Perfect dinner before walking over to Omnia to dance my pants off. Come here dressed to the 9s and ready to splurge a little bit and you will leave happy!!! Thank you Joe whoever you are!
