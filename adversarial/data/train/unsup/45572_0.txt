Celebrated my birthday dinner and it was amazing!  We sat at the bar and had a drink and enjoyed the cool atmosphere.   I had scallops and my boyfriend ordered the pork chop..... both were absolutely phenomenal!Chrissy the bartender was adorable and sweet as can be!  We will definitely be coming back to Square 22
