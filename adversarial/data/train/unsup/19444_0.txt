Forgive me yelpers, for I have sinned. My name is Wendy and I'm a choco-holic. It has been twelve minutes since I last ate a piece of delicious handcrafted chocolate from Epiphanie.\n\nI remember a time when Epiphanie didn't exist in the lovely little strip that is 11th St. I also remember the day I saw brown paper in the windows and a sign that said \"chocolate store-coming soon.\" And then, the memorable day when the brown wrapping was taking down and I could peer in the windows on my way to work before it was open, and peer in the windows again on my way home from work after it was closed. I made it in on a lunch hour once and managed a sample. This time around, I came out with a little box of four chocolates. I'm scared what the next time will bring.\n\nWith so many delightfully decorated chocolates and ingredients mixed in to many different chocolates like mint, honey, ginger, passion fruit and the likes, I simply cannot resist. I'm going back to try the hot chocolate (and the guitar with pop rocks in it that Crystal H mentioned).\n\nIdea: buy your Christmas chocolates here. I'll bet your recipients haven't had this chocolate yet.
