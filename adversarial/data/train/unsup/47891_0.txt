Diners, drive ins and dives listed this place as a MUST try do we did. k so first off let me explain why they didn't receive a 5 star. We came at 8pm on a Fri night and it wasn't too busy for a mom n pop spot. The lighting was HORRIBLE. I understand u want to set the mood outside but if customers tell you more than once that they can't read the menus then something needs to change. They lite a candle but it gave little to no help. We had to use our phones. Another thing we noticed is that the food took SSSOOOO long to come out! Also, by the time the food came out (3 plates at first and then another 10 minutes later) the food was luke warm. It seemed like they had plates ready but waited for the others to come out which made the rest of the food barely warm. \n\nOk on the upside, the presentation of the food was great! We ordered beef pad Thai, tropical chicken fried rice, yellow chicken curry and peanut chicken plate. They were all very good, but the temperature of the food down played it. It all tastes great. We were so Hungry after our softball tourney that we didn't want to send it back since it took so long in the first place. \n\nOverall it's pretty good Thai food. Service was good as well. We Had a hard time understanding our waitress but we made it thru. If you're a local come try it.
