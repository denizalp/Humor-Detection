We had bought tickets the moment they were available to the midnight showing of New Moon, so it was a few months before the premiere this past weekend. We expected it to be busy, and planned accordingly.\n\nLittle did we know that a new promotion had come out just a couple of weeks before the premiere, where you could upgrade your ticket to see \"Twilight\" beforehand, then keep your seat for New Moon. This seemed extremely unfair to those of us who simply wanted to see New Moon, and not pay $5 more a ticket to sit through a movie we've seen before just to claim a seat. We soon heard buzzing from other people in line of their disgust, and after a complaint to the manager we were let in early without paying for the upgrade.\n\nIt didn't matter. We were in the third row, all the way on the side. The theatre was 95% full of people watching Twilight. It wouldn't have mattered if we had camped out 24 hours before the midnight showing, we still wouldn't have had a decent shot at a seat.  Very bad planning on the part of the theatre. This will guarantee that I never attempt a popular premiere at Harkins again. It was as if we were being punished for doing everything right, since we bought our tickets in plenty of time, and showed up hours before. You expect it to be busy, naturally. However everyone should have had an equal shot at getting a good seat. Bad move Harkins, bad move.
