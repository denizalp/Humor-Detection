Filed claim for dead Kitchen Aid dishwasher 8\/23. Tech has been over 4 times, replaced countless parts, and now I'm told more parts are needed. Today is 10\/14. Almost 2 months. Unit still dead with no resolution in sight.\n\nThis company takes incompetence and ineptness to a whole new level.\n\nI've given them till 10\/21 to either repair or replace unit. After that I will purchase a new machine and file a lawsuit for bad faith insurance. My attorney has the supporting documents ready and is waiting for my go ahead. \n\nWord to the wise: never, ever get scammed into buying an extended warranty. The never ending delays, excuses and runaround are not worth it. Call a 5 star independent repair tech, get the issue fixed, pay what you owe, and get on with life.
