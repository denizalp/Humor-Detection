My favorite restaurant in the world with the best social media!!!! I always love coming here for lunch or my after club drunk food.\n\nThe most authentic and incredible Mexican food I've ever had in Las Vegas hands down! Their tacos are freaking amazing. My faves are the carne asada and chicken tacos. Their chilaquiles, and breakfest burritos are awesome as well and made correctly! Their elote is also super amazing and so fresh that it comes on the husk! What's cool is that your first basket of chips and salsa is complementary and a refill is so inexpensive.\n\nGreat food and great prices.\n\nTheir margarita and beer selection here is to die for. \n\nI wish I could come here everyday!
