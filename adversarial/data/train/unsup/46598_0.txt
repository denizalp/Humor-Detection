This place had great atmosphere, great service, delicious food, and in great location. The portions are huge so plan to share. You have to try the Bellini too. Delicious!!! I had the Shroom Boom pasta. It was delicious. We also had the Fried Zucchini, simple salad, BBQ pizza, and the cookie with ice cream (I can't remember the name). It was so absolutely amazing and we were so stuffed!! It was worth every miserable step we took back to our car. Lol
