Am surprised but not THAT surprised to see that Freshii's been getting some sub-par reviews.\n\nI read about the founder in a Globe & Mail article and was impressed and couldn't wait to try this place. My first one was the Bangkok Chicken burrito. $6.95, not bad...I was going to opt for the veggie since I'm not that big on meat but dammit, the veggie burrito cost the same if not more (definitely not less than), so I went ahead and ordered the Bangkok Chicken requesting \"more vegetables than brown rice\".\n\nIt came grilled which I was impressed with. Then I ate it. Then I realized that there was A TON of brown rice and not enough veggies. Then I thought to myself, next time I'll just go to Booster Juice (which is literally 15 steps away) and spend $6.95 and be happy about it.\n\nThen a week later I went back to Freshii to give its Veggie Wrap a chance. It was about $7.95. Expensive, and my mind wandered over to Booster Juice again but I stuck to my guns. I even asked for tofu (an extra $1.50). The wrap arrived, I paid $9.52 for this thing. \n\nI ate it. I was incredibly unimpressed and felt extremely ripped off. There were veggies, a pinch-ful of chick peas, sun-dried tomatoes...my tofu. It was dry, no balsamic dressing like the menu said. It was gross-dry. Basically, it was all those things wrapped in a tortilla. \n\nHonestly, I could've just gone to Metro next door and spent $9.52 for a week's worth of this wrap. I could've spent $1 more and gone to Booster Juice for a Regular Drink Combo plus grilled sandwich.\n\nThe good thing about this place is that I bitched on Twitter and they responded right away. I still have to email them about my experience before they decide to do anything about it.
