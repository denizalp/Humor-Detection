I thought my burrito at taco chiwas was good, not great. The burrito was not very big and size and I was ready to fuel the beast. The burritos are pretty basic and there is not much that they put in the burrito. I ordered a beef burrito which was very flavorful. Next time I am here I am probably going to go for the tacos. Will definitely be coming back
