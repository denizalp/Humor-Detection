We found this place on our travels the day before and thought that it would be a great place to try for breakfast. And it was delicious. The cafe au lait was wonderful, recommend getting the 'bowl' if you are a coffee fan. It's worth the treat. We both got eggs with quinoa that was prepared better than most. The fruit that came on the side was fresh. It's definitely worth going back to for breakfast or maybe lunch.
