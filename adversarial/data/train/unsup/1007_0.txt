My hubby & I used to be obsessed with Sweet Tomatoes. We would go like once a week, no joke. After a couple years we got so burnt out on it & didn't go for a while. I have been to this location several times for lunch with mainly my mom, but today I went with my husband. Parking can sometimes be a bitch, especially around noon. I don't know why but every time I am at the salad bar I smell B.O. even if there's no one by me! Maybe it's me, ha, but I think it's the building. \n\nAny who, we love the caeser salad & I really like the tuna tarragon pasta salad. Their soups are pretty good but I am not a huge fan, hubby loves their chili. The steamed veggies are just ok but I always get them, the mac & cheese is kind of blah but I will get a lil bit sometimes. The focaccia breads are good & I love the blueberry muffins. The chocolate brownie muffins aren't good alone, but top one with vanilla fro yo & it's delish. Their cobblers are so good though, wish they had them out during lunch too since we haven't been for dinner in a long time!\n\nSign up for their \"Club Veg\" to receive coupons. I never go here without one & it makes it a pretty good deal when they have their buy 1 get 1 free coupons.
