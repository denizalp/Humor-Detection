The restaurant was not busy whatsoever upon our arrival for a Sunday lunch. We were extremely excited to try this iconic restaurant, but were thoroughly disappointed by the service. Upon being seated, our server seemed annoyed to even be helping us. We got the minimal service from him. Taking our order, bringing our order to our table and then proceeding to have to wave him down to get our bill. The restaurant did not seem like they had a low number of staff to service the few patrons for that afternoon, but our server was seemingly swamped. He apologized for his service upon handing the bill to us, but at that point it was too late. Per the other reviews, pickles were supposed to be served before your meal. We didn't receive that. We also did not receive any followup to ask for refills on our drinks. The food became mediocre when the service was so poor. There are too many delis in this town to give this place another try with such poor service. Totally bummed it was such a bad experience.
