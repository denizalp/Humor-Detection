We called to place a take out order and I ordered a pasta carbonara.  They told me it would be 15-20 minutes.  As I pulled in I got a call from a host saying they made a mistake and don't have a carbonara (why the lazy manager has a host fixing problems with guests is beyond me).  I was frustrated and asked how it takes 15 minutes to figure out you don't even carry the product.  Once he tripped over his words for a minute he put the manager on the phone.  She said it will be taken care of and get the pasta out in about 5 minutes.  I went in and went about 8 minutes without being greeted while sitting at the bar.  The staff making it obvious that I was the angry customer but no one acknowledging my presence. Finally after about 15 minutes the manager comes over with the food(10 minutes after she promised,  keep in mind the restaurant looked to be about 15% occupied).  She came over said they didn't have the item and that was it no sincerity at all,  almost as if I was a bother to her when I showed her the item on the online menu.  I was furious after that,  I sincerely hope one of the Dooley brothers reads this and gets that team together.  I've been to other chains and had a pleasant experience,  not like the one today. I did not eat the meal due to my frustrations so I cannot comment on the food.  I just can't fathom how someone could literally not give a damn after so many mistakes in an 20 minute interaction.
