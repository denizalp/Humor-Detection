You can have more fun with a pocket full of quarters here than any other place in town. Why buy a pinball machine when you can try at least 300 of them here. I go at least 3-4 times per month... Very relaxing & very entertaining. Great variety. Take the time to learn on the older (slower) machines for 25 cents... Then graduate to the newer models that take 50 cents, 75 cents or as much as a $1 to play...
