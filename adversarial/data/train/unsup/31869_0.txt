I have stayed at this property two times this year alone as I was relocating to Fountain Hills and needed a home base. I love this quaint little hide out on the hill. The property is a stunning white adobe like structure with a killer view of Fountain Hills. The strong points of this property is the killer gym on the bottom floor adjacent to the decent sized pool and of course the Flourish restaurant where eating outside on the patio at night is simply delightful.\n\nBoth times I was booked in a premium suite where the view from the balcony was beautiful and serene. As far as the rooms are concerned the beds are very comfy and the bathroom big enough but the rooms needs a little updating. Don't know what it was but it just felt dated. Since there isn't 24 hour room service, a little tip...go to the bottom floor and stock up on sandwiches and cold pressed juices from the juice bar that way you don't have to keep leaving the property to hunt down food.\n\nAlso before heading down to breakfast, check your reservation to see if you paid for continental breakfast or not. Every morning when I went to breakfast there was also a little confusion amongst the guests about whether they had access to breakfast or not. While the breakfast isn't anything to write home about, I heard quite a few guests complaining about $30 to eat a very basic breakfast.\n\nIf you want more details about my stay, you can read more on my blog www.oneinfluencer.com\n\nPS.\n\nIf you're a business traveler this is an out of way location better for play then using as a base. If you're on vacay, the tennis program is world class as is the gym facilities and you'll love the quaintness of this property.
