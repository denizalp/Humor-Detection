East Side San Jose: possibly a pho mecca. East Side Las Vegas: not so much.\n\nPho T is located at the southwest corner of Boulder Highway and Flamingo, and it's one of the closest Vietnamese restaurants to where I live in Henderson. I knew that sooner or later I'd have to give them a try, but maybe I should have waited even longer.\n\nI ordered the #4 House Special Pho ($8.99), which comes with rare steak, brisket, beef meatball, and tendon. Broth seemed nice at first but it lacked depth and complexity. Noodles were fine. Meat was actually pretty good, although it would've been nice if they'd actually served the steak while it was still rare.\n\nI did have issues though. A small one is that the Thai basil served on the side was not as fresh as it should be. Some of the leaves were on the slightly darkened or limp side. Flavor was fine, but you should have vibrantly green leaves. Larger problems are that they don't have a viable large size, with a $5.49 cost to upgrade to XL, and the default bowl size is small for the price. It's as expensive as large bowls elsewhere in Las Vegas and huge bowls at places in California.\n\nI might consider going to Pho T again, but only if I get a specific craving or want to try out their rice and noodle dishes. I'd like to see an establishment run by a Vietnamese family succeed, but they have to be a little better to convince me not to make the trek to Spring Mountain or even to wait until my regular trips back to California.
