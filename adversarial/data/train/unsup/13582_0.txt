This is my first yelp review! I'm happy to be able to let people know about my experience here! I'm a new chicken owner, it was my second time purchasing feed for my chickens. I decided to visit TNT because it is only a few miles away from my home. I wasn't to sure where to find the feed when I walked in, was searching around for awhile when a male employee finally came over to help me. I asked him for organic feed for larger chickens. He condescendingly told me that there is no difference in organic feed and what he had. When I know this isn't so. I didn't appreciate his attitude and told him his feed was over priced and not organic, so I would be going to Higley Feed, where they not only treat new people with respect but help you right away and even load it for you! Don't buy here!! Goto HIGLEY FEED they are very helpful, I don't mind driving the extra miles!!
