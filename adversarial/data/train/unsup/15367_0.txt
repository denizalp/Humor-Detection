I guess I'll be the exception to the rule. Let me clarify a couple of things first, though:\n\n1. I love Aveda salons and this one is no different. The art, the open space, the natural light-beautiful\n\n2. The girls at the desk were beyond friendly and attentive\n\n3. Cecelia, the nail tech, was also competent and wonderful\n\nNow to the 1 star bad (which I REALLY hate giving, by the way).\n\nI came in with purple hair that I have been cutting myself (along with husband's help) for two years. I've had enough bad experiences to just quit salons all together but this time, I needed to change the purple and this was not something that a box was going to fix. So I make my appt and we talk price. She tells me how much the color will be. Cool. She looks at my hair (it's barely chin length) and tells me she won't charge me for a haircut since I basically just want the ends and bangs trimmed. Super cool! The really good thing is that she took my hair from lavender to a deep, espresso brown and I love it. I mean you can't even see the purple through in the sun. The totally lame, shady part? She repeats at least two more times as she is styling my hair, \"Naw, I'm not going to charge you for the hair-cut.\" She shapes my bangs and off we go to the front desk with people standing around and she turns to me and says this:\n\n\"So I'm going to go ahead and charge you full price for one of my hair-cuts and that will make it up for the extra bowl of color I used, k?\" \nAnd she walks away....\n\nExtra bowl of color-$20\nHer hair-cut price-$60\n\nShe basically not only lied to me (three times!) but she also sideswiped me and then gave herself a $40 tip. I was in shock, paid and left and took about this long to process it (happened last Saturday). I have washed my hair since and you can still see the split ends and unevenness from me and my husband's great hair-cutting in the bathroom adventures. I am pissed, to put it mildly. Sorry, Mood Swings, I will not be coming back on March 13th for my gloss because I was quoted $30 but don't want to end up walking out having paid $70 for it to, ya know, make up for the comb usage or the electricity from the hair dryer use.
