How have I not reviewed sweet, sweet Carolina's?\n\nThis place is a dump in the best possible way.  If you've never been here, you're likely to grimace upon arrival.  Sure, the neighborhood is rough, but the real shocker is how dirty this place looks, inside and out.\n\nWhy 5 stars, then?  At Carolina's, it's all about the food.  The tortillas are, as already stated, to die for.  They're soft, yet strong.  Your burrito probably won't be exploding all over itself mid-meal.\n\nI'm a huge fan of the Oaxaca Burrito, which contains generous helpings of chorizo, potato, and other delicious goodies.  The machaca is also very good.\n\nBack to the dump factor (that sounded gross, sorry).  Normally I am easily creeped out by restaurant filth, but not here.  Carolina's reminds me of Christmas Eve parties at my Nana's.  Everyone sitting at shoddy tables in a little room, eating delicious food.  The only thing missing is the mariachi.
