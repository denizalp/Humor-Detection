I have given this place several chances to make things right and.they never have.everytime i have brought my.car in for repair,i ended up bringing it back because the problem wasnt fixed and the owner Andrew would ask me to bring it back to fix it right.he even got upset once because i DID bring it back.every time i ended up taking it somewhere else or a dealership to get fixed correctly.so its like paying 2 shops because ATWOOD EUROPEAN cant accomplish the mision.i even referred a few new customers to him when i first started going there and they all had bad experiences as well.ANDREW,IF I COULD GIVE YOU LESS THAN 1 STAR RATING,I WOULD!!!!! i will never refer anyone to this shop or take my own car in ever again.very disrespectful to customers and always tries to upsell something.what a scumbag.
