There are several people who work here and it seems like when there is a line waiting at the ONE check out they have open by the printer cartridges, it takes a really long time before someone takes notice and opens another register.  The person at the check out does not make the effort to notify anyone of a line, the people in the copy section just hang out and chit chat with each other instead of offering to help.  Actually the only time I have seen them take someone from the line to help is when told to do so by the manager.  \n\nYou would think a place would pride themselves on customer service but not here and not sure why.  Oh well, it here or Staples which actually has cheaper prices on some of the same items.
