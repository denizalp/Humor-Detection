Excellent food. Have been getting delivery from them for a while. They accommodate for some non dairy dishes and are generally very helpful getting you what you want. The food is fantastic. Well spiced and very fresh. I have had many Indian meals ( also having lived in the UK), this is my favourite of my Toronto area.\nHighly recommended .
