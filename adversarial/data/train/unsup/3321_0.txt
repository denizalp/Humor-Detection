OK so, you know the drill, Hubs was hungry and I haven't gone grocery shopping in like two weeks. Give me a break my cat died and work has been hell. So. My husband is hungry, its Friday night, and I am a bad wife as there is nothing to eat aside from some Frito's and some 1 week old cupcakes from my sister in laws wedding in L.A. \n\nMy go to Chinese place is closed for the month of October, shit, I tell him some of my Fav Yelpers have yelped about this place and it is minutes from our house. Off we go. \n\nAs we park, I remind myself what others have yelped, don't let the appearance scare you off. We walk in and there is only one other couple in the place. A lady meets us at the door and tells us to sit wherever. \n\nWe find ourselves at a table by the window. The table cloth is stained, the floors are beyond dirty. I keep chanting the food will be amazing. \n\nFirst up, the corn egg drop soup. I liked it a lot, it had a subtle pepper taste to it. \n\nNext up the Crab puffs with a dipping sauce that I wasn't totally sure what it was. Usually you get a sweet and sour sauce with crab puffs. The sauce they served was fruity, I thought it tasted like fruity pebbles. It was good whatever it was. \n\nNext out were the entrees. I played it safe and went with Orange Chicken, hubs went with Shrimp in Lobster sauce. We ate it ALL! Every thing was perfect! \n\nLastly came the egg rolls. She had forgotten we had ordered them so we had to remind her. I was unaware that egg rolls even existed in that size! They were like mini burritos! HUGE! They were made fresh right on the spot and were stuffed to the gills with chicken, shrimp and all kinds of tasty veggies! \n\nIf appearance matters to you, then this is not your place. \nIf amazing, fresh, cheap, fast Chinese food is for you, then Wahsun is for you!
