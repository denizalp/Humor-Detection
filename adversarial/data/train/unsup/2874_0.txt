Nah nah honey I'm good,\nI could have another, \nbut probably not from here. \n\nI've never had a Fat Tuesday before, and have only seen people carrying around the iconic, large and skinny yards. So I was looking forward to sipping on one myself as I walked the strip. My boyfriend and I walked around Planet Hollywood until we found it near Guess. I'll admit, I was so excited that I did not even see that there was a line and started asking the bartender about their drinks. She didn't reply a single word, and simply pointed behind us. The bouncer comes up to us and tells us we have to get in line. Of course, we feel silly and ashamed that we didn't realize there was a line, but they didn't let us know nicely either. \nWhen we reach the bouncer again during our turn in queue, he checks my ID and says in a degrading tone, \"you'll wait right here\" for the next bartender to be available. When I get to the bartender she failed to ever say Hi or smile. She just told me the price with a side of attitude.\n\nNo thanks, not when there's tons of other places serving practically the same alcoholic slushies. \n\nBy the way, if you're looking to even get buzzed, you better buy extra shots because these drinks are nothing more than frozen sugar water. However, if you like overly sweet drinks, it might be OK.
