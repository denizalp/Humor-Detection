As a fairly cheap and broke Concordia student, I like this place. I REALLY like this place.\n\nThe 2$ trio became 2.50$ trio (including cheap drink in a styrofoam cup, a falafel sandwich and a soup of your choice). It is THE best quality\/price Lebanese restaurant I ever set foot in.\n\nGranted, the portions seem smaller than other Lebanese restaurants but it's still at a higher quantity\/price ratio that I've ever seen. The pitas are the freshest I've ever tasted and the service is fairly fast. The lady at the counter seems hateful towards life but is actually really friendly if you bother to throw more than a \"Hi I'd like X, Y and Z please\" at her.\n\nThe place is kind of small and cramped but with those prices, it's to be expected. The chairs at the tables seemed to have been stolen at a local daycare center and the tables wobble.\n\nRecommended. :)
