Again here is another Charlotte institutions that it took me to long to get to. I actually watched the episode of Triple D before going and was curious by cornbread battered shrimp which was amazing!\n\nI was super surprised by the large amount of vegetarian options on the menu including veggie chili, veggie dogs, and even better the Veggie Corn dog!!! \n\nThe prices are really what makes this place stand out, everything is very reasonable and matches the low key paper trays that all the food comes out on.\n\nThey also have a solid beer selection along with a full bar. If the weather is nice you should sit outside on their porch. Parking can be a bit dicey due to the corner it is on, so keep an eye open as you get close.
