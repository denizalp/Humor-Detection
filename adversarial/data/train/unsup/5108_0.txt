This business is called \"Jacks Run Auto Center\" now, formerly Parker Auto. Took him (Gary the owner) three days to even look at my car. This was the second estimate on my car and he literally was trying to charge me double (first estimate $800, Jacks Run estimate $1400). He tried charging me for new catalytic converters when I had already put new ones on three years ago. Total rip off artist. His Angie's List page says they give free estimates, he charged me $67 when I told him I couldn't afford his estimate. Do not take your vehicle here.
