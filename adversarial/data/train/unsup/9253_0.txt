Where the hell can I get a big latte for less than $4 in the plateau? Nowhere, not if you want it to be crazy yummy. \n\nDo you? Do you want the person making your latte to smile and look you in the eye? Do you want to pay quickly and just chill and love your coffee?\n\nCaf√© Rico, my friends.\n\nI am obsessed with this place. I'm never buying a coffeemaker. Ever. I live here now.
