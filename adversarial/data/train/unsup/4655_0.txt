When I'm travelling I am ALL ABOUT going somewhere new to eat, especially when its BUSINESS TRAVEL because I'm NOT PAYING!\n\nI wanted something easy and Bunny had come out as well and he was looking for some MEAT to sink his teeth into.  Enter in this place.  It's located in a HUGE strip mall so there was PLENTY of parking.  It was also FLAMIN HOT out as in was AUGUST in PHOENIX!  Need I say more.  \n\nWe hopped out the car and made a dash inside to soak in the FREE AC and much to our surprise it was HOTTER THAN A jalape√±os cooch inside the place, which was only a few degrees cooler than it was OUTSIDE!  WTH?  JE-SUS, MARY ANNNDDDD JOSEPH where is the AC!\n\nThe first thing we ordered were drinks to cool the H*LL OFF so we could think.  AIN'T NOBODY interested in eating when it 90 EF'in Degrees inside with 100% humidity!  I'm surprised the State didn't shut them down if the AC was broken, which I suspect it wasn't they just weren't using it.\n\nSo AFF-TA that we were able to read the menu without SWEAT running into our eyes and having the salt burn out our corneas.  Bunny went with some sort of meat plate.  I mean you can see them roasting the dead animal on the SPIT right in front of your eye and FEEL the heat coming off the grill.  I got a veggie burrito.  They are NOT VEGGIE FRIENDLY AT ALL nor do they do anything with fish.  ALL MEAT!\n\nWe wait and refill our cup with cool liquids while we wait.  I SWEATIN LIKE A POLITICIAN in CHURCH trying not to loose my mind. We contemplated JUST LEAVING but GOD ONLY knows WHY WE DIDN'T!\n\nOur food finally comes up and we go grab it.  They have a salsa bar like the one in Baja Fresh.  Same Salas and items same concept!  We dug in and ate lunch!  It was lack luster at best.  Noting inside the rito seemed seasoned.  Was more like they took it straight out a can or frozen package.  Bunny wasn't impressed either and he LOVES MEAT!  He said the meat was season either which is sad.\n\nThe only good thing about this place was I LOST 15lbs JUST SWEATING like a wildebeest inside this establishment!  I would not RECCOMEND this place even in the winter when you could warm up from the cold air because the food was good!
