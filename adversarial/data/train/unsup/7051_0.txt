DISCLAIMER: While my Skeptic little self has never experience Knox United Church (or any other church, truth be told) as a religious organization, I really appreciate its role in Calgary's music community.\n\nIt would seem that all of the best shows occur at Knox. It is where I have had the chance to see some of my favourite (has anyone else noticed that Yelp totally spellchecks the Canadian spelling of FAVOURITE? Probably just jealous that we spell it proper) artists perform, such as Owen Pallet, Timber Timbre, Daniel Johnston, Dan Mangan, and the list goes on. I've seen Owen Pallet a few times here, and the acoustics of the church always contain his violin music more beautifully than I have ever witnessed seeing his act at outdoor festivals or larger venues. Daniel Johnston was also completely haunting, which I believe the space contributed to a lot. \n\nThe church itself aesthetically is absolutely gorgeous, and rich in history, from what I understand. The sound is something I just can't get over. Incredible. There is something about this venue that makes me all warm inside. I actually sometimes attend shows based on whether or not it is at Knox.
