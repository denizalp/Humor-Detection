I came here not only because I saw it on Yelp but because some of my friends told me to. So I brought my neice and nephew since they wanted some chicken fingers. We all got the 3 piece meal which included, duh, 3 pieces of chicken fingers, piece of bread, fries and a drink. The bread just reminded me a little like Hawaiian bread, slightly toasted. Fries were just ok. Sweet tea was good and I could feel the cavity creeps starting to make a home as I drank it. Chicken fingers were crispy and seasoned nicely but the secret sauce was THE BOMB YO! Yeah, I said \"the bomb yo\". You taste it and wonder \"what the hell is in this?\" I was trying to figure out what the flavors were in this sauce. It could have been ass juice and barf for all I know. Actually, it seemed to have a thousand island background. Ranch too? I dont know. But it was hella good. Yeah, I said hella.
