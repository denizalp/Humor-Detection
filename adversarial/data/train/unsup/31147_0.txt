After reading a glowing review in the Globe and Mail we had high expectations for our first time eating Filipino food and we were not disappointed.  We loved the \"Eat with your Hands\" experience offered on Sunday.  Different chefs brought and explained each food item as we watched them paint dipping sauces on bannana leaves and create a beautiful display of food as we waited to devour the delicacies.   And the food was as good as it looked.  We'll be back.
