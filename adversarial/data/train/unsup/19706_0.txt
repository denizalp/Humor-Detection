We have been shopping here since the initial opening and week by week it's gone down hill.  First of all the place needs a good cleaning, when they first opened it was shiny and brand new, i don't think the floors, glass on freezer section, public washrooms, shelves all around and the butcher areas have seen a broom or disinfectant since then.  Come on guys it's a grocery store clean it up.  The prices are now consistent with any low cost grocery like no frills or food basics.  The customer service is atrocious.  I asked at the butcher department for some help with getting some chicken (told me no one could help till 9am)  then why do you open at 8am.  The deli which used to be so inviting doesn't have anyone there till 10am and if you look at the expiry dates on the meats most are nearing the end of shelve life.  The lack of english of the floor staff is not good, even the manager hasn't a grasp on simple request.  Mind you the cashier are friendly and efficient, they should put some of them in customer service.  The halal butcher is just plain rude, i went to get some ground beef from that section and he pointed towards the other butcher area noting that his meat was halal, duh, so what.  I buy kosher and halal meat all the time if it's on sale.  When I asked him if there was a problem with me buying halal meat he kinda shrugged his shoulders in disgust.  The hot kitchen area used to be fantastic.  I think that part is brokered out, the chinese bbq is still great, but the rest take a pass, they make the food around 11am and push it all day.  The tandori oven chef is always missing in action.    I have noticed a drastic decline in customers on each shopping trip, so it's not only me.  I'm done with Al Premium.  \n\nnote:  i wonder why not one person that works there is Caucasian , just an observation but is a bit of reverse discrimination going on.
