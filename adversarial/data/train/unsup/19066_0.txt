If I lived in Cleveland, I think I would Flea for the winter. Down south or something.\n\nBut if you want Fleas in Cleveland, come to this massive Flea market, which I was dragged to by my thrifty friends in town and a girl from Buffalo that I thought I was bringing to Cleveland for things other than shopping.\n\nI'd give it a 5 star rating for sure if it wasn't free. It takes place on the 2nd Saturday of every month in a massive industrial relic of the old days of Rust Belt Cleveland, and has a lot of everything you could imagine. I don't like that they charge you to get in, though.
