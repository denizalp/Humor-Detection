4 stars for the fries only. Months later, I still dream about the fries. Belgian-style. Fried in duck fat. Excellent portion. What more can you ask for?\n\nExtensive selection of beer. What's great is you can try any 3 draft beers for $6 for 4 oz pours. Mussels were nothing memorable, though the sauce was perfect with the delicious complimentary bread.\n\nWe hung out in the bar area, which had comfortable seating and fantastic service. This was a short stop for us, just a quick bite and beer, so we didn't get to try the rest of the menu. But I would definitely stop for the fries if I'm in the area. And some beer.
