First time here and will NEVER come back. CLAIRE the barista was the rudest barista I've met at Starbucks. Not only will she not take ownership of her mistake, she will argue with you to prove herself \"right\". When you ask for her name, she'll refuse to give it to you and then turn it around on you saying \"you started yelling at me\". Nice try. Be grateful you have a job with that attitude. If you don't like your job, QUIT. No one will cry about you leaving. Trust. #aintnobodygottimeforyourattitude8inthemorning #starbucks #customerservice #failed
