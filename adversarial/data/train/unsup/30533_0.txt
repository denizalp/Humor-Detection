I'm not sure if they forgot about me, but I must of waited about half an hour for someone to take my order on a Monday when the place wasn't very busy. The bubble tea is okay. I've found it watery in the past, but they give you popcorn so that's nice. The vibe is really neat. Great decor. A trendy looking place to hang out and have bubble tea with friends, but if I had to rate it on just bubble tea and service, it might not be my first choice.
