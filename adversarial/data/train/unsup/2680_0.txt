I will never go to this location again. I went with some of the girl so happy hour with the  intentions to bring food home for me and my husband, when it came time to order I asked the waitress, when she dropped off the other girl food that I would like to place a to go order then. So it will be ready a bit after they got there's so I could stay and socialize. The waitress incised, so I told her how I wanted it timed and she said she understood. So I placed my order. I should have known it was going to be a disaster. My food showed up with all the other food, and the waitress was no where to be found. She showed up 20 min later. So I explained to her what happened and that I would like new food, and the check as soon as the new food showed up. She took the food back and brought the checks then 6 min later brought me my \"new\" food. Really, we all know that there is no food that can be made in 6 min. So I then spoke with the manager and got it all straightened out. That was nice. But I just got home and they gave me chicken tacos when I ordered beef. Not good.
