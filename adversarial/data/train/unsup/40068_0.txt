We revisited the weekend brunch on our most recent trip.  I was the designated 'drinker' today so my wife ordered a coffee while I chose a cucumber mimosa (2.5 Sips out of a possible 5).  This mimosa did not include any pulp like the one last year so the flavor was muted.  \n\nWe were served the usual fresh melon with citrus sauce (3.5 Forks) and guava empanadas (4 Forks) while we reviewed the menu that I now have memorized.\n\nOn our first round we ordered a plantain empanada (3), crispy rajas taco (3.5), fig and blue cheese quesadilla (4) and a waffle and pork belly with maple syrup (4). The second round began with a mango mimosa (2.5 Sips) followed by orders of chorizo and egg taco (4.5), short rib hash (4.5), breakfast enchilada (4) and green egg and ham (2).  \n\nMy glass was empty so I ordered a pineapple mimosa (3 Sips) while we again reviewed the menu to see what dishes would close out this feast.  Our order included another pineapple mimosa for me, a brisket omelet (4) and a double order of bread pudding French toast (5).  As I was finishing the last morsel I realized an alien had finished my mimosa so another pineapple mimosa was required.  \n\nFor those counting, and I surely couldn't at this point, I achieved a personal record this afternoon by consuming 5 mimosas.  I had recently signed up for Border Grill's VIP club and received a free entree coupon which I was allowed to apply against our bill.
