Great service and fast.  We arrived in Las Vegas on the 7am arrival and headed straight over to the rental car center, and to our surprise (based on past experience) there was NO line and the service was incredible.  The lady that helped was pleasant, although she looked as if she could give you a solid ass whippn' if necessary, and processed us quickly and painlessly.\n\nGreat experience !!!
