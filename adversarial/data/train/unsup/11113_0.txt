Again, since the daughter is Vegan now so far, I have had a fun time trying out some places here in town.  \n\nFirst of all, I have to say that our server Nikki was absolutely awesome and made our experience here fantastic. Just her overall disposition and being-ness was great.\n\nThe ambiance - This place is great.  When you go to places like Skinny Fats which cannot accommodate too many people, this place can accommodate quite a bit of people. It is airy, has a very eclectic feel.\n\nThe Food - We came here for the food and all I have to say is phenomenal.\n\nMy Little Dumplings - If no one told you this was vegan, you would never know. The taste, juiciness is as good as it gets. The shitake mushrooms and the dumplings in this thing I would compare it to any dumpling vegan or not.  The dipping sauce was tasty as well.\n\nHot Tamale - I have to admit, I am not a big tamale fan.  However Nikki our waitress recommended this and we tried it. I loved it. Wonderfully presented in a tied up husk that was very easy to separate and crazy good.\n\nBao Wow - I love normal meat bao and to try this was, I have to say I was thoroughly impressed. I felt like I was at one of my favorite dim sum places and if this was on their menu, I would be ordering it for sure, vegan or not! The bbq tofu in this was great.\n\nSave the Tuna - What can I say, the rice was perfect, the texture right, the taste just right. Can't go wrong with this one and what a joy to have sushi like this.\n\nVegenation Burger - Nice hunking juicy sized burger with black beans, walnuts and mushrooms.  A bit messy as it was breaking apart on the edges, but this is very nice. I like to use burgers to compare many veggie \/ vegan places.  This was better than the one at Skinny Fats.\n\nOut of Africa Stew - This was the deal breaker. I was conflicted between this and the tagine dish of the Casa Blanca.  Love dishes created in a tagine. However, Nikki recommended the Out of Africa Stew. Slightly spicy, yam okra, greens and peanuts.  I was so full trying everything else, however, this thing was a standout. Creamy, spicy, served over quinoa, this was to me the signature piece and they hit it out of the ballpark.\n\nI found this restaurant as one of the best I have been to overall irregardless of it being a Vegan \/ Vegetarian place.  I really look forward to come here again, and again, and again!\n\nI say, I can't wait.
