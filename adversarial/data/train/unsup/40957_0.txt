We retained Ms. Connolly for a family member that was looking at some prison time due to drug addiction. Ms. Connolly was very honest and up front with us,  always giving us the worse case scenario but promising to do her best. Because of her expertise,  knowledge and professionalism she was able to get us the best case scenario. We were praying for some type of rehabilitation. It was evident that Ms. Connolly is highly respected and valued. Because of her we now have our beautiful,  drug free family member working and finishing her college degree. I know it wasn't easy for her as there were several charges in different courts and many obstacles,  but Ms. Connolly dealt with them with ease. Our family will be forever grateful.  We highly recommend Karen Connolly's services.
