Can't believe I never written a review for this place. La Cav Du Vin or \"Wine Cave\" is easily one of my favorite spots on the east side \/\/ Cleveland Heights area. It was the first place I fell in love with when I moved here from California. You typically walk down these steps where it smelled like piss (I'm confident it's not like that now) and B Side lounge is blasting their music, but once you open this heavy ass door, you have this reaction like \"WTF\" where was this place hiding ?\n\nThe place itself is pretty sweet. One of the first things you notice is the atmosphere and the lack of lighting, but it adds to the feel of the place. It's dim, it's charming, it's romantic, it's everything an adult would want a chill place to be. The second thing I notice is the 4 doors or wall of refrigerated beer. They have all kinds, which is a little overwhelming for your first time, but go there enough and you waste no time picking out some of your favorites. Mine is the Hitachino Nest Beer (White Ale) aka \"The Owl\" beer. If beer is not your thing, Wine Cave also has a great selection of wines and liquors. The food here is also underrated. I think their charcuterie and cheese board is a solid choice.\n\nNot sure why La Cav Du Vin is ever considered pretentious. Yeah, they won't allow you to pour your own drink, but it's a comfortable place for intellects, students, hipsters, non-hipsters, classical musicians, and people to hang out and enjoy a drink! As long as the kids are waiting for their parents to pick them up outside, I'm happy.
