First time staying at the Venetian and as others have mentioned, worth the visit for the suite-style hotel rooms alone. Comfortable ends, large bathroom, comfortable seating area, and quiet.\n\nI visited a couple of the restaurants in the hotel and was disappointed by both but neither were a high end eatery. My limited experience with the employees were pleasant and not overbearing. Can't say the same for the black jack dealers.\n\nI don't love the layout of the connection with the Palazzo, especially compared to the Belagio or some other comparable casinos, but the canal shops are great.
