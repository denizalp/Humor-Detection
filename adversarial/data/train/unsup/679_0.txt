This is not one of the best Mediterranean style restaurants in town. It is conveniently located in the Village Center shopping center where many locals in the area frequent. \n\nI have not visited Sultan's Grill in months. I used to come regularly over the span of seven years. I stopped coming frequently due to a rapid decline in customer service, food quality, and the inflated pricing for what you get. \n\nMy previous experience nearly ended it for me when the staff couldn't wait to rush me out the door fifteen minutes before closing time. The lamb was cold and appeared to be scraps - as though they turned everything off and put everything away prior to my walking in and then made my food with what they were going to toss out. So naturally I thought - coming in around closing time is not a good idea since closing time is not literally when they close.\n\nThis visit, I figured I would see how the restaurant is handling customer service and food quality prior to dinner rush around 4:30pm. Well, customer service is still not very good. Staff is much more preoccupied with dinning at the front table and chatting with friends than providing even a small amount of service. \n\nThe food quality this round was good. We each had a large Greek salad with gyro meat. I have to that say though that serving a large salad on a flat plastic dinner plate makes tossing and eating the salad a little difficult. Since all the toppings are on top, you kind want to toss the salad without dumping your salad on the table. The pita bread that comes with the salad is good and they offer two types of dressing for the Greek salad. I always get the house vinaigrette.
