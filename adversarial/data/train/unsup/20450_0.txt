Have you ever gone to a new hair dresser and gotten a haircut and that haircut just happens to be the best haircut you've ever had in your life and you feel like you're Charlie Bucket when he discovered the golden ticket... You have this feeling like everything is perfect and you are truly happy. This is how I felt when I walked into this restaurant. There was old timey New Orleans jazz cover of the Marvin Gay sexual healing song playing in the background, the industrial style decor felt warm and inviting. The mouth watering aromas of fresh made food had me salivating before I had even sat down . I felt like I was meant to walk through that door, and I was home. I was torn between ordering chicken and waffles or the grande taco .... I went with the taco. I asked for hot sauce, and was informed of their house sauce made from homemade candied jalape√±os. Holy shit; MIND BLOWN!!!! They had a good selection of specialty beers.  The bartender\/server was knowledgable on the beers they had and I told him what I usually drink and he suggested the Lupulus. He was spot on! The prices were very reasonable for Montreal, especially for the old port. And as you can tell by my picture it's American sized portions. The only reason I gave it five stars is because they didn't have an option to do six.
