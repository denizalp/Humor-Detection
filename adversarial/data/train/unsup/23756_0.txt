I'm really not sure how this shop keeps any customer base at all. I went in with a broken lens mount and had no idea how expensive it would be to repair and wanted to know if it would be worth it before committing to any type of expensive repair since it was a kit lens that came with my camera - they demanded $40 before they would even look at the camera (although the problem was quite obvious, a small piece of plastic on the outside that had been snapped off). They also wanted to take the whole camera (even though only the lens was broken, and it has a standard mount), and refused to even give an idea of whether or not they would be able to fix it.\n\nAll the while, treating me like I was an idiot and an inconvenience to them. I've never felt so disrespected at a place of business in my life. Just because I'm not a professional photographer doesn't mean I don't know my own equipment.\n\nSo Ritz Camera did the job instead.\n\nUPDATE: As one reviewer mentioned, a diagnostic fee is not an unreasonable thing to charge, I just took issue with the fact that I had a common lens with an obvious problem and they wanted me to pay $40 before they would give me a yes or no as to whether they would fix it. I would happily pay a $40 diagnostic fee or deposit on the repair if they had been willing to give me a little information on what they thought might be wrong and what kind of repair it might need. It ended up being a really simple repair and I wish I could have given the business to someone local rather than resorting to a big chain like Ritz.
