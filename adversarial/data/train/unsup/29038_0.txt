This is one of those places that you may feel hesitant about writing a positive review because you don't want to let the secret out. However, the secret already is because this small place gets pretty crowded from 11:30 until 1:00 later in the week. I always get my order to go because the space is just too tight for me. It's about the size of a small Subway with some stools at the bar. Some of the tables are close to the drink machine and that also happens to be where the line forms to order so that can get uncomfortable quickly. It's not really in a gas station but there is a gas station next door that has a Subway inside of it. It is in the same strip mall as that station and there is also a dry cleaners in the building.\n\nThe trick is to go after 1:00 or go earlier in the week. They are only open until 5, so dinner is not an option for most people. They have a \"Speedy Gonzalez\" special that is designed to be quick and cheap. For $5.25, you get a taco, and enchilada, beans, rice, and some tortilla chips. I always get the burrito though. It's $6.25 and also comes with beans, rice, and chips. I once tried to get it with spinach but that was not good. It was just microwaved creamed spinach. They have a large variety on the menu but lack the vegetables that some of the chain \"Mexican\" places offer. Some items take longer to prepare such as steak, so if you are in a hurry or they are busy, they will let you know that (the woman that is always working the counter when I go is very nice).\n\nThis is a good place to get some mostly authentic-style Mexican food cheap, without having to do a sit-down at a place like Azteca. If I want something quick, cheap, tasty, and filling, I usually end up here.
