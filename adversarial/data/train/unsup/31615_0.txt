This hotel was perfection through and through. While there were many things that prompted me to write a review, the most outstanding was an interaction I witnessed between what I believe was the General Manager and one of his staff. So often the interactions between staff when they believe no one is looking are entirely unprofessional and can make guests feel uncomfortable. This interaction was filled with kind requests, \"yes sir's,\" and courtesy. These things stand out and are a credit to a slackening hospitality industry. Well Done. \n\nEverything about the hotel is wonderful - a modern pool area with a fantastic view; well appointed and spacious rooms; a welcoming happy hour; and an exceptionally friendly staff. I will betray my Starwoods points each time I visit Phoenix to stay at this hotel. \n\nThank you for a wonderful stay.
