Both times that I have been here were not by choice. I forgot why I never came here but now I remembered. This place sucks! A lot of their entrees had too much salt or lacked flavored. Beyond disappointed that nothing hit the spot besides the lau lau which was decent enough. To top it off I didn't even enjoy their desserts. Glad both times I came I did not have to pay as I was treated but even then I did not enjoy the food. Never coming back and our server sucked as well.
