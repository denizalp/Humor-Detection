We had some time to walk around the Bellagio which is probably my all time favorite on the Strip as it is elegant and timeless.  We ran across Jean Philippe with its world largest nontraditional chocolate fountain.  If you are looking for a casual bite or to satisfy your sweet tooth, this is a nice option as they have sandwiches, paninis, crepes, baked goods and pastries like the nutella brioche.
