The place was very small to get in and out of. Parking is limited. However I have to disagree with the lack of customer service. The person who helped me started to tell me my options and prices. Sadly it was out of my price range. He kept finding things wrong with the lenses I brought in which increased the price. I briefly explained (I think it was the only time I spoke) that it was out of my price range. He said \"well then see how a new pair of frames will cost you.\" Not helpful not friendly. Will find alternatives.
