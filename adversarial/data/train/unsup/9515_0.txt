We've been here a few times. We've never smoked though. The stuff is cool, they have a neat selection of posters, great deals on oils, and some cool vintage clothes. Their prices are good, nothing is over priced. They have some cool pieces and interesting doo-dads. Don't get me wrong, the guy who works there is incredibly nice. But I don't like the vibe he sets. Lots of negative talk about another shop, I don't know... just kinda overdoes it in the talk department.\nWe will definitely check this place out to have some sheesh and relax. Maybe vip it up in the little loungy area they have which looks really cool.
