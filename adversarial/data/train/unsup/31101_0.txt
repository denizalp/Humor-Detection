I was in middle school in the 90s when this place opened, so I remember enjoying it for a few years back then before aging out. Going back now with my 4-year-old, I'm really impressed: it's a solid draw for kids maybe 3 to 14, and a lot of the exhibits have enough content to interest the adults as well.\n\nI really appreciate the wide range with themes of water, robots, anatomy, trains, electricity, and astronomy. The indoor play area on the top floor even has some math skills built in, and I appreciate a place for little ones to get out some energy during a long stay.\n\nThe price is reasonable; for locals, a membership would be the way to go.
