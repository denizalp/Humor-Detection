Food was bland (our group had the filet, chicken, and burger and found they all were not seasoned whatsoever). Chicken tasted like plain, boiled chicken. Bread and butter as an appetizer was actually the best part of the experience, but it came to our table almost 45 minutes after we ordered it. Service took almost 2 hours from start to finish, which was not surprising because it looked like there were only two servers in the entire restaurant. Would not return unless there were drastic changes to service and menu.
