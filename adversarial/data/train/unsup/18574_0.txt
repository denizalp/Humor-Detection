As a native from Cleveland I was so excited to find out Fahrenheit was coming to Charlotte. For of you that don't know, the owner also has as location in Cleveland. The menus are slightly the same, but they have a select few different options. I loved the Cleveland location when I went there, but the Charlotte spot has been a miss for me. \n\n-The location: Nothing can beat the view! The restaurant is located on one of the top floors of the Hyatt hotel and the view is AMAZING! They don't have much outdoor seating which is a bummer- it's more of a hang out spot. But this is a must for out of towners. You see the entire Charlotte skyline,\n\n-The drinks: The cocktails are awesome and unique! However, they are a little pricey with the average drink price around $12. The wine selection is Ok. Nothing to rave about for being a nice restaurant.\n\n-The atmosphere: It's modern, but elegant. A bit fancier than most places so make sure you comb your hair when you come here.\n\n-The food: This is the biggest miss for me. The food was just average. Nothing to really rave about. I got the salmon once, which was served with wasabi mashed potatoes. Holy crap- whoever thought of that idea needs to go back to the drawing board. My brother is a head chef and thought that sounded disgusting too. My husband got the filet and it was good- but again, nothing to rave about. It was a little tough. On the bright side- the calamari was pretty good, but nothing to come back for.\n\n-The service: Service has been hit or miss. The first time we came here our service was horrible! When we sat at the bar the bartenders have been great though.\n\nOverall, I would come here for special occasions or to take out of town guest- mainly for the view. I recommend to sit at the bar and get a drink & app, but not stay for dinner. I think there are better places to eat in Charlotte for the money. OR just travel to the Cleveland location :-) Since I loved the Cleveland location I'll give this a 3 stars....
