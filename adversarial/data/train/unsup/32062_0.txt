My absolute favorite sushi place in the area, actually anywhere. The sushi is always so good and fresh and can not beat the $3 roll specials. One of their best specialty rolls is the Pink Lady. One is one then enough since is so large.  \n\nBesides the sushi, the ladies who work there are very sweet and remember you when you come in. On many days our sushi would be ready for us if we called in and wanted to eat there.
