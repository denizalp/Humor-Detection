My regular dentist referred me to them 6 months ago. They kept insisting I go to their Centennial office. I'm not fond of driving all over BFE so I want the Summerlin office. No follow up, nothing and they never return my calls to make an appointment. Flash forward 6 months and the tooth I need extracted has abscessed! Dentist again refers me here. I go in with a raging migraine. Their office is as bright as the sun and they have 80's pop blaring from every crook and cranny of their office. I was told it's a quick 5 minute appointment. Wrong, lie. Girl at front desk tells me it's 2 hours! I sit there in agony waiting for over an hour. As a plus, the receptionist's pungent cheap perfume makes my migraine worse! Girl takes me for bite wing x-ray, then tells me it will be another 2 hour wait for doctor! I tell her look, I'm in serious pain, this tooth is throbbing and hurts when air hits it! She says they don't give out pain meds even after surgery! Not even Motrin or ibuprofen! Then she starts talking about how I need sedation and it's over $1,600 for one tooth. I'm out. Screw that. Total waste of time. 10 girls at front were loud and cackling like hens then entire time making my migraine worse! I had to go straight to the ER thanks to her brothel brand perfume. Totally unprofessional and greedy!\n\nThen they still tried to get me to pay a co-pay and reschedule to come back since I couldn't wait 2 more hours! I'd already been there 2 hours! I'm not trying to move in and they made me miss work for this BS! No thanks scammers. Casinos are less of a rip off than this place! Avoid at all costs.
