Today I got a to go order from here. I tried something new  and it was delicious. I usually go with pad Thai at Thai restaurants but I decided to get the Pud prew wan. It was like a sweet and sour stir fry. So delicious.  The restaurant  was very efficient and my order was ready before I finished my beer. I plan on returning to this restaurant.
