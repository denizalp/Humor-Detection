It was a unique and fun experience dining in the dark. We went there last night for a friend's birthday. \n\nThe food was good. I didn't know it was vegan. When my friend invited us to this place. I was kind of scared because I am a picky eater and I like to see what I'm eating. So coming here was an adventure and the experience was wonderful. \n\nOur server tiki was very nice. We enjoyed the dinner and the whole experience
