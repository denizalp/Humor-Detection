I've never even tried Portuguese so I was a bit nervous about eating at this place. My boyfriend loves Portuguese food so I left him in charge of what to eat.\n\nWe went there around 4-5 pm for a late lunch early dinner. It was empty at the time so the owner and the waitress were able to give us most of their time. The owner introduced her self right away and so did the waitress. She told us about their restaurant and how it's the first Portuguese restaurant in Las Vegas. They went through the menu with us since it was our first time there. I was surprised at how knowledgeable the waitress was about every item in the menu. \n\nThere is a complimentary bread basket in the beginning. The basket had two types of bread. The first one was a cinnamon bread. It was very soft and slightly sweet. It went really well with the butter. The other bread was an herd bread with a caviar dipping sauce. It was really delicious. I wanted seconds but, I wanted to leave room for rest of the meal.\n\nWe ordered calamari, pig ears, and paella. The calamari was good. It has a very light flavor and I think it was intended to be that way. It was lemony and buttery so I enjoyed this one more than my boyfriend did. The pigs ear was really good! It was not tough where you would find yourself chewing excessively, but slightly chewy andy crunchy. It came with two sauces, a vinegar one and a spicy one. Both were very good. The paella was simply amazing. I did not know what the sauce was but this stuff was really good. I'd recommend everyone to try their paella. \n\nWe also ordered their dessert of the day which was a mascarpone roll with ice cream and berry sauce. This was really good. I can describe the taste as a cookies and cream cheesecake. Though I would've thought that texture was going to be gritty from how it looked, it was the opposite. It was smooth and creamy. Definitely would love to have it again.\n\nAnd the best thing about it all is that everything is homemade.
