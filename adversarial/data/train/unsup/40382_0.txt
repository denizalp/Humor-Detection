How cute is this place!  A friend had her bridal shower here in the little back room, and it was so perfect for what she needed.  Small space, but enough elbow room, and great food!  We had a little brunch buffet with some mimosas (hell yeah!), and it was super tasty.  Not your typical limp buffet bacon, it was thick, cooked perfectly, and delicious.  Fluffy pancakes that were literally the same size as the inside part of the dinner plate, and plentiful whipped cream.  Just enough food to hold you over.  The staff was very nice, and everything was picture perfect.\n\nI wish I could have parked closer though!  The parking is atrocious (as it is everywhere in the 'burgh), but I did enjoy a nice stroll through Aspinwall (it's like Pleasantville... who knew?!).\n\nAlso, maybe the staff should have erased the \"Thirsty Thursday\" advertisement from the chalkboard in the party room.  I wasn't offended (thought it was hilarious, actually), but I can see how someone's grandmother could be.\n\nAside from those things, beautiful party in a beautiful location!
