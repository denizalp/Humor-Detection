I can't believe I haven't updated my review from the time they first opened.  I have been here several times for purchases and yesterday for a repair.\n\nAfter contacting Apple Support online, I made an appointment to bring my Mac to the Genius Bar when I had a crash while installing the new OS.  My genius was Rick and he was extremely helpful and knew exactly what to do after asking me a few questions.\n\nHe started the Mac and got the same \"problem\" options I got.  After knowing I had a backup on my Time Capsule at home that was only 6 days old, he erased the hard drive, installed Mohave--the new OS--and I was all set to go.\n\nI brought my Mac home, got it online with my wifi and then began the hours long process of restoring my data from the Time Capsule backup.  All my photos, all my music, all my documents--only one spreadsheet had some missing items.  Now I'll back up automatically and it will always be up-to-date.\n\nRick, thanks for your help!  You're one of the reasons I have always been an Apple buyer starting in 1984.
