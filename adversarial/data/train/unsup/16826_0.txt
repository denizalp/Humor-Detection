Me and my girls needed some last minute nails done. We called and asked how long the wait was for 3 gel manicures and we got right in when we showed up. I have a friend that I usually go to, to get my nails done, but her salon is on the opposite side from me and I have to book far in advance, however, she's honestly the best so I'm very particular with who does my nails. \n\nI originally wanted to do an ASU nail design on my nails and this was the second nail salon that said they couldn't draw the design. I ended up choosing a fall design for them to do. I had two different people work on my nails and showed them a picture of what I wanted. They got the color pattern wrong, but the design turned out ok. \n\nI think that it ended up being over priced for what I wanted, not to mention all of my friends got a massage with their gel manicures and I didn't. They get a three star for the attempt at the nail design and the fact that we didn't have to wait long.
