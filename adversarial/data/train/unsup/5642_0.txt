Worste customer service ever. Went in & asked the girl behind the counter about prices, when she was done texting she quickly went over them & was rude about it. I'll never return.\n\nLuckily I found Elite Tanning off Silverado Ranch & Bermuda. Girls are always friendly & the salon is always clean. Love all the beds they offer & great on prices :)
