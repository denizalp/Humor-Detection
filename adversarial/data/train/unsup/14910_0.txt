Dear God... what was I thinking?\n\nI wanted a quick trim for the weekend, and I just couldn't wait for my appointment at Swank Salon in two weeks... \n\nYea, yea, I get what I deserve, you get what you pay for, etc...\n\nThe girl didn't even listen to a word I said - It shouldn't be too complicated considering I don't have that much hair left to begin with, and certainly not a complex style.\n\nDamn you Great Clips!\n\nWell at least I have an excuse to buy myself a new hat.
