Since my last visit, this spot seems to have blossomed. Came for a few afternoon visits and staff were friendly and welcoming. Finally got a chance to sample the food and have fallen in love with the madeleines and sandwiches, particularly the Est (brie cheese, tomato, pesto, and greens, all on a fabulous brioche bun).  I haven't camped out with a mug of tea yet, but as the colder weather settles in, I'm coming by more frequently for grab-and-go coffees, which are always just right. \n\nCome by when you have some time to kill and explore all the little seating areas and the owner's decorative touches- there seems to be a story behind everything. Staff is very professional, and Jonathan is great at suggesting items to try.
