Car sales staff are great. The service department on the otherhand, not so much.\nIt took them 3.5 hours to change the oil and rotate the tires. Most of the time my truck was sitting on the rack with no one around. I watched. They had it parked right in front of the window. I dont care how short handed you are, if I have an appointment that was to take 1.5 hours, why am I leaving 3.5 hours later?
