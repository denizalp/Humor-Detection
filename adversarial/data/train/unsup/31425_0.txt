Cravings is a great buffet for large parties.  You'll need to reserve in advance if you have a party of 16+ guest, otherwise, you'll have random tables all over the restaurant.  Also the prices.  It's $32 a person for dinner, however, that price can get discounted by veterans card (40% off up to 4 people and AAA card (20% up to 4 people).  I save a lot of money doing that.  My experience working with the staff was great especially our waitress.  She was great!!  Service was phenomenal and variety of food was great.  The best thing about eating here is the all you can drink beer and wine which is also part of the price.  I did have one negative, the person who cut me the dried up ribeye should be reviewed.  I didn't say anything at the time because I thought it was normal and it's the way they cook it.  But when bro got his ribeye, it was juicy also a large cut.  However, this place is still 5 stars because of the service, pricing discount, variety of foods, and all you can drink beer\/wine . I will back definitely.  Also, Mirage is one of my favorite place to gamble
