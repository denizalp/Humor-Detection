I'm a big fan of this little restaurant at the top of the central corridor.  The food is outstanding, and the build out of the restaurant itself is quite impressive.  I have been a couple of times now as I am rediscovering the Phoenix restaurant scene, it has become a staple.\n\nThe stuffed burgers are my favorite thing on the menu.  The toppings come inside the burger.  Make sure to be careful or they will burn your mouth.  The sweet potato fries are good and the regular fries are also pretty good.\n\nThe Monday special is outstanding and there is possibly no better deal in town.  $3.  You have to be kidding me.  Too bad Monday night is difficult for me to get here...this is definitely a staple and a great spot for date night or a dinner with some buddies.
