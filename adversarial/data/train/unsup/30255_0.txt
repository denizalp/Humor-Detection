I think part of the reason I like doing the occasional home visits for my job is that I get the chance to eat lunch at local places like Drew's.  Such was the case when I stopped in here last week.\n\nI was mighty tempted by the hot roast turkey and potatoes, but for my money, nothin' says lunch in a diner like a good club sandwich.  I had the turkey club--basically a BLT with sliced turkey.  With a side of coleslaw and some coffee, it was just right.\n\nAs stated before, Drew;'s has been a Forest Hills icon for many years.  In fact, it's been around for over a century.  In my book, Drew's rates a solid 3 to 3.5 stars.\n\nPs.  I think my husband Rick and I will be back for Greek Night on November 8, 2014.
