Found hair in my food at Cora's in Pickering this morning. They did not handle it appropriatly unfortunalty. I go to Cora's in Pickering fairly regularly with my daughter for breakfast always been a good experience. When I found the hair mixed in with my hollandaise sauce this morning I showed the waitress (who was very nice by the way) and she took it and had the kitchen redo my meal. By the time I got my meal my daughter had ready finished hers so I asked them to pack mine to go. Got the bill and no kind of discount as applied. I mentioned this to the waitress and her response was that they redid the meal for me. So I guess I was supposed to thank them for not making me eat food with hair in it? I said that a discount would be nice. She went to ask the manager who gave me a $5 discount. I feel under the circumstances, first finding hair in my food and then having to wait for it to be redone and therefore tainting my breakfast experience with my daughter a offering my meal for free this time might have been a nice gesture. It's s shame because I really like Cora's in Pickering my daughter and I really have a nice time when we go and then this happens. It's really a shame.
