Let me just say, the sushi is delicious.  The food was not the issue.  Came here on  Wednesday night around 5:30 and waited an hour for our food.  Our appetizer was also forgotten about, but they did bring us a one eventually.  The waiter was very apologetic about the appetizer and the wait.  They seemed understaffed and very crowded.  \nThey do pick up, though! Probably going to go that route next time.
