Lovely beginner trails and interesting enough for the intermediate rider too-- just add speed and head over to the the hurl, techno, red valley for some splash of rocks! Flowy and easy to decipher trails\/ they're marked at the \"corners.\" Make sure when you take beginners let them have a looksie on the rock drops... So they can decide if they can put their body in the correct spot... Or just walk down or up... Southwest bikes was super nice and sweet to some newer MTB people! I went back in hopes to ride badger pass, techno, wht rhino, red valley, Spanish trail-- blue diamond loop for the return... Totally easy to spend 2.5 hours or more here! Beautiful red rocks for view... Just be careful when you fall-- it's sharp everywhere -- cholla, thorn bushes, sharp rocks... You got the \"point?\" Jajajaaja
