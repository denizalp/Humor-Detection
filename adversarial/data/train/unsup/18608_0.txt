It's perhaps the closest you can get to authetic Chinese food in a place like Madison, particularly after China Palace closed. The food is alright, it's been embellished in a way to appeal to an American audience, but at least the some of the menu choices are pretty real. \n\nMy real problem with this place is the service: The menu was misinforming and didn't specify that some steamed fish dish was a filet as opposed to a whole fish. I politely complained to the waitress about my order not being accurate and she informed her manager. The manager only ended up refunding me 50% off the item ordered and began telling me how you wouldn't refund someone a fancy steak in an expensive restaurant!\n\nIn the end, I paid for my meal and tipped the poor waitress, but I will never visit this place again. I'm not sure if that manager woman was giving me a hard time because I was a young college student or what, but her management skills leave much to be desired.
