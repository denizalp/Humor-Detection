A complete miss with this place. I don't know how exactly they accumulated a rating of 4\/5 stars from over 4K reviews but there wasn't much to praise about. For the first time it feels like Yelp has failed to do its job. \n\nSadly it was just mediocre burgers and fries with Gordon Ramsay's name slapped on the menu. TAP sports bar at MGM is a much better option.
