P.F. Chang's used to be our go to upscale, Asian Fusion dining establishment of choice.\n\nBetween the SFS and the Mill Avenue locations, we must've visited 100+ times over the years.\n\nThen either our palates changed , or their quality declined, or a measure of both; but we just stopped dining here and chose other options.\n\nHowever, we were famished after the Can-Am 500 at PIR; and since there is a dearth of Chinese Cuisine options in this side of town, we opted to give P.F. Chang's a chance.\n\nThe place was understandably busy with all the activities going on in the West Valley, but we paid no mind to the prolonged wait due to the fact that we were hungry and we didn't really want to fight traffic on an empty stomach.\n\nWe were with several of our friends, and everyone chose an Entree so that we could share in the variety of dishes.\n\nOur server was okay. But, with the myriad of customers here; she just seemed overwhelmed and showed less than a friendly attitude. After she took our initial order, she barely checked on us, until it was time to settle the check - and that was an arduous task as well.\n\nThe Mongolian Beef was as good as I remembered. The beef was well prepared, and the sauce that it was cooked in was not overdone.\n\nHowever, the new addition to the menu that I had no experienced before; which was the Spicy Korean BBQ Chicken was not up to our expectations. The dish was actually quite bland. If you know Korean BBQ, spicy or otherwise, you know that there is definitely a distinct taste to it that comes alive in your mouth.\n\nNot this particular dish. The presentation was good, but the execution fell flat. We experienced the same lack of distinct flavor from the Kung Pao Chicken as well.\n\nI am not sure if during preparation that the right amount of sauce ingredients were applied, but it was definitely not in keeping with what we thought P.F. Chang's used to represent and symbolize - unique, distinctive, and quite tasty Asian dishes.
