Great decor in the lounge. Red chairs, dimly lit. The service was great in the lounge. The menu is the same in the restaurant as it is in the lounge. You don't have to make reservations for the lounge. There is a cucumber vodka lime drink that was very mild but wonderful tasting. The food was decent. All of Susur's restaurants pale in comparison to the original Susur. Here they have dumplings, soups and typical Chinese fare. The tofu and mushroom dishes were great. Lots of vegetarian options as well as Seafood and Meat. My stomach was extremely upset at the end of the meal and I had to rush home. Otherwise I would have given a higher rating
