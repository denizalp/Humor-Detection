Major props to my husband for noticing this coffee shop last weekend while we were driving down Eastern. We decided to stop in yesterday and we were oblivious to the fact that this was the grand opening day. Whatever they've done to advertise is working because the place was packed. The line was to the door when we arrived and stayed that way until we left.\n\nThe shop is apparently Harry Potter themed. I didn't catch this at first since Harry Potter isn't my jam, but I like owls so I can appreciate that aspect. I liked the overall design of the shop and the colors they chose. \n\nEven though the shop was crazy busy the staff was still very friendly and not acting frazzled. The woman handing out the prepared drinks was thanking everyone for their patience with the long wait. \n\nThe menu offers a nice variety of items. They have several offerings for true coffee devotees. The latte selection is impressive and they have some really unique flavors. The pistachio latte and lavender latte are what initially intrigued me enough to stop in. I'd love to return for tea as well because they have several delicious sounding tea concoctions. The pastry selection was limited yesterday, but I wonder if that was because they ran out of things with how busy they were. \n\nI had an iced pistachio latte, passion fruit macaron, and caramel macaron. The pistachio flavor was very bold and required some heavy stirring to get the taste to be right, but overall it was a good drink. Both macarons had great flavor and the consistency was correct. It's rare that a macaron is the correct consistency so I really appreciated that the macarons were done right. My husband had an iced mint mocha which he really enjoyed. He said the mint was more subtle than other mint mochas he has had, but it was good.\n\nI'll definitely be back to try more of the fun lattes and teas.
