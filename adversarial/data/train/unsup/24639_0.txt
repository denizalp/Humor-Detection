7th Street Market in Charlotte is my favorite, and I was so excited to see acai bowls there. I ordered a rainbow bowl with honey and was a little nervous the moment I watched them starting to grind the acai. It looked like ice cubes grinding, and there was nothing smooth about it, like with other acai bowls I've tried. There was also only a tiny bit of the acai on the bottom, so the bowl was pretty much just an expensive fruit cup. Don't get me wrong, the granola and fruit were delicious, I was just hoping for more.
