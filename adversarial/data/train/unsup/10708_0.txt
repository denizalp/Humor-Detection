Recently opened, this is a new concept of Italian food in Toronto. Although they feature a cafeteria style restaurant, it's very modern and trendy in d√©cor. We only tried a couple of dishes as it was late at night, but the hub has been here several times and it's quite busy especially at lunch time. I tried the baked prosciutto stuffed with fior di latte, and it was good. Their pizzas and panini look great! They also serve Italian wine and beer! Will certainly be coming back!\n\nEdit: Came back about a month later to try their pizza and pasta. We had a pizza margherita (if you can't do this one right ...) and a pomodoro meatball linguini. The pizza was actually quite good, thin crust, cooked just right. Same with the pasta, it was perfectly al dente. I also tried some of their red wine and it was decent.\n\nOne complaint: I wanted to try one of their little dessert\/puddings but no one in the whole restaurant could tell me what flavour it was. I guess there is no communication with the pastry chef; they should at least invest in some labels.\n\nStill, good food and good value!
