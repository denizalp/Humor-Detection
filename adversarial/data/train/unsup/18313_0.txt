To the bat cave, Robin! \nNo, there are no Batman references here, only batty ones.\nThis restaurant has built its persona on Phoenix's underground bat population. Thus the reference to the bat cave. No, they don't serve fried bat or vampire bat margaritas!\nThey have two happy hours, one from 2-6 pm and the other from 10 pm to closing.\nThe service was excellent, the margaritas were yummy and the food was delightfully filling. To be truthful, after chips and salsa and a cowboy meatloaf, I was stuffed to the gills.\nA great experience and brilliant ambience. A fun place to take a whole group of friends (room for about 12 without running out of space inside the bar cavern).\nAwesome outdoor patio for when the temperature drops below 90 degrees. Room for a larger group-maybe 20-30 adults.\nHoly catfish, Batman, this place is totally the bomb!
