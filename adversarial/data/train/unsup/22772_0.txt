Bruh let me tell you what, you ever walk into a spot and just know you about to smash! The menu is straight fiya and I tell you what you will not be disappointed. The fries are crispy and the chicken is tender, customer service is on point! It's a little hazel eyed lady named Star in the front that will take care of you like she yo mama! \n\n#YoMamaMightNotLoveYouButBuffaloSpotDo\n#Fiya #ChickenOnAMisson #StarForPresident
