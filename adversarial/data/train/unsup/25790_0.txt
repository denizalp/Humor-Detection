This place is so cute! The food was good and our server was even better! She was so sweet, I wish I could remember her name because she was really nice. The food was good and we found a really great groupon deal so that's nice too. I would really like to have given this place FIVE stars but the cashier was so incredibly rude, it was almost like we were bothering her to pay for our food! As you can tell I'm not good with names otherwise I would have remembered hers too...
