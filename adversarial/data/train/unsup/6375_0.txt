Good place. Safe.\n\nThe place is very close to downtown and light rails.\n\nIt's quite in here and neighbors don't bother. People are a mixed crowd. Family bachelors students. \n\nGym is small but quite equipped for light workouts. swimming pool always has some leaves but I guess cause we always go at night. I haven't used it in morning or day time. Maintaince is good. They usually come in within 48 hours. \n\nThe walls are not very thin cause I never hear anything from Neighbors ;) \nRooms are spacious but that's something on individual needs.\n\nNo entrance on indian school road. Entrance is only on 3rd Ave.
