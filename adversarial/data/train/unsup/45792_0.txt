Who doesn't wake up wanting to spend the afternoon drinking beers and throwing axes at a wall?? If you've never done it before, then you probably don't; however, after you finally give it a try, you'll definitely want to again and again.  Lumberjaxe was a very pleasant introduction to the world of axe throwing. There's apparently an entire league in Charlotte for this \"sport\" that I almost want to move back to the city to dominate (I'm a natural!). The staff here is great. Everybody's friendly and full of tips and advice.  I highly recommend stopping in here to find your form. Sign up for an hour block and enjoy the $3 beer selection as well.
