TJs I love you!\nGot spoiled having TJs right down the street from me in SaMo.\nNow that I live in Vegas... I will make the 8 mile drive to this location to get all of my \"must have\" TJ products.\nI come here atleast 3-4 times a month.\nLove their fresh flowers too!\nGreat customer service, fast check out and no stress parking.\nI'm a fan!\n-Miss Yelp 2012
