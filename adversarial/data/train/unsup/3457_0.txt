The folks behind the counter here pack a punch when they fill the espresso tray, and I dig it. They are among the most jovial baristas in the city, so they must be shooting the dark goodness all day long. Lucky bastards. \n\nNeighborhood mommies flock here for a laugh and a coffee and enjoy the large patio in the summer, plenty of room for strollers. Inside is tighter with free wifi, so that's where us non-baby east enders hang, a true cornucopia of kids on mac laptops sipping high-end caffeinated beverages.* \n\nPEPPER POINTS: For a solid scone collection. \n\n*Am I a yuppy? What did I just say? \n\n12\/30
