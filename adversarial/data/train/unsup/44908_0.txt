I just had two cars to be diagnosed for possible brake issues and and a strong odor coming from the heater coil in one of the cars. After my car s were seen there were no brake issue in either car and no problem with my heater.I appreciate the honesty and professionalism at brakes plus in avondale. All the techs from Hector Reyes, Al Stoner, Jeff etc are honest good mechanics.I highly recommend them to all as i have been a customer with them for years now and have had other work done in the past.
