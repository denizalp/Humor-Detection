This bar is still here! Still divey, still half in the basement, still friendly staff, nice whisky and scotch selection, still one of the better no fuss vibes in the area. We accidentally broke a glass and nobody gave us a hard time, and nobody batted an eye when we repeatedly burst into song. Dudes played foosball nearby, wooden benches wrapped the walls. The smell was not ideal, but after a couple cheap shots we forgot to notice it.
