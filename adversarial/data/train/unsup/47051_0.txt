This place has a fantastic buffet. We spent about 40 minutes there and watched the food be replaced twice. The food was always hot and the buffet area was kept spotless.\n\nThe waiters and waitresses are excellent at their jobs. They are always fluttering around clearing plates and filling up your water glass.\n\nThe place is very clean and they give you delicious fortune cookies when you pay.\n\nThe only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because their won ton soup was a let down. Won ton soup is my favourite and unfortunately at this restaurant, the soup had no flavour.
