I love this hat store! After shopping every other hat store in the valley, I finally was fed up with baseball caps and wanna-be fedoras. I needed a 'real' hat, I needed a professional hatter - I needed AZ-Tex. After arriving on-site I could tell I was in the right place: a large, comfortable great-room stuffed wall to wall with fine head gear. The sales person seemed to know I needed special care, as I was taken under her wing. We spent nearly an hour working though the store's many offerings, trying on and speaking about a wide verity of hats before I found the right one. It's made of leather with a screened top for ventilation (a must in the AZ summer) and it is easy on the eyes. So was the price. For the kicker, after a few days I was concerned that it may be a little too big. I arrived back at the store and there was another capable salesperson on the floor. She was just as kind and knowledgeable as the first. After much contemplation and re-measurements, I ended up having the hat replaced with a new one that was the next size down. It still wasn't a perfect fit and AZ-Tex respectfully demanded that I allow them to make it so. She took the hat into her shop in the back and after a few moments emerged with my hat, but it was professionally modified to be just a little smaller for a custom fit - like I said, I needed a hatter, not a kid selling franchised caps. As I left I was told that I can come back anytime and they will adjust the hat as needed. Come back I shall. Not so much because I think that this hat will need another adjustment, but because I saw another one there that also wants to live on my head. Who am I to deny its destiny...especially with such a fine business behind it.
