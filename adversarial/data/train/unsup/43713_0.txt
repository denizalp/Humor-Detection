They had a good selection but for the price I don't think it was worth it. Most of the meat that we had besides the prime rib were overcooked and dry (Kobe beef brisket, turkey breast, and venison) . The sushi was what you expect at an all you can eat sushi restaurant. The salmon Poki was very mushy and had very little flavor to it. I called ahead to find out what the price of the buffet was and over the phone was told $36 for dinner. When I arrived they had a special holiday price of $49.95. There are definitely better buffets on the strip. nothing was horribly bad but it was not worth what we paid.
