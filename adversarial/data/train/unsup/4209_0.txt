DO NOT GO HERE: SECURITY GUARD SCAM This COMPANY is NOTORIOUS for BEATING up PATRONS & using excessive force... Even with small 100lb girls. \nLast night after spending $5k+ on 2tables, my boyfriend and I left happy & holding hands.\n\nImmediately after we left, they grabbed my boyfriend and accused him of grabbing \"A guys neck\" but the security guard couldn't think of who's neck had been grabbed when I asked him 3 times.\n\nAlso that's impossible, he was still holding my hand.  \n\nLater the small security guard who had made the fabricated the story all the sudden decided it was a security guard's neck that had been grabbed...interesting. \nIf he had somehow grabbed a security guards neck( while holding my hand which is impossible)... They would have tackled us to the ground before we left & would have been escorted out. This is so bogus\n\nThey knew I was the only witness & that this entire story was fabricated, so they Hyde security made me leave immediately so that I could not give the cops a statement for the report. \n\nThen they took him to lock up where they lied to the cops & he was beaten.  \n\nI WAS TERRIFIED that I would get ROBBED OR RAPED walking all the way back to my hotel ALONE and I asked if someone could please Walk Me there Safely, but they said no & demanded I leave. They said if I didn't leave, I would be in trouble too. \n\nWHILE he was in Lock up, he audio recorded his conversation & 2 small girls were brought in while he was recording... Also from HYDE. \n\nThese girls were BEATEN by 3 big male violent HYDE security guards, one had a BLOODY FACE& they KNOCKED Her TEETH OUT!!\n\nthis is just one example from one night at Hyde... This is how they regularly treat high rollers at the Bellagio. \n \nHere's the link that shows this company has been doing this for years \nhttp:\/\/www.myprgenie.com\/publication\/get_pdf\/sbe-entertainment-lawsuit-violence-and-brutality-by-nightclub-bouncers\n\nThis place is scary.
