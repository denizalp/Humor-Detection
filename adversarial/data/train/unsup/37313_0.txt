I always try to support my local-ish business chains, but I'd rather eat somewhere else.  I've tried Pita Jungle twice, and I was dissapointed both times.\n\nThe menu is huge, and all of the options sound especially appealing.  However, most of the options are dissapointing.  I've had better healthy food, and better Medeteranian food.  The service was decent, and I'd usually give three stars for that alone, but the food was so dissapointing and bland I just can't do it. I might have even pumped up my rating if the prices were lower, but for $9 I'd expect my pita sandwich to be accompanied by a side and some tzatzik.  \n\nOverall, Pita Jungle is overpriced, and overrated.  What I've tried is listed below.\n\nChicken Tikka Masala:  such a forgiving dish should be spicy and full of pep, not bland and sad.\n\nHummus:  try the cilantro hummus.  It was the best of all.  Otherwise, nothing special, but they are all passable.\n\nDolmades:  Lots of leaf, no filling.  Dissapointing.\n\nFalafel:  Nothing special, but passable.\n\nPitas and Lavosh:  for this price, I'd expect them to be made fresh on site, but they aren't even warmed.\n\nRoasted Carmelized Cauliflour:  my friend urged me to try this.  It came out partially burned, not carmelized.  Very dissapointing, and I couldn't choke it all down.\n\nGreen beans (on the mediterranian platter):  you'll like these if you like garlic, but be forewarmned that they come out cold.\n\nShwarma Lavosh:  this is not shwarma!  Huge dissapointment.  It tasted like the aforementioned chicken tikka masala in a toasted wrap.  Major dissapointment.\n\nTabbouleh:  was there even bulgur in this salad?  Inedible.\n\nRoasted Potatoes:  hard to mess up potatoes, and these didn't dissapoint.\n\nTzatzik:  fresh and tasty, but it doesn't come standard with sandwiches as it should.  it's a condiment, people!\n\nBaba Ganoush:  standard, but nothing exceptional.\n\nSalad:  the small side salad was little more than a garnish, but what there was of it was fresh and crisp.
