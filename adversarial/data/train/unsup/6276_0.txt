Since my first visit, I've popped in a few more times to grab a quick drink while in the downtown area but it wasn't until Restaurant Week that I gave their food another try. M&F had a $20 three course breakfast, including a latte, which was a great deal.\n\nICED LAVENDER LATTE: The way to my heart, served in a Ball jar. My server said this drink was best cold, and I have to agree with her. It was light and refreshing to prepare for the day's crazy heat.\nAVOCADO TOAST: Lightly toasted golden bread with avocado, tomato, and queso fresco. Avocado toast is a favorite quick breakfast of mine and I enjoyed this version.\nAREPA BENNY: Enjoyed this combination of flavors again, egg was perfectly poached, the arepa makes a great, solid base for this dish. Surprised I haven't seen more versions crop up around town.\nBIONICO SHOOTER: Essentially a mini-parfait, with Greek yogurt, fresh fruit, and granola, this was a nice bit of sweetness to end the morning meal. \n\nI really like the trendy-cool but still cozy-local vibe this place rocks. Covered patio seating is available if you get there early enough that it's not too hot. There's bar seating with outlets if you need to multitask and get some work done. Bathrooms are in the back, shared with Hopnuts next door.
