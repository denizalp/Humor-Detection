I took my car for repair to pass smog!after paying $1800 for the repair I was told to drive for 150 miles before smog test to make sure computer would reset I did well over 275 miles and  failed smog! Took it back to them they said they'd  check it out! After 2 weeks of waiting and calling and driving to the shop getting excuse after excuse as to why it wasn't ready the only answer I got was were still driving the car! Well I declined them the opportunity to fix and got my keys and took my car! Few days later discovered they broke my sunroof and I was really pissed. Then found other objects in my car that didn't belong to me . A female adult toy!! Really?? So I guess they were joy ridding in car!  Disgusting!
