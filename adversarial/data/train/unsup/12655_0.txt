Great place for big dogs!  Lots of grass, doggie bags and water buckets placed about.  Love it here!\n\nMy happy yet very active Border Collie was all smiles and had a blast!  There are two large gated areas with a mix of natural green grass and dirt to run in.  One gated area for dogs 35lbs or less and another for 35lbs and over.  Technically, you're not supposed to bring big dogs with the little dogs and vice versa, but my Toy Schnauzer is used to the big guys and did wonderfully playing with them.   The dogs were sweet and very accepting of my little guy as well as my BC.\n\n99% of the owners were very cognisant of their pups and made sure to keep the drama and aggressive behavior to a minimum.  Of course, there's always that one guy who let's there dog go to the bathroom and feels no urge to clean up after them.  With that said, CLEAN UP AFTER YOUR DOGS!  Not cleaning up after your dog is up there with never returning your grocery cart at the market or throwing your garbage out your car window.  It's ridiculous, lazy and if my pup happens to run in it, I'll be the first to call you out. \n\nI highly recommend this place for loving owners with big dogs and\/or little pups whom are in need of some fun socialization!\n\nThanks to April D. for the awesome recommendation!
