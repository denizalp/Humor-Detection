Some like it hot! And those that do go get Sichuan style food :) Located in the same shopping plaza as the Super L, Szechuan Palace specializes in chile and peppercorn laden dishes that turn up the heat and tingle your senses. The use of the fragrant, almost floral tasting peppercorn not only adds flavor but it numbs your tongue.\n\nWe ordered the Chongqing chicken (boneless), water boiled fish and dry saute green beans. The chicken and fish had the requisite spicy, salty bold punch to them and my tongue was numb in seconds after eating it. I was glad we ordered some sauteed green beans because it helped provide a tongue numbing break in between spicy bites. While the chicken and fish provided the spicy kick I wanted, the flavors weren't as developed as other restaurants I've been to (Such as the sadly defunct Miu's). The chicken and fish were tender though, and overall enjoyable. The green beans were perfectly seasoned and cooked perfectly. We finished the plate in a record amount of time.\n\nThe restaurant was fairly busy when we came for dinner around 8 on a Thursday. Most of the people eating here were Chinese speaking families, friends, or couples- always a good sign for good quality Chinese food. Note that while our main server did speak English, another waitress did not, so it helps if you know Mandarin or are with someone that knows it.
