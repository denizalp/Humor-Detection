Service: 5\/5\nGreetings: 5\/5\nAttentiveness: 5\/5\nCleanliness of the staff: 5\/5\nCleanliness: 3.25\/5\nFoyer: 4\/5\nBathroom: 4\/5\nTable cleanness: 2.5\/5\n(Condiments on the table weren't clean. Slightly sticky) \nMenu: 3\/5\n\nFood: 3\/5\n\nBeef soup 3\/5 \nSoup base is 4\/5\nProbably the best flavor beef noodle soup base in town so far.  However, not the best I have ever tasted.  \nThe beef 2\/5\nThis cut of beef is cheap for a reason.  Before the tendon being cooked throughly, the meat is almost over cooked.  There tricks to overcome this issue, but I'm not about to teach here. So, my rating is low on this part. I don't enjoy the meet melting and have to spit out the chewing tendon.   It's just not a proper beef noodle shop would do. \n\nPork Chop with Fried rice 1\/5\nFried rice wasn't cooked evenly. There are parts over cooked and parts lumpy.  The pork chop was too sweet.   \nDidn't like this dish at all \n\nPancake: 3\/5\nPork and cabbage 3\/5\nIt's still a bit undercooked. \nFlavor is good \nThe dough is cooked in evenly\n\nBeef and onion. 3\/5\nThe dough is a bit chewy. \n\nDumplings 4\/5\nPork and Chive \nThe dough is a bit mixed unevenly. A bit lumpy taste in the dumpling skins.
