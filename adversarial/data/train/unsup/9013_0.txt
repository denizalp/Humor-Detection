Come here even if you're not a boba lover, because they have soft serve! I snagged ube and black sesame on my first visit and got hooked- the shareable $5 portion is huge and packs a punch of flavor. Add some texture with add-ons like Fruity Pebbles, Pocky, crushed Oreos, or mochi bits. I am definitely going to be keeping an eye out for when they change flavors, and am looking forward to when they do matcha, which I can't find nearly as easily as I'd like. It's a small shop, but super clean and service is sweet.
