I am not one to visit a gelato shop, but based on reviews from friends, hubby and I just had to check Amorino out.  The little shop is cute with offerings of gelato, macorons, and other goodies. \n\nWe got to taste several flavors before I decided on the mango and yogurt combination in a piccolo cone.  Hubby got the pistachio and specoloos.  The staff was friendly and sociable.  The shop was clean and pretty.  It was a bit cold yesterday so we decided to enjoy our gelato as we walked to our vehicle, but I can see us coming back again and again to enjoy the gelato at one of the tables nearby when the sun is out.
