It'a probably been years since I've been to Jamba Juice. So I was surprised to see how much things have changed. They have the usual smoothies but also breakfast wraps and pastries. Planning to get a smoothie, I changed course after reviewing the menu. I ordered a pitaya bowl which has strawberries, bananas, blueberries, granola, coconut, and honey. I requested not to include the chia seeds. I also tried an apple cinnamon pretzel. \n\nThe pitaya bowl was as good as others that I've had. The base was well-blended and the fruit toppings were fresh. They only offer one size, which may be fine for most people but I would've preferred a smaller bowl. The apple cinnamon pretzel was decent but certainly not as good as freshly made ones.
