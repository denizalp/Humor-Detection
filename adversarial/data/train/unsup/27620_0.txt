I know Dr. Leah Wingeart as a colleague. She is a healthy mix of charisma and professionalism that would set most people at ease. She is constantly striving to educate herself for the sake of her patients and has a warm, caring energy about her. I would definitely recommend her as another professional in the mental health field.
