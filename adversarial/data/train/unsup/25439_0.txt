Cons: like other people have said, most of the machines need to be swapped in for newer ones. The one on Stephanie should let them have some, they have newer everything. Also, the bathrooms aren't very clean and always smell since I've started working out here. And I don't understand why they decide to clean the gym floor at the busiest time of day around 4 to 7 when everyone is just getting off work. Wires are everywhere and creates a hazard.\nPros: main thing is its just down the street, a straight drive. Also it doesn't get too busy, just have to avoid the 4 to 7, and I'll get the machine I need in no time, and they have all the machines you need. The staff, most of them are friendly. Anthony, person who signed me up always says what's up and checks if everything is going okay. People at the counter are always greeting leaving and entering except late at night. The deal for 20\/month and you can bring a guest every day is awesome. I bring my gf when she feels like going or bros to go HAM. Would recommend if you want to get serious and not have to deal with the gym being over crowded.
