The selection of food is so-so here, but that's most likely because I'm a picky eater when it comes to Filipino food. Basically, I came here because I wanted to see if their dinuguan could beat DJ Bibingkahan's. Long story short, it doesn't.\n\nOne of the good things about this place would be their TFC on a flat screen that the other patrons were enjoying. Other Yelpers might find this cool, which is why I mention it. One thing that really stood out for me was their Sago Gulaman. Now theirs is the best Sago Gulaman I've ever had, & I've tried almost everyone's: Max's Chicken, Goldilocks, Kambinggan in Waipahu, etc. Their Sago Gulaman is the only reason that I'll ever come back here. Unfortunately, they serve it in a small cup for $2.18 each (after tax).\n\nThe reason why I deducted two stars is not only because of their mediocre selection of food, it is also because they have an employee, the male busboy in his 40s I believe, who would not stop staring at me the whole time I was there; it creeped me out so much that I almost got up & left a couple times. Finally when he had gone in the back, I ordered another drink & hit the road.
