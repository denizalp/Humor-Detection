I called to get both of my units checked out and also the attic duct work and zone dampers. Cody can out and did an extremely thorough check of everything. He located a bad capacitor in my 2 year old equipment and when he left all was working in top shape. He was polite, educated me on everything I needed to know and clearly a top-notch technical person who takes pride in his work. I highly recommend Cody and Desert Diamond.
