I usually love downtown spots like this, but as I get older I realize that they often house spots that are way too mainstream and overpriced.  With that said, this place SERIOUSLY reminded me of the Denver Pavilions on the 16th St. Mall.  \n\nWe happened to stop in here late on a Monday night, so our options were limited.  We ended up going to BlackFinn, which was a similar A-OK experience.  I could see how this place would be nuts on the weekend!  We only ran into one tool that night - some dude hit us up for a cab fare, and after my buddy gave him $5, he was like \"that's it?\".  Nice.  Jackass.
