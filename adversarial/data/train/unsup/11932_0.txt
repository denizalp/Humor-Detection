I'm not the biggest fan of chain places mostly because the food lacks love and atmosphere seems fake.  But if there's a chain place that does it right, it would have to be Maggiano's.  The food feels like its been prepared with care and the place is comfortable without being too commercial.  And their Las Vegas location is no exception.\n\nThe Maggiano's Salad and Chocolate Zuccotto Cake are a must try.\n\nWhat was particularly interesting for this visit was the wine I had.   I usually find it difficult to smell what I'm suppose to smell in red wine: hints of strawberries, cherries, oak, vanilla, leather, sunshine, earth, wind, fire, etc, whatever.  Not this time: I smelled the floral bouquet that was suppose to be in my red.  I was so shocked that I was practically snorting instead of drinking it.\nThe only reason I stopped was I heard our waiter ask, \"Is everything okay, sir?\"  And as I looked up from my glass to answer, I saw the wife shaking her head with the \"What are you doing?\" look and the waiter slightly looming behind her with a smirk.\nI placed my glass down and responded, \"We're fine.  Thank you.\"\nI should've responded with \"This wine may have gone sour.  Could you please bring me something else?\"  But then he would have taken the only wine I could smell properly.
