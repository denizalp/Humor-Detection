Grazie offers great Italian food and wines with simple, no frills service. Whether you are dining with your significant other or a group, I'd suggest you try a couple items and share. For starters, try the Bruchetta and\/or one of their salads. The salads are all great, particularly the Caesar and Emiliana, and are big enough for two people if you are going to order an entree or pizza too. I've enjoyed several of their pizzas and would recommend the Margherita (add garlic if you are a garlic lover), Quattro Stagioni and the Americano.\n\nAlong with classic Italian fare, Grazie has a massive wine selection all from different regions of Italy. My girlfriend and I are particularly fans of the Le Cupole 2005, a red wine blend of Merlot\/Cab Franc\/Cab Sauvignon\/Cesanese\/Petit Verdot from Tuscany. The servers are usually pretty happy to let you try different wines before buying a bottle. Just ask. \n\nWe will continue to be fans of Grazie.
