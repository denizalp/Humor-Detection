I was referred to David by my Realtor.  I couldn't be more happy with their service.  I stated that I was already 3 days into my inspection period and they were happy to schedule the termite inspection the very next day and I called them at 5pm.  It was easy too, I just went to their website to fill out the form and they called me back right away and told me they were good to go.  The following week I was at the property with my home inspector who said he thought he saw a trail of termites, so I called David back and he immediately went over and investigated the problem  Turned out, it was just dirty, and not termite infestation.  Thanks to House Doctor Exterminating, for making my home buying experience that much more smooth.
