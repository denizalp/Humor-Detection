The hot wings were good and our server made good drinks, but the bartender made horribly weak drinks and was a dick about it when the drink was sent back. he said \"there's a full shot in there, if she wants more she can pay for it\" I'm not sure if my friend being the only black person in the place has anything to do with it but the bartender treated me ( a pretty, white, blue eyed female) differently. On top of all of that a small was cranberry vodka was $9!!!!
