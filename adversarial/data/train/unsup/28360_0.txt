Just like many folks out there, this place is a must stop for me when I am in Vegas. Think about The Peppermill as Denny's on crack  Same prices, same hours but they serve liqour, have muuuuuch better food and the portions are ginormous! I love a place that doesn't hold back on the portions and this place, in true diner style, feeds it patrons like they are at home. I usually go for a giant omelette which comes with a bagel and all the fixings.\n\nFor some reason i always eat here before the drive home, and I always regret it because I'm always in a food coma upon leaving lol.
