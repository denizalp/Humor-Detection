WORST COUSTOMER SERVICE!!!\n\nI've been to this clinic a number of times and ever time I go I wait at least 2 hours; no matter what time it is and am out within 5 min. The doctor barley listens to what you have to say and just writes a prescription out. \nReception is a whole other story with their lack of customer service skills. Every time I go I seem to get stuck interacting with this miserable B I T C H Y blonde who seems to hate her job. \nToday I visited the clinic around 10am to only find out that they open at 3pm (WTF). I came back at 2 to register, sat around for 15 min for someone to come to the front and then asked to register and was told \"sorry we are still closed, ill be opening in 15 min. 15 min later (now 2:30) I walked up to the front and with 2 receptionist sitting at the desk not one of them looked up,  so of course I spoke up and said its been 15 and if they could please check me in so I can be on my way with my errands and come back when the doctor arrives. I was still denied even after I was told she would take my card in 15 min. They did not start to register people until 10 min till 3pm, when the doctor came through the door. \nI do not understand if you are there your work day has started, why in convince everyone else ?\nlet me mention that I am in a similar line of work and if I treated my clients the way that I was treated today I would be fired for that  behaviour! \nOn top of all that the washrooms are always dirty and in the summer they blast the AC so the sick get sicker!
