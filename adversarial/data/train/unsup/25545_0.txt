We came here when we were waiting to get in for a concert down the street. It was about 5pm when we got there and it was really slow. Much different then some of the other reviewers have said. \nOne cool thing is you get a 5 dollar game card with a yelp check-in, so we played some skee ball and a few other games as well.
