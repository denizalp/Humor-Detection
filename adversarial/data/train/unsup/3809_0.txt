We really like Five Guys and we're visiting from out of town so we decided to grab take out from this location. My husband asked for my hamburger to be well done and the cashier even repeated it back to him. But when he got back to the hotel my hamburger was literally RED in the middle. I can't stand pink in my burgers. Extremely disappointed. The fries were pretty good so that's the only reason I gave it two stars.
