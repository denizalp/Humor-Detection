WORST MEXICAN FOOD EVER!  How is that for a title?\n\nSo, one evening last week my wife and I wanted some Mexican food and while we would normally patronize some of the other places in Madison (and yes, we do like Laredo's) my wife suggested la Hacienda on park Street since she had not been there in years.   Honestly, neither have I.  I think I had been there once before at 2:30 AM as a drunk college student.   Anything tasted good back then.\n\nWell, we got there and sat down right away and placed our orders. I go steak fajitas and my wife got a steak burrito.   Ok....remember that!\n\nSo while we wait we got the normal chips and salsa and wow did the salsa suck.  it was a tasteless liquid....yuck and the chips were nowhere near fresh or even warm.  But next came out meals...\n\nMy wife burrito was tasteless and dry with nothing special about it at all.  The steak inside was dry, tough, and burnt and the extra cheese she orders....wait....it had not cheese at all.  She took three bites and was done\n\nMy fajitas were the same.  the steak was burnt, over cooked, hard and had zero flavor.  The veggies on the skillet were just cut tomatoes and onions.  Where are the peppers people?   NO FLAVOR AT ALL!   What terrible food!\n\nI am not even going to try to be funny and witty with this one because the place and food just sucked and on top of that was pricy for Mexican food as well.  hell, I would have been better off going down the road to Taco Bell.   At least TB has taste!
