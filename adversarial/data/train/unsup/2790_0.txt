VIBE \nIt's industrial chic in here. They recently did a renovation and I love love loved it at first but now I'm not sure if it's smaller or hard to navigate. Staff are quick to help. \n\nMERCH \nThey used to have a lot of True Religion\/Soia and Kyo (sp) and now it's mainly Vero Moda. I'd love to see more of the selection they used to have. Now I wait until there's a sale and am one of those \"window shopping\" customers. Yes, I suck. \n\nOBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK \nLet's go with seven more brands instead of five ok? (Does this even make sense?) What I'm saying is bring back what you used to have! People will buy if there's good, solid product. aka clothes that can stand the test of time (and a boyfriend or two).
