Dr. Stickland and her entire staff is professional, friendly, and most importantly, very knowledgable and genuine about the best care and health for your animals. \n\nWe took our 5 month old puppy in for her first vet visit and any jitters she had completely melted away with their clean facilities, complimentary toy on her first visit, plus she was having so much fun playing with all of the staff members, even in the exam room. I was very happy with their reasonable pricing, attentive follow up, and the genuine service I received from every staff member as well as Dr. Stickland. \n\nSince our visit, their office has given me a phone call every few days to check-in on our dog and see if there's anything we needed until our next visit. I truly appreciate all of the follow up and attentiveness and look forward to bringing my animals here for years to come.
