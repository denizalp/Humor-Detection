\"If you don't believe in God...trying to get into a club without any females, surely won't make you a believer\"\n\nThis was my first official clubbing experience in Vegas since turning 21 --- four years ago.\n\nThe beauty of clubbing, is that it's totally a subjective experience, generally based on an individuals personal wants, goals, and expectations.\n\nGirls mostly go out to dance, where as I find, guys tend to go out in hopes of \"picking up chicks\".  t'is not always the case, but a popular trend that is in no threat of deviation in a \"heterosexual\" atmosphere. \n\nTurning down an offer to go to XS, the previous night (I was too tired), I made a conscious effort to finally embrace the Vegas nightlife. My friends and I were staying at the Wynn and for some odd reason refused going to the Tryst in amid hopes of getting into the \"Galeria\" (Planet Hollywood) and or \"Haze\" (Aria). We had some \"free\" passes that would bypass cover fees. I guess you could say we lucked out.\n\nTraffic on a Saturday, after 8\/9PM is horrible. Time was our worst enemy, as we were in a frantic race to beat the clock. We wanted to use these passes, my friends made this notion inherently clear.\n\nThe cutoff for the Gallery was 10:30 PM, and the Aria was 12AM. we realized pretty quick, that we were not going to make it to Planet Hollywood on time. In a fog-less \"Haze\" we get to Aria by 11 PM. We park, and rush our way through the casino looking for the entrance.\n\nImmediately we are haggled by security and bouncers who attempt to sell us a \"cut the line pass\" for $20 a person. We refuse, but to make matters sweeter, the security guard ripped on my brand new (white) air force ones. Saying how it wasn't \"dress code\" blah blah blah. I look around and see at least three other guys in white kicks. Then he feeds me the line, \"if you pay the $20 pre-cover, i'll let it slide\". I was prertty pissed at this.\n\nMy buddies and I, got into line. It wasn't really that long, maybe 30 people in front of us...but it believe it or not. Even a line, of 30 people, takes a good forty-five minutes to reach the front.\n\nI would see group, after group, after group of females just bypass the line, and instantly get in. I would see large crowds of guys, who paid for bottle service -- just walk right in.\n\nPretty much, if you can't grow boobs while in line, and don't have boobs in your group...kiss your ass goodbye.\n\nAgain, time was the enemy. After enduring a lengthy wait, i look at my phone, 11:52 PM. We have roughly 8-minutes before our passes are null and void. The guy again, tries to persuade us with a \"$20 dollar cut the line offer\" We politely refuse, and he starts to let more females in.\n\nI would say, close to 11:57 PM, FINALLY, the bouncer\/security guard lets us in. We show our passes, and by the nick of 1 minute, 11:59 PM, we get in for free, on a Saturday.\n\nThe interior of the club has a neon pink theme, and was packed to the brim. Security is up to par, and patrolling the venue like madmen.\n\nDrinks are ~$17 dollars, give or take a couple of bucks.\n\nThe music is great. The crowd ethnically is mixed, but noticeably there is a fair ratio of black people.\n\nI got the impression that people come here to dance, and dance I did. It's not like those other flimsy clubs where the environment doesn't measure up. The Haze delivers.\n\nThe club is two floors, and in terms of dancing, the size of the main floor is just right. Not to big, not too small, yet enough to navigate, but close enough to get down ;)\n\nMy buddies and I, eventually met some gals. We got our moves on, and the rest is history!\n\nAgain, back to the whole subjectivity. Now, fortunately I did get my groove on. This instantly brings this place from a lousy 2 star rating to 3. I did get in for free, and our group did save roughly $90-$150 dollars. +1 star for that. So overall not too shabby.\n\nI asked my buddy, who has been to the XS, a half dozen or so times said that the Haze is \"more like his scene\" in the sense that one too many stuck up females frequent XS and not everyone wants to dance.\n\nIn the end, I had a great time, and an early morning checkout!
