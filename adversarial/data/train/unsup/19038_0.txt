Some trusted friends recommended this place to me and I was unfortunately underwhelmed. In it's previous incarnation as I-Naba, they were known for their noodles. The chef assured me upon entry that they were still the same place with just a name change, and all the previous dishes were available.\n\nI started with the chawanmushi appetizer, which I enjoyed. My guy opted for the cold soba noodle meal and was disappointed by the quality and flavor. Perhaps going the route with added tempura would have been a better choice. I'm not much of a fan in the first place, so I opted for a chirashi. Meal was beautiful and fairly priced at $15 including soup and salad, but some of the fish used was less than fresh and the spicy tuna seemed downright old. \n\nMight return for a bento lunch or noodle soup, which seems to be more in their wheelhouse. Promo menu features sake and beer specials. Note that they currently have a Yelp offer for half off an app.
