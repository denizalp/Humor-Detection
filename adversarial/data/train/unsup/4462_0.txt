If you care about your pet do NOT take your pet here. \n\nI called in advance two times to make and confirm my appointment. When I brought my 10 year old cat Bossa Nova there, they told me they'd call be if there will be any issues. 5 hours later, I didn't recieve any calls so I assumed the bath was done. When I went to pick her up, they had fucking left Bossa Nova IN THE CARRIER for 5 HOURS with NO WATER or food. That aside they did not call me as they said they would if there were issues. Apparently Bossa Nova would not let them handle her for a bath so as a result they didn't give her one and just NEGLECTED her. I was outraged and when I asked them why they didn't call me they said \"they didn't know and thought their co worker did it already\". \n\nThese people are incredibly UNPROFESSIONAL, DISTRACTED, NEGLECTFUL. \n\nTHEY MAY BE CHEAP BUT IT COMES AT THE EXPENSE OF YOUR PET'S WELL-BEING. DO NOT TRUST YOUR BELOVED PET WITH THESE PEOPLE
