This Talbots is located just outside of Nordstrom's and has a good selection.  \n\nWe're in Talbots, either here or at Kierland Commons two or three times a month and there is always a Special or Sale going on.  We like going to the Camelview 5 and stopping at Fashion Square afterward.  On our most recent visit they were having a 25% Off  Sale on regularly priced merchandise.  If you are on their mailing list, you can usually add coupons to this discount.\n\nThe employees are all very friendly and view themselves as your personal shopper.  They're also willing to search other stores in the area, or do battle on your behalf with the catalog or warehouse.  All making for a pleasant shopping experience.  We'll be back.
