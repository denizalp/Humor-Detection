One word: OPULENCE. I have stayed in numerous hotels in Las Vegas and nothing compares to the incredible elegance, worldliness, warmth and playfulness - all bundled in one delightful package - that this hotel exudes. \n\nFirst of all, the rooms are not even comparable to other rooms on the strip. Every room at the Venetian is a huge suite with either a double queen or king size bed. What makes them stand out is that I love the layout of their suites. It has a living room area separated from the bed area, with a small set of stairs adjoining together. Simply brilliant & Simply gorgeous!! It always makes me feel so comfortable the moment I enter my room. And the marbled floor bathroom that looks like a mini palace!  Need I say more?\n \nI feel immensely luxurious at the Venetian where luxury is just one of their many appealing factors. This hotel offers so much more than their apparent beauty and class. It offers a great sense of satisfaction due to the fact that they make sure their guests receive the utmost enjoyment and comfort in all aspects of their stay. From the gondola rides to the musical entertainment at the Square, to the fabulous restaurants, to the free parking, to all the amenities that the Venetian offers... It will just take your breath away and you more than likely wish you can stay there forever. I always look forward to staying here. Thank you for such an incredible experience! BEAUTIFUL in every way!!!\n\nPS. And don't forget the different flavored gelato... OMG...
