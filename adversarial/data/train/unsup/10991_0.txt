Hidden gem!\n\nI came here for lunch the other day and enjoyed their food so much.\n\nIt's tucked away at the small strip mall in the middle of residential area. The decor inside is questionable with some pictures from all over Italy, so inconsistent, I wasn't sure which region's Italy they were from...\n\nI ordered pizza with pesto sauce. First bite of pizza, I couldn't believe what I just ate, pleasantly surprised. Turned around to look at the person in the kitchen, and all I could say was \"you made pesto here\" with smile.\n\nTurned out they make most everything from scratch, they only use natural ingredients. For example, if they want to make it sweet, they use carrots. Carrots natural sweet flavor is added to their food, not sugar.\n\nI got to talk to the chef a little, his family is originally from Sicily island and his cooking style comes from there. Wouldn't have guessed from pictures hanging on the walls.\n\nTheir tiramisu is home made, never been frozen after they made. No eggs used. They add whip cream to mascarpone, creating such a delicate texture.\n\nWhile I was there, a regular customer stopped by to make a reservation and asked for today's special. It was a fish (can't remember the name anymore). I love the way southern Italian fish is cooked. I thought if I could come back for dinner that night.\n\nThis is not a fancy place at all but this place sure will satisfy foodies' palete.  Can't wait to coma back to try more food.
