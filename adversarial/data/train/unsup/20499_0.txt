So first, what it's not. As much as I think Gilbert needs one, Rise Up isn't a hipster-cool bakery, doesn't have a loaf as gloriously beautiful as Noble Bread, and isn't (yet) using any local heritage grains (Agritopia and Hayden Flour Mill have the goods!). And none of the employees I've seen are covered in tattoos with beards and\/or Macklemore haircuts.\n\nWith that said, Rise Up is a really solid bakery that's kind of safe for everyone to love. My inner hipster loves that there's a place making good bread daily (super happy about the challah), kids will love the brownies and cinnamon rolls, and parents will love the bread bowls and fairly inexpensive loaves. And the people are all friendly, with plenty of samples if you need any tastesperation.\n\nIf you like bread (and I know you do), do yourself a favor and get your next loaf here. Be a good citizen and support your local baker.
