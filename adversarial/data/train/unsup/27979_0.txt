I awoke this morning and looked in the fridge - what stared back at me was a head of organic lettuce and a bottle of champagne.  Dismayed I checked the pantry only to find soup and some expired almonds.  And most importantly, no coffee to make.  I laid down in the fetal position on the floor.  How did this happen?  How did I neglect my grocery reserves for so long?  How am I going to function at work with no breakfast?  I thought all hope was lost, that I would simply have to go slightly hungry today, or worse buy a crummy bagel at my place of employment.  Through a foggy haze I had a thought, I could buy breakfast before work!  After all I had woken up to a healthy direct deposit laying in my bank account like an angel from above so I could spare a few bucks.  But where to go?  Dunkin Donuts? Starbucks? Einsteins?  All were out of my way and would cause me to be late for work.  I quickly googled, \"breakfast places near xxxxxx\" and kneaders popped up.\n\nI arrived around 7:30am eager to fulfill my breakfast needs.  When I walked in it was as if I stepped back in time to an olde tyme bakery.  I quickly began scanning the menu for my prize.  Ultimately I selected the sausage egg and cheese sandwich with an iced coffee.  I selected a table and awaited my bounty.  About 10 minutes later I was presented with a breakfast sandwich fit for a king.  10 minutes may seem like a long time, but I could tell the eggs were freshly made, the sausage was real sausage, and the croissant was buttery (but not greasy face buttery).  So yes, slower than your convenience place but well worth it.\n\nI'll be back.
