Another place that I would go back in a heart beat, their tasting menu is a delight and an experience one must indulge in. (Unlike the tasting menu at Canlis in Seattle,WA - that place is only good for ambience, service and wine --food was a blah in all aspect)\n\nThe attention to details, presentation and most importantly the well balanced flavors..wow!! \n\nLove this place, every time I go back to Phoenix, I would make reservation to this place and nobuo teeter house.\n\nThe other is right next to shinbay (roka akor), great but not as amazing (worthy of a 4 stars for sure)
