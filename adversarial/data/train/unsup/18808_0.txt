My second visit was a much better experience than the first one. Service was friendly and attentive unlike the first visit we had. I would give it 3.5 stars.\n\nThis place has specials Mon to Thu.\n1) Monday: $10 pizza, any pizza on the menu. This is a steal. They have coal fired oven; pizzas are quite delish. Four of us ordered 5 pizzas to try as we couldn't decide what to get. \nMy order of preference, from the best to not so best: \nChorizo, Neptune, Nova Scotia, Smash, and Bacon & Eggs.\nChorizo was the best one, I would get this again and again.\nI didn't expect to like the Neptune (shrimps and smoked salmon seem odd on pizza) but it was surprisingly delish. \n\n2) Tuesday: $10 burger with a side (salad, fries, or soup). Burger patties were juicy; fried onion chips were a nice touch to the burger. \n\n3) Wednesday: AYCE ribs for $27. I have yet to tried so I can't comment on this but I heard they have good ribs and chicken. \n\n4) Thursday: half off wine.\n\nOther items we have tried: \n- Ahi Tuna Wontons: 3 for $14. Nice apps, I would say its worth the money. Wonton shells are nice and crispy.\n- Duck tacos ($5 each) were flavourful, satisfied. \nOne of my friend bad the buttermilk fried chicken. He enjoyed it.\n\nOverall, it was a nice place for us to hang out with friends, grab a bite and have some drinks. I do enjoy the food here. Service seems to be hit and miss though. First visit was quite bad customer service and second visit was a better experience.
