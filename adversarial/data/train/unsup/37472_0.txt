I can only talk about what I have had here and that is the beautiful falafel.  \nIt was made by two gentlemen that were extremely friendly and took pride in what \nthey were doing.  The taste was unbelievably amazing.  The prices are extremely reasonable and they have two for one specials most days of the week.\nThe restaurant had limited seating but mostly people take out anyways.\nWhen you walk in it feels like you are in a Middle East city with the music playing from a typical radio you would find there.  \nOverall....great feel to the restaurant and great falafel.  If you get one....get it loaded with everything including the hot sauce which is not over the top at all.
