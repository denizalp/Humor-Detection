We love going to Black Bear. Food is good and prices are fair. \n\nBlack Bear would get 5 stars, but I had to deduct one for the fact that every time we go, we are told it'll be a 20 minute wait for a table - don't think we've ever waited less than 45 minutes. \n\nMaybe they have done some research and 20 minutes seems to be the best answer to give customers when asked \"How long of a wait?\"
