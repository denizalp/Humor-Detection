Another name for clairvoyants: Sears. They can see things that others can't. Cerebral. Visionaries.\n\nYou won't find too many of them shopping at Sears though. This location, like many, has not too much foot traffic, pretty high prices ($40 for the pillow we wanted! It's just a pillow!), and didn't have much that interested me. I preferred the Nordstrom down at the other end of the Mall. Having said that, there were a few cool shirts and items in here that, if cheaper, I might have considered picking up. I noticed that the whole time we were in here, nobody said \"can I help you find anything.\" I guess they're really cutting back on employees because of how little business they are getting.
