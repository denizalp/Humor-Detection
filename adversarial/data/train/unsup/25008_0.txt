Wow, this place was not what we expected.  The idea is that you build own meal, with the guidance of your server.  We had Minh,  and he did a great job of walking us through the process.  At first we were a bit confused,  but he got us squared away. When the mean arrived, it was quite tasty. One of those things which turn out better than expected.   The drinks are interesting,  but the quality of the ingredients and the actual cooking was first rate.  A fun and different place to try.
