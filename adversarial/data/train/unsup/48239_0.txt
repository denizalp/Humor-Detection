I stopped in for lunch to check the place out. Have driven by several times and never had the chance to sit in until today. \n\nIt was quiet due to being Monday. First impression- very clean! Also, a ton of beer taps with a very wide selection and variety. \n\nFood menu was a bit shallow. Diversity of burgers but not much else to speak of. Wasn't surprised... went there to get a burger and a beer. I got the California burger and it was super tasty! The fries left something to be desired. I've had tastier potato chips. \n\nStaff were very friendly! Will drop in again.
