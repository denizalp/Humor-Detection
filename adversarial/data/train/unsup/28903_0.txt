These guys are ripoff artists. The guy in the garage actually doing my oil change did a good job.  I watched all the work he did from just outside the garage door. It was the desk guy in the office and then the store manager who came up with every excuse in the book to more than double the cost on the oil change coupon. If they do this for an oil change I'd be afraid to use them for a brake job.
