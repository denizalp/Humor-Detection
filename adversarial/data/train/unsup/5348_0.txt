Sushi is a traditional Japanese food combining seasoned rice with fish, vegetables, or egg. Sushi burritos are an oversized, modern take on the cuisine. Oddly, Ted's is the only place I've yet found that manages to give sushi burritos a clean, traditional flavor.\n\nThe menu suggests a handful of prepared combos with recommended toppings and sauces- the Sashimi Oishi, Tuna Tuna, and Ted's California, listed in order of preference, have been pretty good. I like that they have more traditional toppings available, including two different types of radishes and (my personal favorite!) carrot. The sauces are lighter here than elsewhere, and though some complain of a bland flavor, the profile at Ted's is distinctly different from the overly-sauced mayo-based stuff found at other local chains- and I like it that way.\n\nStaff are friendly and fun, and there are sides to pair with your 'rrito  from traditional (miso soup, seaweed salad, edamame, udon) to fun (imported ramen chips, Hawaiian onion chips, mochi). Note that they are closed on Sundays, so plan date night ahead of time.\n\nTIP: Hurry in to take advantage of their grand opening buy one get one half off promo through the end of October.
