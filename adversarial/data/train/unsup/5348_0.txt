I am so thankful for Royal. I personally worked with Frances who assisted me with finding a great place of employment. I kept my word and showed up at work everyday and it has paid off. After only being with Royal just a few weeks the company has decided to hire me on permanent. This has been a great transition for me. I am very happy and content. I now have the stability that I needed and am working for a great company who Royal found for me.
