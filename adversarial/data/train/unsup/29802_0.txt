Very rude and bad customer service. Natalie in the front office was very rude to my kids when I tried to drop of my 16 year old daughter and wouldn't take her because being under 18 going to places is \"illegal\" apparently, which is false. She also would not let me talk to the office manager and rudely  hung up the phone on me. I don't think that's called a happy and friendly atmosphere if anything that's attitude and disrespect.
