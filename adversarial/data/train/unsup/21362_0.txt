Best wedding Ive ever been to was here... and it was MINE! HA! \n\nShort, sweet, to the point and Elvis was there. None of those ceremonies that drag out for 45 minutes plus. They do ceremonies every 15-30 minutes. If you have guests, make sure they arrive early. We had a few people fly all that way and miss the whole thing. \n\nThe whole process was so simple. They provide Elvis, the minister, flowers, limo to and from the chapel, a photographer and videographer. You pay for the package and then you can add things from an al a carte menu such as web access to your wedding video, a cake (to go!), more pictures, flowers, etc. We chose the \"Cant help falling in love with you\" Elvis package. Elvis was tall and handsome and an EXCELLENT impersonator. He sounded and looked just like him. The whole thing was so quick. We walked in, paid, everyone sat down, Elvis walked me down the asile, vows (with Elvis playing \"One\" by Metallica on the guitar in the background), kiss, photography session with the fam and with Elvis, done. \n\nI was so nervous when I walked in and the lady at the counter said it would be over before I knew it. She was right. The staff is very very sweet. I would definitely recommend doing the Vegas wedding thing over the big lavish $45,000 wedding anyday. \n\nPS- Bon Jovi got married here. Awesome!
