Went to check out Public School last Tuesday since I live right by Downtown Summerlin. The vibe was pretty chill and our waitress was cute & attentive. Got the cutting board as our appetizer but how could you mess up cheese, cold cuts and bread right?..Went with the pepperoni pizza as our main which was the biggest mistake of my life (gross, greasy and salty). Literally equivalent to eating Little Caesars that someone drenched with 2 lbs of oil. Was gonna complain but our waitress Courtney, but she recommended good wine so I liked her; plus I ate it all because I was dying of starvation. Conclusion: never order the pizza at Public School. We probably should have gone with the shrimp and grits our waitress recommended as the Summers Cabernet she recommended was good. \n\nCheers!
