I had no idea this place would be so huge! Be prepared to tram it over to claim your luggage, and for somewhat dated facilities. They're incredibly efficient, though and while the size is a bit intimidating my experiences were both seamless.\n\nA note on nearly everything about Pittsburgh: It's bigger than you think. I had no idea this city was such a big, bustling place. So it makes sense that their airport is a biggun. I was totally impressed how easy it is to move through it given its size -- I had my luggage in under 15 minutes and when I came back to check into my flight, the lines moved swiftly and sans-stress. \n\nWhile the tramming was a bit of a surprise (and what I would get stressed about if I had a connecting flight here), it was actually really easy to maneuver and I believe takes you from where the planes are to where everything else is. There are also tons of shopping options in the terminal and higher-end brands at that. A great way to waste time if you've got it to waste. Not to shabby, Pittsburgh.
