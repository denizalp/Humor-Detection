Not sure how this happened  but it did! While in Vegas I suggested  this place because  I thought it was like the one in Dallas. Boy was I so wrong! \n\n  I thought I would be able to use an email coupon I had received but after speaking with the manager he explained that they were NOT same restaurant like the one at the Dallas location. \n\nWell they could NOT have been more right about that. The service was awful and the waiter never told us his name. We came with our cousins and we were really hungry after leaving the Criss Angel show in the Luxor Hotel. This is were this locatiom is located. I ordered the pulled pork tacos as well as my cousin. She and I immediately returned our food when we saw it. \n\n My pork was a nice color on the outside but when you moved it around with your fork it was beige in color..... Yuck!!! Plus the Black Beans looked liked someone..... Well you can use your imagination on that one. The waiter keep running off and would never allow us to finish what we were saying or asking. When we asked to speak to the manager again about our service and food. He also began to walk away while my cousin she was trying to explain herself. \n\nOnly the men kept and ate their dishes it was okay for them. We sat there and and,waited  for them to finish. I did not have cash but my husband refused to pay with our credit card so we borrowed the $15 to pay the bill and told our cousins we will pay them back when we left there. \n\nWe paid that bill and ran out of there and didn't dare to look back in fear salt might be thrown in our eyes!
