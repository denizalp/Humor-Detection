Excellent food and service. Simple decor with quiet music to set the tone. \n\nGood menu with all the traditional Indian selections you'd expect with clear descriptions of each one. The back page of the menu listed a few \"Indo-Asian  dishes. Unexpected but once you read the descriptions it's easy to see the culinary relationship. \n\nChicken saag and lamb khorma were superb. Vegetable samosas were light and delicious. Indian ice tea is so good you won't miss beer or wine - good since no alcohol served here. Go to Mantra for some of the best Indian food in town.
