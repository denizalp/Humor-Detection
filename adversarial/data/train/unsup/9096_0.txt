\"Cute blonde and bouncy boobs only go so far.\"\nMy husband and I went this afternoon just before 3.  And it was explained to us that they're only serving brunch before 3. Fine, although the brunch menu's kinda limited, we're willing to give this place a shot since we live around the corner.  I ordered a smoothie, specifically asking to have it in a to-go cup since I can never finish a smoothie quickly, and my husband ordered a beer.  We also ordered our food with very simple instructions (salad instead of chips). \n\nMy smoothie finally came, in a regular glass.  I said it's fine, and cute blonde server went on her merry way. While we were waiting for our food (a long time), our server seemed to be milling aimlessly. We asked about my husband's beer, and cute server blamed the bar for being slammed and backed up.  Although other people at nearby tables who came after us didn't seem to have trouble getting not one but two rounds of beers.\n\nOur food finally came (chips showed instead of salad), and beer never came! In the meantime my husband was never offered even a glass of water!  When we asked again about the beer, again cute server rolled her eyes and blamed the bar for being slammed.  Check was brought out with the beer charge on it, so we asked our server to just take it off.  Again it took forever as we were just twiddling our thumbs.  Needless to say, we won't return despite the super convenient location!
