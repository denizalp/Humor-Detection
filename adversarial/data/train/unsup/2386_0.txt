This place smells really bad and I am not sure what it is. \n\nI had a conference here and the walls that separated each conference room seemed to be makeshift walls that were very temporary. The food they served us was decent but they should have had snacks in between since the conference was all day long and we got very hungry throughout the day. \n\nBut I wouldn't recommend staying at this hotel. It's very subpar compared to the other hotels on the strip and for half the price compared to where I stayed, I would still shell out more money and have a more comfortable experience.
