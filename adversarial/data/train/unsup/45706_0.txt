Had breakfast here with my honey on the way to the airport to go back home to Cali. \n\nThe restaurant was very clean and the decor was contemporary.\n\nWe were immediately seated and given menus and a glass of water. I immediately noticed the menu consisted of a fusion of french and southern foods. \n\nI ordered an egg white omelet, it came with potatoes, and toast. I also had a mimosa. \n\nMy husband ordered the quiche lorraine which came with a salad. He also ordered a bloody mary. \n\nWe also ordered beignets (we couldn't resist) which came with raspberry sauce, nutella, and a vanilla bean sauce. \n\nThe food as GREAT and cheap! The raspberry sauce was good enough to write home and tell mom. \n\nThe beignets was not as good as the ones you get from the famous Cafe du Mond in New Orleans but they were very tasty. \n\nI wish we would have discovered this place sooner.
