I've been here 3 times now. \n\nFirst time I ordered takeout...ma po tofu. It was lacking flavor in my opinion. Not only that, but I ate it around 5pm and roughly a half hour later I fell asleep and didn't wake up until the next morning, feeling awful. Not sure if I received an msg overdose or what.\n\nI later talked with a friend who raved about her meal when she visited, so I decided to try again.  I ordered a vegetable spring roll and kung pao either shrimp or tofu, I can't remember. This meal I had at the restaurant and was significantly better and I did not lose a day to sleep. I felt fine after eating.\n\nI just ordered takeout again.  Veg spring roll and vegetable egg foo young. The spring roll is a bit undercooked inside and the egg foo young has a great variety of veggies, but is a bit overcooked and mushy.  \n\nAll in all, this is place is just average.  The staff are SUPER friendly but the food is a bit inconsistent and I feel the prices are too high for the quality.\n\nBecause it's new I am hoping they can get it perfected. I pray they replace the carpet. And because it's 2 minutes from my apartment, I will go back, but only when I don't feel like driving further to a few of the better spots in the area.
