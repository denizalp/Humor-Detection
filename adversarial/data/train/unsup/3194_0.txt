If you have a big party celebrating a special day, don't go here. I made reservations days in advance for a party of 16. We were seated in a corner and promised the table next to us for more guests. We didn't get another table and had to pull over our own chairs. We only had 1 server. The plan was to eat, drink and be merry, but only some ate dinner due to the limited space. The accommodations weren't very accommodating here. Very disappointed.
