Beautiful to walk around and enjoy some shopping and dining.  Lots to do in one afternoon and fabulous restaurants and experiences to enjoy. Great place to take guests and you don't have to leave because there's so much to do here.  From the wax museum to the Gondola ride to boutique shopping, live music in the open courtyard area and lots of fabulous restaurants.  Zefferino's second level has tables with balconies that overlook the Gondola's and food was great too (but that's another review), great people watching but take a GPS you could get lost this place is huge! I've stayed here before too-rooms are mini suites, luxurious, clean, first class experience, loved it!   P.S. Celebrity hotspot TAO is here too but make a reservation!
