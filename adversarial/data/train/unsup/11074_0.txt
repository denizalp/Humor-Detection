Sorry but I have to defend this place and no I don't work here.  I am a Scottsdale business owner who has been eating here for about a year regularly.  The manager and owner is the nicest woman on the planet and remembers her customers names every time they come in.  They are also the only Chinese restaurant I know of that is moderately priced that uses all white meat chicken.  Some of their items like their orange chicken I am not crazy about but their chow mein is awesome and most of their dishes are pretty darn good.  I can only imagine that most of your story is fabricated around the fact that she asked you to pay the difference and your too cheap to pay it.  To say their food is bad because you can't afford a dollar more to upgrade to the next dish is pretty low.  Maybe you should try running your own business and offer low prices in tough economic times and then have cheapskates ask for a free meal.  Don't let this homer fool you the manager is as nice as can be and this is a good Chinese place with very reasonable prices.
