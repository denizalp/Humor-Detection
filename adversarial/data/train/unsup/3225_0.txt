It doesn't help anything that we went here during the Christmas holiday. \n\nBut, since we never tried this place, we figure why not since we were staying at Cesar's palace. The wait was about 30 minutes to an hour wait (being Christmas and all) that's with being a diamond member. \n\nFood selection was definitely worth the wait. They had almost everything and top meats you can choose from. \n\nFor the price you pay ($70\/person-holiday) it was worth the wait. Now, I just have to try t when they're serving breakfast.
