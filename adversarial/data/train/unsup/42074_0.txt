Great selection of fresh Mexican and Domestic seafood. Most gringos get a little nervous eating anything from Mexico but as a past expert in worldwide seafood I can tell you that the fish from the Sea of Cortez is some of the least polluted seafood in the world. No nukes, no factory waste, and low population centers on the ocean. \nI was looking for a Mexican seafood store and heard about this place from my co-worker. Don't let that fishy shop smell dissuade you from shopping here. Even the cleanest shops smell fishy because they sell fish. You won't find fish this fresh in Scottsdale.
