Wednesday at work has always been Mexican food day. Over the years, where we got our Mexican food has varied, but for the last year or two, it has been Azteca more often than not.  It is a favorite of one of my coworkers, and he was the one who convinced us to give it a try.  And, how thankful was I!\n\nTheir tacos are fantastic -- shredded beef with a bit of kick to their seasoning, in a crispy, thick hard shell. And, even their beans and rice are wonderful. They make it even better, in my opinion, by sticking some chips in with your beans and cheese. It's like a mini nacho surprise. Plus, they always add a small slice of orange with every meal. I usually don't eat it, but it always adds a nice touch and smell to your eating experience. \n\nI've not ventured too much beyond my yummy tacos, but my fellow coworkers always rave about their chimmi's and burritos with just as much gusto as I do about my tacos.  Oh, and the other day, I tried a sampling of their breakfast burritos, and I must say they were muy delicioso. Eggs and potatoes and bacon wrapped in a fresh, homemade tortilla -- that is what I call a heavenly breakfast.\n\nAnd, finally, of course, are their baked goods. Again, I haven't tried their whole selection, but in the past I've been lucky enough to partake of their empanadas, and I've never been disappointed. \n\nAll in all, Azteca is a fantastic Mexican food experience in the heart of downtown Phoenix. It is affordable, it is welcoming and the food is delicious.  What more can you ask for?
