This has already been a favorite stop for hubby and me when in Vegas.  Kids always ask to stop here to.  It's been a while and I see that there's been some remodeling done inside and out.  \n\nWhat hasn't changed is how friendly and helpful everyone is here.  From the moment the Valet greets you to the moment he closes my door as we leave.\n\nThey've changed a restaurant, looks very sophisticated now, but the shops upstairs remain the same, which I appreciate.  We always find d so etching here to eat or take home- usually chocolates and Hawaiian treats.\n\nWe we're too early for the oxtail special, but they would drive back later in the evening to get their fill.\n\nDowntown is. Great area to go to...  It has a different vibe than the strip hotels have, and this one, well this one makes you feel at home.  Hubby can strike up a conversation with everyone here -  from the valet, to the cashiers, to people gambling or just walking by us.\nLove how easy going and comfortable this place feels, no matter how long it's been since our last visit.\n\nThis will always be a come back to place for us - to gamble, to eat, to shop, to walk around in...  If you haven't been here you should!
