I would pay $500 for this meal. It changed my life. I look forward to telling you about it...\n\nYes -- This restaurant is OFF THE STRIP. \n\nYes -- This restaurant requires a reservation because of how busy they can be. \n\nYes-- This restaurant is expensive, but it will change how you look at sushi. \n\n\nNow that we got the basics covered...\n\nTHE RESTAURANT\n--------------------------\n\nThe restaurant maybe seats 24 people at most, they have tables, but there is almost no point of going unless you are seated at the sushi bar.    \n\nAlmost every party at the sushi bar got their own sushi chef. \n\nThis sushi chef will help determine the order of which your sushi will come out to pace your palette accordingly. \n\nOurs was an expert. \n\nTHE FOOD\n-----------------\n\nWhen it comes to sushi, most people don't know that the quality and treatment of the rice is almost as important as the quality and the treatment of the fish. \n\nIts hard to imagine tasting better rice or fish.\n\nAll of the fish was extraordinary. Buttery, smooth, soft, luscious, rich, pick your adjective, it doesn't matter, some of the TORO I ate was some of the sexiest, most delicious bites of food I have ever had in my life. \n\n\nSERVICE\n-----------------\nImmaculate.\n\nNot much more needs to be said. \n\nMichelin star quality.  \n\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n------------------------------\n\nBe prepared to spend over $100 per person and order every cut of TORO they have, which is four or five! I guarantee you will most likely never try anything that tastes like this again. \n\nMy favorites were the Hagashi Toro, and Yamashito Toro. \n\nAlso the Iced Green Tea is a must, it is the most refreshing drink you will ever taste. \n\n\nGo. But don't tell too many people, because its too good, and the more people who try it, the busier they will be, the harder it will be for us to get back in. \n \n\nNOTES\n-------------\n\nI am omitting some of the incredible detail, like the quality of their handmade soy sauces and actual wasabi they use as opposed to the fake wasabi many lower grade sushi restaurants use. \n\nFinal Note. Expect Excellence. You won't be let down.
