Went in today to buy a large screen curve tv. Went to the tv section of the store and waited 15 minutes while employees walked past me into the stock room.  Finally one advised me the two who should be in the dept are busy and will come as soon as their finished.  20 minutes later still no one approached me and numerous employees walking back and forth right past me into the stock room.  It is good that they prioritize their stock room responsibilities over customer service because as far as I am concerned all they will have in the end is stock and not customers.  worst retail experience ever.  low energy employees.
