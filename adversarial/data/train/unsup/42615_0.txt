I love Coffee Bean, but this location needs help! Not one to complain, but the barista was lacking in the customer service department. First, I was standing at the pick up counter and she pulled the trash can in front of me and said you need stand somewhere else. Then when I got my drink it was definitely not right. I order this drink all the time at the Indian School location, so I know the difference. If your a coffee drinker like I am, then you like good thick foam, not airy foam. So, when I ask her to remake the drink she ask what was wrong with it and I told her that the foam was super airy and she glared at me for a good 30 seconds and acted completely put out. She never said one nice thing to me. When I'm specific about my order, I expect it to be right. I'm the customer and paying for the drink and expect respect. I'll not give my money to a business that treats the customers this way.
