Well I don't know who the people are who are getting roped into time shares but we had a great experience.  \n\nDecides on the Jockey Club because rooms all over vegas were about 300 a night.  So glad we stayed here.  It's right on the strip.  It's QUIET and well accomodated.\n\nDefinitely would stay here again.  As a note....if you think you are getting something for free you haven't been around the block very long.  Just book a room here and stop winning contests haha
