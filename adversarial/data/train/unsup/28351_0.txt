coffees good, plenty of cream and sugar on the table so you wont have to ask for more.\nthe full menus available all day minus soups but only because they might not be ready. \n\nNice clean place from floor to ceiling. Feels.really big and open. The log cabin feel is great reminds me of little diners up the California coast. \n\nThe food portions are great and the price is good. 10.99 seems to be the average breakfast price. It taste good and flavorful. doesn't have that frozen reheated taste you get else where.
