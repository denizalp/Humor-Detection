We tried Hanshiktaco this summer. It's close to where I live and as soon as I saw it I was really excited to try it. I love trying new things and the food sounded really interesting. I've had L.A.'s famous Kogi tacos and was hoping for something similar from this truck. However, it was only okay. The flavors just weren't there. Good concept but more work is needed on the execution.\n\nHanshiktaco has quite a few good reviews, so I may need to try it again as they may have improved. However, I'm reluctant to do so based on my first experience.
