We used the mobile service to put our cat to sleep and it was one injection into the neck and then the cat was put into a garbage bag.\n\nEverywhere I have read and the people I have talked to said it should be two injections.  One to sedate them and one to put them to sleep.  I'm not sure why it was only one needle but would love to find out.
