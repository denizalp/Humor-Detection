GET. A. BUNGALOW.\nSo I went MDW and this place was pretty lit on a Thursday. The girls and I got a bungalow for about $700. It's yours till 6:30p. Totally worth it since there's a $200 drink minimum for any seat in the house. Just have all your friends put in on the bungalow. Plus, you get your own personal mini pool that you share with your bungalow neighbs.\n\nService was amazing. From the kitchen staff, security, front desk and our super hot server. Quality food. Get the nachos and salmon poke bowl. BOMB. The slushies that are strawberry and pina colada flavored are alright. They are virgin initially and they add the alcohol per request. \n\nCrowd is mixed in age and color (yay, diversity). Towards the end of the day, long past the point of return from sober land, there was some hot messes. E.g. one of our bungalow neighbors barfed and was escorted out; lots of making out between strangers. In other words, amazing people watching.\n\n*Stay hydrated
