It is such a nice neighborhood. The decoration looks like ltalian Cafes. Food is delicious and they are behaving so friendly and take a good care of you. But the problem is that you can not just go there for a cake or coffee. We were looking in yelp for a good place to have coffee and ended up there. They just have fixed menus that you have to choose one of the limited options they have and each of the options is super expensive. 65$ per person. When we arrived there the waitress said we have to choose one of the options in fixed menu beside our coffee if we want to sit there and when we ordered, we just found out it's gonna be 65$ per person. Then if you are planning to go there, just consider that it's mandatory for you to spent a certain amount of money at least.
