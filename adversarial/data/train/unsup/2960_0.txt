Newly remodeled including assigned reclining seats that have a button for low and high heat! This is definitely a new idea for movie theaters! Perfect for those who get cold while watching movies.\n\nThe concession stand is also being remodeled to include alcoholic beverages! I like the automatic machines where you can purchase tickets without having to wait in a line.\n\nFYI, make sure you join the Cinemark club for free popcorn on your birthday and earn rewards \/ points for every movie ticket and concessions purchased.\n\nEnjoy the show!
