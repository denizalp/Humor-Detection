This place has saved my life a few times and a few trips to Spring Mountain. I usually pack my lunch when I have to be at UNLV across the street but 75% of the time, I eat my lunch right after breakfast...on the way to school.\n\nBy the time I get out of class, my stomach has already eaten itself. I need to eat constantly. The food comes out quick and I never to have to wait to be seated. Lots of parking.\n\nI normally get the same items: egg rolls, Thai tea and a bowl of pho. The egg rolls are warm and crunchy, and the filling is tasty. The pho is always steaming hot...the broth is good.\n\nService has always been the greatest out of the Vietnamese restaurants I've been to in town. I always come here solo and I like joking around with the staff here. They're nice like that.
