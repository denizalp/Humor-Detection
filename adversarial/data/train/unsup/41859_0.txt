Airport food, thy name is mediocrity. Genghis Grill wasn't bad but it wasn't that good either. My husband ordered a Seoul bowl which I think was supposed to have Korean inspired flavors but it definitely didn't taste at all Korean. It was alright but nothing spectacular, and certainly not worth the money they charged for it.\n\nI ordered a Thai bowl and it was depressingly bland. It was supposed to have a peanut sauce on it but it just tasted like frozen vegetables tossed with udon noodles. The chicken was tender and the tofu was alright but there just wasn't any flavor to anything. I ended up dumping the leftover sauce from the order of chicken potstickers we split over my noodles. It helped but it was unfortunate that I had to do that.\n\nI did enjoy the potstickers so I'd recommend those, but definitely pass on the Thai bowl. The Seoul bowl was alright but certainly not something to write home about. All in all we spent close to 30 bucks on our mediocre meal but when you're stuck in an airport on a layover your choices are going to be limited.\n\nDefinitely be sure to check your order before you walk away though. When they first tried to hand ours over they were missing my husbands order and it took a few minutes to flag someone down to correct it. Also be sure to let them know if you have a food allergy because they use a large mongolian grill to cook the food so cross contamination will definitely happen if you don't give them a heads up.\n\nI haven't been to a Genghis Grill outside of an airport before but my understanding is they're a decent place for Asian fast food. I'd consider going to one at some point but I don't plan on returning to this location, even if I am stuck in the Charlotte airport. There are other options that are hopefully less mediocre.
