Juans is the best! Everyone here is so kind & the service is above & beyond for how busy they get. Expect to wait, but it is more then worth it! The food is absolutely amazing! This is by far my favorite place to eat. The fajitas are my go to, but I've tried just about everything. Don't fill up on the chips, salsa, & bean dip because their desserts are so worth being miserful!
