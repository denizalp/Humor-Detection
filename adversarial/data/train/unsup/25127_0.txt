The decor and ambiance of the restaurant was excellent, inviting and a place to relax.  The food selection doesn't seem like there are many options, but as you read through the menu there are actually quite a few.  Had the bison burger with the kale & brussels slaw.  The quality of the food combined with the taste was superb!  Pricing is very reasonable and not over priced.  Service and friendliness of staff was great!
