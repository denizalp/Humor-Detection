Worst little Caesar's on earth.  I joked with the manager \"I guess hot and ready doesn't mean hot and ready.\"  She told me \"You don't know how many times a day I hear that.\"  Clearly this place is run extremely poorly.    This of course was after she gave another customer directions to the Little Caesar's over on Lone Mountain and Decatur.  Oh yeah, best part, when I stepped out to the register I asked \"What's ready?\"  The young man at the counter told me, \"Uhh pretty much nothing.\"  We went to Roberto's across the street.  Was served in less time than it took for me to find out Little Ceasars had no food ready.  Yay Roberto's.  Boo Little Caesars
