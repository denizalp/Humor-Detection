Worst. Customer Service. Ever.\n\nMy husband (G) went to this center today to get some screws for a microwave we were given after striking out at Ace, Home Depot, etc. G told the \"Customer Service Rep\" what he needed and after searching his computer a bit, he declared that he wasn't able to help G WITH ATTITUDE - like G was putting him out by asking him to do his job.\n\nG asked to speak to the manager in the hopes that he might be able to get some actual help and was told that no, he wouldn't get the manager for G because G had an attitude and needed to leave the store. Keep in mind that my husband hadn't said anything rude or raised his voice. He had simply asked to speak with a manager. G was floored... what had he done to deserve this? \n\nAfter he left the center, he called and unfortunately got the same rude employee. Employee said he still wouldn't get a manager, but eventually gave in after declaring that the manager probably would refuse to talk to G. The manager did come on the line and when G explained what had happened, the Manager (THE MANAGER!?) told G that it is a store policy that if an employee determines that a customer is out of line, rude, etc that they have sole authority to have them removed from the premises. \n\nWhat kind of BS is this? Apparently at Sears Parts & Repair, the customer is always WRONG. \n\nIt is amazing to me that after all the money we have dropped in Sears that not only did this kind of disrespectful thing happen, but that the Manager actually claims this is ok and store policy. Really? Store policy?\n\nI will be writing a formal complaint to Sears Corp and see what they think of this ridiculous \"store policy\".
