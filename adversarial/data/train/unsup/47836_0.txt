My ac unit went out yesterday. So I contacted my home warranty and their contractor couldn't get to my house until 4 days later grrr. It's summertime in Vegas... I can't wait 4 days. I contacted another company that I had previously dealt with and sent them my info on their emergency #.... never heard back from anyone. After reading some yelp reviews I decided to email MD air. They responded in 2 minutes stating they can be out within the hour. I gladly took that appointment. James showed up 30 min later, worked on it for about 15-20 min and my ac is now working again. The price was very reasonable for what I would consider an emergency service call. I will only use and refer this company from now on!!
