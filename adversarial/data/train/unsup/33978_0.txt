Let me start by saying that finding a good transmission shop is very difficult.  Already spent several thousand dollars with another shop that kept my truck for a total of 5 weeks, including several trips.  Once with a tow truck because the expensive high performance parts they charged me for blew up within 500 miles.  After all this my truck was leaking transmission fluid all over my driveway.  Leaking from the front and back.  BIG MESS!\n\n****LESSON****\n\nShould have gone to see Jimmy and his brother at Earl's Transmission Service in the first place, would of save time, and lots of $$$, thousands in my situation.\n\nThese guys are no thrills, old school, know what they are talking about when it comes to transmissions!  They had my transmission pulled the same day, removed all the silicone that the last shop used and replaced the several seals to stop all the leaks.  My truck is supercharged with lots of high performance engine\/exhaust, and suspension parts.  No matter, they had it repaired and ready by the NEXT DAY!  *****WOW****   \n\nOh, and they are super reasonable on their rates!  Thanks guys.
