Great westside location. Clean and open. Menu is chuck full of great choices. Wraps are full and big, very tasty. My only complaint is the staff yelling across the restaurant to other staff members as voices carry and it was a bit annoying. Otherwise this is a great place for good, reasonable food....Happy Eating!!
