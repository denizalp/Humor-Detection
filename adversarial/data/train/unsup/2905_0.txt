Amazing. Amazing. Amazing!!! \n\nIf I wasn't cracking up by the comedian, I was delightfully entertained by the tasteful, sexy and very talented show that these women put on! I went with my boyfriend and I think I actually had a better time than he did.. Hah okay maybe not ;-)\n\nThis show isn't just a bunch of girls shaking what their mama gave them. They actually go up there and perform acrobatic acts, themed dance routines, etc. The other thing I loved about this show was that there were women of all sizes.. meaning it wasn't a group of women with ONLY fake boobs. \n\nI have to say one of my favorite parts of the show was the comedian. .I'm bummed that I forgot his name already! He will have you on the floor with his silly-ness.  LOL.\n\nLadies- Go with your guy, you won't be disappointed ! I promise you its clean, classy fun!\n\nMen- Take your girl but don't get too googly eyed ! Haha\n\nFYI's:\n1. There is only one bar outside the showroom so get your drink before you go in!\n2. They offer a buy one get one FREE as a \"locals\" discount! Thankfully, my cousin lives in Vegas so she purchased me front center tickets for only $70 after tax! Such a steal of a deal and SO worth my money! \n\nEnjoy!
