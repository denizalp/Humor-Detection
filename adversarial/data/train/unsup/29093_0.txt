The food is really good. The coffee is pour over which is the best way to make it. the customer service is outstanding. \nthe only downside to this place is the size. You want to enjoy your time at a place like this. But the aisles are narrow and you feel rushed and crowded when your there. so the ambience is way down which is important for me on a nice Sunday morning.
