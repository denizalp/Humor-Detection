It was after 5pm, I was hungry and seemed to be the only person walking down the lonely stretch of Main Street.  I noticed the Mexican restaurant called Mango's but I didn't have high hopes as the name brought to mind a boring Americanized menu with bad margaritas and table side mariachi music.  Hunger won out so I sat down to order the fish taco special.\n\nWell, first impressions be damned.  The simple meal of grilled fish tacos, rice and beans made me think I was at a good street vendor stand in Mexico -- and I mean that in the best possible way.  The ingredients were traditionally authentic.\n\nWhile I don't expect to find myself a frequent visitor to Mesa, I do plan to visit Mango's in the future when I pass through the Phoenix area.
