Um yeah, so I've worked in restaurants my entire working life and tonight I've witnessed a few fundamental health code violations. Our water was poured from the tap straight from a hand sink in the back into our glasses.  The hand soap from said sink was located directly over a pitcher of iced tea and a pitcher of water. The server washed out a horchata\/lemonade pitcher in that very same sink--which you're not supposed to do. Those sinks are for hand washing only. I saw a busser bus tables then go cook on the line. Did he wash his hands or just wipe them on his extremely dirty apron. Seriously it looked like he was butchering meat. Unfortunately we were seated near the line where the servers pick up the food. They were horsing and joking around to the point we thought they had been drinking. It was really inappropriate. In keeping with the drunk theme, my server literally laughed at me when I ordered a cheese tamale. He apologized, maybe he was thinking of something else but it was really rude. On a positive note, the food didn't suck.  I actually wouldn't mind food poisoning; I could really stand to  lose a pound or two. Hence the two stars.
