So it was time to make the repairs\nTurns out on of my relay fans had shorted, that caused a cascading electrical issue the stopped a full 1.5 of Freon from cooling the air.\n\nI gladly and quickly paid the $516.00\n\nBecause 25 to 30 degrees coming out of the vent\n\nIS A GOOD THING.\n\nIf I am not doing the work to maintain our 2 Honda's. These guys will.\n\nHonest, No B. S. And interesting to see an all Asian Mechanical repair shop.
