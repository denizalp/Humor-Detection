was very good. Took my daughter there for a birthday dinner. everyone's food was great service was good. we got there @ 5 and they have a good happy hr special. 1\/2 off apps, burgers, pizzas, and drinks. i have bacon blu cheese mushroom burger . it was good. kids shared a pizza some fries, and chicken fingers, and of course a milk shake. I would take them there again. actually very reasonable price during happy hr.
