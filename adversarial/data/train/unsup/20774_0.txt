Unless you want a trip back in time, I would choose someone else, they were not willing to work with me unless my husband was present. I thought that a \"no obligation estimate\" meant that I would not have to make a decision that day, apparently not.  \n\nI then called Empire and they said he does not have to be there unless he is going to have questions. Thanks Empire..... I was getting worried for a minute there!\n\nGood Luck!
