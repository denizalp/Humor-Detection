I was looking for a nail salon to visit to get my nails did before I go on vacation. A friend recommended The Nailery and so I decided to try it out!\n\nThe Nailery was originally located on Grove Rd but moved to this new location near Brentwood Town Square this past August. Not only is it a much more accessible location, but the staff and salon itself is great. The inside is very clean, something that doesn't always happen at other nail salons. The staff is extremely pleasant and fun to chat with. Usually I sit back and relax, but found myself talking with everyone there!\n\nI got a gel manicure and as a first time client it was at a discount of $27. Val helped me to pick out a color and made a suggestion about how to jazz up my nails. \n\nBefore leaving I even scheduled my next appointment, which I never do! I'm already counting down the days.
