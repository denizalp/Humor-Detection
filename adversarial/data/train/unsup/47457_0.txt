I went for a family party in the private reception room in the back so I can't really comment on the restaurant itself. \nOverall, it was a good setting for a quiet family party, the service varied between ok (dear waitress, a negroni is not a gin and tonic!) and fantastic (shoutout to the bearded waiter who overheard me translating to my BF in Italian and took care to speak to him in Italian!) \nThe food was decent - nothing special but all edible standard Italian fare. The standouts were the main dishes as both the salmon and the steak were generous portions and quite tasty.
