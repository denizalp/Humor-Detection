Jennie Pho is located in a free standing restaurant in front of a strip mall on Rainbow Boulevard just north of Windmill Drive. \n\nAfter a long day of moving we decided to start trying some of the places in our new neighborhood that we've never tried before. I had a combo platter that consisted of a moist and tender grilled pork chop. That pork chop was so freakin tender that I was able to take the first few bites by cutting off pieces with the side of my fork! Also included was 3 large shrimp a fried egg, and a sizable portion of rice!\n\nI haven't tried the pho yet but my friends weren't overly impressed. They both ordered the Jenni Special. They noted that it was okay but that they have had much better at other places in town(including several places in Chinatown and the Lemongrass Cafe on Eastern Ave.). I am quite sure I will be back to try it myself and at that time I'll be able to update this review regarding their pho. \n\nThe service was quick and friendly, but then again the place was pretty dead when we went in there yesterday afternoon. \n\nI guess the biggest complaint I had about my experience yesterday was that we were ambushed by a couple of very aggressive gnats\/flies. Very freaking annoying when you're trying to eat!\n\nBe aware that they only accept cash. They also have an ATM inside for your money gouging convenience.\n\nI did like this place enough to the point that I will return and try more things. It does have the potential to bump up to 4 stars and it's so close to the house that it would be great to make this a regular spot.\n\nUntil further notice though...it will be..\n\n3 stars.
