I order a birthday cake from this store, and I was very specific on what I wanted on the cake, wanted to have fresh fruit half strawberry and half peach and frost I wanted to have it be whipped cream.  Paid over $50 dollars for a half sheet and I got the whipped cream but this cheap basters put strawberry jam and peach jam.   Had ppl. That were diabetic  and of course they could not eat the cake.   I WILL NEVER ORDER THERE AGAIN AND I WILL TELL EVERY ONE THAT I KNOW NOT TO EVER ORDER THERE EITHER...  Such a disappointment.  I should of just ordered from smiths or Costco.  This ruined my child's birthday party :(
