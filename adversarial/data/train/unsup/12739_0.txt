So much better than other Southwest locations *cough Salt Lake City* It is conveniently located near bathrooms, Starbizzle, magazines and some fast foodie options. Our flight attendants were hilarious and good natured. The best part was after the pilots came down and one of the female attendants simply said \"We're here.\" (no @#$# )... that got some laughs. I have such a love hate relationship with Southwest but at Sky Harbor we had no issues with checking in our luggage within a reasonable waiting period, no luggage was lost, and had a comfortable flight. To be continued on our second Arizona UYE (yes the plus one and  I are coming back... and you @#$#@&$ better come with us!!)
