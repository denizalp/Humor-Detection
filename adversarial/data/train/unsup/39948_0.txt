I am from San Jose,Ca with a huge Indo-American community and over 100 Indian Restaurants to choose from. I have traveled extensively in India as well. I found the food at Woodlands to be exceptional and of the quality of a fine Indian restaurant but at prices which were more family oriented. If I am ever in Charlotte again I will be sure to have more than one meal there.
