Guilt is a bitch. And after giving Cartel a crap-tastic review without actually tasting their brew, guilt got the best of me. I had to try again.\n\nPlus, I've got a soft spot for anyone willing to roast their own beans and forge relationships with growers, not to mention serve to-go coffee in compostable cups. Oh, just thinking about it makes  my bleeding heart flutter. \n\nBut on to the goods...\n\nVisit #4, 8:30 am on a weekday. Open. \nFucking. Finally. I just order coffee, cuz....well, if you can't do a cup right, I won't trust that your foaming and steaming abilities are up to snuff.\n\nIt's good. It's rich and flavorful, with that bright taste, hard-to-hate of a Central American bean. The beans are fresh, and you can tell. The coffee is fresh, and you can tell. And their milk is that delicious non-pasteurized crap that makes people nervous. This doesn't faze me (see previous commentary re: dirt and germs for more) and tastes delicious. \n\nI head to work totally satisfied. When I'm low on beans, I'll be in to pick up a pound for sure. It's just too bad this place is off my bus route to the office, or I'd stop in more often. Because they're doing something right, and their beans don't cost any more than Starbucks' (although if you are buying beans at Starbucks, I suggest you save your money and just buy grocery store crap, because it's not any better). \n\nSo, why just three stars? Because, c'mon -- Cartel keeps hippie hours. In my book, 8:00 is LATE to open a coffee shop for us proles with desk jobs. (Plus, when you own a business, 8:00 does not mean 8:18 people!) And while I'm digging the laid-back, warehouse-y vibe, I wish the place were better set up for working rather than chatting about literature or politics or whatever it is people without day jobs discuss. \n\nFuck. Am I a yuppie?
