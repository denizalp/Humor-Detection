Expensive, but highly delicious. I loved the mint chocolate chip. The huge chunks of chocolate are so satisfying. I'm craving some as I write this review. \nThey also have a nice outdoor seating area. \n\nThe staff are a little snooty. I mean, don't talk down to me when I ask you about an item on the menu. You're selling ice cream, not Chanel.
