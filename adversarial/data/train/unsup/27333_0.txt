First of all, this is the ONLY location that's close by!!! This wasn't my first time. I've never been so insulted, or felt UN-WELCOMED EVER! I won't be back again. The only reason we gave this location two tries was, I had to use my $16 Groupon!!\n\nI should of known from the start the staff was HORRIBLE. I was the one who was trying to be polite. I agree with Emily's review completely. They couldn't be bothered to fake a smile! I wish I grabbed this young kid's name working tonight.\n\nFIRST of all, I picked up a meatball marinara COMBO. He was rude to my Mother at check out. Then when we ate, I was going to give a simple yelp review for like 3 stars. The food was GOOD but the people working tonight were miserable. You can see it on their faces. My mother had opened her bag of ruffles & told me to try them. I liked those more than the Sun chips. I put the sun chips back, the female employee was right there. She watched me switch them out.\n\nWe're about to leave, as I grab a refill. The young guy behind the counter's like \"You gotta pay for that!!\". I came back in, told him \"What are you talking about? I just switched the bags, I hadn't opened it.\" He said \"Oh our regular costumers come in and open bags & grab new ones.\" Well it was just really insulting to me, he doesn't know me.  I know granted I was wearing casual clothing, but I DO NOT steal. SIMPLE.  He really pissed me off. No apology, fine I'll take my money to Firehouse Subs.\n\nI hope they're happy that they drive business away. I walked in there at quarter of 6 & the place was EMPTY, as if that wasn't a big enough red flag.\n\nI won't be shocked if they're closed in a few months.
