It's a bit hard not to venture into 'TMI' territory when you're reviewing a waxing salon, but I will say that I was quite happy with the results. I walked away feeling confident in channeling my inner Jennifer Aniston, a la the scene in 'The Break Up' where she  sexily strolls past Vince Vaughn -- totally nude -- showing off her \"Telly Savalas\" wax ;)\n\nWas impressed by:\n\n* Speed! The salon prides themselves on a \"15 minute wax,\" and my aesthetician  definitely stayed close to that timeframe. \n\n* Pain minimizing techniques. Now, I hate to break it to you, but if you're in search of a completely pain-free wax -- I have yet to come across a technique that lives up to such a promise. BUT, the techniques employed at this salon definitely help keep pain to a minimum.\n \nWas turned off by:\n\n * The paper thin walls. I was a little mortified when my sister informed me that any words exchanged between myself and my aesthetician (including um, 'positioning' cues and her asking whether my giggling was a \"coping mechanism\") were very easily overheard from the lobby area.
