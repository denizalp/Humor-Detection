Nomz. Aghh. So tasty so delicious, too many choices. I was surprised by how cheap the breakfast was ($15.99) considering that it's the Bellagio--which is super swanky.  Although it was breakfast, they did have their full spread of lunch foods and desserts as well.\n\nThe service is great, it's very clean (including the bathrooms) and there is so much to choose from. A list of some of the things I ate: lots of lox, bagels and cream cheese, eggs florentine, watermelon in lavender honey, flan, bomb-diggity bread pudding, shrimp pesto pizza, eclair, berries, etc. Now that I'm listing everything I ate, I kind of feel like a fatty...but whatever. It's Vegas!
