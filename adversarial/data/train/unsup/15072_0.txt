Never thought I would write something praising a Wal-Mart but this location defies expectations.  There aren't the typical Wal-Mart customers here (think about it) and the location is spacious and amazingly clean.  During the day it's never busy and checkout is always fast.  Parking is abundant, and I'll continue going here until it is discovered by everyone else and it goes downhill.
