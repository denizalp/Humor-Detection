Bad dealership beware of the pushy salesman who only see the dollar sign when you walk in. The salesman don't explain you anything about the contract and they don't let you read the contract either I'm glad I got out of there in time they were asking $500 for just looking at the car it's some kind of scam deposit. There prices for most cars are on average $3000 more then on the Canadian website of dodge like might as well change the prices on the website so people aren't mislead. I love dodge cars but because of my really bad experience with this dealership bought a Ford pretty good experience solid car and nice service so far.
