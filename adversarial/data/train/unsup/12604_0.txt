So I know I am swimming upstream with this review with only giving it 3 stars, but I wanted to add my opinion of the show here anyway.  I'm sure I am not the only one that doesn't think it is a 5 star show.\n\nI have seen a lot of Crique shows.  I think my last count is 5, so I do have some experience with this genre of production shows.  I do enjoy Cirque shows, just not this one.  I thought O was ok, but not the best thing I have ever seen.  \n\nThe theme of this show is death, which I found out after watching the show and talking to some friends who had seen it as well.  As soon as my friends told me that, it totally explained a lot of the things I thought about the show.  I found O to be very dark and it made me uncomfortable in many instances.  I actually had bad dreams the night I saw the show.  It just creeped me out on some level in my brain.  I just didn't like the imagery at all.\n\nNow I do have some positives for the show.  It is a great show for the performance value alone, which is why it gets a 3 star rating from me.  It is a high quality Cirque show with some great performers, except for the clowns, they creeped me out too, but that goes back to me seeing scary clown movies as a kid.  I am just traumatized on numerous levels I guess.\n\nThe theater is also well designed with most seats being good.  I would recommend not buying the cheapest seats though because they have some obstructed views and are pretty far back.  If you are going to see the show, spurge on the better seats. I was given comped tickets to this show due to an old job I used to have and we were in the \"cheap\" seats and my friend who went with me actually couldn't see a section of the stage.\n\nSo take what you will from my review.  I hope it helps you decide on which show to see in Vegas!
