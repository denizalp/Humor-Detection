I cannot rave enough about this place! The mother\/ daughter owners are some of the sweetest people I have met in AZ and the services went well beyond my expectations!! I had an amazing facial, HCG weight loss, B12 shot and laser hair removal (yes all in 1 day!)\nSpa is cute and clean, extremely friendly owners, more than competitive pricing and my face is smoother than my toddlers now, lol! \nI will be back for these monthly magic facials and can't wait to get a spray tan in the near future. So many options under one roof to get you looking your best. \nHighly highly recommend!!!!
