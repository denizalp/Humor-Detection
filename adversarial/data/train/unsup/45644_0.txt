Visiting Vegas for a few days and came here on a Sunday around 4pm\nThe place is clean, staff was very friending and the tacos omg amazing. I ordered Carne Asada and tongue tacos and they were so good. ( they come with avocado, onion, and cilantro)\nThe only thing i didn't like about the place was the 3 different lines i had to wait in.. they were very confusing and everyone keep cutting in front of me. The menu is in Spanish so i had to figure out our what each meat meant. ( it would be a good idea to translate next to them)\n\nOther than the confusing lines and the whole menu being in Spanish i love the place and will def come back
