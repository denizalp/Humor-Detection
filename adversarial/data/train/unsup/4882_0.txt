A legitimate slice of New York-style pizza is almost impossible to find in Cleveland. Why is that exactly? I mean, we're close enough to the East Coast that this really shouldn't be an issue. Especially not in 2018. Neapolitan, brick oven, Sicilian and even somewhat sorry excuses for Chicago Deep Dish are all available, yet our local pizza scene is seemingly devoid of authentic N.Y. style options. At least, that's what I thought, before trying Vincenza's. \n\nMy husband and I recently made a pilgrimage downtown just for this pizza (during rush hour, mind you) and it was totally worth the drive from the Heights. We called in our order for pick up and it was ready in under 20 minutes.\n\nThe jumbo pie had a perfect cheese to sauce ratio, extra thin crust that was crunchy on the outside (yet had a slightly chewy center) and it was sliced large enough for each piece to be folded in half while you eat it. If you're wondering, yes, that last part is essential to enjoying a truly great NY pizza eating experience. \n\nThey also had all sorts of individual slices available with a variety of different crusts and toppings, making it a great downtown lunch option, as well. The dining room was simple, but clean. \n\nVincenza's is very much worth the commute, if you're traveling from the 'burbs, like we were!
