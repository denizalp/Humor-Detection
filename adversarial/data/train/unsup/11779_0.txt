My husband and I joined fellow Yelpers Jim & Audrey for a show at Stand-up last...well, it's been so long I can't remember when, but there was a Yelp special for tickets!\n\nWe arrived somewhat early and took a seat in the bar next door to the showroom.  I can't remember the bartender's name, but he certainly can pour a strong drink!  The two I had were plenty, and the show had not yet started.  The bar, however, was sweltering hot.  There's a clue.  The show must have been in early summer before our buddies moved.\n\nOnce the doors opened, we waited in line to file in.  I'm not sure what point was served in making a reservation because we weren't seated any earlier, nor in any better position than those who crowded in ahead of us without reservations.  There is a limited menu available, typical burgers, nachos, chips, etc.  We only ordered french fries and popcorn.  Neither were exceptional, but obviously good enough that I couldn't quit shoving them down.  Service was just fine, too.\n\nAs far as the comedy..some were funny, some not so much.  But overall, a fun evening for a reasonable price.
