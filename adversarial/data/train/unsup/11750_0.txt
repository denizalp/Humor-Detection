Spencer got the itchies!!!\n\nAll the sudden - out of nowhere - my new puppy dog has red, swollen and infected eyes and a sore on his paw. He was scratching his face like crazy & had to be put in an e-collar (you know that thing they wear on their head that looks like a lamp shade). \n\nMy husband and I were pretty upset with the impending doom of having to visit the vet to unload his wallet on him for little to no treatment - at least that is what we were certain was going to happen given our past experience with the shyster vets on the East Coast.\n\nWhat a shocking and pleasant surprise Grayhawk Animal Hospital turned out to be. The doctor (Dr. Stan Howard) was great: knowledgeable & friendly and most of all cheap! \n\nHe did not try to pad the bill in any way with bogus tests and fictitious scares. \n\nThe staff (Heather in particular) was great. OMG - so good with animals and friendly. She gave him his shot while playing with him and he did not even know it. Very professional - very impressive!\n\nIn the end, Spencer was found to have seasonal allergies. Yes, my hypoallergenic\/allergy-free dog ironically has allergies himself. Poor Spencer. \n\nWe got out of there with 4 different meds for under $150. This is great to me. The same visit with a horrible vet back East would have been at least double.\n\nI hold back on 2 stars for a several reasons:\n1.) It was a quick visit. I would have liked a more thorough exam - especially since this was our very first check up with Spencer. \n\n2.) It was super noisy and very irritating. They have a kennel on-site, and I felt like I was standing in the middle of it! I could not think, and I was already pretty nervous and having a difficult time with it to begin with (Spencer looked pretty sick).\n\n3.) There was nowhere to take Spencer to urinate. They had nothing available. They are in the Bashas strip mall. And when I heavily hinted that he needed to go NOW, they ignored me! WTF!@#$%#  Eventually, Spencer relieved himself on their fish tank.\n\nIt was not a bad experience though, and Spencer is on his way to better health. All in all, it is a very nice place, with very nice people that is inexpensive in my opinion. My husband loved them. We will go back again, and I hope to also get him groomed there. Stay tuned for an update on his haircut.
