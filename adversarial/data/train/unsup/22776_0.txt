Well, I love this place... Both my daughter's and one of their mother in-laws come here, when my mom comes into town I bring her here.\n I recieve several different services here.\n My brows are done here by Holly. \nI get gel pedicures by anybody, all are great. I just call before appt, I always get in during the week. I know better to try to come in during the weekends..\n I get my nails done by Richard with appt and for special designs I request Holly.. But while pregnant with their baby girl I try to stick with Richard and give myself extra time.. Clients run late designs take time.. I understand my nails and their service is worth it..\n I also love their punch card when paying cash for services.. Gift cards for services are available with yr expiration date from date of purchase. Great selection of color.. Absolutely a good time when Richard sings
