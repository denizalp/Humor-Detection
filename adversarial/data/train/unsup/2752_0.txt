This place is still hit and miss. Remember the therapists are students and you are paying cheap rates for them to practice or earn their experience hours on you. Sometimes I get a green student with less than 10 massages, but I've also had a few that was close to graduating. \n\nAnother thing to note is if you go on the 2 for 1 weekends, the wait could be at least an hour depending on what time you and your friend show up. \n\nIn the summer, it's more uncomfortable because they blast thenAC and its freezing under that thin sheet they have over you.
