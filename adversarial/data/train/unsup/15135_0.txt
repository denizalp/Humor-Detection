Bolt is within walking distance of The Drake Hotel (which I adored) and is great if you need your fix of green smoothies and drinks. The staff here is super friendly and I didn't get a chance to check out their solid food. What I appreciated most about BFB is their willingness to accommodate dietary needs including my allergens of coconut and almond. Might not seem like a big deal to note; however, many sites use coconut and\/or almond milk and don't offer alternatives.\n\nI was very open about it being my first time and they were so kind to walk me through their ordering process and give some insight. They also sell a particular brand of cold-pressed juices which had me craving for more as I left the city. The best one was the activated charcoal cold-pressed juice for those crazy nights you need to recover from.\n\nWhen I'm back in the neighbourhood I will definitely be swinging back!
