Friendly Service, Good Food, Family Owned and Operated \n\nI got a Groupon and thought we would make the journey to check this place out. We were greeted warmly by members of the owner's family. The son who is super attentive and genuinely welcoming helped us select the proper menu items to satisfy our hunger.\n\nI had the chorizo beef breakfast and it was a tasty treat that left me nice and full and ready for a nap!\n\nThe coffee is self-serve and taste good, but maybe drinking several cups of it might've been a bit much for my stomach mixed with the char easel. LOL. That's totally my fault though for thinking that coffee is water and downing it when I'm thirsty.\n\nWhen you're pulling up you could almost not even notice this place. As the exterior isn't anywhere near as inviting as the interior.\n\nStop by and give them a chance and your stomach will be glad you did.
