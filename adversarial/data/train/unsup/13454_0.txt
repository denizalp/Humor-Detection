Someone told me that Holsteins is the best burger in Vegas. Yes, the burgers are delicious, but no, I do not believe this place is the best.\n\nBeing a HUGE fan of burgers, I've been to many burger joints and restaurants, and have been searching for the perfect burger. Holsteins was pretty damn good, but not the top of the top. \n\nI ordered the campfire s'mores shake, which is the most amazing shake I have ever had. The alcohol in the shake was very subtle, and the shake was just.. perfect. no other words.\n\nThe lobster mac and cheese- pieces of lobster with mac and cheese and truffle oil. As a big fan of truffle oil, this dish was perfect for me. So far, so good.\n\nThen the burgers- the gold standard and the billionaire.\nI hate blue cheese, so had only regular cheddar cheese with the gold standard. It was a good burger, the ingredients were paired well and I was satisfied.\nThe billionaire burger- wgayu and foie gras- was ok. Because foie gras was banned in California, it was a must that we got that burger. However, the burger was a bit dry, and did not meet up to par. \n\nOn the other hand, service was up to par, the lady was very nice and came around to check up on us often. I would definitely come back for Holsteins for the shakes, that was the highlight of the meal. For Vegas standards, this place is decently good, although I expected something better.
