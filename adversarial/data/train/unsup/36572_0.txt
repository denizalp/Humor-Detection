It was a toss up between here and Shake Shack across the street. Once we found out this place is only in New York and Vegas, we decided we out to give it a try! \n\nI love that I'm not confused the minute I walk in. The menus clearly show you how to order, and the descriptions are fool-proof. We went with the classic Blue Ribbon chicken sandwich, and the tenders for the kids. I also got 2 extra pieces of chicken leg and their house salad. \n\nDon't waste your time with a salad at this place! I should've gotten 2 more pieces of chicken and skipped the salad. Not sure what I was thinking ordering a salad from a place known for their fried chicken, but that was my mistake. It's not that the salad was horrible, just nothing amazing. All of the attention should have been on the chicken, and whatever fantastic seasoning they put on it. The fries are fantastic! Not too salty, just right and they have a crunch to them... so delicious but frustrating as it's easy to just sit there and devour waaaay too many. \n\nWe want to give this place another try in the near future. My husband loved their sauce but was very intrigued by the mix of other sauces on the table, there was just no more room in our bellies for more. Only other thing we didn't care for was the coleslaw, would like to sub that out for something else next time around.
