It's been a long time since we visited our old favorite. This is a mom and pop and daughter and friends greasy spoon. Nothing fancy and that's the charm. Food is fast and fresh. If you are looking for an old school diner for breakfast or lunch this is the place. This is a hole in the wall that exudes a family's love to feed the neighborhood. Bring cash, cause it's cash or wash dishes. Coffee's hot and the ice tea has my favorite crushed ice. Did I mention it's reasonably priced too. We'll be back!
