Quite interesting place. This is legitimately a gelato place in the wall. Keep your eye on the gelato or else you'd walk right by it. \n\nTheir scoops are quite large. I had the strawberry with the cheesecake flavour and it tasted great. It's not too sweet but retains the flavour quite well. My medium bucket was loaded and I spent a good 5 minutes keeping the gelato under control. \n\nReasonably priced, usually a decent line outside, the beats are poppin on the boombox out front. This is a cute gelato joint and not a bad date idea.
