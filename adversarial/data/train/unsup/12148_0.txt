Hakkasan is cray. Cray good. \n\nFirst, let's start with their cocktails. I am not a big drinker, so it was so nice and refreshing to see non-alcoholic cocktails on the menu.  The one called Eden was absolutely delicious -- rose, black grapes, lychee juice....yummmy. I think I am actually going to try to make it at home in LA myself.  I told the bartender to keep them coming (like, I said, cray. I was getting cray with the non-alcoholic cocktails, y'all).\n\nOur dinner ended up being about 25 people, so I didn't order for myself. Someone ordered and I just ate..and ate....and ate...well, you get the picture.  The fried dim sum platter was excellent -- the duck was my favorite out of the dim sum.  Scallops in mango\/chili sauce were also good, but I kept going back to the fried stuff. \n\nAs for veggies, we only ordered the sugar snaps, and I would have liked to try something else...like the lotus root, that looked amazing.  Sugar snaps were still good if you like sugar snaps. I mean, who doesn't?\n\nThe Wagyu beef was really incredible. If you aren't used to the heavy marbleization, then it may be a bit of a shock at first, but don't worry.  You'll love it. Delish.  My favorite meat was the black pepper ribeye in merlot....so so so good. A must try.  We had other dishes that I didn't even get to try because there was so much food on the table, but everyone was raving about every single dish, so I don't think you could go wrong.\n\nAs for dessert, the coconut pudding was pretty incredible.  We kept calling it paradise in a cup.  We also had the black sesame chocolate one, which was good, but the coconut pudding was better. Loved it.\n\nThen we went to the club for bottle service. They walked us all the way in and made sure none of us got lost. I was really happy to have a place to sit because this place is crowded.  So fun and really what Vegas is all about --- amazing food and getting cray.
