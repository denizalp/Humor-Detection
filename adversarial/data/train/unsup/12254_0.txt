BE AFRAID OF MAKING AN UNWISE DECISION\n\nThis complex is a giant head ache.  Not worth the cheap price.  If you decide to live here expect the following:\nTwo faced management and employees. \nLousy attitudes and service\nConstant Dirty pools\nClosed pools\nForced closed pools\nScary Hot tubs...have not put a toe in one ever!\nDrug activity and Swat, attacks\nDented scratched or theft of vehicle..pick at least 2\nHORRIBLE Maintenance\nNo timely response to any maintenance issues\nDo not let the pictures fool you (they painted,cleaned that day, and i have never even seen grass like that)\n\nThis complex was Alegria ,check those reviews as well.\n\nHey Barron (Property Manager), when are you going to learn that customer service, maintenance and community communication are key.  Probably just change the name and paint over the holes.
