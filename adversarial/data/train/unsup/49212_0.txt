I'm not sure who others have spoken to, but the lady that answered the phone to take our order tonight was pleasant and helpful. We eat mostly gluten free and she was able to use the chicken breast without the breading for our combo meals. The house rice is really good (it has chicken, shrimp, and pork in it), the orange chicken was great, my husbands general tso was very good and my sons sweet & sour chicken was good. I would've liked more vegetables in the combo meal, but it was a good size portion. The crab Rangoon were very good, although a bit on the extra oily side. The egg rolls were just ok. My husband commented that it's probably the best Chinese we've had since we moved to az. They said it would be 40 minutes to deliver and it was here in 20.\nI have zero complaints and would totally eat here again.
