Free show and the kids enjoyed it, not bad for your typical Vegas tourist trap.\n\nThe family and I arrived 25 minutes before the show began and managed to get a good view. We all enjoyed the fire plus heat, the cool lights, and the sound effects of the volcano. \n\nNext time you are walking by The Mirage with a drink in your hand and have some time to kill, check out the Mirage Volcano for a free light and fire show.
