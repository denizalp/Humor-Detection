I loved it! It's so convenient to get to, especially if you can ride public transportation, because it's right in downtown Pittsburgh, so you don't need to pay for parking if you do that or find a good street spot instead of paying for parking.\n\nWe had to be buzzed in, otherwise we may have missed it, if not for the sign lol. Once inside, you're lead to the main office room where you pay and sign in. I got a great Groupon for it too, so look for those. \n\nOnce inside I started clocking everything in the main room. The time on clocks, what's on the walls, etc.. Little was I aware that we were to go to the game room, which plays out like a Sherlock Holmes mystery. It's a one hour adventure against Prof. Moriarty. Ben (one of the workers) was in the room with us to help along if we needed it and earned it (no spoilers on how you get hints). \n\nI suggest playing with a group of four or five. I believe it goes up to 10 players per game, but I would suggest 4 or 5 at most. You have to work together as a team and too many people means too many opinions and not enough delegation can be assigned. At least that's my opinion based on doing this as my first escape room. That's the only reason I gave it a 4 star review, because I have nothing to compare it to.\n\nI really enjoyed it, except we were SO close it beating to game and should have used our clues earlier!\n\nI strongly suggest checking it out. I think is a great starter room, and they plan to make another I think. I really hope they do. Very entertaining!
