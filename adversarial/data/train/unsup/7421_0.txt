I find the high ratings for this place to be completely baffling. Maybe I came in on a bad night, you know, someone being off their game. But, I think 2 stars is pretty generous if you ask me, why? This was probably the worst bubble tea i've ever had. Ever.\n\nI was in the area and was checking around for some new bubble tea places that were closeby. After seeing the high ratings, I decided to check it out. The inside of the store is pretty nice. It's clean and well maintained. Things started to go downhill after ordering a bubble tea.\n\nLarge Milk tea w boba and egg pudding and caramel- Let's start with the boba. It was not well cooked. It was mushy on the outside and hard in the middle. Definitely disappointed. The egg pudding was ghastly. It was way too soft. By the time it gets sucked through the straw, it disintegrates into a cottage cheese like texture. I almost wanted to puke. The milk tea had 0% tea flavor, it might as well have been water. And finally the cherry on top would be the caramel. They use the Torani brand caramel syrup. Yes, the same caramel syrup they use at Starbucks to flavor their drinks. I mean, come on. It was terrible.\n\nIt should have been 1 star but I gave them an extra star because the total was 4 bucks with the yelp check in offer. But, not coming back.
