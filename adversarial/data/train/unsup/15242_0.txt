Came here a few days ago. I am sorry, but besides the fact that the owner actually came onto Yelp and laid into someone for their OPINION, which really just bothers me....the food here is EH. \n\nI had the Ravioli and my hubby had the Pizza with the sun dried tomatoes. YUCK! Mine was ok, but the portion was smaller then I expected. We were in AZ to look at homes and what got me in here was \"baking co.\" I was hoping for some delicious deserts. Not my type of food basically. I think the decor is cute enough, but the waitress lagged, and how many times does one need to ask for a glass of water? Sorry Amy, but service is key in these tough times.
