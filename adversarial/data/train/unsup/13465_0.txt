The Gladstone is an uber-chic hotel. Each room has a different theme, from things like one that looks like something my 13-year-old self would have adored to cool cat graffiti. But, as with all cool, big city hotels there is premium on space so the rooms are pretty tight. Mine was barely big enough for a queen bed, two nightstands and an odd, small table that hosted some snacks. And while I appreciated the quaintness of the elevator it is a disadvantage that you can operate it yourself, especially when it comes to checking out at 6 am and carrying your suitcase down three flights of stairs.\n\nHowever, the staff is the nicest. They may actually be the nicest people in Toronto so points for that. And free coffee on each floor until 10 am is super rad. Given that and the good location and reasonable prices I'd totally stay here again.
