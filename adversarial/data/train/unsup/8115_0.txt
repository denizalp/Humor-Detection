Not my favourite bar in town, but the people I've gone with like it and I've heard a lot of weird stories of the things that go on there. Lets just say there are ways for girls to get in without paying the $10 cover charge....\nAnyway, it tries to be a more upscale place with a bunch of bars mixed around the large floor and upstairs. You can't get in without dressing up a bit, though and I'm not sure I like that. But a lot of others do and I suppose it keeps drifters out.\nBoth times I've been there, people have been raving about the dj, so if you like that kind of dance\/hip-hop thing, this is your place. The only entertainment I got out of my last visit there was a girl throwing a drink on my friend and then another girl asking for his phone number shortly thereafter. That's not classy, is it??? Sometimes even creeps can dress up....
