I took my puppy here for her first groom and I made a wonderful choice! Cindy and her husband are just fantastic. I recommend them to anyone I can. I picked up my fur baby about an hour after I dropped her off. She was clean, trimmed, adorable with her bows and so happy! I love how she wasn't kept in a kennel; when I walked in she was watching the other groomers and wagging her tail at the dogs walking by. Thank you all so much again for your TLC!
