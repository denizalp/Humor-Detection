Despite the reviews, I thought I could make this work. I read all their rules, fees, and guidelines and figured I'd give them a shot. I thought that this may be do-able for a quick little weekend getaway.\n\nI made our reservations for a little weekend trip to another state. The fares are astoundingly low. They are upfront bout letting you know that the price only includes the seat and the gas for the plane. But even after choosing certain options, our tickets were still fairly low, so we bought the tickets.\n\nWell, here it is, roughly 12 hours before our departure time and the flight has been cancelled! Very disappointing! So I call Spirit to find out about refunds on cancellations. The recording say to take care of it online or you will (wait for it) be charged a fee. Well, I go online and they will not refund your money. They will only issue you a credit....and that credit is only good for 60 days! What if I'm not traveling in the next 60 days?? \n\nWell, after 1 hour and 23 minutes on hold, I finally had a chance to speak to a Spirit representative. At first, they tried to get me to take a 60 day credit, but, after some \"spirited conversation\" (see what I did there?) , they agreed to refund me my money. There was no attempt to offer a different flight or make some other arrangements. I understand they can't control the weather, but I just feel like more of an effort could have been made to come to a more satisfying resolution.\n\nI am at least happy to get my refund. I may even attempt to use them again one day. They are still better than United lol\n\nBut for now it is still..\n\n2 stars.\n\nI have experienced better.
