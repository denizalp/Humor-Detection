DAS was truly awful to work with.  They try to be very professional upfront prior to getting your order but when it gets to the 15th day and you are supposed to have your vehicle at your door only to find out it never left the original drop-off terminal they act as if there is nothing they can do and are rude to deal with.  No urgency whats so ever.  Awful to deal with--moving is difficult and I would recommend NOT using this company as they dint care about customer service....
