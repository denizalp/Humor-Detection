I Frickin' LOVE this place!!!!! \nAside from most of the the Scottsdale bars this place is nothing like them, and that's a good thing!!!\nEverytime I go there I have a blast. The people there are a good mix Although yes there can be the occational group of doush bag guys and fake hair, fake boobie girls there too. But for the most part it's just really cool place for genuine people that aren't into the whole Snottsdale scene to go hang out. \nThe bartenders are great. Funny and Cocky just the way I like 'em! \nAnd Hello......I almost forgot to mention!!! They have BIG beers there!!!!\nOh yeah, and the Wheel O' Shot's, Kinda scary!!! \n\nThe only thing that kind of sucks about the place is that it's sooo small.\nThe bathrooms are small, the patio outside is small, and they even have a guy that works there that's small. \nBut who cares because......they've got BIG BEERS!!!! WooHoo!!!
