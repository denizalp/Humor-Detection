There's nothing better than when the reality of a brand new spot not only lives up to it's pre-opening hype, but surpasses it. So it was with Tender.\n\nPart of the \"Tender\" name comes from the establishment's emphasis on BAR. Six high profile, named bartenders have created spot-on cocktails that not only shine, they exceed all expectations. Each bartender (startender?) has created his or her own spin on classic cocktails or else has upped the ante by coming up with entirely new creations. What's in store for you in the cocktail department upon your first visit?\n\nDo NOT miss the Nathan Luchansky-created Once Upon A Honeymoon with ginger-infused apple brandy and blood orange marmalade. Despite what you may think, it is not too sweet at all. It is just right.\n\nSean Rosenkrans created a delightful pastis-kissed, non-blue curacao creation called  Death in the Allegheny. Served over crushed ice, one of our group declared it tasted like a \"Good n Plenty snowcone.\" Yaya's Snowcones on the Northside never served a flavor that GOOD!\n\nCraig Mrusek (Dr. Bamboo), who specializes in Tiki drinks, came up with a cocktail named Nilsson. There was some discussion around the bar about it being inspired by Harry Nilsson of the \"Put the Lime in the Coconut\" fame. This was another crushed ice delight that hit all the right coconut, lime and rum island notes without being overly sweet. As Nilsson sang, it was no problem to \"drink it all up.\"\n\nThe last cocktail sampled this particular evening was Marie Perriello's Hemingway's Mistress. Made with smoky mezcal, Luxardo marachino liqueur, grapefruit juice and lime, it was simple...but so much more than the sum of all it's parts. It's easy to see why Hemingway might have had a fling with this tart little number!\n\nThe kitchen draws on some regional cuisines of the U.S. to feature on the food side of the menu. Look for specialties from the South, Northeast, West (of here), Pennsylvania, and (okay, not a region) Classic Americana. If there's shrimp n grits on the menu, that will always be my order. Bonus, it was gluten-free. \n\nThe plating of two round grits cakes and two head-on shrimp was a vision in simplicity. Keep in mind, these are small plates, not full size entrees so servings are small and shareable. Well, if you want to share and not keep all that deliciousness to yourself alone.\n\nThe hubby ordered Beef on Weck and got 2 small slider-sized portions of perfectly cooked beef slices on those beautifully seasoned buns. And no, he didn't share either. We did share a plate of crispy potato chips with aioli to dip the chips. The aioli was the only negative of the evening...we couldn't remember what the menu had said it was and certainly couldn't identify the flavor except to say it was bland and weird. Skip the aioli, but get the chips!\n\nOh...that other \"Tender\" meaning? Legal tender. Tender Bar & Kitchen is housed in a former bank so the double entendre of \"tender\" works on both the \"bar\" and \"legal\" levels.  If it sounds like I focused on the cocktails, you are correct. While the food was very, very good, it's the cocktails that will keep me bouncing back. Like a rubber check? (Sorry, couldn't resist a last cheesy bank reference.)
