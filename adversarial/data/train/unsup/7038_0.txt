Fact: Kiehl's is a gateway drug. If I were you, I'd be wary of even walking through that front door, because once you claim one of their products as your own, you'll never settle for anything else. And with only one Kiehl's (as far as I know) in all of Toronto, it's a dangerous addiction to have. \n\nSome evidence...\n\nThe \"Supremely Gentle Eye Makeup Remover\" is the only makeup remover that will ever touch my eyes. It's a lotion-based makeup remover, unless some of the grotesque oil-based removers out there that leave your face greasy and necessitate tugging. It's smooth, easy on your delicate eye area and doesn't smell weird. I wear dramatic eye makeup most days and this gets all of it off in a snap.\n\nMore evidence...\n\nThe \"Creme de Corps Soy Milk & Honey Body Polish\" is the only scrub I'll ever use. Once you use this scrub, any other exfoliating scrub will seem too gritty, dry or wimpy for your calluses. This is the real deal - it gives you an unbeatable scrubdown and it smells like honey. Oh, and it has jojoba oil in it, which is essential what the sub-species of Humans  With The Softest Skin On Earthâ„¢ swear by. I've tried other scrubs from Aveda, Philosophy, etc. and I always come back to this one because it just gets the job done, pure and simple.\n\nOK fine - a third piece of evidence...\n\nAre you using eye cream yet? And if not, why not? You know you should be, if only to start preventing those pesky signs of aging. The \"Creamy Eye Treatment with Avocado\" has a really unique texture and a small container of it, while a little pricey, will last you forever because it goes on really thick. The only thing that could make it better would be SPF 30. \n\nWhen you visit, make sure Zach's working. You'll be able to spot him because he'll be jamming to Lady Gaga, Britney Spears or Kylie, and he'll rush up to you and say \"Oh my god - have you TRIED the new [fancy, convoluted product name that of course you didn't know about but are like, so ready to try like this very instant] yet??\" You'd think Zach was a descendant of the original founders of Kiehl's back in the 19th century; he just knows everything about Kiehl's and its products to a terrifying degree. \n\nThe store sometimes has special makeover nights and product launches, so get on their mailing list so that you'll get invited to them. Another win about Kiehl's is that they're very generous with their product samples, and some of them are good enough to last you months of sampling. It's nice to be able to try stuff before you buy, especially since they have a pretty massive arsenal of products to offer.
