My friends in Cleveland are HUGE fans of this place. I was really glad that I got the chance to check it out while I was there. It's a really nice atmosphere that seems sophisticated, but its still a casual dining place. The servers are really friendly and great. The food is delicious, portions are great and the price is fantastic.
