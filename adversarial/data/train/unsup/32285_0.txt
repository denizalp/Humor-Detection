DO NOT COME HERE FOR THE SPA! The hotel itself deserves at least 4 stars. Comfy rooms with patios, and the staff is extremely friendly and service oriented. I especially have to give props to the valet parking guys for being so friendly and offering cold bottled water at every encounter during the hot summer heat. Now onto the so called \"SPA.\" Horrible! If you are going to have \"Hotel & Spa\" in your advertised name and charge $125+ for a 50 minute (not even a full hour) massage, try to make sure it is worthy. Here... it is not! Worst massage I ever had (and I have been to many resorts). The \"masseuse\" did nothing but rub our extremities and plead for gratuities based on their familial situation and personal monetary needs. NO relaxing music, NO cold or hot plunges. NO amenities except a nasty steam room in which you can catch any desired disease you want. Ugh... waste of money even with a Groupon or whatever else they offer you to entice you to this poorly run joke of a \"SPA.\" Shame on parent company Marriott for letting this shameful \"SPA\" exist with \"massage therapists\" who I doubt are even certified to practice. I would guess they just hired these people based out of need, and not on their ability to make people relaxed and perform qualified massages. And the facilities.... well a so-called \"Relaxation Room\" does not a \"SPA\" make. Anyways, besides that whole rant... great hotel and awesome location in Glendale, Arizona next to the football stadium. If they just improve their \"SPA\" and\/or remove it from their name so as not to mislead the public, I would give a more positive review.
