Found this little gem via Yelp and did not disappoint at all!  It's a very informal place with delicious food!\n\nOur server was very friendly and she replaced our dirty plates and utensils several times when new food came out. Nice touch. \n\nAfter reading the reviews here, we ordered the meatballs (one of the best meatballs I've tasted with great bone marrow sauce), pork belly (melts in your mouth), foie gras mousse (only knock was the bombolini was a little hard), grilled octopus, and lamb carpaccio (fantastic). The food lived up my expectations and so good!\n\nThe drinks were just as tasty and refreshing too. Not the cheapest place ($111 before tip) with 5 small plates and 2 drinks each. \n\nDefinitely try this place out when you are in downtown Madison!
