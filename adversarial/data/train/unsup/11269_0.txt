I'd probably really give this a 3 1\/2 stars but since no halfsies they get a bump up. It's a solid meal here every time we come.  I love Chilean sea bass and it's delicious here- I'd recommend preparing it simply grilled because it's so flavorful if there were any sauces on it - it would mask how delicious it is on it's own.\n\nI love that Mitchell's is on open table so you can reserve a table quickly and easily.  They also are part of the Landry's group of restaurants (Mitchell's, grand concourse, joe's crab shack, McCormick and schmick and Morton's are all a part of it) and they have a rewards type program and on your birthday they give you $25 toward your meal!   \n\nService is good, fresh seafood, nice wine list and close to my house -so a thumbs up!
