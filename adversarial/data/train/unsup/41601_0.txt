On Keto, i avoid carbohydrates and sugars, and like to load up on fats, moderate protein, and good carbs, like fiber found in veggies. Bread and butter was brought to my table, while i did not consume the bread, i have to say the butter was delicious! I started with an appetizer,  the seared ahi tuna, which was a tad overcooked, but well seasoned-it was delicious. While the rice paper was a nice touch, it was also easily removable, and I set aside both the paper and the beets Frank G(my server), recommended the Lamb and scallops, and instead of couscous, i was able to substitute with broccolini . The lamb was cooked to medium rare, as requested, well seasoned, and the fat content was beyond my expectation. The scallops were cooked tender, with a slight crispness on the outside, and well seasoned. The broccolini, was crisp and no overcooked, which provided the ideal fresh vegetable to go perfectly with my meal. Service was impeccable, and staff made sure to keep the beverages filled. I do not recall, once having to ask for anything. Overall, the experience was great, food was tasty, and the ambiance made for an exceptional experience. I would highly recommend this establishment to anyone staying in the area.
