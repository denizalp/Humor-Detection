Okay....let's not get too lovestruck here people. Went to the King Street location. The reality is that you're paying 8 dollars for a burger that is freshly grilled to order on a bun that you'd pick up for any ol' BBQ in your backyard and toppings that are pricier (avacado\/rosemary mayo) but no means quality. The fries are average at best and the rings are good (whole rings with a solid non-greasy breading). \n\nOverall, a combo (burger\/rings\/drink) will run you $13 dollars. The burgers aren't really gourmet (the meat is run of the mill) but it does replicate that hearty fresh backyard burger that perhaps few Torontonian's get to experience anymore. If you're in the right mood and craving a hearty burger, you've come to the right place. But don't give them any \"best\" burger titles.
