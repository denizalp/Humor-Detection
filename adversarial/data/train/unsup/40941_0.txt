true to form, i never plan but we were lucky enough to get reservations at spa lamar on short notice! \n\nupon entering, it wasn't my typical spa experience. it felt a bit small and cramped. we were promptly and warmly greeted by heidi (owner?). she was extremely nice and took us on a tour of the establishment before leading us to the dressing rooms. we quickly got into our robes and realized that we had a about an hour before our first treatment. we spent the the time by the pool-it was quite small, it made me feel like i was in a backyard pool at a friends house but it was still nice and relaxing. the sitting room was well equipped with lots of cushy chairs and ottomans-perfect to put your feet up and just veg out before a treatment. they have both a hot sauna and a steam room, both being extremely relaxing-with fresh chilled towels waiting for you after a sit. \n\ni got a swedish massage from rachel and she was personable and nice. she was really in tune with making sure i not only enjoyed the massage but she was able to work out some trouble spots. having another hour before my facial, i spent some more time at the pool. being a seattle girl, i relished in having clear blue skies and blazing sun. the facial was excellent and left my face soft and clean. my only gripe came when i got my manicure, it was my very last treatment of the day. not only did my mani feel rushed but it was poorly executed. the manicurist was unsure of how to clean and properly trim my cuticles and i had to do it myself. pretty disappointing. \n\notherwise, it was a good experience and some cute eye candy from the front desk guy and jimmy the masseuse. i will come again and check out their first wed special the next time i'm back in scottsdale.
