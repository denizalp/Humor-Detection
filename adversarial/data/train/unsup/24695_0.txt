i've put off going to Melt for at least a couple years now. in truth I tried to go (before meeting Danielle) with coworkers when i worked for \"AT&T\" but the wait at the Lakewood location was near 2 hours so we went to Winking Lizard instead.\n\nanyway, since meeting Danielle she's wanted to go and I'd lost interest - wasn't particularly excited about paying so much for \"just a grilled cheese\" and that was basically my mistake. i thought of it as \"just grilled cheese\". so, when we went to Melt on Sunday for the first time you might imagine my surprise to find out this was not \"just grilled cheese.\" in fact, as I just mistyped, this is more like \"frilled cheese\". \n\nElliot, our server, was a nice enough chap and basically did just enough to get a near 20% tip - which i'll give to nearly any server who does the near basic work. i could have used a couple more check ins to find out if we needed drink refills or whatever but, all in all, it was fine.\n\nLet's talk about my sandwich though. I ordered the Cleveland Cheese Steak. Unlike other cheese steak sandwiches made with sliced rib eye, this was made with shredded\/pulled braised beef brisket. this combined with the rosemary onion aioli made this one of the best beef sandwiches I've ever tasted. the only issue I had with it was that the bread crust was grilled (then baked, i assume) until it was very hard and tough to bite\/chew through. minuscule issue, really. \n\nThe fries that came with the sandwich were overly seasoned. too much salt - way too much.\n\naside from the food, i liked the look of the place but it was really loud inside and very cold. Danielle went to the car to get her jacket. the menus are really cool. they paste the actual menu onto the backside of old LP records - which i thought was neat as hell. \n\nsince Sunday, I've already gone back to Melt - the new Fairlawn location this time, which is close to where i work - and i plan to go back again. I've now had the cheese steak and the Backyard BBQ (w\/ pork) but have to try a few others I have my eye on.
