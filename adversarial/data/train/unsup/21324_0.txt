Alright, ill keep this short n sweet. This is no 4 star resort. It's a \"blah\" hotel in a really good location, and a good price. They do have a pool, and they do have a shuttle that will give you rides within a 5 mile radius. The place has a restaurant up front called Papi-Chulos which has a comedy show. (I haven't seen it). Clarion is a good option for those who are planning on partying it up in old town, and don't want to worry about drinking and driving. \nOh- and there was no \"resort fee\" I hate when places sneak that in there!
