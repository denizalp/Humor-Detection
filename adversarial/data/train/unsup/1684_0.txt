BEWARE: Lied to sell me a car! \nThe car buying process was fine and as promised; however, they lied to sell me a car. We came in to see a few models, decided on one and found the one we wanted another store to be transferred. \nWe started the transfer process, asked if there were any issues or SMELLS, to which they replied no (lie #1), and paid to have it shipped. It arrived shortly and we came in to purchase it. We noticed an odd odor, which the salesman stated was the chemical cleaner they use (lie #2).\nShortly after owning the vehicle, the cleaner wore off leaving the distinct smell of smoke. We've since brought it in 4+ times to have it cleaned\/treated for smoke smell with no resolution. I've asked to be contacted by a manager several times but was not, so I called. I spoke with an Anthony\/Tony whom stated he was the head of ops\/oversees service. The kept circling around we've done everything we can do, you can bring it in to try again but he didn't believe there was anything different that could be done. he also stated I'd have to speak with the sales manager for any dissatisfaction with the \"expectation\" from the salesman. I asked to speak with the next level person as I felt this was unacceptable; he replied there was no one else (lie #3). \nI later called back asking for a general manager and spoke with Joe in Operations\/Sr Management whom confirmed he does oversee Anthony\/Tony.\nJoe said he'll look into the details, talk to his partner, the General Manager, and let me know.
