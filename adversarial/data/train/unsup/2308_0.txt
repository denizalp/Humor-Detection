Went to grand opening for Star Wars 3D. We live across the street at Optima so we've been anxiously awaiting this new theater to open. We were disappointed to learn this is not a \"full service\" theater like Ipic or AMC Esplanade. It's kind of a hybrid service model - yes they serve alcohol and a limited menu, but you need to buy the food\/drinks and carry them to your seat with you. \n\nSo we expected a busy opening night, got there early and went to the bar. There was a huge line to get food items so we asked the bartender if we could order at the bar which we did. He then told us we had to get in that giant line to pick up our food when our name was called. This turned into a 40 minute ordeal with half of our party missing the start of Star Wars 3D. Food items were coming up and they were yelling out names, and then the items were sitting there getting cold. People eventually started grabbing items that weren't theirs. Once the food was ready, it was difficult to carry back through 2 sets of doors into the theater - we asked an employee to open the door and he refused until we practically begged him. Then he walked away without opening the second set of doors. Ugh.\n\nOnce inside the theater you realize that while the recliners are very comfortable, they are not designed with any sort of table or surface to put your food items on besides a drink holder in the arm rest. So now you are trying to balance your food items on your lap. Ackward.\n\nThe other issue is the very limited and unimaginative menu. Corn dogs, hot dogs, pizza, nachos - that kind of stuff. Meh.\n\nLooks like we'll be heading back to AMC Esplanade. Wuff!
