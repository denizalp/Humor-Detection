Had I written this review about 8 years ago, I would have happily given this establishment a 5\/5 review. Unfortunately, times have changed and the fairly recent revamping of the menu, cooking styles, and value has fallen short in recent years. \n\nToday my Dad was visiting and he wanted to take the kids to lunch. He had several gift cards to Romano's Macaroni Grill so off we went. We were greeted at the door by a very friendly hostess and seated immediately. If this review was strictly based on the service, I would have no problem giving them a 5\/5. Unfortunately, the food quality alone takes this review to the 3\/5 mark. \n\nThe Rosemary bread and oil accompaniment was delicious as always. The service by Sandra was excellent on all levels. Quick to refill drinks and quick to bring additional bread as requested. \n\nThe appetizers and main dishes, however, left much to be desired. My dad ordered two appetizers: one of stuffed mushrooms, which appeared to be extremely greasy and possibly frozen; and other of Calamari which was an extremely small serving and though tasty, were a bit over-fried. \n\nFor my main course, I had the $10 3 course lunch special. It included a single triangle of fried cheese, a small Caesar salad, and a main dish which I picked the Fettucini Gorgonzola. Though it was okay, the cheese sauce was layered in oil and dripped off each piece of pasta, leaving me with a sunken stomach and an overall bloated feeling. \n\nIt really seems like the quality of the food has taken a strong dive in recent years and it is because of the food quality alone that I must give them a 3\/5.
