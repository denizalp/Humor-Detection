Stopped in one morning randomly, had heard good things and decided to give it a try.  Had no idea that the Christmas Parade was about to pass by, no wonder there were so many people standing around!  Our 4 year old hears the sirens and realizes Santa is coming, but we just placed our order.  Uh oh.  The staff puts our order on hold, and tells us to go outside to see Santa.  We watch the parade for a few minutes, and when we go back inside, our order hits the table the same time as us.  \n\nI know there is a wait for tables most mornings, so it was especially nice of them to be so accommodating and child-friendly.  We have been back may times since, and the food is always amazing and the staff is just the best.
