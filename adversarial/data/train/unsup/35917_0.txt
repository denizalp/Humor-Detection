Love the view -the quiet and nice large rooms.  I've been to a bunch of Vegas hotels and this is my favorite.   I like the strip views so rooms like 916, 1016, 1116  and similar numbers are my fav.   The pool is friendly and it goes under part of the building to get shade.   I didn't try the restaurant- so can't comment.
