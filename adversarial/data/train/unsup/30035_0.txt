Visited for first and last time recently.  Service was poor.  Received a beeper and went to bar to wait for our table.  Having already heard one customer complain that his beeper didn't go off, my husband went back to hostess stand to let them know that our party was waiting at the bar.  Twenty-five more minutes and he went back to see how much longer for a table and was told that they paged us about 15 prior.  Beeper could not have worked because I was too hungry and was staring at it the whole while.  Finally seated and given menus. Another five minutes and we meet our waiter.  Ordered appetizers and entrees.  At least fifteen to twenty minutes before the appetizer arrived with no checking in by our waiter.  Appetizer was the onion strings and jalepeno stack.   The food at the top of this pile was pretty tasty.  The onion strings were obviously, however, taken out of the deep fryer and immediately plopped on the plate without draining as anything under the very top was just a pile of greasy goo.  Husband had fried shrimp and fries and it was about the standard frozen food dropped in a deep fryer fare.  I had the Margarita Grilled Chicken and I really can't describe how oddly yucky it was.  It was  on a bed of white rice with black beans, which was bland but not bad for what it was.  The chicken, however, had the strangest taste and texture.  It was like you had ordered a ham dinner and received Spam instead.  I think that's the last of Chili's for us.  For the same money the food at Applebee's is so much better.
