I had heard about this place on Thrill List,, getting mentioned in both dim sum & chinese food for being one of the best in the country.  Boy, were they right.  We came here for dinner, in the mood for dim sum & were not disappointed.  Being dinner, the dim sum menu is limited, but still worth it.  The sesame shrimp rolls are crispy & coated with sesame seeds, filled with suculent shrimp.  The golden sand buns (steamed egg custard buns) are wonderful with a fresh bun & smooth sweet egg custard filling.  We also ordered some appetizers.  The pot stickers are crispy golden filled with a perfectly seasoned ground pork, cabbage, & ginger filling; perfect with a little rice vinigre drizzled over the top.  The vvegetarian egg rolls are crispy with a perfect vegetable filling; perfect with the well balanced sweet & sour sauce.  The pan fried seered shrimp & chive dumplings are wonderful with wonderful wrapper that is not doughy & perfectly pan fried bottom; the suculent & savery filling is excellent.  The hand made fried shrimp balls are wonderful with a crispy exterior & well seawsoned suculent interior.  For other desserts, not on the dim sum menu at nigyht, the sesame balls are sublime with a crispy sesame seed coated exterior & smooth red bean paste filling.  The service is friendly & attentive.  I can hardly wait to come back & try other items.  Round it off with a Ching Dao & you will not be disappointed.  Keep up the good work guys.
