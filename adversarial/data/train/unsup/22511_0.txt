They yell and act really excited when you come in! That was pretty sweet, if slightly awks. \n\nI love the interior - it's hip, like a... rustic... japanese... hipster... pub. I hope that paints the right picture. It's very woody inside, which was surprising, but I liked it. \n\nThe food was delish. Lots of fried stuff, which s always good. I had an udon bowl that was tasty, and the fried chicken bites appetizer (sorry, can't remember what it's called). A friend ordered the fried octopus balls, and though I generally hate seafood, I tried them, and I didn't mind them! My fellow diner lived in Japan for a while, and she gave the place two thumbs up. We were here for lunch, but seems like it'd be fun for a late dinner.\n\nPS: it took us like 5 minutes to find the door. I hope you fare better.
