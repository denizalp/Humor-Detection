Get this: It's darn near 1 AM in the mornin' and we're dahn in the Strip for some jagoff concert at the Altar Bar (you know, next to the McDonald's, across the street from where that Chinese place used t'be). My cousin, who been drinkin' whiskey and pop all night, he look over at me and ask, \"Djeat yet?\" Other than the dozen or so Arn Cities I been poundin' back (and that's not even countin' the pahr hahr before we left), I was thinkin' we'd polish off a mangled box of Mrs. T's (that I fit back together to put in the freezer with some gumbands) that I have back at my hahs. I hit 'im with the \"Nah, djew?\" and next thing you know we're aht at the Priman'i's gettin' some food 'n' at. I'm big on the double egg and cheese, but some people like that capp and egg and some people are more abaht other meats. Honestly, yinz can get whatever you want, it ain't gonna bother me much.
