Not often do you find a place with excellent service and amazing food. Our waitress Vanessa was on top of everything, if I needed anything I could turn around and she would already be on top of it. Jason also took time to make sure everything was going how it should, which of course it was. I will definitely be back and will highly recommend it to others. Since living in Vegas I've been to a lot of nice restaurants down on the strip and this place knocks it out of the park. I have nothing bad to say.
