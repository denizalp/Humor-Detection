I've never been a big shopper, but the last time I went, I was with some hardcore shopaholics.  While I typically spend most of my days sleeping near a pool, I spent my last trip between the shopping areas of Cesar's and the Bellagio.\n\nWhen shopping in Vegas, especially at high-end stores, one expects high quality products matched with high-end service.  I expect no less from a place like Tod's. \n\nGiven how empty it was when we visited, I expected better service. We found what we wanted, but because we had a long day in front of us, we asked if we could hold it and pick it up later in the day.\n\nWhen we returned, we found that the people at Tod's decided to sell the pair that we put on hold. There were no apologies, just statement.
