This place is always the place I would stop by whenever I am at Vegas. Their slushie doesn't taste like alcohol and syrup blended together with ice. \nIf you wanted to get a little drunk add in some shots. It's only a $1 for 151. That's such a good deal. \n\nPeach Bellini is always my favorite one. It's always so refreshing especially when it's super hot. \n\nStrawberry and mango mixed together is delicious too.
