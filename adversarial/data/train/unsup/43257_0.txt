Sweet hodo kwaja! \nI immediately popped one into my mouth after purchasing, expecting the same room-temperature pastries I had come to expect from the Christie street bakery. Little did I know, they were infused with piping-hot magmic bean paste! \nBut I was admittedly impressed with my scalding hot fresh cakes, consdering that this place is always empty, and they always seem to have a tonne ready made. \n\nAnyways, if you have a craving for fresh Hodo Kwaja, this place is around the corner from young and sheppard. check it out.
