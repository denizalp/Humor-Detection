They really need to work on their customer service. Very aloof staff! If my very patient mother has to go \"Hello? Excuse me? Anyone, please?\" to get so much as an acknowledgment from the staff, talk less of actual assistance, then you know there is way too much room for improvement. Even then, she still wasn't acknowledged much less attended to. After waiting awkwardly and wondering if we had fallen outside of the visible spectrum, we even left the store to check out other places and because she was travelling and we were short on time, we had to come back to the store for the item. I wonder if they even noticed. They get an F for service! Only ice can rock cold not humans.
