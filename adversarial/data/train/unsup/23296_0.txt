HORRIBLE, TERRIBLE, ABSOLUTELY THE WORST EVER!!!!! I've been an unfortunate patient to this facility since 1-01-16 and this is by far the most inept office ever. When I call I am put on hold for an average of 15 minutes or more and then they are notorious for just hanging up on you anyway after you have waited all this time.  If you leave your phone number so that you can be called back they don't return these calls as they say they will. Most of the time if you actually reach a person then it's their operator and she just takes a message and nothing comes of that either. I have been trying for almost a month now to get two referrals and when a man from the referral department, Brian finally gave these to me the referrals were no good as the provider didn't accept my insurance. So then Brian doesn't want to be bothered with me anymore so he sends my request for referral off to another worker, Janis in that department and I haven't heard back from her either. Today I went in person to their office to talk to someone in the referrals and I found that that is the only way to get anything accomplished as they can't hang up on you and tomorrow I will go back to their office to see if they have my referrals and I am going to try to talk with Dr. Hughes and make him aware of how poorly his office is being ran.  I don't think these doctors know how broken their office and referral department is.. I would change providers but can't now as I am paid up till the last day of Dec 2016 and then I will get new insurance with the new year and I will be so happy to be done with Md 24 House calls.  Do yourself a favor and find a different provider if you can.
