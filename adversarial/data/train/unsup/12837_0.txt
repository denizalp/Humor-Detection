Occasionally, we will make the rounds at Teppan restaurants, and this time around; we opted to give this place a try. We're not neophytes at this, so we always arrive with some reservations. \n\nFrom the moment we walked in, we were none too impressed with the greeting we received from the people whose job it is to welcome you with a smile. And make your first impression a memorable one. It was memorable alright - in a negative way! The greeting was cold and disinterested. Yes, there are two of us! We are sorry that we interrupted whatever you were doing to let you know that customers actually want to dine here this particularly evening - NOT!\n\nAfter being seated with another party, we were quite impressed with the cheerfulness and attentiveness of our server. She was very prompt and courteous as well. She actually did a great job of livening up the mood to get us ready for our Teppan chef.\n\nEnlivened, he was not. Our chef was dry and reserved. Either he was having an off day, a bad day, or this is his typical demeanor. Definitely not the kind of presentation we were expecting.\n\nAnd to top it all off, the food wasn't that impressive either. The chicken was definitely undercooked, and so were the vegetables. The rice was passable. The only redeeming quality was my wife's Kobe Beef steak. She indicated that it was done to her liking.\n\nAnd as we were leaving, we passed by reception booth, and received the same cold shoulder we got when we first arrived. It's no surprise that this place was more than 1\/2 empty on a Friday evening. Hopefully, they can endeavor to rectify these deficiencies.
