Very authentic spicy Mexican food. I always hang out on this place whenever my Costa Rican friends hit the town. My thought of the their best food would be Adovada Ribs with added cheese. I also like Shrimp Veracruz and Enchiladas with either Green and Red cheese. Have been eating sumptuous Enchiladas before we're introduced with Adovada Ribs.\n\nOne thing to note though, the service is moderate, don't expect great service. Service can be iffy at times dependent on the mood of the boss-girl, and hence impacting the server's mood as well, but so far we've been lucky, a server told us sometimes it impacts the food as well. \n\nWill be going there again (once my Costa Rican friend comes during their business visit).
