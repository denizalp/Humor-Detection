I've written a review about a different location, but was passing by and thought I'd stop in for a quick breakfast. The man working was very nice and told me about their current holiday special: spend $25 and get $5 free. Doesn't take much to convince me and I do like the menu here!\n\nThis location is a lot smaller than the one on Scottsdale- limited seating and decor is definitely lacking. I ordered the PB Acai bowl to-go. He clarified after ringing me up the PB not the Berry bowl and went to make it. When I got home I realized he gave me the Acai Banana Berry bowl. It was still great of course, but not what I had ordered. Regardless, still like this place and guess it was time to try something different. \n\nTry it out, but maybe check your oder before leaving!
