My first visit here was dinner with my foodie group. We were a party of 10 and were seated near the glass casing of cured meats. The atmosphere is open and cozy at the same time. I enjoyed the \"wall of herbs\" located on the northern wall. It looks like part of the d√©cor, but it has actual herbs such as parsley and cilantro. The washrooms are located in the hotel section of Hotel William Grey. I noticed there is a boutique, cafe and terrasse.  \n\nI ordered beet salad with goat cheese and the  sweet potato manicotti with a nice red pasta sauce. They were both light and fresh which is what I was looking for since I did not want a heavy meal. \n\nFrom the very start, we received excellent customer service. Our waiter, Maxime was extremely attentive, helpful and accommodating. We never felt rushed to finish our meal. The group ordered cocktails which they seemed to enjoy. In the end, Maxime brought our table complementary Prosecco which was a lovely gesture.
