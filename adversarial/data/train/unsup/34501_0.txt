Freska is a welcome addition to the Middleton\/Far West Side of Madison.  It's nice having an alternative to burgers.  \n\nThe menu is small with salads, pita sandwiches with gyro meat (lamb\/beef or chicken), kabobs (beef or chicken) and falafel.  The sandwich options also are offered as a platter with rice, couscous, or salad included.  \n\nI had the lamb and beef gyro to go.  It was very good and filling.  Service was friendly and very fast.
