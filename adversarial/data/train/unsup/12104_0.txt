This show is DIVA-licious!\n\nFrank Marino brought all the divas to us. Madonna. Gaga. Beyonce. Cher. Dolly. Diana. Tina. You name it, she was there. Ooooh, girl, and the crowd. There was a young woman in her early twenties crying with excitement to see the Brittney impersonator (and for the record, he killed it... he also was blowing kisses at my boyfriend which only made me slightly nervous because he was so damned sexy as Ms. Spears). Oh, and the older ladies seated in front of me? I'm still convinced they really believed that was Tina Turner. \n\nThe divas had me dancing in my seat with my arm around the older gentleman seated next to me. That man and I laughed and cried together and, at one point, had runaway feathers all over us. My favorite part of the night was when my new friend would turn to me and exclaim, \"My God, that looks just like Liza!\" And you know what? It did. \n\n\nThe next time you're in Vegas, you have to see this show. If you're anything like me, you'll turn to your boyfriend and excitedly shout, \"Who knew I loved Cher this much?!\" What can I say? I heart drag queens, the historians of pop culture. Oh, and the ballad at the end, \"What Makes a Man a Man?\" Heartfelt and incredibly touching. My new friend and I were crying our eyes out.
