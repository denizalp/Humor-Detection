This place is amazing in all aspects. The food is awesome, the staff are all friendly and helpful and the atmosphere is sleek and modern. \n\nThey also accommodate large parties and seem to handle the ordering very well. We were there for my cousin birthday party and fell in love after we tasted their fresh sashimi (only for dinner) the portion sizes are awesome because they are not too big and this lets you get to try a lot of dishes of their iPad menu. \n\nDefinitely a great place to take your parents are a date that likes to eat lol.\n\n4.6 stars from me!
