All Burgers are not created equal \n\nEverybody likes a good burger every now and then, and Phoenix has become saturated with burger joints but what make one burger joint stand out above the others?\n\nWhether it's the toppings, bun, patty size, or the way the burger is cooked.  A great burger needs that \"it\" factor; which separates it from all other burgers. Well, Premium Burger has the \"it\" factor. Everything at Premium Burger is fresh and made to order. \n\nIf you visit Premium come hungry because the burgers at Premium Burger are large. Not only are these Burgers large but they are flavourful, the buns are toasted perfectly,  and the condiments are delicious.\nOn this visit  I ordered the the caramelized onion burger and french fries. Everything was perfectly prepared, especially the fries, which were fresh, crispy, and serve piping hot and the burger had  just the right amount of sweet caramelized onions, sauce, and cheese, everything was delicious.\n\nIf you're looking for a fresh, delicious, grilled to order burger, give Premium Burger a try.
