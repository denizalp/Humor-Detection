This place was horrible. There were maybe two girls that were worth throwing cash at. They didn't climb the polls or do that many tricks. Also, I ordered two drinks and when I got home and checked my card there were two $100 charges on my card. Now either the drinks I ordered were $100 a piece or there is some messy business going on at this establishment. NEVER AGAIN.
