Ummm, do they really charge almost $20 for full-priced admission? That seems crazy to me! We took advantage of the groupon deal and I still didn't feel like I got a great value.\n\nThis was mostly like looking at large fish tanks with average sized fish for an exceptional home aquarium (or an aquarium store, for that matter). Then there's the grand finale, which is the ocean TUNNEL!!! Oooooohhhhhh, 20 feet or so where you get to see more of the same tank that you just saw from another angle. I'm pretty sure this is the only \"impressive\" display they had, and even it was lacking in many ways.\n\nFor starters, the tunnel was closed off for repairs when we tried visiting Sea Life a few weeks ago, so we thankfully decided to come back another time. Then when we came back today, I found that it was still not looking like tip-top condition -- we could see the black liner through the sand, for instance, and the top of the aquarium's water level is just barely above the glass.\n\nThis place didn't even capture much of my toddler's attention. His favorite part, I think, was the McD's-type play gym at the end of the tour, and I've seen better versions of those as well.\n\nNo thank you, Sea Life. As much as I initially thought this seemed like a silly idea, I am now convinced. We'll look at the fish on our next trip to the coast and feel better about the whole experience.
