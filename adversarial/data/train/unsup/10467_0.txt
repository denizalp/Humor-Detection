Never. Coming. Back. The manager\/owner is a total jerk. We had Groupons that expired and should've been good for the value paid ($46). We had a $65 tab, and he wouldn't accept our Groupon at all...for the value that they've already received. Never coming back to this horrible restaurant. Go to Texas de Brazil, WAY better! Only silver lining was our server, Rachel, who was awesome! You can do better, girl!
