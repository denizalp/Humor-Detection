I HATE giving Senor Taco a bad review. They have DELICIOUS food. I'm giving an extra star because of the food. The reason for two stars is that they rarely open on time. They say their hours open at 7am on Saturdays but this is the second week I was there at 7:20 or later and they still weren't open. I had to leave the last two weeks and find another place to eat. I understand the occasional 5 minute late opening but this is ridiculous.
