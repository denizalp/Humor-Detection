Let me start off by saying, I'll never be back to this location. I've been a regular at the Southern Highlands location for over a year now and I love it, what I can't understand is why there isn't any sort of consistency between the two restaurants. \n\nIn order to have excellent nigiri sushi you need to have excellent rice. Undercooked cold rice doesn't cut it. The fish is frozen which is fine because its an all you can eat but why does salmon nigiri look different then salmon in the rolls? Almost looks like it had freezer burn. When I mentioned that I was waiting for my x-treme orgasm (sashimi salad) after 35mins, the response I got was \"don't worry, its still coming\" unfortunately the lumpia never made it out at all. Having educated servers would be a big plus, when you order tamago and then say egg sushi to simplify and the server replies \"oooohhh I always thought that was a piece of cheese\" my confidence in the experience definitely doesn't grow. On top of that why does the tamago at xtreme sushi Southern Highlands look and taste completely different than the tamago here? Nothing makes sense at all.\n\nOverall the food is edible but below average, service is slow and mistake laden with below average product knowledge. They should probably burn this down and collect the insurance money, stick to the quality version in Southern Highlands.
