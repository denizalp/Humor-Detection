Yum!\n\nI used to stop by this bakery after school all the time! \n\nMy favorite thing to pick up was the Mango Danish! It always had the perfect consistency: light and crisp on the outside, smooth and custardy in the middle with perfectly ripened mangos to top it off!! I could not get enough!\n\nThe baguettes were also very delicious, crusty on the outside and deliciously chewy and moist in the middle! This was a perfect way to move on from ACE bakery baguettes! I do believe there were a few times when I bought a baguette sat in my car alone and polished the ENTIRE thing... on my own... yes it is that good...
