The only taco place I recommend to anyone coming to Cleveland in hopes of finding good Mexican tacos! The customization of the tacos allows every person to get to try something that they like! The salsa that is served is also incredible and I always get the stoner queso each time I'm there! As if the food choices weren't good enough, the margaritas there are phenomenal! One downside I have is that they don't allow happy hour when there are sporting events going on in the area which I'm not a huge fan of. Sometimes the wait times can be around an hour (or exceed that) which isn't ideal- but for how great the tacos are, it is understandable!
