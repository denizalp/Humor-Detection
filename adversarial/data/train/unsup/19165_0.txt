My 100th review is a tribute to \"street food\" - Tacos El Compita is in a strip center, and was fast and authentic.  We were limited on cash (forgot it was cash only in other reviews), but scraped together enough for a 5-taco plate (I got the juicy tongue\/lengua, and the boy had 2 beef, 1 carnitas and 1 pollo), a side of sliced avocado, and 1 Mexican coke (bf only drinks h2o).  The food was fast, the salsa bar very nice (radishes, whole raw jalepenos, pico, onions and cilantro, very spicy salsas - loved the green especially).  The tacos had onions and salsa on them, and my poor bf doesn't do spicy food too well, so he got the avocado to cool him down while I was dipping it in the green sauce!\n\nThis place is cheap and yummy, a solid bet.  I would definitely return when I have cash.  The salsa bar had cups with lids so if we hadn't been on our way to Popcorn Girl, I would've taken some green salsa home!  I ate only one taco due to our limited budget and the bf's big appetite, but next time I may try a torta (highly recommended by the lady in front of us).  The guy sitting right behind me was selling pirated CDs and peliculas :)  No one seemed to bite every time they walked in and he called CDs! Peliculas!  CDs! Peliculas!\n\nThe best part was watching my bf go to his car to get change and count out quarters and dimes to buy me the Mexican coke :)
