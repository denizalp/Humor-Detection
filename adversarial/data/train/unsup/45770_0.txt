Had the Soft Shell Crab sandwich today. $16 is a bit pricy for my taste but definitely worth the price.  The sandwich is huge, enough for 2 people.  The sandwich taste gd but if the crab cook a little longer on the fryer than it would be perfect. The fries is ok. The shocker is the coleslaw, it is amazing.
