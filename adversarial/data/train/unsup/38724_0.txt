In the cookie cutter world of big box stores we live in it is refreshing to get an experience where the entire store was committed to an exceptional customer service standard. At most hardware stores it seems like employees try to avoid you so they don't have to answer your stupid novice questions. I believe I counted 11 different employees at this Home Depot that actually asked if they could help me and my wife find something. The best part was the paint department where the nice gentleman explained us the differences between the brands of paints and help us select the correct finish for our room. I am so sad I don't recall his name because he was excellent. We live about 20 mins from this Home Depot but will continue to make the trip past many other hardware stores including other Home Depots to go back. Great work to the team that worked the store August 10th around 6pm.
