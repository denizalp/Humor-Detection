After suffering through years of so-so haircuts from hacks and crack addicts, I finally stumbled across Phil at Summerlin Barber Shop. Wow. What a d-i-f-f-e-r-e-n-c-e.\n\nUntil finding this gem, I had no idea the monthly ritual would become something I look forward to, instead of dreading. \n\nNo more noisy, crowded \"waiting\" areas. No more crappy \"what-the-hell-will-I-look-like-this-time\" hair-cuts. I make an appointment, get a great cut every time... and in an upscale private setting... Yes - I pay more... And guess what? I am HAPPY to.  \n\nPhil has my highest recommendation.
