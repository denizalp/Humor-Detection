One of my favorite wing spots just opened near my favorite library.   I am always in need of a great and awesome location to pick up food when I am headed to the library to read\/study.   This place just happens to be my all time favorite. \n\nBrand spanking new with my favorite lemon pepper wings and hand cut fries.   Order online or with the app.   Could life be any better?   I think not.
