Bless us oh lord and these, thy burgers, which we are about to receive from thy bounty. Make us ever mindful of the needs of our bellies through Burger's Priest, Amen.*\n\nI've eaten here once and I can't wait to get back. I've heard rumour that there are additional things on the menu too that aren't listed. I can only imagine that you need to get to a certain level of priest-dom before you can even see, let alone understand, these delights. If that is the case I'll be at this church as oft as possible until I understand thy ways.\n\n*Amazing place for a burger, grab one and some fries. Fries which are truly delish. Some of the best of both in the city. Worth the trip.
