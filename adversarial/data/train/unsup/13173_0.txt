I have to say, this place is pricey! Be prepared to spend. \n\nSoup - We had the soup of the day (cream of broccoli) and it was absolutely amazing! ($7)\n\nBeef tartare - to die for! You can also order this as a main course and they claim it's a bit bigger. Next time I would just order the main course version. ($15)\n\nShepard's pie - delicious, however, not that big a serving for the price ($24)\n\nFish and chips - absolutely GROSS!!!!! DO NOT ORDER!!!! The fries were soggy and tasted stale \/ old. The fish was super oily! I took a bite and the fat \/ grease \/ oil squirted out. I was so disgusted!!!! ($23)\n\nThey give you 1 bread per person! Lol .... I mean, it's all good but really? If i'm paying this much for meals I expect an entire bread basket of WARM bread!!! Lol  \n\nOverall - $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$\nIs it worth it? Not really \nWould I return? Just for the tartare - otherwise NO\nService - it's ok - nothing crazy
