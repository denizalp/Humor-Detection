Menchie's at Avondale is one of our favorite places to grab dessert! Don't forget that on Mondays, you can fill your tub to the brim for just $5. I love the fruit flavored yogurt for my base. Then, I top up with fresh strawberries, mango and kiwi. If I am decadent, I add cheesecake. I definitely love the syrup filled jelly bubbles. I occasionally indulge myself with caramel!
