The reason I come to Vera's nail is Trish. I have been using Trish for at least 5 years. I am sure based on the fact they are busy everyone is just as good. I recommend scheduling an appointment. They are pretty on schedule if you make an appointment. \n\nI am always satisfied with how my nails turn out. I usually get a regular mani unless I am going out of town then I get the gel. \n\nTrish will let me know if I choose the wrong polish!\n\nMy tip is if you have time at home, remove your gel polish before you come. Makes everything faster!
