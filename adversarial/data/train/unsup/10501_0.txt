Do I have to give it one star - It was so bad.  So so bad.  The worst show I have ever seen.  I had to laugh because I could not \"Believe\" it.  They state that \"The show is a fantastic journey, an out of this world roller-coaster ride into the subconscious of a man with magical powers\".  Magical??  There was very little magic, he made a few birds appear -  WOW!  And he was cut in half - AMAZING.  What type of journey are they referring to?  From where I was sitting I saw a few folks making a journey out of there before the show was even half over.  This show was all about his ego.  Criss tries to act and falls flat.  It was so very bad I don't know how they can recover. At the end Criss gives a speech about how you can work hard and \"Believe\" in yourself and you too could have a show in Vegas....Please, we all paid to see a show.  Not Criss stroking his ego.  MY GOD, had he really had this dream for 15 years?  That's sad...\n\nI was tempted to demand my money back but it was not the money I was upset about, it was my time.  That can never be recovered.\n\nThis show proves a few things:  Criss Angel needs to fire everyone around him telling him how great he is - this show will ruin his career.  WHO bombs this bad in VEGAS??  AND if your a magician, stick to what your good at.
