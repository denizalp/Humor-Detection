A deceptively large drugstore along 17th Ave. Shopper's is the kind of drug store when you want to get food, passport photos, and a new camera to go along with your prescription.\n\nThey've got a great selection of all your your bathroom and personal care needs. Great supply of drugstore level toothpaste, shampoo, soap and all that good stuff.\n\nIt's clean and comfortable during the day but  there can be some sketchy characters kicking around late at night. I've seen some guy run in, grab some headphones, book it around the store and run out with people chasing him. I think the staff does a good job keeping it safe feeling - just every now and then you get some suspicious characters lurking on 17th
