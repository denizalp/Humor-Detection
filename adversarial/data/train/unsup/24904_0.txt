Vegas.  I.  Hate.  You.  We'' make up soon.  Right now?  I.  Hate.  You.\n\nMastro's Ocean Club?  I love you.  No, really.  I actually LOVE you.  \n\nSo Vegas...  Why do I hate you?  I'll list the ways first.  \n\n-McCarron's Baggage Claim is vomit bad.  \n-Getting a Bungalow at Wet Republic is the most awesome idea ever.  The pain I felt the following day made me want to kick babies.\n-Losing my ATM card and having $2900 in attempted cash advances happen.\n-Losing a lot of money at Single Deck Black Jack on Thursday night.  You suck Caesar's dealers.\n\nSo Vegas....  Why do I still want to make up?  I'll list the ways now.\n\n-The Bungalow at Wet Republic.  Oh to be young and dumb again.  Act like ballers and drink our faces off like money didn't matter and Donald Trump was my bitch.\n-Taking the last $150 in cash I had due to losing said ATM and making 3 Card Poker my bitch for 8 hours after Wet Republic.  Baller status achieved again.\n-Caesar's upgrading our room to a suite after we collectively lost tons of money.  Then won double that back.\n-Finally, Mastro's\n\nYou see?  We were out there for a Bachelor Party.  Not just ANY Bachelor Party.  A Bachelor Party of Epic Proportions.  The kind you and your buddies talk about for decades.  Fourteen guys hell bent on reliving college memories from over a decade prior.  Fourteen guys that wanted to go out, make Vegas our bitch, and have the best time ever.  Almost all of this was achieved.  Except for the making Vegas our bitch part.  Vegas pimp slapped us all.  Hold me Vegas.  \n\nMastro's capped the trip off.  We decided to take the Bachelor to a great meal.  Mastro's rolled out the red carpet.  Complete with private room with a view.  No dancing girls.  Otherwise, it would've been a 6-star performance.  Still, overall, one of the Top 5 meals of my life.  Including my hometown Atlanta, NYC, Chicago, LA, and elsewhere?  \n\nSo what did I eat?  I know you're dying to know.  I had the Dungeness Crab Cocktail to start.  So they do this Dry Ice thing to add to the presentation.  It's cool and all.  I don't really need that stuff though.  The crab itself though?  Slap my mama good.  I remember one of my buddy's trying to grab a piece of grab and me trying to stab his hand with my fork.  Back off my crab homey or get a stump back.  \n\nThe next thing ordered was the Bone In Ribeye.  If I'm going to eat at a very nice place, I'm probably getting a slab of red meat at some point.  This didn't disappoint either.  Literally melting in my mouth while having a perfect combination of seasoning and outer char.  My buddy asked this time and I still tried to stab his hand.  \n\nI'm not normally selfish about food I order, but when it tastes this good and all you got was Salmon and Creamed Spinach, you're simply not allowed to offer that for trade.  Idiot.  \n\nI am not kidding about this place though.  It really was that good.  I can't remember our server's name.  He was pretty good though.  Made sure to bring the bachelor some free stuff too.  Not too shabby.  \n\nIt's probably an amazing place to bring a lady too.  Get the dungeness crab.  I'll be back.  \n\nVegas.  Hold me.
