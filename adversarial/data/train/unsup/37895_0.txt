This is one of my favourite places to find a wonder and robust variety of national and imported draughts.  German draughts are always draw me in but I always find myself with a glass of La Fin du Monde.  It was quite appropriate in the winter when we were celebrating the last day of the year.  Four rounds.  \n\nBut I am a real sucker for their varieties of mussels.  All I need is a bowl of moules served with a fresh crusty roll and several rounds of beer.  \n\nIt is nice to sit down a enjoy a good brew without the damning loudness of other beer venues and pubs.  A good pub is always treasured but sometimes you cannot savor a good beer when you're constantly raising your voice margin by margin to hold a conversation.  Somehow, this seems like a more appropriate way to drink down centuries of brewing tradition, give or take a century or two.  \n\nAnd please get the fries.  And the brunch is excellent.  \n\nOh, and if you happen to need to go to the Gent's room there is a surprising way to keep you focused on what you need to do.  I have never had the need to go to the Ladies's room so I don't know what awaits you ladies there.  Sorry.  \n\nProst!
