i hate you, stupid sports book.\n\nno, i'm sorry.  i didn't mean that.  really.  i promise.  i'll be back, with lots and lots more money.  i'll even buy crepes next time i'm here.  and i'll eat at the burger place again.  we love the burger place.  i've never had pancetta before.  please, don't walk away...\n\nle sigh.  i love you.
