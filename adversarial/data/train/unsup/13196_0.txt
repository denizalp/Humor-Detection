Let's face it, after 3 full nights in Vegas, the hubs and I were in need of some take out and a movie. Because I had been eyeing this spot in our hotel since we checked in, we decided to check it out!\n\nS = Superior sushi rolls! I opted for the traditional eel roll, which was absolute perfection! The extensive menu offers a wide variety of fancy and simple rolls, perfect for any sushi lover!\nE = Excellent Korean dishes! my husband chose to nosh on a few different kabob's to introduce me to the flavors of Korea!\nK = Killer staff. We had a tough time navigating the menu, but the hostess was so sweet, friendly and gave us great suggestions to accompany our meal. \nU = Unbelievable vibes\/atmosphere! Although we got our food to go, the space exudes a cool\/trendy\/environment that feels as though you've stepped into a little shop in Korea or Japan!\nS = Seaweed salad! OM NOM NOM! Literally full of flavor and so delicious! The hostess talked me into adding this menu item to my cart, and so glad she did! SO GOOD!\nH = Hidden in a corner of the Paris hotel, it's quaint and small, and yet, you can't miss it! \nI - Incredible prices! After ordering sushi, seaweed salad, 4 different kinds of kabob's, sushitio peppers, eggrolls and more - our total was a mere $50! \n\nI find myself craving this place since leaving Vegas and will make a point to stop back in! MMMM!
