Bottomless soup and salad make me happy. It is truly the simple things sometimes. The salad is pretty straight forward, not about to win any awards, but somehow when I can get 4 refills the salad quality improves in my mind. Quantity can be important from time to time and yes, I did manage to eat 4 salads on my first attempt. The soup changes daily, but both times I have opted for the chili, and the chili is pretty good bar chili. I have had it twice, so clearly no complaints from me. \n\nI also brought my mom here when all she wanted is a salad, and she ordered one of their specialty salads and was pleased. I also spied on some fellow diners sandwiches, and they looked pretty delicious. \n\nThey have a separate smoke-free area that is open for dining until around 10pm I believe. Late night, you will sit in the main area. It is probably the darkest place I have ever entered (besides a cave on my 13th  birthday), so trolls and moles will be pleased, and me too. I actually like the darkness. They have some cozy seating options, but if you want service late night, head to the bar. While service is a tad haphazard, it is definitely friendly. There are plenty of TVs for watching your sports. And, I must comment that on my last visit, I was particularly fond of the music. They played \"High Enough\" by the Damn Yankees, one of my top 20 all time favorite songs (perhaps even top 10). With endless greens and a bit of Jack Blades, I can't help but be a fan. It just feels right.
