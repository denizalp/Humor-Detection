Now open!\n\nI love Latin supermarkets. For the most part, the prices are on par with Asian markets, but the places are usually much cleaner, and the staff more helpful, plus no surly attitudes. I don't mind the attitudes, as I'm used to it (it's just kinda our culture) but it's nice to see some smiling faces sometimes.\n\nMy favorite parts of these types of markets are always the bakeries. They have so many kinds of Mexican sweet breads and all the ones in the big case are only $0.60 each. They have about a dozen other kinds that are priced higher than $0.60 and those are in the cases.\n\nThere's also a large ready made food to go counter, a juice bar, a salsa bar and plenty of seating. I have yet to try the ready made food but they have tons of options. Next time.\n\nFor sure don't forget to check out the produce section. Today they had the hugest Fuji apples I've ever seen, 2 lbs\/$1. As I walked by I thought to myself, \"Damn those are some big apples! I should get some.\" Then a girl came by and said, \"Wow those apples are big!\" And then another guy, \"Shit those are huge.\". LOL Yeah they're big ass apples.\n\nFor opening weekend, they were pretty busy, but parking lot was easy to get in and out of, and checkout lines were plentiful, and wait minimal.\n\nThis is a great option if you live in the North West part of town, and previously Cardenas near the Meadows Mall was the nearest good Mexican supermarket. We'll be stopping by again soon for sure.
