This was one of the worst places I've ever eaten in. I understand that they are new and need to work out some issues but when the wait is over 30 minutes for some eggs and toast, well, that's too long.  They had a menu which looked very good only to find out you can't order from that menu until 1pm. Then why put that menu out on the tables? Oh for the drinks on the back? Poor excuse, get a separate menu. Oh and how about having some salt and pepper at the table? Pitchers of water at the table would have solved our 10 person table water problem, rather than bringing one glass at a time. As it was we ate in shifts as the plates came out one by one with a waiter walking around trying to find out who on the patio the meal was for. So disorganized! These people need a lot more training.
