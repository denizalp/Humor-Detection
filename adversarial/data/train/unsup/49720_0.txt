Super happy that one of the popular Chinese restaurants in Markham has now opened in sauga! Don't need to make the trek down there anymore lol. \n\nWe decided to come on a Friday night around 740pm for dinner with a group of 10. Our table wasn't even that big.. there was another group there that had 30 people!!? We got seated around 820pm and it was actually really spacious. The interior of the restaurant is really nice and it's super bright inside. There's so many things to try! Their menu has a lot of things and I got overwhelmed by it. Congee, rice, noodles, BBQ, you name it. \n\nWe ordered 7 dishes. \nSpicy turnip patties - not spicy to me, crisp and had a lot of flavour\nSweet & sour chicken - relatively big chicken chunks, I think they used chicken breast. Super crispy but I think there wasn't enough sauce. \nGeneral Tao chicken - same as above for s&s chicken just different sauce and there's broccoli in it. \nFried spiced pork chop - I like how the pieces were chopped into smaller pieces, it made it easier to share between people. It wasn't salty imo, had a lot of flavour and I liked this dish. \nChicken fried rice - nothing too special about fried rice. Pretty typical but this was good. \nSliced pork chow mien - nothing special about fried noodles as well. It was still good. \nSuper bowl congee - don't remember which one we got but I enjoyed the congee! Lots of flavour and had a lot of protein pieces in it. \nDidn't get to take more pics.. they were too hungry haha. \n\nAside from the restaurant being really busy (as expected) since it just recently opened up, I enjoyed my time here with good company. Def would come back again, there's so many things I want to try!
