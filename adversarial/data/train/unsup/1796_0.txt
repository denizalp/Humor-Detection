Where can you begin with this mall. It has been here as long as I can \nremember ,but has had many facelifts and make over, How Scottsdale right!\nIt is always interesting here,with lots to see and lots to do.\nThough I was always upset that they would not have Santa here or the Easter Bunny many years ago, but now they do.\nI love Christmas so much. But, I am glad that soon I can go to the mall without all the crazy shopping drama that goes with it.\nLots of new shops and lots of new restaurants, you just cannot go wrong here.\nThe mall is very large and 2 stories so wear comfortable shoes.\nRestrooms are clean and many food choices.\nThe worst thing is Parking, it can really be crazy!
