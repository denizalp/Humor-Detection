These guys are the best!!! My rugs were spotless when they left. My house smelled clean without an overpowering chemical smell. They were very professional and did everything they could to make sure I was pleased with the outcome. In addition, I was impressed with their obvious pride in using high end equipment and great cleaning products. I will not even consider allowing anyone else to clean my rugs in the future.
