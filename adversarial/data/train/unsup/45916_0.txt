I had a small issue\/long story about a damaged guitar. Tommy was the best. I have never had such amazing service. More than made things right.\nThey have earned my business forever. Honest and more than fair.\nUnlike the big box stores like Guitar Center or Sam Ash.\nI have nothing but great things to say about the sales and service.
