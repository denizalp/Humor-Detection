We had never been to smoked, but it smelled so good outside that we had to go in. First, they had a 1\/2 price wine special. Kevin Parks was our bar tender. He let me taste a few before I decided on their meritage. He made a great suggestion in the brisket sandwich.  My wife loved her BBQ chicken salad. While we really enjoyed the food, what will bring us back is the great service by Kevin. Such a pleasant, helpful, knowledgeable and energetic young man. Hard to find outstanding service in many places today, but Kevin will provide it at Smoke Modern BBQ.
