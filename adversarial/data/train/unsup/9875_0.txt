We stayed here over the weekend and we must say, we were very disappointed. The hotel room was nice-nothing special though. The casino itself was small and the ceilings were very low. The machines were high priced and paid out NOTHING. The poker room had limited games and if your someone who likes limit, then your out of luck here. \nThe location of The Wynn also blows. Its next to nothing fun and a big walk to the middle of the strip. \nOh, and I almost forgot the food\/restaurants here also suck. They are all over priced and the food we did have was not even good. Not a good sports bar or dessert shop or nothing. The shops were all empty and super high end. Why bother when NO ONE is in your store. A bunch of empty restaurants and shops. LAME!\nWe gave it 2 stars only because it obviously wasn't ghetto.
