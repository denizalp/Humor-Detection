Nice place to get a quick bite if you're at the Mandalay Bay Hotel or Conference Center. The restaurant is chic but has limited hours, so I got my food and beverages at the convenient Libertine to-go counter around the corner. \n\nI opted for the hot link, which was excellent. Not only was the link hot, but they add a wonderful house-made mustard which nicely complements the pork inside the sausage. \n\nI enjoyed this so much I ordered it twice during my current visit to the Sin City, washing it down with beer on one occasion, enjoying the stinging heat sans beer the next. \n\nService is friendly and quick, décor is quirky and over the top, everything you'd expect in Las Vegas. \n\nBon appétit.
