This place is filthy and the hallways smells and the biggest rip off ever after 9 months I was late on my rent for the first time they charge me $50 for first day and $25 second day to deliver the eviction letter it coat me $75 more for two days . And their new manager named Brenda is rude and very unprofessional she thinks she is the shit landing a management position . FYI Brenda  we the tenants pays your fucking salary .Bitch
