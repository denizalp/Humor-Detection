After being blown away by the incredible California version of this store, I made it point to check out this Bass Pro Shop to see how it compared.\n\nThere are a few differences.  It's a little smaller in size, there is no seafood restaurant inside, nor is there a fudge place, but even without all of that, the size of this place is unreal.  It's like \"Casa Bonita\" for the huntin'\/fishin' crowd.  It's less a store, and more a retail theme park.\n\nSeriously, this place is MASSIVE, \"smaller than\" or not.  It's full of impressive displays and waterfalls, and aquariums and rivers.  There are games to play inside, and an archery range.  The mass amount of guns and bows and camping and cooking equipment, home goods, boats, ATVs, fishing tackle....  It's mind numbing.  It's like there is so much to see that you almost don't know what to do with yourself.\n\nSouthern background or no, I'm not what you could call a \"sportsman\", but you would be foolish not to appreciate the sheer majesty of things they've crammed into this place.  It's absolutely stupid how awesome this place is.\n\nI finally broke down and bought some cooking stuff (and yearned over some other options).  I've been contemplating getting some fishing equipment....  I think I found the place to stock up.  I've always been a little snarky about sporting goods stores.  I know this.  But....  You've earned my respect, Bass Pro Shop.  Go in peace.\n\nAll I know is, when the zombies finally rise up to quell their insatiable hunger, I am holing myself up in this place.  With the arsenal at hand, I doubt they'll ever be able to touch me, much less find me.
