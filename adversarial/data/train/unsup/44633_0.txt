I like this YMCA , it's the only y in Charlotte that has a jacuzzi , the set up is super cool. But my issue is . It's a bit racist if your black they think your sneaking in trying to steal stuff . I had a woman tell me I look like a thief I can't come in this way to go to the locker room. If you do not come in there dress like a business savvy person , the red button goes up. Second mainly the woman that's been coming for a long time walk around butt naked , it's so disgusting they get in the jacuzzi necked and shave there private areas in front of ppl. It's just to much . My husband says the men do it to. And they would have a towel around there neck while they are talking to you. The staff doesn't do anything about it , cause they say they been here for a long time and they do not want to upset them.
