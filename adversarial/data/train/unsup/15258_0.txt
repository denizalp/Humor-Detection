I'm always on the hunt for spam musubi and House of Aloha did not disappoint. I walked into an empty restaurant and Sammy, the owner, was chilling with his Dad. They opened this spot up after Dammy retired. Such a cool story of a local who was so passionate about food that they opened this local spot. I felt right at home.\n\nSammy was incredibly friendly and made a slight menu modification for me. He even laughed at my joke that I may be white but I have the heart and belly of a Hawaiian because they are both so happy all the time! #dadjokesfordays \n\nI came for the spam musubi but I fell in love with the manapuas. I wasn't a fan of the macaroni salad, it was a bit bland and heavy-handed on the mayonnaise. Everything else was a big hit. The kalua pig has a really nice smoke to it and the chicken katsu was tender with a crispy exterior. Plenty of rice is served on the side.\n\nI'm not over this way often, but when I am I'll be swinging in to say Aloha and to grab some grub. The menu isn't huge but there is so much more I want to try.
