Loved it!  My daughter and I went there for lunch and were very happy with our order, as our sandwiches were delicious!  I had their capri sandwich on ciabatta and my daughter had the turkey\/bacon on ciabatta.  I didn't get the name of the guy behind the counter, but he was awesome!  Very friendly and willing to answer all of our questions about our sandwiches.  We are definitely going back :)
