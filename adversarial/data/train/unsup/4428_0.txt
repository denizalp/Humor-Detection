Ironically enough, if you're willing to venture off the Strip in Vegas, sometimes you'll hit a jackpot. Poke Express is one of those type of gems uniquely delivering the Hawaiian islands flavor in the desert that is Las Vegas. \n\nWe went at around 11am on Sunday and they had initially already sold out of malasadas.  Fortunately, they were able to make another batch (w\/in 20 minutes) and when fresh, these were amazing. Whether custard filled or just plain, the coating of sugar and the nice crisp flaky dough was tremendous. I recently had a batch frozen and delivered from Hawaii and these malasadas were comparable in quality. \n\nThen there's the star of the show, the poke. Really good poke to be exact. I can't attest to how it compares to poke in Hawaii but from all thirdhand accounts it matches up. Not quite there in terms of freshness but a close alternative. \n\nMy favorite was the shoyu poke because the sauce is a great balance of sweetness that marinades the salmon or tuna to perfection. The spicy avocado poke was more spicy than I expected but having never tried avocado and poke mixed together, I thought it was pretty fantastic. \n\nI'd steer clear from the seaweed soaked poke as the salinity of the seaweed was too overpowering. \n\nThey serve their poke by the 1\/4, 1\/2, and 1 lb sizes and we started by trying four different 1\/4 lb. containers. Just a note, thats not nearly enough and we had to double up on what we ordered between two people. \n\nOverall, its affordable and delicious comfort food served with welcoming hospitality. It's like your own slice of Hawaii only a couple thousand miles away.\n\nTip: Get here early, especially on the weekends, because at noon this place is jam packed with large parties.
