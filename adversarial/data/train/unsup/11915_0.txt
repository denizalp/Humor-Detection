For me, this is an acquired taste. The pasty that I got had a strange and pungent smell to it even though it was delicious. We sat at the bar when we came here and had a chance to observe the surrounding a bit. The bar area makes you feel like you're being taken back to the good old \"Irish\" country pub.  I don't know if I will come back because my pallet isn't Irish enough. However if you like pasties, this is the place!
