Yo this place is sooooooooooo friggin good. I've never eaten at a place and wanted to give it more then 5 stars. NEVER! I will never be able to eat soul food again if it's not this good. Set the bar really high for my taste buds. \nI'm here visiting from Chicago. I stayed at the Hyatt Place across the street. Thank God for Yelp! That is how I found this place. I told my husband we must try when I saw the yelp reviews. \nWe ordered the fried cat fish. They make it fresh when you order. It took a really long time to cook but beyond worth it. Very flavorful. We also ordered the fried chicken. It was really good too. For the sides we had the yams, Mac and cheese, collard greens, and corn bread. All were finger licking good. My kids ate with us. They loved mac and cheese and yams as well. \nI'm kind of sad I don't live here but glad too. I guarantee you I would be fat if I lived in charlotte. I would eat here everyday. If i lived here I'd go to the gym twice a day though just to smash this place on the regular.
