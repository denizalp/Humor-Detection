The GreenTree staff was pleasant, but Alma at the front desk was exceptional!  She made you feel welcome and was very accommodating.  My room was large (#408) and had a view of the pool.  The king-sized bed was soooooo comfortable.  It was nice and quiet.  They also have a laundry area and a workout room for guests (I didn't use them, but they appeared to be clean).  They offer a full breakfast!  Scrambled eggs, make-your-own waffles, sausage, juices, fresh fruit, coffee, cereal, bagels, donuts... complimentary every morning.  Missed it?  Get fresh-from-the-oven cookies offered throughout the day.  Want to get out and about?  There's a free shuttle from the airport to the hotel.  The shuttle is also available at no cost within a 3-mile radius of the hotel.  They only have one shuttle van and airport rides always take precedence, so be ready to use Uber if the shuttle doesn't show up within a reasonable amount of time to pick you up or drop you off at nearby restaurants, parks, etc. GreenTree Inn is a great deal for those on a budget.  It's clean, with a friendly staff.  Oh, and breathe easy, smoking is not permitted in the hotel.
