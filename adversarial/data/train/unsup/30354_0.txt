Duggan's had their grand opening this evening.  Gord fences with Kayla, one of the bartenders, so we checked it out.\n\nThey brew some of their beer onsite.  I had a couple #14 Sours ... one with raspberry syrup and another with cranberry syrup. They were good!\n\nKayla gave us a sample of Chicken Crackle ... Gord liked it.  I had an order of chicken wings with lemon pepper.  There were ten to my order.  They were big and tasty!\n\nIt's a nice spot.  The beers were tasty as were the wings.  We'll be back!
