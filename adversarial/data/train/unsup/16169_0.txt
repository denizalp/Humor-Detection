I found this Nail shop on Yelp, they had pretty good reviews so I decided to try them out. They are in a great location, right next to the Jimmy Johns on Lake Mead!!\n\nI was there right after they opened, I walked in and was immediately hit with the smell of fresh paint. I believe they were in the process of jazzing up the place.\n\nA gentlemen asked me what I wanted and told me where to sit. He was nice and polite. I was in for a fill. He did a an okay job on my nails BUT what really irritated me was the fact that every time the phone rang he would stop working on my nails and answer the phone, mind you there where 3 women in the store who could have done that for him. I say he answered the phone at least 6 times, overall the quality of my nails is okay and they were reasonable as far as prices. Only $16 dollars for a fill but I probably won't go back there, 4 days after I got my nails done they started to lift!!!
