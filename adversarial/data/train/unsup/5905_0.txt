Please read entire review...I believe in redemption!\n\nI'm sitting here now waiting for a Super Combo. It's been almost an hour since I ordered so why not start on the review...I have nothing else to do.\n\nI'm not sure why things are taking FOREVER and I've seen people who ordered after I did get their food and leave. Hmmmmm, I wonder what they ordered.\n\nAs others have stated, it's cash only. And did I mention, it's taking FOREVER to get my food? I'm praying it's knocking my socks off, and blowing up my skirt good because it's honestly the only way I'll drive all the way back over here again, EVER!\n\nThe woman at the register is very nice.\n\nI'm done for now until my food comes out. I ordered my food at 7pm, it is now 7:59...received food at 8:18.\n\nPLOT TWIST...\n\nThe food is amazing! It's almost 10:00 and I'm just able to get to it because I went to the gym to earn the meal!\n\nEverything is seasoned extremely well. The usual drawn butter one would need for crab legs has no place with this food, it really is THAT GOOD! And when I opened the containers, there was a little extra for my wait...I'M NOT MAD!\n\nSo although I walked out thinking that I'll probably never return, I have had a change of heart. I'm hoping my situation was a one time thing and the next time I'll be happy with my total experience.
