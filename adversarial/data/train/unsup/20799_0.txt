I feel like a black sheep for writing a 1 star review, but my experience at Jacob's was so below standard that I don't even want to consider a possibility of giving this place another chance.\n\nTo begin I know a lot of people would choose this place as a treat for special someone or to spend a romantic dinner together. Well, how romantic could your dinner be when you are cramped behind a tiny table that has another table at a distance of 20 cm? I was practically involved in the conversation the other couple was having. The server was not even able to approach me from the right side, he had to pass dishes from above my head, a dangerous task if you are balancing a freshly grilled steak on a hot iron plate. \n\nThe service in itself was far from spectacular and rather nonexistent, no prompt water or wine refills, we had to resort to pouring our own wine. Cesar salad that was made at the table was made behind our back because of the cramped space around the table. It also took 20 minutes for a server to finally figure out the dressing, after about 6 minutes I just turned away and carried on conversation with my partner.\n\nFood was the biggest obstacle of all I believe. Salad was bland and the lettuce used was cut into super large chunks, making it challenging to eat. I had to return my steak because it was overcooked and charred to obscenity instead of medium rare I requested. My partner did not find his steak to be any better than a restaurant we frequent that is 3 times cheaper. Duck fries were dry and overcooked. Manager offered us desert as a compensation for the meal. Unfortunately that did not save the experience. When spending close to $300 on a meal it takes a little more than an Okay dessert to pull it off. \n\nLuckily Toronto is full of good steakhouses that will mend my soul and my budget.
