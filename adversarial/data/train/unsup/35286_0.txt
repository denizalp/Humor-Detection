Don told me he could probably do the work to install screening on our chimney to keep pigeons out when he comes to inspect our house.  He said it would cost $75.  When he arrived and inspected the house, he tells me it will be $300 for both chimneys, when would I like to schedule, and there is a $75 service call fee.  I told him I obviously misunderstood that the cost of the work would be $75 and that it would be completed the same day, so I would need to think about it.  He did waive the $75 service call charge in hopes of doing the work.  I call back two days later to schedule, and he says he has decided not to do the work.  Why is he in business?  And further, please be clear with customers about costs and scheduling.
