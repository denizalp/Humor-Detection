We went to the Tempe Outback around 5:30. They were busier than we had anticipated. Only had to wait approx. 15 min. I had the 6 oz. filet and lobster special. The filet was cooked exactly as requested, med. well, and it was excellent. The sweet potato was yummy and the broccoli was cooked to perfection. My husband had the 6 oz. sirloin. He requested medium and he was very happy with it, the sweet potato and the broccoli. It was so good we ate too much. NOTE: please ask before putting a lemon wedge in a glass of water. Thank you for a very enjoyable meal.
