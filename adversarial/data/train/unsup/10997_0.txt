Husband and I came in to register here late one evening after having already registered over at Babies R Us earlier. Let me tell you... not a good idea. We were both tired and just wanted it all to be over with. So, we registered for the easy stuff, and I decided to make an appointment with one of their registry specialists for another day. This preggo needed her beauty rest. \n\nSo I came back, well rested and open minded, to meet with Chris. I told him that I was lost in a sea of baby bottles and breast pumps. He laughed and led the way through the store, scanner in hand. By the time we finished, I felt educated and comfortable with my decisions (even if it meant that we took about an hour and a half to make the full round of the store). Chris is awesome! He answered all my questions and then some. \n\nThere's a reason almost every single review mentions fantastic customer service here. Take advantage of it.\n\nOh wow, this was my 100th review! I think I'll have a glass of sparkling apple cider to celebrate!
