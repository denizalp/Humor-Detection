It is really, really hard to top Erica O.'s spot-on review of D&E. A good friend dragged me here one night three years ago playin' it up over their cheap Red Stripes (her drink of choice) and well drinks (vodka being my drink of choice; though preferably not well).\n\nAnyway, I meet her and her BF at the time here at 9 on a Sat night. Man, was this place sort of depressing. Not much was going on, and lots of TVs were on everywhere displaying some white trash recreation (nascar? Ufc? Monster trucks? Who knows).\n\nShe did have one thing right - it's cheap, and you get what you pay for. Typical bar food (cheese sticks, fries, wings, burgers) is sub-par - though we totally lucked out recently with a Rocky Point-style taco special that was actually really, really good. They should put THAT on the menu.  \n\nThe average patron appears to be of the fake ID variety to the pushing 35 variety. And invariably sporting a TAP OUT or Ed Hardy shirt. Despite the dilapidated d√©cor, smelly bathrooms and cheap booze, I can't call this place a dive bar - it's just too big and has too many TVs to qualify. Speaking of the bathroom, I once overheard a conversation between two girls, one of which wanted to call some guy or another to \"hang out\" with after they left, the other of which was slurredly talking her out of it, at one point reminding her that the last time they hung out, he choked her. Awesome.\n\nBut I keep coming back because I can ride my bike here (I just can't typically ride it home from here).
