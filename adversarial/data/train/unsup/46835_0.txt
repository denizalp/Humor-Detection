I've been there for dinner several times and have yet to be disappointed.  There's a nice patio which is great on summer evenings.  I've only sat inside once, but it has a very cozy atmosphere.  Anything I've ordered from the menu has always been excellent and friends I've gone with said the same about whatever they ordered.  Great pesto!\nService is very friendly and price is very affordable.
