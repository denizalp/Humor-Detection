Very happy with the tint that I had done on my 2011 station wagon. I didn't want the \"dark\" tint so many people seem to want as it makes driving at night very difficult and they were able to accommodate my preference for the tint. It has worked out well, especially the lighter front windows blocking the heat. All done well
