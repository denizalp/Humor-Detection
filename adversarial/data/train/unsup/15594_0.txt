Went in on a Saturday wanting just a fill and a nail repair. Waiting 15 minutes not bad for just a walk in. I will never go back or tell anyone To go there. All the technicians talked to one another. No conversation. My nails look horrible, shorter than what I said I wanted. I have never been so cut up on my cuticles and even underneath my finger. How does that even happen?! My whole cuticle on evey nail is cut up. My nails aren't even, some are flat and some are wavy and bulky. Lady couldn't even finish my nails so she pushed me to another technician. Getting these taken off and I'll keep traveling to my guy.
