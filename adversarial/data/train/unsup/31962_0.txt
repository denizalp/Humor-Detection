Five Guys in Montreal,\n\nThe famous burger franchise opened a location two blocks away from where I work, so today after waiting a few weeks for them to work out the kinks that you are bound to find in any new restaurants, I wondered over at lunch to give them a try.\n\nI liked the look of the place typical old school fast food decor and hustle and bustle, the kind of feel you don't find at the big boys. In their desire to homogenize the look, feel and taste of their food, the fast food feel has gone away. What I liked about Five guys was the fact that are unapologetic about what they serve. It's burgers, fries and soft drinks, they aren't trying to be a salad bar or a coffee shop, it's a burger joint point!\n\nThe person taking my order at the cash was great fast efficient no fuss no muss, even if the line was out the door, she was a pro got my order right first shot and I didn't order an all-dressed I picked my toppings individually. What more can you ask for? \n\nAs for the rest of the experience, I kind of have to agree with the previous reviewers. Although the burger tasted good I felt it had been thrown together, I ordered raw onions on my burger and none of them were on the patty, they were under the bread. I had the regular fries, they were OK but nothing spectacular, I prefer the fries at LaFleure but that's a matter of personal taste. \n\nIn short if you're in the area it's not a bad place for a quick burger to go and the taste is pretty good but I wouldn't make a special trip.
