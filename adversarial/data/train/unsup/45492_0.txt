This is our new favorite Italian Restaurant!!! Our first visit, we sat in the restaurant section and from the moment we walked through the door until the moment we left, service was phenomenal! The food, amazing! We had garlic knots, wings, Caesar salad, pizza and pasta (we wanted to try it all!) Everything was really good, the honey hot wings and alfredo were our favorite! Our second visit, we sat in the bar - same amazing service! We ordered the same wings, alfredo pasta which came with a salad... so much food and cold beer! :) we will be back, over and over again! :)
