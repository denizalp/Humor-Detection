Went tonight with my partner and looking over the cocktail list i thought WOW 15 dollars for a 2 oz drink better be good.  i received my drink it was good but not 15 good..... move on to the pork belly which was bland bland bland actually tasted like cold day old chicken.  I ordered a burger and my partner had a fried chicken thigh sandwich and boy oh boy was it tasteless and dry, it takes a lot to make a chicken thigh dry, so i guess thats a plus for the kitchen.  My burger was worst patty i have ever experienced, mayo and pickle lol are you serious for 12 dollars and its 4 oz give me break.  It is unfortunate that such a place should open in this neighborhood and have such horrible food.  I gave them one star because the fries were great and if anyone from the county is reading this , please take not that when a customer eats half the meal and says\"this was really dry and bland\" you should comp the item.
