Time\/Day: Various, mostly mid-afternoon, early evening. \n\nThe first thing I love when I enter Fatheads is the unmistakable, beery-hoppy-grassy-oak smell. I live in Ohio City near GLBC, and every time I can smell it in the air, I stop and take a whiff as I smile. Ah, well anyway, onto the review. \n\nFirst I'll say I'm not a beer connoisseur. Give me a High-Life, and I'm good. Give me a Miller Lite, hey, I'm doing fine. That said, I'm willing to experiment. On our most recent visit, I had the \"Lazy Magnolia\" (not house made) southern pecan ale. It was very good, and nicely not as syrupy as I'd expected. My inner fat girl said, \"This would be good to use as injectable in a roasting thanksgiving turkey\" -- and if anyone uses the idea, she demands credit. My dining partner had a vanilla porter something or other that to me tasted like flat doctor pepper, which while not bad, was not \"beery\" enough for me. BUT... The BEST drink choice we made was a local mead brewed in Mogadore. The \"Autumn Harvest\" mead was .... nothing short of ambrosial. It wasn't something to drink with a hearty meal, but to be sipped alongside perhaps, with conversation (about how freaking good the mead is), or saved for desert itself. \n\nNow - I've never had anything \"bad\" at Fatheads. I had pizza once, and I don't think it's fair to judge, because it's not a pizza place. Sure if they offer it, they should know how to cook it, and again, it's not \"bad\", but for me, it was so-so. Fatheads shines at the massive burgers they offer, the wings, and oh, do yourself a favor and share a basket of deep fried, house-beer battered mushrooms. They're not the teeny button mushrooms - they're huge. They come with horseradish sauce... ask for ranch and mix them together. Yum. That alone can and has been our meal. \n\nI've had good and bad service at Fatheads. Most recently on what shall henceforth be referred to as \"the day we had that awesome mead\" (yes, it was that good), our waitress was rather unattentive. I  had to think it was because we didn't have that big of a check? Anyway, like I said, good and bad service. Like most brewery-restaurants, it depends on what time\/day you go. \n\nI do recommend the place, heartily. We'll definitely go back time and time again, for mushrooms, mead and more.
