We love 12 West. The atmosphere, the beer selection and the service is impeccable. It's so nice to have a place so close to home to be able to grab a beer after a long week. There is a wine bar just steps away for those who want a wine with their friends who want to have a beer so you can also order wine and walk over. \n\nLove love love it!
