My husband and I went last night around 8ish.. had to wait about 40 min for a table which we expected since it was a Saturday night. Tacos were delicious... even the tortillas themselves! We got bistek (steak), chicken tinga, shrimp, and braised lamb...all were very good! Unfortunately they ran out of the ribeye tacos..so that just means we have to go back :) we ended the meal with the caramel flan..which had the perfect amount of sweetness. Loved the interior of the restaurant and service was great! Will definitely be returning!
