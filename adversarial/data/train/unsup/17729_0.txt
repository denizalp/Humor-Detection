\"I don't eat fast food.\"\nPfft!\n\nNope, that's a lie. In-N-Out is fast and I'm sticking to it.\n\nIn-N-Out doesn't feel like a bad thing to do. (And it *was* super fast!) Had this heavenly goodness for the first time recently. I almost keeled over in delight while sampling the fries. GOODNESS GRACIOUS. \n\nWhy has no one told me about this place before?\n\nAll french fries should taste like this! I'll never have a fry again elsewhere. Why bother? These are the best kind. Light, crispy but not too crunchy. It didn't feel like grease was involved in frying them. But the pure vegetable oil I later learned that is used. Delightful.\n\nI still can't believe it. \n\nI was cheated growing up eating the mushy drive thru fries of other chains as a child. (Thanks Mom!) I'll save this special treat for special indulgences. Totally worth it. Loved it!\n\nOTHER STUFF\n+ The quality of sound during drive thru order process was crisp\/clear.\n+ Staff was super polite, easy to understand. \n+ Staff was helpful. Cheery!
