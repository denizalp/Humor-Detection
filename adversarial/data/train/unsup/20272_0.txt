So Big O was advertising a $16.95 oil change \"special\". I was advised over the phone there were two car on the rack ahead of me and \"come on in\". I arrive and he tells me that the wait would be about 1.5 hours. So, I'm there and decide to wait it out. After 3 HOURS, I get called to pay the bill which now totals $27.45!!! Apparently I have a \"special\" oil filter which costs an additional $9.49, which I have never had in any past oil changes over the last 2 years. So my \"special\" turns out to be 5$ more than a regular Jiffy Lube and I had the privilege of waiting 3 hours rather than the usual 20-30 minutes at a Jiffy Lube; man, I hate getting screwed.
