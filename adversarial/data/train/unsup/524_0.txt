Guys. The granite is not great by any means. \n\nWell-located, yea. \nDecent in-house brews, sure.\n\nBut it's downhill from there.\n\nThe place closes kind of early. No more drinks after 11:30 on a Saturday (huh?) and kitchen closes by midnight. Weird.\n\nWe just managed to get a platter and PLEASE BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY the crab cakes had me doing uncivilized things for two days straight. I'm talking MILD FOOD POISONING and severe everything-out-now-ness. \n\nI share this not to humiliate myself but to spare you the gastro-implosion. \n\nApart from two crab cakes (that's all it took), I had two wings. It was all tasteless. Oh, except the sweet potato fries. Those were ok.\n\nJust keep walking down Mt Pleasant for real crab cakes and stay closer to Yonge and Eg for proper wings and a better beer selection. \n\nI RECOMMEND- only having alcohol. I tasted one house beer I would describe as a light and flat Heineken and had some decent red wine. \n\nEXTRA TIP- no smoking on the patio.
