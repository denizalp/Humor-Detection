These guys are amazing.  I realized today that my van was very overdue for an oil change and I am flying out tomorrow.  The day I get back my husband is planning to drive the van to Los Angeles.  I called at 5:45 pm to see if they could accommodate me for an oil change before they closed at 7.  I got there a few minutes after 6 pm and they took the van right away and when they learned the vehicle was going on a long trip they did a full inspection to make sure that everything was okay for the long trip.  I thought that was really awesome and then Michael called me out to the shop to show me that the tires were not safe even for local driving.  As I tried to figure out how I could possibly get those tires replaced before I left in the morning.  Dyllon came from the back to determine how much credit I still had on my current tires and what they had in stock.  The van looked like it was in an Indy 500 race with a different person on each wheel.  Still they finished after their closing time and both Michael and Dyllon thanked me for coming in and for my business.   It would have been very easy for them to just do the oil change and send me on my way but as Dyllon said - we want to make sure our customers are safe when they leave.  I really appreciated the extra effort and time they spent.  Above and beyond expectations!!
