My credit card information was stolen after I purchased lunch from this location. I called the manager the next day to simply alert her that there may be an issue with their machine. She absolutely denied any possibility of the fraud charges coming as a result of her store, she even went as far as to tell me that \"None of my employees even know anyone in California\" (CA is where the fraudulent spending came from). Her reaction to my call was that of a remarkably poor manager, particularly considering that I didn't call to complain, just inform.\n\nBe warned-- fraudulent charges appeared on my card after paying for a meal at this Jason's Deli. That, coupled with a ridiculous reaction from the manager are enough to keep me from returning.
