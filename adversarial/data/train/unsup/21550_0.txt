I am sucker.  These people are just so darn nice that I decided to give them one more star. \n\nIt doesn't change my previous review, but I'm sick of trying to find a better place and the only other convenient nail salon is closed on Sundays.  For some reason I only have time on Sunday, so obviously that doesn't work out too well.  Plus, the girls at US nail are just so sweet.  Damn, I'm a sucker for nice people.  Seriously, I once yelled at  a homeless guy (there is a back story to this that will make me not sound like an asshole, but I don't wanna bore you with it) and he was so nice about it that I gave him my breakfast.  I walked up to him, apologized and handed him my breakfast, then I went to class and felt like the world's biggest jerk.  I kinda feel like that after I leave US Nail, so maybe giving them 3 stars will ease the pain.  \n\nI think I can go back with a clear conscience now, but you might see one more update soon.  Also, I still have to bring my own polish- their color selection bites big time.
