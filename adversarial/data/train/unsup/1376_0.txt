Do you know what's worse than being hangry (sic) and having your mouth all ready for something only to find out you cannot have that something? Nothing. Nothing is worse than that! Unfortunately, this is exactly what just happened to me.  \n\nI have been to many Indian restaurants and all have been very accommodating with vegan requests, even if they were not a vegetarian restaurant. Nonetheless, I called ahead of time and spoke with a man who assured me that they could make vegan Aloo Saag for me. So I rushed over, happy to finally get to try this place out for myself. I could practically taste the spices, I was so excited!\n\nWhen I arrived, the place was empty, except for me and 2 waiters.  I was promptly greeted and seated by server #1. Water came quickly and the second waiter took my order. I requested Aloo Saag made vegan with a hot spice level. Waiter #2 wasn't sure if they could make Aloo Saag since it wasn't on the menu. I didn't mention that I had already received an answer; I patiently let him do his thing. He returned and confirmed they could do this. I thanked him and went to wash my hands for my meal. I was so hungry, I could still taste it!\n\nWhen I returned to my table, waiter #2 came over and told me that they could not make my Aloo Saag without the yogurt. Surely, he was mistaken. He said the kitchen told him that it was pre-made so there was no way to make a vegan version. Huh? I was befuddled. I asked to speak with the owner or manager. I was hoping the man from the phone (he had an Indian accent) would appear and set them all straight, but that man was nowhere to be found. Instead, waiter #1 came out and explained, again, that they pre-make the Saag now, so the yogurt is already mixed in... They cannot make a fresh, dairy-free batch, as other restaurants do and as I was told they could. So I left, hungry and pissed. I will not return. \n\nThe good? Cute restaurant and waiter #1 was pleasant, professional, and apologetic.
