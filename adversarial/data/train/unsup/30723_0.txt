My boyfriend knows that I hate to go out to Mexican food because I'm never satisfied but he dragged me here anyways.\n\nThe guy at the counter was really helpful.  He asked if it was our first time and let us try everything on the menu first and explained what it was. He kind of made a big deal when I told him that I couldn't have pork and said no thank you to the samples of them. It was really embarrassing for me and unprofessional on his part. \n\nThe food was good though. I mean hmmm...it was good for chinese mexican food. I'm not sure if I liked it that much but it the idea of chinese mexican just didn't sit well with me. \n\nThe restaurant itself was nice and the atmosphere was good too. Very laid back. I liked that feeling. Just not my thing I guess. It also gave me a stomachache
