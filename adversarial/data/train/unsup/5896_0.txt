No disrespect to the company but CHRISTINE was very rude I asked her \" what's your personal experience\" she said nothing and hung up. I called back on a different number ( after calling on my cell and no answer) and there she was again asking me if I had anything else to say then hung up. I write this review to express the customer should always be taken care of. CHRISTINE you have no customer service skills and should be reported to upper management .(period )
