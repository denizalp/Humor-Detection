No extractions during facial and a hard sell on products ruined treatment package.  Massage and facial price  was quoted included paperwork and payment.   I expected the time for a facial and massage to not include paperwork. Not so relaxing and no reduction in blackheads or pore size. Bad eyebrow wax---they were uneven.  Don't waste your time.  If you want good brows see Lisa at Reprise on State.
