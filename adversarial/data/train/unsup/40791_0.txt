Been a couple of years since we've been here , greeted right away , our waiter April very friendly and on point , started with the zucchini app , huge portion and good , had the potato soup very good with chunks of potatoes and carrots the wife had the tomato basil said it was OK , we shared the chicken fried chicken , the chicken was awesome but the mashed potatoes could have used more flavor, the wife got an ice tea refill and it was tropical instead of the regular, all in all pretty good just $40 a little step consider ing we split the meal , will come back to give something else a try
