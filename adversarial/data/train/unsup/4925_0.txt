So I meet up the homie at this spot. First time for both of us. POP!!! I tells her, \"Where in the Hell?!?\" The spot is located right in the cut of a salon. Weird. \n\nWe both got two combos because we were hungry. $10 gets you 3 baos and a drink. \n\nThis is my first time eating bao. Bao bread is this fluffy white wonder-looking-bread that tastes like it was baked right out of heaven. FOR REALLY DOE!!! We sampled the 4 different baos: chicken, beef, roasted duck, and pork belly. (My hunger made me forget to take pictures of all the different baos. Fail. I did remember to take a picture of the pork belly on round two)They were all good, but I'm a fan of pork belly. PORK BELLY GET IN MY BELLY!!! Coming in second place was the roasted duck. The chicken and beef both tied at an honorable third. \n\nThis was definitely a great eating experience. Great company, great food, and a very unique venue for an in-the-cut cafe. There are like 3 areas to sit at. Don't bring a big party yo. The homie doing the cooking was very professional. Great job ninja!!! \n\nComing back for more pork belly. EYE LIKA CHU PEOPLES!!!\n\nUpdate 11\/3\/2011 - bao bread is the same bread as manapua. It tasted and felt familiar.  This place has the fluffiest kind I've come across so far.  Now you know, and knowing is half the battle!
