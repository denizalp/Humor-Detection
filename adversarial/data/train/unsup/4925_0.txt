Good pizza - if you like sickening sweet sauce.\n\nYelpers, you seriously are high to give this joint anything over 2 stars.  Family friendly and family owned gets one star, maybe another star for homemade sausage, but that's about it.  $23 later and I feel like I had a Tombstone pizza with Prego sauce.  The garlic was foodservice pre-minced crap?  How difficult is it to chop some garlic?  \n\nDo yourself a favor - avoid and have a real pie.  No need risking Type II Diabetes from dinner.
