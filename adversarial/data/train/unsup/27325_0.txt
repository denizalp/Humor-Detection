Update: After contacting the BBB, Cox became much more cooperative and eventually resolved the issue.  My recommendation remains the same for Cox.  If you have no other options and you develop a billing issue save yourself some time and immediately file a complaint with BBB.  This company needs to be shut down for their business practices.
