If you're into boba drinks this is the place. Even if you're not, like me it's still good. I go here for the drinks itself and not the boba. I like the milk tea flavors such as lychee milk tea, honey green milk tea, lavender milk tea, regular milk tea and many more. They have snow, blend and some hot snacks. Those include popcorn chicken, fries, fried calamari, fish ball, onion rings and other items. The only thing they don't have is hot drinks. Wish they had those for the wintery cold days. Other than that the staff is delightful and service is fast. Tables, TVs and couch with outdoor seating is available. Wifi and magazines are available too. Cheers! :)\n\nMust order $5 or more to use credit card.
