I always go here for lunch. The prices are reasonable and the portions are pretty good. Prob my most favorite restaurant in South Charlotte. All their chicken dishes are amazing especially the Szechuan chicken. The sushi tastes fresh as well. And I love that they have the all you can eat sushi buffet during lunch.
