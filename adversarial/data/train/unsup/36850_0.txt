I had a minor accident, an Uber driver bumped into me. \nMy car is 4 years old 350 ML Mercedes and the Mercedes dealership  reccomended the New Look Collision center for repair, so I drove there and got a 3 days repair estimate.  When the Collision Center  confirmed they got all the parts and I received a check from James River insurance company, I dropped off my car and signed my check over them. \nI did not get my car back for 2 weeks, because the New Look Collision Center tried to get more money out of James River knowing he is paying my rental car during this time. \nMy Mercedes during this period was  standing outside in the summer heat in Henderson. The New look collision center finally got their money from the Uber and they allowed me to pick up my car. During the pick up meeting I noticed a large piece still missing from my car. They appologized and told me to go back in 2 days they will order it and fix that. When they confirmed they go that piece 2 days later, I stopped by there again but they realized it is not the right piece! \nSo now I have to drive with a New Look for sure, because they need another day to order the right piece again..... not sure what can they really fix, but I must say it is the worst place ever!
