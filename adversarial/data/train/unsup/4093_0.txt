I've owned 2 @Bentleyscoffee now.  Scratch that.  I've been to two Bentley's now.  Each has provided great service, solidly good coffee and just a touch of what I would classify as \"Vegas attitude.\"  \n\nThis is not \"Rat Pack\" attitude or \"Hipster wanna-be\" attitude.  This is a quietly hip, slightly preoccupied with my own game, friendly with a slight underlying edge sort of attitude.  You know it when you see it.  Kind of a mix of East Coast attitude (people who have lived in busy urban places back east have this - direct, no nonsense but not quite rude) combined with laid back LA attitude.\n\nDoes that make sense?  If it doesn't, stop by a Bentley's and you'll get it.  Get a coffee while you're there too.  Don't just stop in to check out the attitude.  That would be weird.
