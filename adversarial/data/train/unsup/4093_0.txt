sshhh...  Come on peeps.. quit writing all these great reviews and giving this place the cherished 5 stars.  I mean seriously... you're my village homies and we have to stick together.  If we don't, you and I both know, the word is gonna get out on this place.  Pretty soon we'll be waiting in line just like all the suckers at la fitness and 24hr.  Then what?  Besides $100 a month for a gym... thats just crazy talk.  Oh, and please don't mention the bar either.
