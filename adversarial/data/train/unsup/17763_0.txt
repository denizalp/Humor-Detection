Stayed here for a few days.....the place is great.  Here's what I liked:\n\n+ Complimentary Continental Breakfast.\n\n+ Large, spacious suites.\n\n+ Full kitchen and they provide utensils and cookware on request at no additional charge.\n\n+ Nice access to restaurants within walking distance.\n\n+ Pillows are unbelievably soft....I wish I could take them home!\n\n+ Bath & Body bathroom amenities are very nice....the bar of soap is larger than most hotels.\n\n+ They have on site, self serve laundry machines in case you need it.\n\n+ FREE WiFi.\n\nAs you can see, there's a lot to like about the place.  It's an older property, but well kept.....if you're into the newer designed hotels, this might not be for you.\n\nOverall, it was a nice stay.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%
