Crush is an upbeat, unique dining experience for the small plate and wine lover. I'm a fan of tapas style eating because it encourages interaction with your table and allows you to try a number of items, rather then just the single entree. The menu here has something for everyone with the fresh Heirloom Tomato salad with a light balsamic, the seafood lover with the Octopus Ceviche, and how about that Gnocchi with Short Ribs (love it). Eat plate seems very well thought out and presented very well here. I have yet to have a bad experience and will continue to come back. I have actually had my company Christmas party in the back room  and the service was second to none, with everybody really enjoying the experience. Much credit to the staff and management here as they have done a terrific job.
