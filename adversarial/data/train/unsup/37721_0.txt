Excellent good.  Good service that was very attentive too.  The nachos is a must get item!   The nachos spread out from the trash can when the pull it off.  The cheese is pure heaven.  The chips aren't thin, more like pita style.  \n\nThe five of us had the 68 chicken sandwich, pulled pork sandwich and the turkey burger.  The chicken sandwich was ok, too much bread.  The pulled pork was excellent, but the slaw is more mayo based (I like vinegar).  The turkey burger had great flavor, but a spicier sauce would be nice.  I r commend adding donkey sauce.
