Edward Hotel is another hotel that I stayed at during a recent group tour in Canada. It is a multi-level building (at least 14 floors!) that doesn't really have anything around it. If you're staying in one of the rooms on the top floor, you'll get to see that for yourself. The only buildings I saw around Edward Hotel were office buildings. I did read that there is a shuttle service, so that's always a plus if you need to go somewhere since there's nothing nearby! There is plenty of parking outside if you do have your own mode of transportation. \n\nThe hotel provides a variety of amenities. You can find a pool, gym, banquet area, and variety of conference rooms just to name a few. During my stay, someone had a dog with them in their hotel room so I think the place is pet-friendly but I'd double check if you do need that option since I don't know the circumstances of that situation.  \n\nI can't remember anything special that stood out about Edward Hotel. Since we were constantly on the go during the tour, we pretty much just stopped at hotels for the night and left first thing in the morning after breakfast. Not a bad option if you're looking to stay around a quieter area!
