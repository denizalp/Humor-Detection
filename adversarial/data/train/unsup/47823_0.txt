Mea culpa.....haven't been here for months as I felt the sauces and seasonings weren't to my taste. Last night my ribs were very tasty and the brisket was tender and flavorful, the sauces were brought to another level and fulfilled my taste buds demands. Do give them a try as it is well worth it.\nYou will find me there!
