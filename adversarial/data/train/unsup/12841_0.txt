Gave this place a try since reviews seemed decent, but now I'm starting to think that their friends\/relatives are the ones that posted past reviews.\n\nWe got greeted by the owner when we first walked in and then went up to order. The cook\/servers were behind a counter and didn't seem like they wanted to be there. We actually had to get up and get our food instead of them coming to our table, which was about two feet away. Tried the Lonsilog and Lechonkasilog and was pretty disappointed in both. They didn't even offer us any drinks, not even water. Food was bland and not that special.\n\nWouldn't recommend this place to anyone. You'd be better off at DT's or LJ's.
