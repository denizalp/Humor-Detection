The casino is fine.  They did a decent job upgrading it from the Imperial Palace...  well, I'm reviewing Linq and Quad as the same thing, because really they are.  They have a great video poker bar inside with 100's of beers from around the world.  If it wasn't for that, I'd probably never come here.\n\nTheir parking garage is a living hell.  It's old and should have been torn down and rebuilt with the rest of IP.  It took my friend and I like 20 minutes to get up the 6 floors due to difficult corners to turn at and lots of cars coming in and out.  Then on the 6th floor, the parking garage just ends with no warning, and there's nowhere to turn around and go back down.  Any cars queued behind you all need to back up to give you room to do a 17-point turn.\n\n100% the worst garage in Vegas, and I've pretty much been in them all.  Told a security guard that while stuck in line.  His response? \"I work here, I know it.\"  How many accidents will we have to see before they fix this place?  Shame on you, Caesars.
