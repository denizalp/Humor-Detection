We and some friends decided to finally try the Mood Restaurant and were a little skeptical given a recent bad review in the local news. We were pleasantly surprised and had a great time. \nThe restaurant is small, so you better make reservations or you may not get in. They also reserve the place for special occasions so you have to check with them or it may be closed for an event. That being said, we were the only folks in there at the time and it was kind of cool to have the room to ourselves. Our server, Wesley, was great, always checking on us and making sure everything was tasting well.\nWe tried the Calamari which was pretty good but a little heavy on the breading. The Tator Tots were nothing crazy but the Onion Soup was good. The Mushroom Risotto was awesome.\nThe ladies had Rack of Lamb and guys had Chilean Sea Bass. The food tasted awesome and the portions were actually larger than we anticipated. The ladies also had the Chocolate Lava Cake which must have been good because it disappeared quickly. \nI will admit the wine prices are a little bit steep for the labels on the menu. I'm used to bottles being marked up but was a little shocked here. Still, it didn't stop us from getting a couple of bottles and we all had a great time. We look forward to visiting them again in the future.
