We went to the Piedmont Social House and we were pleasantly surpised at what a cool venue it was, since we never heard of the place. It had a nice patio with a bar, a green space with games, tables inside, a back bar and 6 bowling lanes. It has so much potential...Unfortunately, the service was completely unacceptable. It took 15 min to get our first order of drinks, and then we could not find our waitress for long periods of time throughout the night. We all just started going directly to the bar to get our drinks. One time, we did that our waitress came back with the drinks that we had ordered 20 min before that must have been just sitting on the bar. Even as we tried to close out our tab, we couldn't find our waitress for more than 30 min. We finally told the bartender to have her come find us since we were going to bowl. Overall, the place has potential, it just needs a massive upgrade in its customer service to get people to come back.
