Very bad experience trying to get bike repaired. They ordered the wrong parts, had no idea what they were doing all the while piling up labour costs to install disk brakes on an E-bike. In the end they charged me $500.00 for a $100.00 job and refused to accept responsibility for their lack of knowledge of their own product. \n\nVery unprofessional  and not worth the hassle.
