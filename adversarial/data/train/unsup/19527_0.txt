While I wouldn't go here for an Indie-Rock Night-Out (TM), there are certainly worse places to go for those very special nights out after work, like someone's last day, you met your speeding ticket quota for the month, etc. The food is decent, beer selection OK, and the video-game choices are pretty good. It was the first time I spent more than five dollars on video games since I was 12. My Street Fighter skills have seen better days.\n\nLike someone else said, this is like Vegas without the sex and gambling. Wait, maybe that's Branson...
