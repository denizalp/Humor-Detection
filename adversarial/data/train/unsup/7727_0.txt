Durham Oral Surgeons is probably the most fortunate thing that could come out of having to have your wisdom teeth extracted.\n\nI was referred here by my friend, who happens to be a general surgeont o Dr. Chi-Chia Tai.  There are a team of oral surgeons working here and their supporting staff definitely play leading roles in the overall experience at Durham Oral Surgery.\n\nThe office itself is tucked away on a side street next to a Ford dealership and is an antique home conversion.\n\nThey were extremely organized.  When I checked in, they knew exactly who I was, and ticked me off their roster.\n\nI was scheduled in for a 9:45AM.  It took me about 5 minutes to fill out a form (as I had never been before), and within 5 minutes I was whisked away for an x-ray.  Make sure you take all jewellery from the neck up off (I forgot to take off my earings! Oops!)\n\nAfter that, the ladies processed my insurance claim.  I am so glad I have group health benefits.  Can you believe that wisdom teeth extraction (1 side = 2 teeth) comes in at a hefty price tag of $1000+ dollars?!\n\nShortly after I was asked to watch an informative video regarding wisdom teeth extraction, and then Dr. Tai appeared.  He was very informative, and easy to understand.  He explained what he suggested, and asked me if I had any questions.  \n\nShortfly after the consultation, the nurse took me into the operating room.  I underwent general anesthetics, and the surgery went painlessly.  Sooner than I knew it,  I was waking up and escorted to the waiting room where I was given instructions about the next few days and what to expect and to give you the date of your follow-up appointment.\n\nThe nurse walks you straight out to your car (of course, William T was nice enough to take me as you cannot drive after surgery).\n\nThe service doesn't end there.  The day after surgery, you will receive a check-up phone call just to see how you are doing.  \n\nI have worked in the medical field before, and the biggest guffaw about surgery is usually that there is no after-care.  Most surgeons just want to do the operating, and then be rid of you.  \n\nThey also called me this morning to remind\/confirm my follow-up appointment.\n\nI would definitely recommend going to Durham Oral Surgery to anyone who has to get their wisdom teeth removed.
