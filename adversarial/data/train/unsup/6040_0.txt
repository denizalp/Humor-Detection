I tweaked my back a week ago and it's been brutal. After two trips to separate ERs where high dose narcotics and muscle relaxers were thrown at me; along with no idea where my pain stemmed from, no relief, and down Big Pharmas slippery slope of addictive drugs, I was informed by a friend that going to a chiropractor was the ONLY thing that helped.\n\nThe Joint is legit. Open 6 days a week, locations throughout the Valley, and no appointments needed. There are variety of packages from drop-in to monthly. There's also no pressure to commit to any sort of package either.\n\nDr. Ray is a class act and doesn't have just a let's pop you in place and then that's it. He's a holistic practitioner: focusing on mind, body, and soul. He takes the time to sit down, LISTEN, and explain! I wish all Docs were this amazing!\n\nHe explained everything he was gonna do!
