I would give this place a zero or -1 stars, even, if I could. \n\nI bought a Groupon for a custom-made suit from this service, said Groupon to expire on December 16. \n\nOn November 10, I went to their website and used it to try and set up an appointment with them for a fitting to use my Groupon to tailor a suit for me. I thought that given that it was a long weekend, they would take some time to respond. But I heard nothing at all.\n\nOn November 19, I tried to call them at their number to see what happened with my appointment set-up. The number I contacted automatically referred me to a message saying that the phone was currently in use\/unavailable and to call later. I tried to call a few times over a few hours and heard nothing, and left them a direct email using their contact on their website requesting they contact me ASAP.\n\nStill nothing. On the 20th, I try to call again at lunch and get the same message. I even try to call their Toronto office and end up hearing an answering machine. Vexed, I then write Groupon to ask them for assistance in getting the service to respond. Groupon responds quite promptly (which is the one positive point of this story - Groupon's customer service is great) and tells me they are trying to get in touch with the merchant to contact me. They provide me with two emails - one to confirm my contact details and methods to reach me, and another telling me their proposed timeline for follow-up (i.e. to be on the lookout for a return call within the next 3 business days).\n\nI have heard nothing from this merchant. I am not perfectly within 3 business days from Groupon's email to me but I really don't care - the amount of waiting I have done to hear anything from this service is ridiculous. Somehow, even the customer service from Shaw, or Fido, Telus, or somehow even ICBC is better than this. \n\nTHAT statement alone tells you how wonderful this service is.
