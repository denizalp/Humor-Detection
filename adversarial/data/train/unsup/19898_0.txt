I was introduced to this elegantly decorated Thai restaurant by my optometrist friend for lunch after a routine eye exam, and generally liked what I ate.  But, although I ordered a bowl of Tom Kha Kai soup, I received instead Tom Yum Kai.  This was likely the result of a misheard communication by me, but I know what type of Thai soup I prefer and ordered.  Because I did not detect the missing Coconut Milk until after I had downed a few spoonfuls of the hot soup, and the soup I received was hot and tasty, I did not bring up the mixup.  And, afterward I received a huge portion of good Shrimp Pad Thai with medium spice.  Except for the soup discrepancy, service was good, and I was satisfied with my lunch, and inclined to return some day--but not that very afternoon.\n\nYet, after I realized that I had left a bottle of lactose enzyme on the table following consideration of various eyeglass frames, I returned to the restaurant in less than two hours, only to learn that a busboy recalled finding such a bottle but had already tossed it away, and the trash receptacle in which it had been placed had already gone out the door.  Although my own negligence clearly caused the pill bottle to be left behind, such a swift toss out by a restaurant employee seemed a little hasty to me.  The bottle could have been retained for at least a few hours just in case a patron came back for it.  But the Thai food was tasty and plentiful enough so that I will likely still dine here again, without any hard feelings.\n\nXXX-1\/2 stars overall.
