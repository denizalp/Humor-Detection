I went here with my mother and father in law. We really didn't know what to expect if it was like a subway or if it was something else. We were greeted warmly and were helped with a selection of sandwich we wanted. Well I wish I could give a honest review of the meal but they so happened to mess up the entire order. I'm not sure how it was done but needless to say it was. So someday I hope to go back and give a more solid review of the food.
