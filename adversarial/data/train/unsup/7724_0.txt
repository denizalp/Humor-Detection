I'm a huge fan of Culinary Dropout and I go to the Phoenix location pretty regularly. I was super excited to show my friends the awesome menu, and coinciding with AZ Restaurant Week, this seemed like the perfect place to go.\nWe made a reservation for 9 people ahead of time, and it still took us 20 minutes to be seated. When we finally were, we were seated outside and even the waitress commented that we 'had no space'. \nOur waitress gave us slow and unapologetic service. It took so long to even get our order in for drinks, let alone receive them. We all ended up ordering the three course meal and waiting again forever. Our waitress later told us, \"Uh they lost your ticket but uh, they're working on it,\" and promptly walked away before we could even respond. She did not even apologize or try to explain for the mix up. So not only did our food take forever, it also came out of order. A few of us received our second course meal with our third course meal and one friend even got her first course with her third!\nAll of this, and the time it took to be served took up over two and half hours worth of our time. I don't care how good the food is, I am never coming back here again.
