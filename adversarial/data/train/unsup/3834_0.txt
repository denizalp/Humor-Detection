For number 200 I've saved Yelpoween\nA party this caliber I dare say obscene\nThis year's party rawked more than foreseen\nIn this, the year, of two-thousand-eighteen\n\nTo all of the parties I've been before \nPale to Yelpoween forever more \n\nNot to diminish last year's epic celebration \nWhich in my opinion still merits a standing ovation\nAnd this bash also deserves epic acclamation\nRiverside's smoke stacks made an unbeatable location \n\nNo other party has this much in store\nNow I long for Yelpoween forever more\n\nUnfortunate that there are those that just come for the freebies \nThey pack into the place, they grab and they leave \nI love that Halloween isn't reserved for just elites \nBut I think it would be nice if there was a limit at least \n\nStill anything minor I have to ignore\nYelpoween is my favorite forever more \n\nAnd hot damn! That DJ was totally on FIRE!\nA playlist that sick had me really inspired\nTrack after track was nailed without tire\nA pro such as this must be admired! \n\nTo mad songz we dance out on the floor\nAt this Yelpoween and forever more \n\nRiverside staff and lounge sponsors much love \nFor the incredible service beyond and above\nThough packed so tightly snug as a glove\nKept everything moving which was more than enough  \n\nTipping is sexy I do implore \nAt each Yelpoween and forever more \n\nThe most important is the people who were there,\nYou all mean a lot to me, for you I do care.\nThough I wish we had nametags like we used to wear\nTo facilitate new friends with which to share.\n\nAnd to all of the parties I've been before\nYelpoween is the best forever more\n \n------------- Installment 33 poetry reviews\n\n***Yelp Review Numbah 200! Woot woot!***\n\nSeein how much everyone (Riverside staff, yelpers and complete strangers!) loves Mariko always warms my heart cuz shes such a sweet person who works so so hard for us. Huge THANKS to Mariko n Marguerite  n Yelp n Alida n Tyffany and all the Yelper-Helpers thank you so much for these seriously awesome parties! \n\nAbsolutely HAD to take a star off for the choice of a Wednesday for this party. Not only any Wednesday (which was already weird) but Halloween itself. So I had to miss the Elite lounge which made me really very sad because there is NO WAY I'm guna not give out candy on Halloween. That's just nuts. Please, pretty please with a cherry on top, don't do that again. Otherwise a 5-star affair even despite the overpackedness, please also limit guest list in future though to comfortable capacity. \n\nSorry for the delay, but these things take time y'all! Hope u enjoyed my lil \"tribute\" to Edgar Allan Poe for this Yelpoween review! Happy Yelpocalypse 2018! \n\nP.S. So stoked i won the IG contest much THANKS to Restomania and Yelp, I will be sharing the love! Fellow yelpers who's in for some passport outings??!
