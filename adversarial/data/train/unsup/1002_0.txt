I don't mind the cattle call or the delays or the crappy seats, I don't - it's Southwest, you know that going in - you're gonna get what you paid for. It's the service, or lack thereof, that kills me. Southwest employees are so unprofessional, they're teen-age kids at home alone when their parents are in Europe for a month - inviting all their friends over, trashing the house, breaking into the liquor cabinet... Seriously, I think the flight attendant on my last flight was drunk. You should have heard her little safety announcement\/orientation speech. Here's an excerpt (you'll have to imagine her intermittent hiccups and giggles yourself): 'The light button over your seat will turn on your light. The flight attendant button, on the other hand, will not turn on your flight attendant.' Amusing? Sure. Did the attitude instill a sense of confidence that an emergency situation would be handled quickly & efficiently? Hell no.
