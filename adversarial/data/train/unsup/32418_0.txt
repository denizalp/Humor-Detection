On my last trip to Phoenix and heading to the Cardinal game we felt that we needed a hearty breakfast, and the only option that i can see off camelback road was Ihop. And i really was not looking into digging into some pancakes before a football game.\n\nAfter some driving down camelback we crossed this spot, at first i was a bit taken back by the building, cause it is new, and not a real authentic place for mexican food, but i should have not judged it by where it is located at, i saw a few people inside and as a couple was leaving i asked them if the food was good, i ask only because i am from Los Angeles, and there are only a few places in L.A. that are worth eating at in my area that taste good.\n\nSo once we ordered and got our food, i tried their Huevos Rancheros and some Horchata, other friends tried their tacos and burritos and where please too it all fell into place, the food was good and the staff is real nice, the place was clean and they had t.v.'s everywhere to watch the morning games...\n\nGreat place to enjoy some food, next time i am in town i will make my way to this place or another Federico's to enjoy some good food.\n\nThanks for a new spot to eat off camelback and especially that 24 hour option!
