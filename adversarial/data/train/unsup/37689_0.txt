Sooo good! Also I was surprised to see that the lines are just as long as the one in Los Angeles. The line wrapped around the back but I waited probably 15 minutes. \nGaucho burger for my mom (she loved it), turkey sausage egg and cheese for me, we also got a honey butter biscuit (so good), and coffee and oj to drink.\nI'm really glad that this spot is here because I wanted my mom to try egg slut and since we were in Vegas it was convenient that this place was here. \nEverything's so delicious just like the original location
