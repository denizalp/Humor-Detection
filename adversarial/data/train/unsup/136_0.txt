Maybe my expectations were a little high and my brow a little furrowed after the ordeal of finding a parking spot on Mill, but I was not impressed. Starting with the good, they are very liberal with the gravy and toppings. And it was tasty. Now for the not so good. It was tasty until it was salty and the fries were soggy, which is basically after the first, maybe second, layer of fries. Let me explain, the gravy on its own was pretty salty and hits you a few bites in. So add greasy bacon bits, or cheese curds, or a couple slices of ham to that, and well, I really needed yet another cup of water. The main dishes themselves were priced at $7.99 for a small and $11.49 for a large. I don't know if that's considered reasonably priced for poutine, but I thought it was a little pricey. Not to be melodramatic but, adding insult to injury, if you want to make that a meal, it's $3.49 on top of that. That's not terrible, you say, but what's in this $3.49? Well, you get your choice of either a side of traditional poutine, regular fries, or a cole slaw. Does it come with a drink? For a discounted price of $1 on top of that $3.49, then yes, it'll come with a drink. I'm thinking maybe we should have walked out when we saw nobody was in the store while other restaurants had a lively crowd going? 2.5 stars, I'm rounding down.
