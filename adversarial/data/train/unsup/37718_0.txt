I think this is the better nail salons I have been to. The only down side is far. This is the only place I go where my shellac can last me 1 month or because they did such a good job I am ok leaving it on for a month. In normal occasions if it chips even a tiny bit, I remove it myself.. so never really kept my shellac for more than one month. I recommend Ling. She's a cute girl and super nice !!!
