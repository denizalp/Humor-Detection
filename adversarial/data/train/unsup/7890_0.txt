So many Poke joints within 2 mile radius. Competition was hot and not all were winning. Poke Poku won Monkey over easily, while others have disappeared. \n\nI think it's all about the choices and amounts of fish.  Monkey usual was a Medium bowl(3 proteins) with half brown rice half salad, soft shell crab, double Salmon, Korean sauce and all the fixins. Now sans the rice, a Medium Salad is a huge box of greens plus all the above. \n\nFriends who have tried other Poke joints and disliked Poke overall because of them, changed their tunes here. You're welcome. This my go to spot for Poke. I don't want it anywhere else. Poke Poku nailed down the value in its pricing, punch card and free delicious teas while dining in. Staff is always friendly, patient and kind. Great environment. \n\nMonkey do often.
