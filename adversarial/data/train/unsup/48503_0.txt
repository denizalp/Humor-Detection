We came on 9\/29, the initially planned last day they held their International Mosaicultures exhibit. They apparently extended the exhibit for a week because it was so popular in demand. It drew crowds of outrageous proportions; I don't know how people physically stood on the snaking ticketing line in the blazing sun for hours (My group had pre-purchased tickets online and were able to go on the express line, waiting only 5 minues). Once inside the garden, it was very hard to walk around and enjoy the works of art when there were so many people (there was literally no elbow room). They were beautiful works, though. For this particular day's experience, I would give it 3 stars, but I know that in essence, the garden deserves more respect. We saw half of the Mosaicultures works because the crowds tired us out, and did not get to see the Gardens of Light exhibit due to fatigue (it would've been nicer to view after dusk, anyway). The park is huge, which is maybe why the [high] admission price is good for 2 days.
