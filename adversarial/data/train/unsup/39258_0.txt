We tried Tottie's for carryout last night and it was delicious! The packaging was perfect, everything wrapped up well and neat. We ordered egg rolls (4), beef panang and pad thai, asked for it mild and they delivered. I was really impressed. They don't have the liquor license yet, but are working on it. As soon as they get it we will definitely be joining them for a meal in the restaurant. Great neighborhood addition!
