Really love they have healthy options!  Had tacos vegetable style protein and mushroom style.  Both were great, just wish they double up the tortilla, they didn't hold up well especially the mushroom.  The rice and beans were really good, love all the options of hot sauce to put on them.  The interior is cool and staff was really friendly.  All in all it was really good, I'll be back.  4 Star instead of 5 because they forgot my friends meal that was with us.
