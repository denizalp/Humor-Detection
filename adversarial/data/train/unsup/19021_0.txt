This store is close to my house.Right in the middle of Tempe.\nLately when you come in it is hit or miss. There is someone standing at the door wanting to see your reciept. Then go through your bag. A lot like Costco, but no warning anywhere. Not a sign to be seen that says have your reciept ready, or even the cashier letting you know to keep your reciept out because, you will be serched on your way out.\nGet cameras, have someone watching at the check out. I do not like this system at all.  I have to stand in line like a troll while someone checks everyones papers.\nLots of parking in the lot, But, the store could use a good clean up. It is not that nice inside. I know it can be because some of the other .99cent store are quite nice and clean as well.
