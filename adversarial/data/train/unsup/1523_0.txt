I just tried this place for the first time on Monday, as a place to work and get out of the house. Immediately when I walked in, I was afraid I wasn't cool enough to be there. I confirmed this when I shot the liquid sugar across my latte and all over the counter. \nThe redeeming quality of Cartel is the barista working responded with, \"I shot myself in the face with that, last week.\" Making yourself more embarrassing than your clients? Point Cartel.\nThe latte was really good, pretty strong, and tasted really good. The free wifi didn't hurt, and although I know I wasn't really cool enough to be there (I'm pretty sure I was one of 3 people that wasn't wearing clothes they made), it was just what I was looking for. Quiet, but not dull, and good coffee. \nOh, and when I was leaving, the barista said \"Sweet bag!\" (Mine, that I design and sell). Yep okay. I'll be back.
