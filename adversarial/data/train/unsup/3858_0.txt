Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day. I came across this gem after a quick yelp scan of top-rated breakfast spots near our hotel. Butters caught my attention with it's vast menu and incredible looking omelets, pancakes, and more. After an early morning redeye and four hours of travel from Chitown I was famished.\n\nThere seemed to be a bustling crowd at this spot at nearly 8 am on a Friday! However, there was no wait for the al fresco dining option, which we gladly took. Upon being seated, we were immediately greeted. Our server was top-notch and helped me narrow down the immense menu. \n\n I ordered the caramel macchiato and the chorizo omelet served with fresh fruit, and my choice of pancakes, cheesy grits, toast, english muffin, etc etc. I opted for the cheesy grits since my piggie of a fiance said he wanted to try them. The food came out so quickly, and it was made with super fresh ingredients. My chorizo omelet came smothered in jack cheese and green chile sauce. It had a little kick to it, but the cool and creamy avocados nestled inside were the perfect pair! The grits were smooth, cheesy and very flavorful! \n\nI loved Butters and would recommend it to a hungry patron looking for quality food with a decent price tag!
