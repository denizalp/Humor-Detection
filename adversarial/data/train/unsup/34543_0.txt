Casual upscale place at the Cosmo in Vegas. Great service everyone engaging and even management chipping in. Modern vintage contemporary date night happy hour business venue all in one neat area. Good variety of Asian, American, speciality food. Drink options seem a bit limited but otherwise very fresh ingredients. Seen like a place of many business dinners. Came for boyfriend birthday celebration - jeans dressy shirt seem suitable attire however feel free to dress up as I wore an equivalence to a cocktail dress. Order a long island and black label over the rocks. Entree was their fried chicken and rack of lamb medium rare. Their danish blue dressing is amazing !!!! Food was tasty flavorful and tender. Portions were perfect! I am all about not being hungry after spending a bit - Bill wasn't bad and under than what was expected but the con was seeing a $2 charge for an ice cube and no communication about it - but besides that will be back!
