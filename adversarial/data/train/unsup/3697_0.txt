I decided to try this restaurant after shopping around this location numerous times . First impression was very nice interior design. Seated at table by hostess . Ordered drinks . Looked at the menu and couldn't find much entree in there , it was hard for me to figure out the menu and how to order .... There was not much varieties other than 2 pages of drinks, some sushi and hibachi. I was hoping there were more dinner entrees. Just not what I expected. Paid for drinks and left. I would say this restaurant is too fancy for its location. It's best to dine for special occasions.
