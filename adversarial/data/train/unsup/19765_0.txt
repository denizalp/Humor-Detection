I am torn on giving this review. On one hand, I want to keep this place all to myself, on the other hand, they deserve recognition and given how long each manicure lasts, I don't think my business could sustain them. \n\nThe woman who runs this nail salon is hands down (pun intended) the best manicurist I have ever been to. \n\nSeriously. I have been having my nails done in this fair city since I was 19 years old (a long time, ok) and the last 4 manicures I have had at charm nail spa have been the best ever. \n\nShellac manicures that last for weeks: most other places, my shellac will last 10 days, 2 weeks tops. My last manicure at Charm lasted 24 days. I went in because it was so grown out but still not chipped. Oh, and the best part: after 4 back to back shellac manicures, my nails are not even slightly damaged. When she takes the shellac off they look like it was just never there. \n\nShe is a nail magician!!!
