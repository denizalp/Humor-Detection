The food is amazing as advertised.  I got the pastor tacos and they blew my mind.  The meat, the cheese, the sauce, the pineapple...all fantastic.  Also got a carne asada mulas, which was equally amazing.  I could've eaten two more of each they were so good.\n\nThe ordering system is indeed flawed, and I almost want to take a star away just because of that.  There is nothing that prevents someone from getting their food, eating it, and not paying.  If I were the owner or manager of the restaurant I would fix that immediately.  Furthermore, there are three separate lines that list various meats and types of food (mulas, quesadillas, sopes, tacos, etc.)  There really is no order whatsoever.  For instance, what if I want a carne asada mulas?  There are two signs in different lines.  Extremely confusing.\n\nIn the end though you get your food, and I bet you can order whatever you want in any of the lines.  The food is literally some of the best Mexican food I've ever had.  Next time I am in Las Vegas (or San Diego), I am returning.
