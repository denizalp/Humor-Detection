Very poor customer service at the United airline ticket counter. I arrived at 10:45 am only one customer in front of me, 6 agent's avoiding eye contact with me.  When I requested assistance as the kiosk directed none of the agent's offered assistance when I asked. I actually had to get rude in order to get someone to assist.  Hey United I won't be giving you anymore of my hard earned money.
