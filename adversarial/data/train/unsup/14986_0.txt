A must do if you're in Vegas, plus it's free, so why not?\n\nStand in line and and wait your turn for a picture behind Vegas's most iconic sign.\n\nIf you're lucky, Elvis will be there too. He may sing a song for you, for a donation of course.\n\nThe area is very pedestrian friendly with many walking signals to get you safely across the street.\n\nThe downside is waiting in line in the scorching hear, but when in Vegas...\n\nIt actually could be a good thing. You may sweat some of the alcohol out while you wait in line.\n\nYou only need to go once, but you definitely need to go.
