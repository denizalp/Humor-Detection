What a great menu that really delivers on taste. The ambiance is cool. It would definitely be a good spot for date night or a good spot for hanging out with friends on a Saturday afternoon.\n\nI probably went overboard on ordering here, but I knew I needed to try more after the first two dishes arrived. I started with the butter lettuce and grilled mango salad. What a great contrast of flavors with the sweet mango and the smoky pecans. The shrimp and grits justify having \"Southern\" in the title. Wow, this was amazing. The grits were really good, shrimp plentiful and the flavors were out of this world. Last, but not least were the mini bacon donuts with maple glaze and butterscotch dipping sauce. I love, love, love that they pair the donuts with butterscotch sauce. That flavor combination is out of this world.
