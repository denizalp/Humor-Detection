TLDR:  potentially cool. Not ready for prime time yet. Owner hates money apparently. Come here in a few months maybe if they can unscrew themselves. \n\nReview: \n\nThey get two stars for effort for being in an area that could be so cool and desperately needs some innovative businesses. \n\nSadly, not yet ready for prime time. \n\nI stopped here with The Wife after Mandatory Shopping. We were looking forward to what we had heard was a new and dynamic eatery. \n\nWe walked in. The hostess lady sat us outdoors.\n\nThen three millennia and a couple major client changing  environmental events happened. During this time we never once saw what appeared to be the single server. I told The Wife we should have sat at the bar. \n\nThis place has an intriguing menu and a couple decent sounding cocktails. I have no clue what they taste like because after we were seated NO ONE EVER SPOKE TO US AGAIN. \n\nWe waited twenty minutes without any contact, beverages or anything. The single sever is single minded. She went to one table and talked to them. Then she went inside. The she delivered something to the table. Then she went inside. Then she came out and talked to another table. Then she went inside and a few minutes later brought that table whatever they discussed. Rinse and repeat. \n\nThe hostess lady who I think may be one of the owners did nothing this entire time except talk to the bartender. No other customers came in. \n\nShe couldn't be bothered to actually talk or do anything with a customer other than seat them. \n\nI got the impression that these were people who ran a shot and a beer bar for the horribly depressed and desperate when this section of town was at it lowest economic point. \n\nWhen we eventually got tired and hungry and thirsty enough to leave we walked out and realized that the single sever was being tasked with taking care of the interior first floor, second floor, an outside courtyard while hostess lady did squat. \n\nMaybe if they get enough bad Yelp reviews and find someone to sound out the words in the review for them the owners and managers will unscrew themselves. \n\nIn the meantime I sat for twenty minutes and sampled nothing and gave them zero money. \n\nPeople like this are why everything we buy these days is made in China. Gross American incompetence and laziness. \n\nThese people make me sad.
