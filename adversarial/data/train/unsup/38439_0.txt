What are the 5 Stars for: food, service, hospitality, originality?  Not all of these but 3 or 4 with a caveat: you don't go to an antiques shop for food, let alone vegan\/vegetarian AND buffet (on Sundays).  Let's not forget the vegan bundt cakes either.  I give Zenith some slack for service in that patrons shouldn't go there with Michelin-service expectations but for Elaine and crew to stick out their necks in Pgh and do wonderful and very affordable vegan... I don't have a problem rounding up to 5 Stars.  Return visits are in the making!
