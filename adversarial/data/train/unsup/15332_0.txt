I'd rank this lower, if able. I picked up an order to go and the General Tsao's sauce (which was asked to be packaged separately) was broken open. The entire bag was filled with the sauce. For one, it ruined the meal and two it leaked through the paper bag and through a slit in the plastic bag. The sauce was all over the front seat of my brand new Jeep. I called and asked for the manager and explained someone must have packed it incorrectly, because the sauce was on the bottom and the food on top of it (not smartly packed). He called me a liar and said there's no way it happened, but I pictures to prove it and he hung up on me. NEVER, EVER GO TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT. The smart@ss manager needs to be fired, but I've found it, it's the owner's son, so he must think he has the freedom to tell customers what he likes. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE.
