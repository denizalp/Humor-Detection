Tried to come here again on a Sunday.  The Cavs were playing so the place was pretty busy.  The TVs were SO LOUD that we literally turned and walked out.  When we told the hostess why we were leaving she just shrugged her shoulders and said \"ok\".  Turning away a 6-top of drinkers is just dumb.  By the other reviews on this place I can see they obviously don't give a damn about what people (paying customers) think.  Whomever is the store manager is should be exiled to an island where all he\/she hears is loud, blasting, crappy, pop-country and sporting events.  I know this is a corporate place and they have to read these reviews.  The people have spoken....and this particular Harry Buffalo eats ass...
