If you live in the phoenix metro you've heard of filibertos. This particular location is newer and clean unlike the other ones i have been to. \n\nThe food quality is tasty and comes in big portions. I come here when i need a taco fix. I always get the 5 taco plate that comes with carne asada, adobada, lengua, al pastor, and my favorite carnitas. Its awesome and inexpensive a lot better than eating bk mcds. \n\nLove this place. Try it!
