First visits to a new dental office can always be a bit nerve-racking. From the moment I walked in, I felt at ease with the friendly staff. Even though I was running more than 20 minutes late, they didn't act like they were doing me a \"favor\" by still keeping my appointment (is it me or does it feel like most dentists think its a privilege for us to visit them instead of the other way around?). That actually meant a lot to me. The attentive staff were courteous, gentle (as much they could be with teeth cleaning), and friendly. They all seemed genuinely happy to be working there. I left feeling like a found a great dentist and facility I can keep going back to. And by the way, I watched Anchorman during my teeth cleaning. A more entertaining teeth cleaning session I know not!
