Heard many good reviews for Romados and must say that I was neither impressed nor disappointed. The chicken was moist, not dry at all, but not particularly unique in flavor. Perhaps I should have ordered the spicy options. Fries were good but overflowing in the plate while there was a minuscule amount of salad; seemed imbalanced.
