Been here twice now and the last time it was 97.00 for LUNCH before tip.  We all left hungry and seriously went to another place to get more tacos.  Who thinks it is a fair price to charge 2.50 for some dinky taco with purple slaw crap on it and 7-8 dollar drinks with a thimble full of booze in em?  Dummies, that's who.  Yuppie tacos don't do anything for me.  Glad to see the guy who Michael Symon canned from Lolita got another job bartending, though...
