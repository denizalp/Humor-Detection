I hate the word \"stew\". It's right up there with slacks, moist and congealed. That said, St Francis' Pork Chile Verde ( I refuse to call it Stew...*cringe*) was phenomenal. Wow... just wow. I think I said that I wanted to roll around naked in it. It was that good. \n\nThis was my second visit to St Francis, the first visit was wine only. I doubt I'll ever be back without dining again. I'm dying to try the Baked Goat Cheese appetizer..(let's add goat cheese to that list of words I can't stand) and though I'm not a huge fan of sweets, the Chocolate Cake sounds insane. Get this: peanut butter gelato, caramel sauce, homemade caramel corn. Really?......no, really?.... If that doesn't make you need to change your panties (oh great, another word for the list....ewww) nothing will. \n\nI'm fully smitten with their patio. We gnawed relentlessly on some french bread and olive oil. I would love to see more places replace butter with olive oil or at least have the option. It's a petty thing but with everyone being so health conscious it just makes sense and it's tasty.\n\nI can't wait to go back in full on fatty mode and gorge (where are all of these disgusting words coming from) like the closeted fat kid that I am. I'm pretty sure this rating will go up to 5 stars after my next visit.
