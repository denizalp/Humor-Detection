When it's 11PM in Mississauga on a Sunday night I usually get stuck stopping at either Pizza Nova or Pizza Pizza, which isn't a terrible thing, but sometimes it's just not what I want. Luckily, I stumbled across the Burger Factory and it has officially changed everything! When I came in the place had a group of people and it took the employee a few minutes to acknowledge me, but hey, she was alone and she had burgers to make so I ain't mad. I ended up ordering a cheeseburger with onions, ketchup, tomato, and lettuce. I expected a pretty basic bland burger but what I got was an absolutely delicious, scrumptious, and juicy piece of meat between 2 patties that left me kind of sad I didn't get a second for the next day! This place is a little more expensive then some of the other fast burger places, but it's also a better quality burger. This place definitely far exceeded my expectations and I can't wait to come back again to try a different style of burger!
