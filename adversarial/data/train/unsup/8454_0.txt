One star for the tainted reviews. \n\nOrange head liars, nice touch to have all of the employees give rave reviews. \n\nYou gets nothing!!!!! \n\nThe real scoop... the chips were to greasy and too salty our server was a trout mouthed heathen that needed a bath. You would have thought she was at home the way she shuffled across the floor. We left before she could come back and take our order. Nasty. The food might be good but our server drove us away.
