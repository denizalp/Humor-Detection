I booked two facials through Groupon for a weekend getaway and am so glad I did! Deborah is fantastic: the facials left my husband and I feeling refreshed and soft-skinned. Not only that, but she has a fun personality that makes the time that much more enjoyable. Another reason this salon\/spa gets five stars from me is the fact that they made a special appointment just for us! When I first called in, I didn't realize that our weekend getaway was planned for Easter weekend. But, by the time I realized it, we couldn't change the date. The owner\/manager who we spoke to on the phone was so nice and accomodating: he spoke with Deborah and she offered to stay later that Saturday so we wouldn't miss our opportunity to get pampered. Yes, the treatment rooms are near the door, but with relaxing music and good conversation going, I didn't notice any outside noise. I recommend this for anyone needing an express facial or a good, relaxed pampering. They take great care of you and really want to make sure you leave feeling relaxed. Happy pampering!
