I went to this pastry shop 3 times. In one day. Within a span of 3 hours.\n\nThat should sum up my feelings about this place. Absolutely delicious, quaint, and reasonably priced bakery. I am a sucker for anything with custard, so, on my first visit, I ordered one napoleon thinking it would be enough to share with my mom. They say sharing is caring, but, upon the first bite, I just wanted the whole thing to myself. So so yummy. The bakery uses real whipped cream (which gets many points in my book) accented with the floral savoriness of good quality vanilla extract. The custard was the perfect texture and the flakiness of the puff pastry was spot-on. All of the components eaten together was perfection. \n\nI also tried the lemon tart, raspberry hazelnut tart, and apple tart. All were very good, but I would definitely recommend getting the lemon tart. I also hear the chocolate version of the napoleon is delicious, but it was sold out by the time I got there.\n\nWhat I also love about this store is the very friendly service. From the complimentary coffee to the warm smiles that greet you upon entering the store, the people who work there are passionate and care deeply about what they do in giving you the best experience possible.\n\nHighly recommend this place in Cleveland!
