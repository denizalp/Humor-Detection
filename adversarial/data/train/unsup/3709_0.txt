I wish I would have read these reviews before going. I would have stayed clear. My initial visit was good. Even though I had to wait a bit, the nurses and Dr. Colwell seemed nice. I had an IUD put in which went well.\n\nUnfortunately, I started getting infections. I had to visit twice. Both times I scheduled with Dr. Colwell, but was told at the last minute I could only see a nurse practitioner. On my second visit, she suggested I may have Chlamydia and sent a test, even though I know my husband and I don't have it. She never once thought well maybe my body was rejecting the IUD. I later had it removed.\n\nNow today I went for an appointment and I was handed a bill for $950. My insurance had rejected the prior claims because they submitted them 5 months after the service. I called my insurance and they said I did not have to pay a dime since the fault was on their shoulders. Now I have to go to urgent care because they wouldn't treat me.\n\nStay away!
