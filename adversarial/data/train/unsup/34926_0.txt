My family went on the West Rim tour about 2 weeks ago with Dwayne as our guide. He was great! He was enthusiastic and funny and kept us entertained for the whole ride. We were picked up right on time from our hotel and got a small breakfast on the bus. There were just enough stops to stretch our legs and use the bathroom and the trip went by relatively quickly. There is a lot to see when you get to the canyon and 3 hours is a perfect amount of time to spend. We would definitely recommend this tour to anyone!
