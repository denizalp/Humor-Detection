Federal Galley is a smash hit. It's everything you love about Smallman Galley, but with a few differences. \n\nSome of the newly departed chefs from Smallman are here, for example,  Stephen Eldridge and Susan Cope from Provision. \n\nWe had a lot of fun ordering from mainly Provision and Supper. They both featured great vegetarian offerings. \n\nThe bar sure has some excellent craft beer on tap. I had a hard time deciding, but eventually settled on Dairy Potter, an American Double \/ Imperial Stout style beer brewed by Pizza Boy. \n\nIt's a very engaging dining experience, one that I highly recommend. \n\nThe high ceilings provide an expansive space, while Smallman Galley, especially in the bar area, can feel more cramped. \n\nWe had fun ordering dishes to share. I hope you enjoy your visit as much as we did ours.
