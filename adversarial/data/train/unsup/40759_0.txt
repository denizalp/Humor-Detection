Went on a Saturday, had to wait about 25 min for a table. Waiter was fantastic, but was unsure of the liquors carried in the bar. Deviled eggs were amazing, probably the best part of the meal. Do not recommend the Caesar salad at all. It resembled the bagged Caesar salad at Walmart, and cost $10.00. In fact, the Walmart salad has way more flavor, how sad. Added on the grilled shrimp for $5.00 more, but didn't receive the shrimp until half the meal was finished. Good sized shrimp, but paid $5.00 for 5. Seems a bit steep for what you get, $15.00 total. No offer to remove the shrimp from the bill for the mistake, either. House drink specials are $10.00 and extremely weak. Manager came to the table to check on us (nice touch), unfortunately it was before we received our meal. Not for us.
