The guy behind the counter was a dick. Maybe its the fact im a cute female, so theres no way I could be a actual gamer in his eyes. I bought 2 Call of Duty Black Ops 2 games for PS3 yesterday, he was not nice & he didnt even offer the map pack package like he did everyone else before me. I just appreciate a friendly attitude especially since Ive spent a large amount of $ in that store on Triton Headsets, Bat Man Arkham City, Halo 4 etc etc...
