You don't need me to write a story since as you can see from the other two hundred and something reviews that this place clearly rocks. Classy, sexy, tasty, delightful, scrumptious, romantic, plush...it's the type of place that makes you want to walk around with an expensive glass of cognac..Which we did...\n\nLover said the crab cakes here where the best he had ever had, calamari was on point. They have a goat cheese spinach salad that makes my mouth water and the steak was juicy, tender and cooked exactly how we ordered it.\n\nLove!
