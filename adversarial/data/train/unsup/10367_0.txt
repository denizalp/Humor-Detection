Friday Happy Hour.  Good sized crowd but not all the tables were full.....was able to park close to the door....not bursting at the seams, not crazy-busy.  Food was good but not great.  Had boneless wings, nachos, and 5 kinds of bruschetta at the table.  Wings were good but dipping sauces were sad (cilantro lime crema had no flavor beyond crema; pub cheese dip had fantastic smoked cheddar flavor followed by what tasted like a belch of hot Guinness in your throat...definitely awful); bruschetta was well made but not always well conceived..... sometimes flavors did not go together as well as one might have imagined.  Nachos were only half eaten.\n\nService was terrible.  One in our party ordered lemonade and it took 15 minutes to get to the table.  Bleu cheese dipping sauce never made it to the table even with 2 reminders.  Asked for a fork and napkin; was never brought either; ended up using someone else's napkin when she had done with it.\n\nI have to comment on the uniforms worn by the female employees.  I understand the spirit of the outfits, a-la Hooters.  Not all bodies are made for booty shorts and tank tops, and no respectable boss should expect their 45-looks-like-60 year old bartender to wear them with pigtails.  From a distance of maybe 50 feet, she looked like a cute 23 year old.  Up close she looked like the Cryptkeeper.  I'm sure she's a crackerjack bartender; please let her wear something age appropriate.\n\nWhile we didn't feel a strong negative about the place, we generally agreed we would probably spend our happy hours elsewhere.
