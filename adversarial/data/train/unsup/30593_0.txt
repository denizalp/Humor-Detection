My Mom wanted them to come out and take a look at her AC system, she had recently purchased the home.  I happen to be there when the work was being done.  The tech was really nice and took the time to explain everything to my Mom.  He didn't find anything wrong and with the system, and gave her some pointers like not using the more expensive filters as they strain the system.  They were very professional.
