It's interesting when I get a chance to see how drunk and horrible my friends are at singing, so I come here pretty often. The rooms vary from large to small depending on how many people you have, the smallest being able to comfortably accommodate 5 or 6. \n\nTheir check in offers are pretty good as well! And the prices are very reasonable.\n\nAlso check ins get fee hot sale or free shaved ice woot woot!
