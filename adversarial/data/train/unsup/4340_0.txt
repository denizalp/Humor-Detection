If you have a vagina and you know it, clap your hands *clap clap*.\n\nI don`t know too many gynecologists that have as many reviews on Yelp as Dr. Moss does and that is precisely what drew me to her in the first place. After a nightmare of a doctor consultation here in Las Vegas earlier in the year, I thought I wouldn`t be able to find a doctor I would feel comfortable looking at my lady bits with. I was wrong(Yeah, I said it). Thanks to Yelp and it's trusty community of amazing reviewers, I was able to book an appointment with Dr. Moss and check off another box on my \"adulting\" checklist. Since I DO love lists so much, I`ll do this review in that style. \n\n1. Important notes first: Dr. Moss now only does gynecology and she ONLY takes cash or BCBS insurance(I lucked out on this one, because that is the type of insurance I happen to have at this time).\n\n2. If you are a no show for whatever reason, they will never see you as a patient in the future. They let me know this when I first made my appointment and I was \"Dang that is harsh, yo\", but then I appreciated it because it told me that they are a quality office not looking to fuss with people who are not going to value their appointment slot. If you have an emergency and cannot make it in, CALL them ASAP. \n\n3. Now onto the good stuff. The office is in a nice little medical plaza and is upstairs(take the elevator). The waiting area is kept cold and is clean with plenty of magazines and a t.v. The receptionist was nice enough and check in was a breeze. They do take your photo the first time, for your file. I was not prepared for this, so I probably look a hot mess.\n\n4. You'll first be taken back to a room with an assistant who takes your blood pressure, height, weight, and asks what you are there for(for my vaj!) Is it your first time? See number 5. If not, see number 6.\n\n5. You'll meet with the doctor, in her office, before the exam. There will be a quiet assistant there, taking notes on a laptop. I wasn't weirded out by this at all, even though I felt like I might be somewhere else(question mark). Here were my initial thoughts on the doctor: super easy to talk to, compassionate, listens to your questions and answers thoughtfully, concerned about the patient's health and background. I found her to be really personable, which I was nervous about. I didn`t feel awkward discussing my medical history or anything related to my life that she asked about.\n\n6. The exam. *dun dun duuuuun!* Honestly this was the most \"awesome\" pap smear\/pelvis exam\/medical breast feel up I've ever had. That is saying a lot because I loved my last doctor so much. The exam room was comfortable, not too cold. You get the standard gown(work it, honey!) that you leave open in the front with a lovely paper drape for your nether regions. She starts with a breast exam and moves onto a tummy and upper pelvic exam. All very gentle and she talks to you during the exam so you aren't looking around aimlessly while someone touches you. Then she will get your legs up in the stirrups(oh joy) and she does the pap smear(and whatever else you need done down there). It is all very quick and painless(at least for me). I was honestly surprised how smooth it all went.\n\n7. This is where you part ways and put your clothes back on(no walk of shame necessary). I did end up having to pay a $20 copay for a specialist because we discussed some things other than \"standard\" wellness exam discussion, but it was no big deal. Just know that if you mention anything out of the ordinary, you will be charged a copay. I`m happy to hand over a copay for such an awesome doctor.\n\nIf you need someone \"under the hood\", so to speak, I highly recommend Dr. Moss.
