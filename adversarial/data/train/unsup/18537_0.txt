Sienna Mercato is a 3 story Italian restaurant and bar. On the first floor they specialize in meatballs but you can get appetizers, soups, and sides to go with it. The second floor which wasn't open during my visit is an upscale Italian restaurant. The top floor is an outdoor bar.\n\nSince I was downtown and had little time to catch a show I opted for eating on the first floor. The waiter was very nice and went over the 5 different types of meatballs they offer. Meatballs are normally $3.50 each but if you are really hungry you can save more if you buy 4 and of course you can make a sandwich out of it.\n\nThe meatballs come with your choice of sauce. I decided to go with the chicken meatballs and a side of broccoli with parmesan cheese on top. Believe me those meatballs very delicious and the broccoli spears big and very tasty. Two meatballs as sufficient for me and my waiter very extremely attentive to my needs and my having to be out of there to catch my show.\n\nI really enjoyed eating on the first floor and hope to return in the future to try out their second floor restaurant next time I'm in the city. It is located in the 900 block of Penn Ave downtown and there are other restaurants in the vicinity to try.\n\nDefinitely worth the visit! Food was out of this world good!
