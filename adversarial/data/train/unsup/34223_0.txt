Aw man... I hate writing bad reviews but the food is pretty bad. \nMy husband and I dropped in this morning for breakfast - we both agreed this was basically a Denny's. \nThat said, our server was wonderful. I think she's the bartender too. Our drinks were great!! This lady was fun, outgoing, just amazing. Wish we'd liked the food so we could go see her again!
