I stayed here for four nights, and if I hadn't prepaid for the stay I would've changed hotels. The staff was nice and my bed was comfortable but the towels were thin and scratchy enough to exfoliate your whole body. \nDon't expect daily housekeeping of more than a swap of towels and call ahead if you do need anything. \nThe walls are thin enough to hear your neighbor's tv, talking, and headboard banging recreation. We were super lucky to hear an upstairs guest proclaim his love of Las Vegas in the wee morning hours.
