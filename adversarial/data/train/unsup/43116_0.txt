Came for the spaghetti special. It literally took me 45 minutes to get it and I sat and watched a total of three other tables come in, get served and actually leave\nNobody checked on me and I actually had to go and ask what was going on with my spaghetti that typically takes six minutes to make and since it was the special I figured they had it prepared.  \n\nThe pizza is just OK. it's very expensive but one thing that's consistent is the service is typically slow and the staff is not very attentive.  Unfortunately, the reason that we go there is because it's nearby no other option and I think they know that.\n\n\n\n\nWe have lived in AZ since 2012. I honestly have tried to give this place a fair opportunity.  I started calling tonight to order a pizza before 830 pm. The phone rings and rings until it disconnects. I do this 4-5 times and based on the this site states is open until 9pm.  I literally drive there and the phone is still ringing and a lady was out front and she said we are closed. I said when? She said 830. I said I have been calling since before 830 and no one answers.  I even shared this has happened before.  There were still employees inside.  I am convinced they ignore the phone for it has happened a few times before.  Both times the staff said the phones have issues.  Turn up the ringer or answer it.  I'm done with this place.
