My mistake for ordering a dozen oysters in Wisconsin.  I got the #2 tower and the shrimp were the best part.  The crab legs were not very succulent and almost seemed like they had been frozen for too long; the meat was a little mushy.  The oysters seemed OK going down, but I had terrible food poisoning later that night as my body rid itself of all of them.\n\nI love seafood so I will probably try it again, but next time I'll stay away from the oysters.\n\nTwo stars because it has a great atmosphere.
