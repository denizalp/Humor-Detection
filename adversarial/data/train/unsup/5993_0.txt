I really LOVE this place!!! It's a great bar and grill! It's great for date nights, day drinking  & even family dinners. \n\nThey have a shuffle board table, a couple pool tables, a couple Golden Tee machines and you can play music from your phone with their jukebox. \n\nThey have a couple patios! There are single person bathrooms in the bar area and there are some on the regular restaurant side. Tons of tv's everywhere!\n\nWe enjoy their happy house and daily specials!\n\nI personally love their fries and ranch to dip them in! Yum! I'm a picky ranch person- otherwise I love Bleu cheese. Their Big Zipp burger is AMAZING!!! My favorite around! My husband loves their green chili burger and orders nearly every time!\n\nThey have quite a few beers and my husband always orders their zipparitas. They usually have great happy hours for them also. \n\nI've been here many times and I love it. I forget to check in sometimes but we love it here. Family or just date night, we enjoy it. We usually leave in an Uber tho! Lol I think it's a sign of a good time! Hahaha\n\nY'all can come watch NFL games here, but they don't show the UFC fights if you're wanting to watch them. However, I think they should.\n\nIf y'all come here, I think y'all will like it! Xoxo
