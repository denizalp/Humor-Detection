Teharu Sushi is a family-favorite. It's a great place to get \"discount sushi.\" I've been visiting here for years now and I've seen some great improvements--the music that used to blaring loud is now reduced and the overall hygiene of the restaurant has seemed to improve. The Haru poppers here are amazing and is the first thing I order every time. \nThe service, however, can be improved. Some servers are respectful but others barely speak or smile at you, and just don't look at all happy.\nOverall, I like this place a lot and the prices are great for college students.
