1 star is a bit generous here..\n\nFirst off, if you're from out of town, you might get lost trying to locate this place.  The GPS dings but where the hell is it?!  After circulating the street for a while...AHAA there it is!!  It's located right behind the main street in a sketchy strip mall.  It would have helped if they light up their sign on the big street or cut down the tree blocking it (I say fix the freakin' sign).  But no worries, this place has no shortage of patrons.  There was a long line even on a weeknight.  We waited close to an hour.  Normally I would not wait to eat this kind of food but I was with family and one of them was craving Thai.  During our wait there was a car getting broken into.  Wait, did I already say the location is sketchy?\n\nSERVICE:  Bad.  We asked for extra spoons that never came.  The food took 30 minutes to come out.  While fuming, I saw two ladies who got seated way after us getting their food first.  And they actually had the audacity to tip themselves 18%!\n\nFOOD:  mediocre at best!  We had the usual pad Thai, pad see ew, rad na, Thai fried rice, etc., and there was nothing special to write home about.  And the portions are tiny!  Growing up in southern CA where there's no shortage of Thai restaurants, I'm use to leftovers.  We left hungry because we didn't want to wait another 30 minutes to order extra.  And oh yeah, it's expensive.  Not worth it and I won't be coming back.
