Best breakfast, pastries, and lunch in town. Added bonus they are ALL gluten free. This is the motherland for people like me who have celiac. 0 chance of contamination here. The wait staff are all amazing, and they offer new specials every month! Just got their newest addition, sweet crepes for breakfast, and they are Devine !!! Go see how great they are for yourself.
