VIVA LAS VEGAS!!\n\nafter hearing so much about this steakhouse, my gf's and i had to give it a try last year during a bachelorette party.  it's the place to see and be seen.\n\ndue to the sheer size our party, we took advantage of the special the restaurant offers for bachelorette parties - we sat around the circular bar (smack dab in the middle of the restaurant).  $75-$100 a head gets you a great meal w\/ champagne toast and VIP entrance into RAIN.\n\nthe steaks were great and just melts in your mouth.  \n\n***the stars LOVE this place...just as we were entering the restaurant, we ran into the husbands to the \"desperate housewives\".  also dining there that night was dule hill & wife (of west wing fame).  mind you, this was only around 7:30PM...you can only imagine the madhouse it would have been later on in the night.***\n\neye candy for both the guys and gals...be careful, your food may get cold if you're too busy checking out who's at the bar (hehe)!
