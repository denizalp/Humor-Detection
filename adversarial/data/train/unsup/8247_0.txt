It is with a heavy heart that I demote Kazimierz to three stars.\nAs I mentioned in my previous post, it's where I have great memories, met my husband, and, still, I think, it has a great romantic atmosphere.\n\nBut the waitstaff is turning into a bunch of serious DBs and the wine is really starting to suck.\n\nHere's the thing: I'm willing to spend money for a good glass of wine. I don't have enough money to spend, say, $25 a glass. But I can spend $12. And I know that, for $12, I should be able to get a glass of decent wine.\n\nYet everything I've ordered from Kazimierz the last 4 times I've gone has tasted awful. Awful, as in, \"tastes-like-the-$6-Tunisian-wine-I-bought-in-downtown-Mesa-and-then-left-in-my-fridge-for-three-weeks-to-use-as-cooking-wine-and-then-tasted-as-I-poured-into-my-ratatouille-awful.\"\n\nIt's great they have unusual offerings, like wine from Montenegro and Lebanon - but why does it have to taste rubbery? And the malbec I had last time was absolutely horrendous.\n\nNot only that, but what's with the reserved table thing? Every time they have NO space for us when we go as early as 8 p.m. Yet we can't make reservations unless we have a party of 5 or more. Even though they have talbes FOR TWO with \"reserved\" signs on them.. Hmm...So... that means we can't go? ok....\n\nLong story short, atmosphere will only take you so far. If you're a wine bar, you need better wine. Try tasting it before you put it on your menu. I realize that once in a while, I might not like the wine - but this many times is just getting ridiculous.
