Well, it's still here, the relatively close Lowe's has yet successfully torpedo Busy Beaver's ship. On our way to Lowe's with Kay's father to purchase some toilet parts just days after a crisis involving our water heater (crisis after crisis...do yinz see why I relate to superheroes?), I spotted Busy Beaver's sign on Library Road and decided to shorten our trip by helping out a David rather than a Goliath. \n\nSo thanks for having what I needed at a fair price and for sticking around.
