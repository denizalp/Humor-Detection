I had a late lunch this afternoon at Scaddabush.  It's been open since last April.  I'd had lunch there a few times when it was an Alice Fazooli's so I experienced a bit of déjà vu.\n\nI ordered what I usually get at a Scaddabush ... an Americano pizza.  I love love love pizza and they make good pizzas.  Today mine was delicious ... cheesy and loaded with pepperoni.  The chef had neglected to put the Scaddabush spice on it and I was okay with that as I sometimes request it without it.\n\nThe service was just okay, though.  My server was pleasant but I felt a bit neglected.  Once my pizza was dropped off at my table, I didn't see her again until it was time to pay, even though there were only a few tables of people.  I could have used another pop but she didn't check up on me to see if I needed one.  I could hear a few of the servers chatting and laughing so I knew they were around.
