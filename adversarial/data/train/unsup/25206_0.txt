All the stories of deliciousness I've heard about Taco Y Taco were true! The tacos taste amazing & they have a ton of meat options. My favs were al pastor & chicharrones w\/ everything on top. The elote (Mexican street corn) is fantastic & the atmosphere is cool too. Thankfully it wasn't super busy when I went in, so I didn't have any issues but I here that it can be hectic ordering sometimes when it gets packed. Busy or not the food would be worth the wait to me.
