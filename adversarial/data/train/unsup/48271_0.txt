This Country Inn and Suites hotels is comparable to others in the chain..  it's pretty clean, and quiet.  It's a simple hotel, with basic amenities.  The breakfast was o.k., and the pool and workout facilities were good.\n\nI was a little disappointed with the service from the front desk however..  we had trouble with the toilet running continuously, and asked the front desk if it could be fixed.  This was on a Saturday afternoon, and the front desk informed us that they were unwilling to call a maintenance person, and that we would have to handle the problem ourselves.  We were able to deal with the issue, but thought a national-brand hotel would have reacted better.
