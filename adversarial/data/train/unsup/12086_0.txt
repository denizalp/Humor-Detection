Last review from my Vegas trip.\n\nWent here for our last dinner in Vegas before hitting up Marquee.\n\nThis restaurant is far off the strip. Heading over here we did pass by the \"Pawnstars\" shop & the wedding chapel that they used for \"The Hangover.\" Pretty cool! Also the self-proclaimed \"World's Biggest Souvenir Shop.\" Place was HUUUUGE! So I wouldn't doubt the name at all.\n\nWalking into the hotel this restaurant was located in was AWKWARD. Apparently that hotel attracts the OLDER crowd. I didn't see anyone our age at all. What made it eve more AWKWARD was that we were dressed in clubbing clothes so all the older people were staring at us like we were hookers or something. lol. Walking into the restaurant got us lots of stares since we were severely over-dressed & looked out of place. Besides that, here goes my experience.\n\nI ordered the chicken teriyaki, musubi combo. It comes with 2 MUSUBI'S! Yummy! The macaroni salad was sooooo good! The chicken teriyaki, WOW. They were not stingy when it came to portions. I ate as much as I could since we were going to be drinking alot that night & it still looked like I didn't even put a dent into it.\n\nThe prices are unbelievably low. I guess going off the strip makes things a little cheaper.\n\nI would go here again, just sayin'
