This isn't a menu, it's a food bible. What an amazing eclectic place, I can't wait to go back, I wanted to try everything, especially the Banana Crab Croquettes. If you don't know what what a banana crab is, it's what 1950's scary movies were made of. They were the most dangerous things at my home around banana plants in Florida. They were the most scariest looking beasts I ever encountered during my childhood, and I never knew you could eat them. Now I want to eat my fears and that is the deadly Banana crab. I suggest you Google them just to take a look at what they look like and you'll say my God.\n\nBut back to the Mission. It has great ambience and a great vibe to it, as I thought it would be a rundown all restaurant that caters to tourists, au contraire Mont Freire.\n\nI sat at the bar and the bar service was exceptional, but it was the food that really excited me everything looked amazing and every time I brought it up to the bartender he said hey dude everything here is excellent I can't recommend anything as it's all good. So it was a hard decision I got the pesola soup which was just out of this world and I got the short rib tacos, and they were Great but I felt as if I needed more but I was so full and I was so in love with the menu I didn't know what to do. The more I looked at the menu the more I wanted stuff, so I realized I would just have to go back and eat and eat and eat.\n\nThe chef here really has to be commended for creating such an interesting menu. I lived in Mexico for a year and I didn't even see anything close to what he had. It may have been the same food but his menu is written like a romance novel. It's what other restaurants need to copy when they develop their menu it is so beautifully written that you definitely want to order what you last read.
