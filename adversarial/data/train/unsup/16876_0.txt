Yay @ILVYOGURT! I love yogurt and so why wouldn't I love a place called \"I love yogurt\" Hehe!\n\nAhh this place is so cool both in terms of their cool, refreshing yogurt and also cool in the sense of their theme. This yogurt place is dedicated to the 80s. Talk about funky and fresh- this place is unique. Hot pink, neon green, sky blue and bright yellow is all over this place in terms of their walls, chairs and even their spoons and cups. They have a wall dedicated to old school candy and other goodies like hot wheels. They have tables where you can play connect four and other games. They have posters with 80s cartoons like the Garbage Pail Kids and Teenage Ninja Turtles.They have an autographed picture from Chuck Norris and Charlie Sheen. It's a total blast from the past.\n\nEven their yogurt offerings have cool 80s names for their flavors. Among some of the ones I saw were: \"Super Mario Power Mix: Strawberry cheesecake\" and \"Capn Crunch Peanut Butter.\" They have \"Chuck Norris\" flavors of the week and a \"Holly Madison's favorite: Cake Batter.\" The neat and unique names make it a lot of fun picking out what yogurt flavor to pick!\n\nThey have a variety of toppings to choose from such as mochi, cheesecake bites, candy, animal crackers, diffferent nuts and fruit and many more. They even have strawberry fizz! Fun! You can also top your yogurt off with different syrups.\n\nYogurt is 36 cents an ounce which is a little pricier than some yogurt places but it wasn't too bad because we got two yogurts for a little over $8. The yogurt combo I got of cake batter\/peanut butter\/cake surprise\/cookies and cream topped with mochi, white chocolate and strawberry fizz was delicious!\n\nYay and because I love yogurt, I will be back to I love Yogurt!
