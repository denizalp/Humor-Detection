Kosher in the house!!! \nwhoooo hooo\nok with that being typed\nyou will have three types of customers here in the great city of Pittsburgh\none will be those that keep them selves strictly kosher and if that is the case you are going to LOVE eighteen (its eclectic dairy and sushi)\ntwo you will be in the need of a kosher (insert here parent child friend) and they need to eat kosher. \nThree would be the person that just does not know but no worries if you chose to eat here you will be pleasantly surprised at how tasty good kosher is so don't be scared go try. \nlocated on Murray ave parking can sometimes be a challenge its all metered\ninside its very calming white table clothes & a candle on each table \nit reminds me of a row house as seating is in a long row except for a little section that has 4 tables \nI have visited a few times the last visit the place was really hopping on a Tuesday night (because they keep some different hours I would recommend calling before going) on a prior visit Sushi chef was out for Chinese New Year\nMenu has lots of sushi offerings from rolls to full sashimi dinners to me that is what a love about this place. My caterpillar roll was very tasty. I love sushi.\nthey also have pastas such as Alfredo \nsalmons as a meal \nand for lunch fare they have salads and sandwiches one I have tried the beet reuben its a very cool concept but you must like beets I love beets but they were so generous with the beets I took a few off.\nOne visit I asked for ice tea which they did not have fresh  BUT the waitress said no worries she made me a refreshing mint tea fresh from tea bags\nwe have had their Cesar salad its nice and fresh and simple\nanother thing to give a try is shakshuka its a spicy egg dish made with harissa \nah the chocolate torte was very yum and my daughter said yup this is really nice.\nservice at eighteen has always been very friendly and with a smile\nthough at times it can be a bit slow....\nprices if your not used to eating at a good kosher place might seem a bit high it goes with the territory.
