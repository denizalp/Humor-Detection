I have been going here since it opened across the street from where they are now.  The best pizza I have had in my 66 yrs.  I no longer live in the delivery area but will make the trip to get this pizza every time.  They don't skimp on the toppings, you get plenty.  Never had to ask for extra cheese because they actually put a lot on it.   Don't know what that so called chef T.C. had but must have been a bad day.  I have never gotten a bad pizza from them.  Trust me when I say, you will love it.
