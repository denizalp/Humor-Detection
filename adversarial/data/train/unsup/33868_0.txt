I came to this spot with a friend for the 1st time about 2 months ago. We were the only 2 people in the restaurant. Made me a little nervous. Started out with a small chicken tom yum soup and an Asahi beer. Happy hour special so the beer was only $2.50! Then my entree. Yellow chicken curry (med). I was pleasantly surprised! The service was really good! Attentive and accommodating! The food was exceptionally awesome! Since that 1st visit I am now a loyal customer! The best part is that it's right down the street from my house! I'm all about this spot!!
