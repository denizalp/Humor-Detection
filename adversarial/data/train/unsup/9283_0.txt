Burgers Amore came to my work one day. I've heard of and have seen this truck a lot around the Valley. I was lucky enough to have forgotten my lunch that day. As I walked up they had just opened and the guys were working hard setting up. They put out fresh pickles, lettuce, onion, and tomato for you to put on your own sandwich, along with all kinds of condiments, even BBQ. All of which they kept covered and over ice. It was hard for me to decide what kind of burger I wanted. So I went with something I had never had before. A Black Bean Burger. It took no longer than 10 or so minutes and my Burger was ready. YUM!! I was pleasantly surprised, as I had been very nervous to even order it. For a burger made of mostly beans it held together very well and was full of flavor. Even had a nice char to it. It was topped with Guacamole and Pepper Jack Cheese that complimented the burger perfectly. Something I would surprisingly get again.
