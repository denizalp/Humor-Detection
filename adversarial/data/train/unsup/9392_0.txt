Makai is ma guy for Hawaiian food. I usually get the Ono'est (3 meats + 2 sides + rice). You really can't go wrong with anything here. \n\nMy favs: the chicken katsu, mochiko wings, poke (both regular and spicy), kimchee slaw, mac salad, and their garlic edamame. I've had the Pulehu steak twice, but they were dry both times.\n\nService is friendly and accommodating. Prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get. With the Ono'est, I usually have leftovers. \n\nWill most likely be back in a few days...
