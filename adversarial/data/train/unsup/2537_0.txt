Saved by the hostess. Palma greeted us with a warm and sincere smile when we walked in. We were off to a good start. The waitress was more blah, which probably related to it being late in her shift. \n\nMy son and I ordered two cheese pizzas, both of which came with salads. The salads were superb, but the pizza tasted very plain to me, and my son wasn't a fan. This was surprising for both of us because we love sweet and the sauce is very sweet. Additionally, it's the same owners as Brooklyn South, which we love. Just different.\n\nThe atmosphere is borderline perfect, the place is clean, and the hostess is excellent at her job, so 4 Stars. Palma told me the Chicken Parmesan is incredible. I'll be back to check it out, but at $22, it better come on a gold platter and have my first name written in the cheese. \n\nOn the way home, my son and I sang along to two rap songs:\n\n\"I only love my bed and my mamma\" \nand\n\"I got diamonds by the bollo.\"
