Yep, I mean, Yelp, this is one of those places. Indiana Jones? Jurassic Park? James Bond? No I'm kidding. This place is as good as it gets. It's a sleeper the kind you want to see but never had. To tell the truth you wont fall on your knees once inside, it is kind of smallish and not very much furnished but still it has more atmosphere than the Natural History Museum in London.\nGo see it, until people will remember the 21th century looking at some giant holographic screen in their planes taking them from London to New York in 45 minutes out of the Earth atmosphere thinking, yeah, that must have been some funny times bro.
