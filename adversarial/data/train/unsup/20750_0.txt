Live music, good food and drinks that's a perfect Saturday day night. I chose this spot for our main dinner for our bachelorette party. I wanted something lively and walking distance to old town where we could party after dinner. \n\nThe place was packed when we got in around 745pm. Luckily I made reservations ahead of time, the wait was 45 minutes. The interior is quite dim and loud. They have live music playing. This night it was a mix of country music. For dinner we went with their sweet corn ravioli, rainbow trout and 36 hour pork ribs. The food took a while to come out but they were busy. The drinks looked good too but we had a long night at the bard and clubs ahead of us so we skipped the drinks here. The sweet corn ravioli was delicious. It had a great creamy sauce, with a nice salty sweet savory flavor. The ribs were falling off the bone. The rainbow trout was cooked well and not dried out. Service was great they checked on us often. My only complaint was how hot it was inside. They have the AC on but they keep all the patio doors open so it doesn't hold any of that cold air inside. \n\nOverall, the food was delicious. And the live music was fun. It wasn't our favorite genre of music but it was still a fun lively environment. It just could have been cooler inside.
