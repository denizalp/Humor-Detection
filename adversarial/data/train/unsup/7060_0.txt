This club was a major disappointment, the second time I came here. The first time, I came here, this club was off the chain. They had lapdance beds, and had some nice, young, white woman, walking around that joint. As you can you see, from my first review, of this place, I had a good time. Well, it has changed, since then. I came in at 4pm, and the club was deader than a 85 year hooker, in Alaska. They had one stripper in there, that was about 6'2, that looked like former Boston Celtic, Kevin McChale. The bartender, was smoking HOT, though. When the bartender is the best looking girl in the club, that is not good. She is a sweetheart, as well. The D.J was really cool, too.One change, that I did like, was that this place, serves alcohol ,now. By the look of the strippers, in this place, I can see why.Now to all fairness, of this place, I left at like 7pm. I did see some cute strippers coming in, so Im not going to give up on this place, just yet. I just wish they could hire better looking strippers during the daytime.
