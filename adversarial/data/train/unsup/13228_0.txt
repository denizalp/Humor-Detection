Two things you'll see at Merc Bar on weekends: near-elderly masters of the universe picking up on gold diggers, and The Real Housewives of Maricopa County. Fantastic people watching, really. I once watched a bottle of Cris delivered to a table of grandpas in an ice bucket with neon chaser lights swirling around the bottom, a beacon to the 20-something +2s who promptly flooded their table with silicone and Jennifer Lopez perfume.\n\nThe vibe is a lot different on weeknights. Less crowded, of course. A little more hip, a lot less Barcelona. My now-husband and I came here on our first date, sipping martinis at a low table in the lounge area and fell for each other, so Merc holds a special place in my heart. But even without that, the atmosphere is great, dark and mysterious, and every drink I've ever had there has been exceptionally well-made.
