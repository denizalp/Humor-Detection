We decided to go out for a lite dinner tonight and we remembered this place. My family really enjoys this place plus we were trying to find a place to eat that had some soft food for my son since he got his wisdom teeth out. We walked in and the place was very clean and welcoming. \nI ordered the Triple Club and was a little leary cause I'm not a real fan of nine grain bread but sandwich was really good. It was just booming with flavor. The Asian Salad was very good and my daughter had the chicken pesto sandwich with a Cesar salad. She loves the sandwich and declared the Cesar salad as the best she eaten. Then my son gobbled up the pesto chicken with linguini. So the food was very good as always. \nThis place is becoming our favorite salad and sandwich place. Beats out Paradise Bakery.
