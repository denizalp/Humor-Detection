I'm glad that this place, one of the few eateries in the valley that specializes in Sichuan cuisine, serves really flavorful food with that spicy-tingly-slightly-numbing kick that can come only with the use of prickly ash, otherwise known as Sichuan peppercorns. Of course not all dishes they serve are that way; you can get mild dishes such as the fish fillet & egg white dish that I ordered; that one featured nicely seasoned, very tender fish fillets in a white sauce with ribbons of egg white. The servings are generous (I ordered the dan dan noodles as appetizer and it was listed as such, but it came as a meal-sized portion) so come with a big appetite. The atmosphere is relaxed, service is middling, and location is convenient (Chinese Cultural Center on 44th Street near the 202).
