Been here alot at this location but the place has been going down hill. Maybe new management, the floors walls and tables are very sticky and dirty, when u walk I slip and slide on the grease covered floors. My service has been nothing but mediocre. They forgot my kids dinner one time you cam see the dirty wipe marks on the the plates when they wipe thr edges off and the associates aurgu about imputting info in the computers. Only reason I came is that I had a coupon for kids eat free. I'm said to say but I'm not looking to come back.
