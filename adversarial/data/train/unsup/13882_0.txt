Moon Moo Life is a very interesting and unique business. The business offers many different activities that are active and great for personal wellness. The business is a learning and entertainment center for all ages that offers TaeKwonDo, Tai Chi, Latin Dance, Hip Hop, Aerial Yoga, Drawing & Painting, and Instrument\/Music Classes (Piano, Violin, Guitar, and Drum Classes. \n\nWhen we were there we had the opportunity of trying TaeKwonDo with Master Kim who is a 6th Degree Black Belt. She gave us lessons of discipline in TaeKwonDo  with our fists (Tae), kicks (Kwon), and the way of life (Do). She taught us techniques and the proper stances and found she was very fun and motivational. \n\nWe also tried the dance class which mainly consisted of Hip Hop Dance. We started of with stretching exercises and moved on to a bit of break dancing moves, and finally ended off with a bit of Krumping (my favorite muahaha). Josh was our main instructor and was very helpful in explaining the moves and helped in preventing people from being discouraged if they were unable to get the dance movements correctly on rhythm. He also stayed a bit in the end to show me a bit more which was greatly appreciated. If I wasn't so bad at dancing, I think I would want to continue.\n\nThe last activity we had the opportunity of trying was Aerial Yoga which was probably not my cup of tea, but YOLO! I tried it and enjoyed swinging in the air upside down. I was not able to do some of the more flexible movements but was able to do things involving more strength. \n\nWhile there were many activities were going on at the same time I found it a bit difficult to hear my instructors at times. I hope they are able to accommodate this communication barrier in the future. Overall a great venue, friendly staff, and a place to promote fitness\/wellness. If you haven't tried it out, I would highly recommend it. JimStar Out!!
