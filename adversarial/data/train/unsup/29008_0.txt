Stumbled upon this gem on Christmas Eve when I was taking my family to try Hot N Juicy Crawfish. We turned into the gas station to decide where we wanted to eat instead since they were closed. Looked across the parking lot and saw Urban Crawfish was open. I can honestly say I will never return to Hot N Juicy again after finding this place. The service, food , and prices were all amazing! We got Crawfish, shrimp, and snow crab. Every flavor and spice level we had was great! Even the bread was amazing! Mica was such a great server I told her I only wanted to return while she was at work. Her shift was over before we finished our meal and the rest of the staff took amazing care of us as well. Even danced with us! They're also open late! So glad we found this place!!! I can't wait to return!
