Mediocre food priced ridiculously. Service was bad, there was one server in the entire dining area. Thought going through my head all night and after: should've gone to mastro's. Probably never coming back, and wouldn't  recommend it. \n\nReally should've just gone to mastro's for the price we paid. \n\nI love going out to eat and I really don't mind paying but 2 so so cocktails, 2 blah apps, 2 okay entrees = $200 not worth it. \n\nShould've just gone to mastro's. I feel so much regret.
