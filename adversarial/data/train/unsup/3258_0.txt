WELCOME HOME TO \"BIG BROTHER.\"  I have lived in numerous upscale apartment complexes over the years, and never had an issue.  However, living at Canyon Villa is like living under the microscope of management.  The management routinely contacts law enforcement and provides them with the names and apartment numbers of residents who have out-of-state license plates on their vehicles.  Read other reviews from other websites and you will see that I am not the only one complaining of this practice.  I was on a temporary assignment in Nevada and received a notice on my vehicle regarding my out-of-state license plates that had been reported to law enforcement by management. This resulted in time and expense of having to go through the court process to explain the temporary nature of my residency.  One morning, I placed my trash outside my door for a period of 50 minutes and took it out when I went to work.  When I returned home from work, a manager notice was on my door instructing me not to leave my trash by the front door.  That means someone would have had to observe trash in front of my door from 8:00am to 8:50am.  I agree that trash should not be on the front door, but it is very disconcerting to know that management took notice during a 50 minute time frame.  I am a responsible pet owner who always picks up pet waste.  Another day I came home from work only to find a manager notice on my door regarding pet waste, a notice for which I was singled out merely because I am a pet owner.  Another time, I had placed storage bins on my patio.  I received yet another manager notice on my door instructing me that storage bins cannot be placed on the patio.  It was not a pleasant feeling to come home wondering what sort of notice would be on my door.
