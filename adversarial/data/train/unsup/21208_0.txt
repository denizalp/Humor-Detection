I'm not sure how this place is still open.  It's always empty.  But anyway, we went after work because we wanted to sit outside and our other usual spots had no available outdoor seating...so obviously, we found seats at tiki hut.  we sat down and received no service.  we went inside to get some sangria that was advertised to have \"fresh fruit\" - what is the fresh fruit....7up, i didn't know that lemon-lime flavoring was considered fresh fruit?  it was pretty terrible.  and the bartender was hanging with his friends and seemed to have no drink making experience - maybe he's only good at pouring beer?  Whatever the case, I will not be going back.
