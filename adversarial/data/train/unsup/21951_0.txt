I have only been here twice since this place was dubbed Linger Longer. I used to frequent 16th St Sports Grill (oh the days). I am absolutely amazed at how they transformed the space. It went from basically a warehouse looking thing to this trendy, hipster spot. The extra game room is a nice addition. Although it did remind me that I need to brush up on my dart skills! Playing ski ball and shuffle board really bring out the kid in you! Drinks were tasty and reasonably priced. Bartenders were super friendly and quick. They had a ton of tables inside and also a dance floor to get down on if you're so inclined!
