The food here is typical mexican food and good, but nothing I would rave about. Nothing to complain about either. I really come here for the great location and unique building. My daughter loves sitting by the fish tank and I always seem to find a new place to get a great picture of her every time I visit. There really are quite a few very good spots for taking pictures. Service is good and this place reminds me of what Mexican places were like when I was a kid which is not a bad thing:) I'm looking forward to sitting at the little bar or in the open air lounge and having a margarita one day when I make the trip kid free.
