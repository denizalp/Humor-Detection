One word. Disgusting.  The room was dirty from top to bottom  from the filthy carpet to the cigarette smell that would not go away and to top it off on our second day they cut the water to the room with no explanation as to why.  Thankfully we had done what we set out to do in Phoenix and decided to check out after the water was cut.  If you like dirty motels that try to pass themselves off as a \"hotel\/ innsuite\" this is the place for you.
