I wouldn't hire these guys on a bet.  I called them up to a first-time schedule to check-up on my system.  they scheduled me for a 9 to 12 appointment.  they showed up at 8 in the morning, never called (they claim the office never got my telephone number) , & just left a card.  When I called the tech back, he told me to re-schedule.  I told him that I didn't want their service because I didn't think they could do the job  because anyone that shows up at 8 (when I'm sleeping) and is suppose to be there from 9 to 12 and doesn't elven bother to have my telephone number to call, what else will they get wrong.  The tech got snotty with me because I wouldn't re-schedule and hung up. Real professional people , right?  I guess they have more business then they clan handle and don't need mine.
