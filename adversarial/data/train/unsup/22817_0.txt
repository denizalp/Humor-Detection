Took my oldest son here to look for some used tennis rackets because he wanted to try out tennis. I didn't feel the need to purchase new since it was probably going to stay in the closet, so we went here. I've been here before when I was looking for a driver to replace my old one. Anyway, I was taken aback by the prices for used tennis rackets. Obviously, I had no clue what to look for in a used racket, but then again, I wouldn't even know what to look for in a new one. With the help of the sales guy, we settled on two. I wasn't too bothered by the sticker shock considering he let my son fill up a whole plastic bag of used tennis balls. That was very generous and it made my son even more excited to play tennis. I'll come back again.  I think this location carries enough variety, although I probably would like to check out other locations.\n\nUpdate: The rackets are sitting in the shoe closet, haven't been moved in months.
