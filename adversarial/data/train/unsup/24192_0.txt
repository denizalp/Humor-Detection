This Winners has been around for at least a decade, I reckon. I have visited this store a number of times over the years. \n\nLast Saturday, I was meeting up with a friend and she needed a Winners store. We agreed to meet here, which is close to the movie theatre where we were headed to afterwards.\n\nThere is plenty of parking in this area with various box stores. I never have a problem finding a parking spot.\n\nI walked in. It looked the same as I remembered it. It's a bit shabby compared to other Winners, but it works.\n\nI liked the selection of size 11 women's shoes. There were even size 11.5 shoes, which was impressive. I saw a pair of UGG sandals with fur on the backstrap. Wow! And, no, I did not get them, even though they were in my size.\n\nMy friend made it and found me in said shoe section. She needed to use the washroom. Here's my gripe. This store is so old that there is only one public washroom for both men and women. Customers apparently don't realize that. My friend had to tell the woman going in after her that there is only one stall. My tip is to plan ahead if you want to use the washroom. My friend waited for seven minutes.\n\nAs far as selection goes, it depends on what you are looking for. This store does not carry any Kipling handbags. However, I liked the rose gold skull ring for my phone. The cell phone accessories section is decent. My friend got a new phone case for her iPhone 6.\n\nThe snacks and candy areas are perfect for me. I got sugar-free mints in both pomegranate and mint flavours. I brought the former flavour into work and these mints were a hit!\n\nI also found a Roomba vacuum at this store. It's a first for me!\n\nLining up to pay for my items on a Saturday afternoon wasn't bad. I was probably there for two minutes, paid, and left. I had a friendly staff member who helped me with cashing me out.\n\nI had a good experience here. It had what I needed.\n\n(367)
