I love this place. It's always busy so you can expect freshness unless you're coming during closing. Quite a selection of sweet and savoury. My favourites are croissant brûlée, and any of their croissants. Especially the salted egg ones. Get it heated up and it oozes out like lava. They also have an assortment of buns and bread like the typical pork floss, pizza, hotdog flavours. I think they discontinued the gangham knot which was kimchi and cream cheese bread. Sounds weird, but it really works. Hope they bring that back. Currently enjoying a cheesy, mushroom croissant. So flaky and rich. Pairing it with a new drink, hot purple potato latte. Does not disappoint. Service on fleet today. hahaha. The drink selection is not huge however. There's a patio in the summer and some seats inside.
