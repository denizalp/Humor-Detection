Attended a seminar in the back room conducted by a reputable financial advisor.  While I was to eat in the back room,  I noticed the SUPER AMAZING VIEWS while I walked through the restaurant.   So FLOURISH probably cannot be topped in terms of views.  But it goes downhill from there.  The service was lacking and the young lady with long dark hair had an attitude that was a cross between snotty, arrogant and rude.  I don't know who hired her but she is not material for interacting with humans. Let's call her Ms. Nasty.  The older female server was more pleasant and attempted to be accomodating.  Thank you for changing the salad to one without dressing.  \nThe company generously provided steak dinners for us except that the restaurant made them all well done. One diner at our table called the steak \"interesting.\"  When one of us asked to get his steak rare, Ms. Nasty said that was not possible.  So one of us chose not to eat an overdone piece of meat and Ms. Nasty gleefully took it back to the kitchen.  The dessert was a piece of overbaked chocolate cupcake with burnt edges, whipped cream and a sprig of mint.  The sprig of mint was delicious.   The other server graciously served all of us coffee with a smile and without an attitude.  \nIt is such a shame that this amazing location and view is overshadowed by badly prepared food and  super poor service.
