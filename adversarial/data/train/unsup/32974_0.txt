Been going here since it opened. Love the wide range of colors & the staff. Victoria is super enthusiastic and I can tell she loves what she does; Jasmine is super talented with designs especially. It is clear that Kristy has a great team and is an amazing nail technician and business woman! Highly recommend this salon
