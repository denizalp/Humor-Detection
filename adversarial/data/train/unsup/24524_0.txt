As a native Clevelander and my Ukrainian ancestors blood running through my veins, I can only ask \"Dear God - Pepperoni Pierogi? WHYYYYYY!!!!\" (camera panning back to focus in on my open, screaming mouth)\n\nFor the uninitiated and the uninformed, these pierogis are *not good*.\n\nThey are, in fact, terrible.   \n\nThe dough is too thick and fills your mouth with the most unappealing flour-y taste.  The \"crimp\" along the side is way too huge - thereby accenting the \"I ate too much peanut butter\" mealy-, clumping feeling.  The various \"flavors\" provided - like pizza - are not generous and fresh-tasting.\n\nIf you want very good, authentic pierogi in the West Side Market - visit Irene Dever's Dairy.   They have the traditional varieties (potato, cheese - not cheddar cheese but sweet'ish, dry cottage cheese, sauekraut, and the barely authentic potato\/cheese mix.  If you call ahead, you can order prune (very good - try it) or apricot.    If you are very motivated - drive to St. Josephat's Ukrainian Church on State Road and buy pierogi from the little old ladies in the back building.  There are over a dozen of them seated at long tables, hand-making these treasures.   Call ahead as they are not open every day.\n\nPizza pierogi?  Never.  'Nuff said.
