My girlfriend and I stayed here last week. She was able to snag a really good deal on Groupon in which we paid about $45\/night for a nice suite. The room itself was great, especially the bed. The TV was kind of junky and the remote was broken, but other than that I have no qualms about the room itself.\n\nWhat I do have a qualm about is being harassed by little dirt bags trying to sell timeshare. Apparently the Riviera has some sort of partnership with a timeshare investment company called \"TLC\". They station their representatives in a central location by the check-in desk and harass young couples. One of their little cretins ran up to my girlfriend and I and told us that he would give us free tickets to a show. We asked what the catch was, in which he told us there was \"absolutely no catch\". He then proceeded to tell us that we would get comped free show tickets and a food voucher if we sat in on a 1 hour presentation the next day (wait, I thought there was no catch?). \n\nAfter we kindly said no and tried walking away, the TLC representative became very aggressive and told us \"Are you guys really that dumb? You guys are going to pass on an opportunity like this?\" I googled this company and they have a lot of consumer complaints and scam alerts. Looks like I'm not the dumb one, sir, you are for pedaling this crap for a living :)\n\nThe reason we were in Vegas was to get away from our everyday lives of dealing with all of life's unnecessary BS, including dealing with solicitors. We paid to stay at the Riviera so we could get away from stuff like this. The fact that we were being harassed and insulted by solicitors that are in partnership with this hotel we are paying to stay at is disturbing and flat-out tacky. I don't expect to come back to this place again.\n\nThe only reason this gets a 2 star rating is for the price and for the nice bed.
