It's BS:\n\nThey accept walk ins\n\nThey don't accept reservation \n\nI was the 3 rd on in the shop \n\nOut of no where suddenly after 3 people walked in (because of their superior online check in system ) I'm suddenly the 8th one.  First I was supposed to wait 20 min max and now I'm here for an hour and I still have a bunch of people ahead of me \n\nWould you come here????\n\nI guess only if you have nothing to do and love to waste time \n\nGo to ****cutting edge****\n\nAt least that's worth the wait \n\nAnd not ever any yelling customers
