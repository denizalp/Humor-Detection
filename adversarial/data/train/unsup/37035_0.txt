Good food and beer!  Great place before a game. They serve food as it is done so people will get food at different times. Sounds odd but it works. We shared and tasted different dishes. The time between meals being delivered was not long either. I had the cheddar sausage. Delicious and spicy!  My husband ordered the pierogi flatbread. Not bad but only lightly reminiscent of a pierogi. Enjoyed the CLE Pilsner and Repeater brew. There's indoor and outdoor seating.
