Easily the most well known gas station anywhere near campus. Easy walk or quick drive from campus. Good prices and always stocked with cheap alcohol as well. Be prepared for the painfully slow pumps though. \n\nIf someone asks, \"are you going to Gas?\" Then this is the place they mean. I've heard their corned beef sandwiches are surprisingly good also. Might have to try one if I feel bold enough!
