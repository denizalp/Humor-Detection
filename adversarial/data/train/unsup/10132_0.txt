The Pyramid Cafe should be considered an alternative for guests looking for something more than the meager offerings of the food court and Starbucks.\n\nLocated on the casino level of the Luxor, the menu offers breakfast, lunch, and dinner fares, for which I'm sure most will find something to their liking.  Although not extensive, the menu does have appetizers, sandwiches, salads, and desserts as well.\n\nOn this most recent visit, my cousins and I were looking more for snack versus an actual meal.  Altogether we ordered the classic caesar salad, quesadillas, onion rings, and buffalo hot wings.   All items were satisfactory and our hunger pains soon went the way of all the money I fed into the slot machines........gone and away.\n\nSERVICE:  Quite good actually.  The server that helped us was an older female, but she had a very positive and enthusiastic attitude.  I appreciated the fact that she apologized for the lateness of our food because of a delay in the kitchen.  She also provided drink refills in a timely manner and checked up on us frequently to see how we were doing.\n\nBottom Line:  As a guest of the Luxor, I would recommend the convenience of the Pyramid Cafe.
