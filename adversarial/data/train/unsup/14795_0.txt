What a disappointment. \n\nI guess the tray of chips ahoy cookies was a nice touch...\n\nI was disappointed by the display of ice cream in a small freezer that had everyone bending over into it and reaching their hands into it..that seemed to scream dont eat this...\n\nhard chicken... hard sugar dumplings.. I'll just keep driving by next time..\n\n$9.95 for a dinner buffet...when I received the bill..it was a piece of paper that said $22.15..not itemized out..
