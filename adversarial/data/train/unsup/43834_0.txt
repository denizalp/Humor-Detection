Came to this place a few months ago with my kids. We were stamped on the arm with huge numbers. This immediately reminded me of the numbers that were tattooed on the arms of people in the holocaust. This was a way for Jews to be identified in the concentration camps. We informed the lady at the front. We weren't sure if she was aware of it. She said that many people have said the same thing and that they were only open for a few months. She was very defensive. \nI tried my very hardest to just ignore it but the huge numbers on my arm and my daughters arm made it hard to ignore. \nI emailed the owners before writing a review on Yelp. I told the owner that I would be happy to help them figure out a different solution. I informed them that Chuck E Cheese has a similar procedure and maybe they can follow the way they check people in. I never received an email back from the owner. I don't even know if they are fully aware of what is going on in their facility nor do I think they care. \n\nI will not be returning with my kids until this is fixed.
