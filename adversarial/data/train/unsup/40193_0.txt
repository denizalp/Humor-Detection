Although walking up the stairs it smelt like toilet.... it was pleasantly surprised with a great time playing pool with friends on a Thursday evening.\n\nThere's snooker tables and 8 ball tables. It seems intimidating when you first walk in, but it's friendly, and seems like a good alternative than trying to compete with people at a bar for a pool table. \n\nIf you squint your eyes, you might be able to see the smoke clouds that used to line the ceiling. But it's nice that all that is gone. \n\nThey have a full bar, with beers.
