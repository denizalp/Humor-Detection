We were in the mood for Asian food, and the Concierge at my hotel offered Social House as an option. The bar area is pretty spacious if you prefer not to wait for a table. The wait was not excessive, and the hostess was very attentive with frequent updates while we were waiting at the bar. Our server had many options for us, and we loved the sake. We tried a good amount of sushi and grilled vegetables, that were cooked well. We will definitely return to Social House when we go back to Vegas.
