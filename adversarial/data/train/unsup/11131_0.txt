The staff was ok, but their customers must all be on Crack because the one behind me got his order put it in his car then looked at me and called me a bitch in parking lot, and proceeded to cuss me out ...the reason ..I still don't know, then a van pulls up with a couple in it he is yelling at her saying why the 'F' did you order from here, he gets out the car slams the door, and last the delivery guys are in the parking lot arguing (THE ARE ACTUALLY SITTING IN SEPARATE CARS ARGUING ) well one gets mad at the other and speed off.This is a Zoo!! I'm sitting in my car waiting for my pizza now all this just actually happened!! Now I'm looking in the place the staff is laughing and dancing...Wow where is management! !! I guess this would be my last time whether the food is good or not!
