I had just finished telling Crystal H about the omnipresent crowds at Dutch Dreams when we walked past and witnessed a contradictory sight: no one was there. Even though we were both stuffed to our necks in fried chicken, I knew this was not an opportunity that should be squandered. We rushed through the front door and within a minute a sturdy line had formed behind us, making an un-liar out of me, and solidifying us as winners of a Thursday night iced cream lottery.\n\nBut on to Dutch Dreams. What a krazy kaleidoscope this place is. You could spend an eon gorging your retinas on the colourful cornocopia that is DD's decor. I imagine if you sliced open a clown, this is what it would look like. And the smell: heavenly. If noses could salivate, this place would make me drool.\n\nGross metaphors aside: I ordered a small scoop of pralines and cream in a cup and it was just fucking enormous. Not only that, but it was topped with strawberries, kiwi, whipped cream, and a shard of waffle cone the size of a five dollar bill. I don't use this word a lot folks, but I was flabbergasted. Go now.\n\nObligatory Title Pun: If you ain't DUTCH, you ain't much.\n\nMenu Readability: What? There are cows on the ceiling!\n\nNeed to mention: You can get stroopwafels here.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: I expect that clown innards resemble ice cream shops.
