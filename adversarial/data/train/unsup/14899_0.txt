I love sushi, but not so sure if I love it here.  There are many pros to this place, but here's why I thought it was just A-OK.\n\nWalking in, you're greeted and waited by waitresses\/servers dressed in kimonos (cute).  It was busy going to lunch on Saturday, but there was plenty of seating.  \n\nWe decided to sit at the sushi bar.  I'm not exactly a fan of sitting at a low sushi bar where I have to look up to talk to the sushi chefs.  It's just awkward.  \n\nTuna Karai, Candy Cane Roll, and the super white tuna nigiri (ono) are what we ordered. \n\nThe Tuna Karai:  $16.50 for a bowl.  You can go to Sumo Sushi and get a Tuna Karai for $14.00 and double the amount.  This was good, but not $16.50 good.  \n\nI love softshell crab, and I'm glad that I Love Sushi has a variety of sushi rolls that include softshell crab.  I decided to try the Candy Cane Roll.  There wasn't any sauce on it.  The flavor was just okay.  It had a weird after taste to it.  It was also a bit too salty too.  Just a weird flavor.  \n\nThe super white tuna nigiri (ono) was probably my favorite.  They give you a generous amount of ono sushi.  Great with a piece of wasabi and soy sauce.  \n\nMaybe I'll come back and give this place another chance in the future, but for now, it was just okay.
