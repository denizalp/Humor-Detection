Phew, this place was hard to find. I was tearing down WT Harris at a mind-bending 40 mph (yay, traffic) and didn't see it in time. Not my fault though, trees have gone up in front of the distinctive red-and-white ABC Store sign so it isn't visible until you have passed the turn-off. Sneaky. I doubled back through a strip mall and, with a few questionably legal detours, found my way back to the store. I was glad to see that it hasn't been renovated into one of those depressingly cheerful corporate boxes. I enjoy metal bars and neon signs in my liquor store windows. It feels much more authentic.\n\nSo I saunter in, supercool. Nod to the clerk, \"Ma'am\" . But she calls me \"sweety\"; my supercool bubble is burst. If I'd been close enough she would have pinched my cheeks. I fumbled around the store for a few minutes, trying to remember what I had wanted. She managed to call me sweety another half dozen times, tearing down my manly ego with each motherly drawl. Finally, reduced to a mere shell of a man, I dragged my purchases across her counter and skedaddled.\n\n4 stars for the human encounter. No demonizing preacher here, like at other ABC stores, hatefully judging my purchases. This woman obviously enjoyed a touch of the giggle water from time to time. I appreciate that.
