This place is such a gem. Fresh, locally sourced ingredients and plenty of delicious gluten free options. The staff were wonderfully friendly and helpful, my food took longer than I expected to come out but actually tasted freshly cooked when I got it. They have bottomless bloody mary's and mimosas every day of the week which is huge when I have guests in town visiting and the menu is varied enough for everyone to find something they like.
