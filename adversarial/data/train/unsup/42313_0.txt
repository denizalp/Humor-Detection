The Original Roofing Company met a few challenges as they planned, staffed, and completed my roofing job. The work is spot on, and any issues I am sure will be taken care of as professionally as they handled my project. In today's construction workplace specialty contractors must meet daily staffing challenges, they must deal with unknowns, and they are charged with pleasing the client. \n\nI am happy to say that The Original Roofing Company did what every contractor should do, and performed their contract. Hat's off to Toni Lumpkin for outstanding customer service, and help along the way.
