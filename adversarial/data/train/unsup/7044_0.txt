Um, NO. Just no. \n\nI won't comment on anything but the massage itself. It was like being put in a torture chamber and seeing how much pain one can take before spilling the country's precious secrets. I would've spilled 10 minutes into it.\n\nThe guy who did my massage did not introduce himself so I don't remember his name, but my bf said his masseuse, female, also used very firm pressure. I can't even describe my massage as \"firm\" pressure. It was like, I was a piece of steak being tenderized by a mallet. I'm not even exaggerating. On top of that, when he used his elbows on my back, it wasn't just on muscle, it was also on bone. It has been 2 days and I still have tender spots on my vertebrae. I've been to other foot spas where I was so relaxed I fell asleep. I think I got even more sore here from being tense from my 60 minutes of torture. NEVER AGAIN.
