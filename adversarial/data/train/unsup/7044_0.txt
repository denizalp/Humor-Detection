A wonderful neighborhood secret.  An excellent and wide selection of foods with a Mediterranean inspiration.  Very nice wine and beer selection with friendly prices.  Deserts are to die for.  The name of Amy's Baking Company is real - and deserts are Amy's passion.  The owners are here every day.  A Scottsdale must!
