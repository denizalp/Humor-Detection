I have yet to eat lunch or dinner here, but their breakfast is phenomenal. I make it a point to eat breakfast here every time I am in Las Vegas. This is the best breakfast buffet I have had. The food is great, even for picky eaters or those with nut allergies, and the people are really nice. It is worth the wait and the price.
