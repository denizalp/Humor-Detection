We've been here pretty often-I totally forgot to write a review eons ago.\n\nIt's a fun place.. menu items right on the wall when you walk in.\n\nModern decor, simple and to the point.\n\nI love the meat scramble and the brizza-very tasty.\n\nIt gets crazy busy on the weekends. We went as a large group on a Sunday-eek, got stuck having to sit outdoors which would be fine, if it weren't August in Phoenix.\nThis can sometimes make me think twice about going-the line can go out the door!!\n\nThe seating can be limited when it's busy, so keep that in mind.\n\nKid friendly with nice kid options too, and they get a little kids packet thing to play with.\n\nPlenty of high chairs!
