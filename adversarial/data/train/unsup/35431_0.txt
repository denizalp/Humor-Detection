Bartender was absent. Two customers walked out because they got tired of waiting for a beer. I had to fetch help to locate the bartender. She was rude and dismissive. There are too many good restaurants around to spend money at a place with poor customer service. Extremely disappointed. I came to Miller's, was greeted immediately, and had a beer quickly. World of Beer is also a great alternative.
