This company is full of liars. Beginning with their employees who are not trained properly ending with corporate. \nI purchased my pup a year ago. I came into this store looking for a specific type of Pomeranian. I showed a picture of what I was looking for gave a $250 deposit and waited patiently for them to find what I was looking for. \nWhen I receive that call I'm obviously excited to see the pup. I see her and I fall in love instantly so I buy her. I asked the owner of the franchise if there were pictures of the parents and he said \"oh don't worry about that they look just like the picture you showed me.\" I trusted him. I trusted PetLand $3000 and a year later, I still love her with all my heart but she was NOT what I asked for In the beginning of the process.\nThis company lies to you. They say they sell pets to you which I'm sure they do. All these animals are pet worthy. But why ask what I'm looking for exactly if they cannot guarantee that?! Why charge a customer $3000 for a \"pet\" that they cannot guarantee is going to be exact or at least  similar to what you asked for. \nI made a claim because I felt like I was completely ripped off by this company. \nThe people from corporate were nice in the beginning, then as I kept calling to follow up they got more and more rude.\n\nI dunno I'm so upset that I was ripped off. I will never buy from this pet store again.
