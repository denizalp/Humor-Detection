I was up early...err... before 10am on a Sunday, and my partner and I decided to take a stroll and grab a diner breakfast. As we were walking, we passed pristine Nadege, and he inquired about it. He loves canales and croissants and all sweets, it was early enough that this patisserie wasn't packed, so I decided this was a decent replacement for a greasy spoon. \n\nNadage is so beautiful! The treats are lined up in precise French fashion and the lights shine down on each row of sugar like they're Tiffany jewelry. How can you not instantly love it here?\n\nI opted for an egg and ham croissant and a cranberry orange fizz with an almond croissant to go for later, and he had the pain au chocolat and the canales. We sat on the patio facing Trinity Bellwoods and watched Toronto's morning people, young families and walk-of-shamers, stroll along. \n\nSitting at Nadage before it gets busy is a serene experience, designed to remind you that everything is going to be OK. If I continue to rise before the brunch crowd, I will continue to frequent Nadage.
