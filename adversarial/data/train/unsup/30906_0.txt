Nice new arena! comfy seats\nGeorge Strait was amazing! Sound was pretty good but louder at times than others.\n$18 for 1 drink was ridiculous!\nthe ushers in the venue were no very well trained on the area or where things were. The were more apt to tell you where to go without really knowing where to send you. I finally got someone to help and I enjoyed the show!
