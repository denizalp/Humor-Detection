4 stars for taste but the overall experience was so-so and gets a 3. We came in and even though it was still early there weren't many choices out.  We ordered 4 donuts and some donut holes and went across the street to the hospital. Some donuts had frosting and others didn't, well they were all thrown in the bag together and the 3 that originally had frosting now had none and it was all over the inside of the bag and other donuts. I think they should have put our purchase in a box instead of cramming them in a bag and ruining them
