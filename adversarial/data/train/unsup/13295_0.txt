I understand leaving a note in my box telling me I have a package if it's something I need to sign for. But, when no signature is required why can't my package be left in one of the lockers and a key left in my box? I don't receive packages very often and when I do, they never need to be signed for. A couple times in the past few years they've put the package in the locker but the rest of the time I have to ask for it. It wouldn't be a big deal if their hours weren't horrible and the customer service was even worse. \nYa stand at the counter FOREVER waiting for someone to come help you and when they do, they take FOREVER to find your package. \nI asked a few weeks ago why they couldn't have left it in the locker considering my package arrived on a Tuesday and I wasn't able to get there during business hours until Saturday. She said it's a hassle to walk around and put the packages in the lockers. \nWell it's a bigger pain in the butt to spend over 30 min waiting at the counter and then waiting for a package. Yes, I said over 30 min! But, I appreciated her honesty. \nThe folks who work here are rude, condescending and lazy. I often do my business at the location in North Scottsdale and those folks are wonderful. Why are you so angry? You get to leave work at 4:30 every day!!!
