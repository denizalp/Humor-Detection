Let me start with what works at Nakama: The servers. They're super nice and efficient.\n\nWhat doesn't work is the food, the prices, the crowds, the incredibly busy, loud bar without the possibility of being seated in the quieter room (reserved only for Habachi eaters) -- even when you're paying $15.00\/person FOR LUNCH!  And, the restaurant demands that you dress in nice casual wear. No t-shirts, yet the food was terrible!\n\nWe shared the Spider Roll and the Chicken and Shrimp Habachi plate, as well as a seaweed salad. The salad was okay. The Spider Roll came in a sticky, overly-sweet sauce which ruined the flavor. The crab was rubbery and seemed old. The chicken Habachi was waaaaaaay overcooked (dry to the point of being hard to swallow),  the shrimp smelled old , and it was NOT DEVEINED (read: it still had the poop tunnel in it!). ICK! This is supposed to be Pittsburgh's finest sushi restaurant? Old fish meets overcooked chicken, meets truly bad sushi, meets loud bar with no option to sit elsewhere (even when you're not drinking), meets overpriced lunch menu!\n\nMy advice: Go elsewhere! If you want something to eat, check out ANY other restaurant in the South Side. Even if it's bad, it won't be as expensive as Nakama. But, there are better places to be had in Pittsburgh. Not being from the area, I can't speak for sushi bars, but,  I especially like The Gypsy Cafe and Primanti's in the South Side. Cheers!
