This place is one of my favorites in the city. You can't fail with anything on the menu, and with most items, the portions are plentiful. \n\nTheir calamari is way way better than it should be-- very fresh and not chewy. Love the lamb lollipops. The fries are high class and irresistible. Mac and cheese is a winner along with the ribs and chicken wings. \n\nThis place is noisy downstairs in the evenings, but that works fine with the great energy here. \n\nHalf price wine bottles on Tuesday. Just sayin'.
