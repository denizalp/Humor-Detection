If you have to have outpatient surgery, then this is the place to do it.\n\nWithout going into my whole medical history I have joint pain in my neck caused from car accidents years ago, which has caused me years of pain in my neck & upper back.\n\nWell there is a procedure where they burn the nerves causing the pain, which then eliminates the pain. They do two diagnostic blocks of the nerves prior, just to make sure it will work before they go in & burn the nerves for good. Basically this means I had to go in on three different occasions to get three needles stuck in my neck. Sounds fun huh?\n\nWell I had visit number three today & the actually burning of the nerves. Imagine 3 needles poking around in your neck. They have to find the right spot after all. No, it is not pleasant.  \n\nWhat made every one of my 3 visits pleasant was the wonderful staff at Greenbaum Surgery Center. Seriously these people are awesome, caring, & sweet. I felt completely comfortable & taken care of every time I was there.\n\nI've had my fair share of bad experiences with medical offices, so it makes me really happy to be able to talk about a great experience.\n\nIt almost makes me wish I had a reason to go back & get some sort of other surgery done...almost. Anyone want to pay for me to get a little cosmetic work? ;)
