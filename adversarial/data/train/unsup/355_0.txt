I went here today to celebrate Chinese New Year. I was with a group of Chinese folks so perhaps we got special treatment because the service wasn't bad at all. I find most asian restaurants have sub-par service, and this place just seemed average from a service standpoint to me. \n\nThe food on the other hand was above average for a Chinese place. We ordered a smorgasboard of everything and most things I tried were light and fresh tasting rather than greasy. Additionally I didn't get sick from an MSG overload, so that's a great sign. \n\nI wish I knew the names of what we ordered, but I will admit some of the things were a bit too authentic for this adventurous eater. \n\n*Bright yellow chicken with the chicken's head on the plate. Hrm, I really didn't like my food staring at me while eating it. Hard to get used to that. I suppose putting a chicken head on the platter makes this place more legit, however. \n\n*Big blocks of tofu with \"bamboo fungus\" (I kid you not, this is how our Chinese hosts described this!). Looked and smelled pretty nasty, can't say I was even willing to try it as a tofu hater. \n\n*Beef chow fun noodles - awesome and way better than the ones at your standard chinese delivery place. \n\n*Fried pork chops - it's fried pork! Obviously amazing. Not as salty as the\nones at Anna's Garden.\n\n*Seabass in a clay pot with tofu - the seabass was slimy and chewy, pretty nasty imo, but most of the people at our table were loving it.\n\n*Honey walnut shrimp - one of my fave dishes and their's is well executed. \n\n*Fried squid (I'd call it calamari but not sure if the Chinese would use that word?). Phenomenal - not greasy, so light, and so tasty.\n\n*Green beans - ok this sounds lame, but they do some amazing wok fry technique and use shrimp flakes or something and I can honestly say they were the tastiest green beans I've ever eaten. Green beans are my favorite veggie so I do eat them quite a bit. These were so freaking good I'm on a mission to replicate them somehow (as someone who has never cooked Asian food odds aren't in my favor!). \n\nOverall one of your better Chinese options in Chinatown. Service was decent, the food wasn't all that greasy or MSG-laden, and prices were fair for what you get. I particularly enjoyed the trippy Chinese karaoke videos they play while you eat. My favorite is the one with people in 80's clothes playing paddy-cake over a dead bird. I wish I could speak the language so I could understand what the hell was going on in that video!\n\n*
