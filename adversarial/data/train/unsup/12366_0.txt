I've been meaning to review Red Robbin, I mean Red Robin for awhile. My wife and I went in here late one night after waiting about 10 minutes at our table at Mimi's for a waiter. Unfortunately we went over to Red Robin for a very poor tasting $19 per person Burger, drink and fry combo. They have unlimited fries, who cares, the burgers suck.
