New to reviews, i thought i should start with my favorites, Mirchi has been my favorite pakistani restaurant for almost 10 years, there have been times where the food was not consistent but always delicious. The menu has been the same with only minor changes over the decade, everything on the menu is amazing, the Goat Karahi, The mirchi kabob, and the biryani amongst my favs, the naan is amazing. A staple in Indain\/pakistani food.
