We stopped at the Saddle ranch on our way to the Paul McCartney concert, and while the lines were insane everywhere, it didn't take long to get a table. \n\nI recommend hitting the outside bars while you wait, the drinks had a lot less ice, if you know what I'm saying....  The outdoor seating was a better choice too, once the sun went down behind a billboard that is!  I imagine it's a bit hot when the summer comes, but it was so much nice than the indoor mechanical bull scene... for dinner.\n\n(I imagine the indoor bull\/bar scene is a happening place to be on a Friday or Saturday night out!  Grab the girlfriends and dress in your best cowgirl gear!  Yeehaw!)\n\nNow the food...\nHad the artichoke dip, wedge salad-YUM! but definitely share it unless you're only eating an ENTIRE head of lettuce for dinner,  and a filet.  While they didn't bring the steak out rare, as requested, it was very tasty.  Much tastier than I thought I'd be getting from the looks of the place. \n\n(We did wait awhile for food, but totally expected to considering the entire city area was packed for the concert.)\n\nBut the best reason of all to drink, eat, and ride a bull (or a cowboy-as some of the shirts recommend) is that when it comes time to tinkle, as us ladies must do.... there are rows of stalls in the ladies room!!!  Ah, finally a place that understands the biggest need of women in bars!!\n\n*I'm putting moderate, but it can easily be spendy if you're drinking.
