When we first walked in and the entire bar turned around to look because we were the only white kids in there, I was a little alarmed. But everyone was friendly and we didn't get picked on. The place wasn't too crowded, found a table easily and got my beer on. Yuengeling is $2\/pint on tap. Otherwise, it's pretty run-down and smelly - ripped bench cushions, wobbly tables, dirty bathroom.
