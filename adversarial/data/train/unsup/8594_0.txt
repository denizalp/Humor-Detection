Not sure if it was too late (9 pm?...haah), or if those in the kitchen were cooking with drowsy palates...\n\nANYWAY, after driving around with indecisive passengers the other night, we all finally agreed on this place. Initially excited... we were not so much enthralled by dinner's end. \n\nI got the Award Winning Gyro Dinner. Personal opinion of this- not very award winning, and did not even intrigue my eyes. Beef and lamb were dehydrated and vegetables originated from a freezer bag. Was given scarce pieces of pita (should have just brought my own bag of pita chips since this was the case), and the tzatziki was not the distinct  blend of yoghurt accompaniment... it was ranch dressing. \n\nThe gyro dinner is a far cry from award winning, dishonorable mention to say the least. I suppose my dish and I disliked each other so much that my doggy bag committed suicide atop my car, and became mere slop on the pavement.
