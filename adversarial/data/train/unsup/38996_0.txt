This place knocked my socks off and I'm still dreaming about it 3 years later. Exactly the kind of unpretentious authentic food experience that we all need in our lives. I don't remember everything I ordered, but I remember even the cheese quesadilla was a revelation. If I ever go back to Phoenix it'll be the first place I go.
