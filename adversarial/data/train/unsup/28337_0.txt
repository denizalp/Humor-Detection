Little bit of context: I suffer from \"Hair Salon-phobia\" as my long locks have been butchered one too many times. Hence, i am very reluctant to try new salons and only go to a particular stylist that sets me back $100 per cut, twice a year. However, i recently started getting tired of my long hair and felt i needed a change. So with the new year and all, i threw caution to the wind and thought i'd take the plunge - not only in hair length, but with a brand new salon. \n\nThe positive reviews on Yelp helped ease my concerns and the $30 price tag was also intriguing. Best case scenario, amazing hair cut for a fraction of my usual cuts. Worst case scenario, $30 wasted is not too hard to swallow. \n\nCan i just say - WOW. i had 10-12 inches taken off and a completely different style and i absolutely love it. My stylist was Japanese and did an amazing job. I got an angled lob and the quality of the cut rivaled some of the top stylists I've been to in the city. Maya will definitely be my new salon and it's so affordable, i'll be visiting quite frequently. Everything else stated in these reviews are true. Definitely worth the visit!
