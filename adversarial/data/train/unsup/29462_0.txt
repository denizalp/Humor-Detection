This is one of my favorite restaurants!  Great food and super friendly service.  We bring our 1 year old daughter here and have also had a huge party here with about 50 guests.  Stellas has the best gyro...ever!  Their gyro pizza and their regular cheese pizzas are also really tasty. The D & M pizza is like the P&M in Arnold.  Their wings are huge and delicious!  We have also had their \"Saddle\" sandwich: the half is enough for 2 people!  Go there and enjoy... you won`t regret it!
