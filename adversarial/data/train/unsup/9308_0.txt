Was in last week shopping for groceries when I noticed a flyer advertising a Peach Festival Brunch, so I made a mental note to come in and check it out!  The flyer said to call and make reservations, but I checked out this location's webpage and saw that no reservations are needed, that all one needed to do was show up!  I think the print-up on the flyer may have kept many away, as the wine bar, where the brunch is being held (yes, it's from 8a to 12p today, so come on over!), only had one couple besides me present.  [Now that I'm finished w\/ my breakfast, another couple has sat down.  Me?  I'm typing away as I just realized I'm missing mass (which may also be a factor in why the wine bar is empty), and all bec. I was so excited to try a couple of items on this brunch's menu!]\n\nFirst of all, the two young women manning the cash register and taking orders are friendly and courteous, and the lone, spectacled, and young chef is also very nice and quite helpful answering my questions regarding to the ingredients of the Peach French toast and the Shakshooka.  Sha-zam wha?  Yep- say it slowly, you can do it!\n\nShak- shoo- ka.  Shakshooka, an Israeli dish consisting of a base of spicy tomato and pepper stew, w\/ eggplant and spinach, w\/ two poached eggs on top, and a garnish of feta cheese.  This was, as the first couple exclaimed \"fabulous!\" when I'd stopped at their table and asked them as I made my way back from the display counter that showcased all the available brunch offerings:  \n\nGranola parfait (w\/ peach compote) $6\nSteel-cut oatmeal (w\/ peach compote, agave nectar) $6\nFrench toast $8\nGreen chile hash (rotisserie chicken, potatoes, grilled onions, roasted poblanos, sunny-side up egg) $8\nBreakfast tacos (eggs, chorizo, beans, potatoes, salsa)\nShakshooka $8\nGrilled peach and arugula salad (radicchio, fennel, pistachio, balsamic vinaigrette) $7\n\nPeach bellinis and Marin French Stinson Beach Peach beer are also available for $4 (6oz) and $5 (22oz), respectively.  \n\nWhat about the peach French toast, you say?  It was many substantial forkfuls of HEAVEN!  There was nothing fluffy about this French toast (and if you know me, you know I DISLIKE fluffy!)  Three slices of WF brand brioche bread, battered, and nicely pan-fried, w\/ caramelized peaches, candied walnuts, and homemade apricot jam (made by the young chef himself!) w\/ apricots stewed in their own juices, sugar, and currants.  Oh. My. Goodness!  I told them I wished they'd hold breakfast here everyday, or at the very least, every weekend-- I'd come back religiously (pun intended)!  The chef said that they're hoping to build up a demand for it.  This is only the second time they offered something like this-- the first time was about two months ago and was beer-inspired.  I say, y'all must check this breakfast out today!!  There's something for everyone's picky palates.  (And if nothing catches your fancy, or are off-limits to you for some reason, there is always the hot food buffet to check out.  Today's lineup includes enchiladas, scrambled eggs (eggwhites, regular), omelets (Denver, sausage, chicken), potatoes, tofu, apple cinnamon crisp, oatmeal, and crispy bacon, among other things!   And if these aren't enough choices to have, there's always the salad and olive bars, pizzeria, sandwich, gelato, and Smokehouse grill areas to peruse!
