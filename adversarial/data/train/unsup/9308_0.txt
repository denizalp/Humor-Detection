Great lunch spot.  I cannot comment too much on the quality of food across the entire menu.  I have only had one item...many times: Greek salad with chicken.  Fresh veggies, good dressing, and it actually comes with a pita and tzatziki sauce (score!).  I find no reason to try anything else.  For $11 bucks...it doesn't get much better--especially for a half way decent healthy meal. \n\nPlace starts hoppin' around noon for lunch rush.  Get there earlier to avoid a wait and ensure you have a place to sit.
