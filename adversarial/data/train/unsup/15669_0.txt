Okay....it's White Castle.  This isn't a gourmet burger joint.  With that in mind, I had a great experience!  I loved each mini cheeseburger with a sliced pickle and chopped onions on it.  I didn't give it 5 stars, as the fries definitely needed some fresh oil and some TLC.  They were a bit brown and sad for fries, so I'd recommend going with the onion chips (like pieces of crispy onion rings).  If you haven't gone, you just need to!
