After a long night in Vegas, this was a great stop to fill the belly in the morning.\n\nUpon walking in, you were greeted by the hostess and asked if you would like to sit indoors or outdoors or at the bar. Both indoors and outdoors seating are great options.\n\nIt did not take long for our waiter to come and take our order. I started with a cup of coffee and my boyfriend had a Glass of orange juice. They were pretty good about filling up my coffee when I had some but the flavor itself was not the best. I'm just glad they had coffee there.\n\nI ordered the two eggs, two Apple chicken sausages, two bacon strips, potatoes and a delicious biscuit with Sage. The meal itself was scrumptious. The serving was pretty generous so I didn't quite finish it and had to take some to go. My two favorite parts of my entr√©e worth the biscuits with a hint of sage and the Apple chicken sausages.\n\nI would definitely go back.
