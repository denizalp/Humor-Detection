This is the best place in Phoenix to buy pre-fab slabs of granite\/stone for countertops. They have a great selection and great prices. When you buy pre-fab granite it comes with a finished edge so it makes fabrication a lot less expensive. They have a good stock on hand so if you need something quick, there is a good chance that they've got it!\n\nI've never used them for cabinets, but the quality definitely seems to be nice and their work speaks for itself. Check out their showroom - You'll be glad you did!
