I relocated to Charlotte a couple of months back and was in search of a good hair salon. With some references i got my hair highlighted at a salon in Ballantyne. Being an Indian i am originally raven-haired . So i normally go for a global rusty brown color with some subtle brown and golden highlights. To my dismay the salon turned me into a blonde to which the stylist retorted that is what is called \"highlighting\" your hair. It was a nightmare. With some \"mourning\" over the loss of my hair color and money; and a lot of online research along with some good pointers from yelp i zeroed upon HairColorXperts to fix my hair. Amanda Overdorf at Carmel was my savior. She listened calmly to my hair crisis , understood what i was looking for and suggested some looks. She was very creative and suggested me a mix of colors to tone down the blonde. I was very satisfied with end result with the 3 day nightmare coming to an end. Thanks a lot Amanda! I would totally suggest this place and Amanda, if you want some awesome hair coloring services.
