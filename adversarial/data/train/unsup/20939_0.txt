This place is BUSY. I've been here on three different occasions, each at a different weekday at a different time. Why is it always so busy, you ask? Well, it's just an awesome carwash, plain and simple. The only minor complaints I have about this place are 1) it's location. It's located on a very busy intersection so be careful! 2) their bug stations. There's only two of them.  And finally 3) some vacuums work better than others. I got an awesome vacuum the first time I went, and then I got a very weak vacuum during my my recent visit. Aside from these two complaints, though, this place is great! Their vacuums are free, there's lots of them, service is fast and there's plenty of options to choose from! I'm seriously considering purchasing the $16\/month unlimited wash plan because it is soooo dusty in Arizona. I like having a sparkling car!
