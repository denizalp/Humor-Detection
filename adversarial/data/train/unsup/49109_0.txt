OMG these guys are FAN-freggin-TASTIC!!!  I needed finishing touches to my company's logo and my graphic artist just couldn't get it right after working on it for 2 weeks.  I gave my logo to Tyler, told him the modification I wanted and 24 hours later it was perfected!  It looked exactly like I wanted it to.  I promptly ordered several shirts and they are absolute perfection!  They keep cost in mind as well and won't try to upsell on everything.  Shout out to mama Kathy and Cindy!!  Come see me at Lash Daddy ;-)
