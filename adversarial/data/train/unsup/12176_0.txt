Well well well, what can i say!?! So I go to Sin City for the Turkey Holiday and as I am going into the Walmart in Henderson (like kinna near BASIC HIGH SCHOOL) (mind u I really don't kno my way, just landmarks, so I am a bad direction giver!) w\/my sister and i notice a van all hooked up w\/\"Eyebrows R Us\" decals. I have my sis take down the number n as we were walking to the entrance I notice the owner of the van coming towards us and we stop her and get info about her services. She stops and talks to us for a minute even tho she looked like she was in a hurry. thank You!! The next day is \"Black Friday\" I am sooo determined to get my eyebrows done b4 nething. \nSo we go to the shop right next door to Bath n Body (as i'm opening the door a lady walks out and her upper lip n eyebrows are red as HELL!!! Ok hello i am trippin now, but still walk in))and to my xcitement the place is NOOOT packed BUT they have like 25-30 chairs all lined up w8ng to be filled w\/anxious eyebrowers!! There are 4 ladies in the shop having a wonderful convo, 1 at the desk and 3 comfortably sitting chit chattin. I pardon my self for interrupting them and ask for a lady named GITA (that's sho the lady from WalMart referred me too). And up stood a young lady, and asked me to follow her to the back of the room. \nI've gotten my eyebrows threaded b4 so the so called pain, i was very familiar too. to those 1st timers, to me the felling is like ur gertting like cut by thread but keeping in mind that the thread won't cut....well that's what i tell myself!! To me it's not as painful as getting waxed n all that oil stuff to take off the wax residue. Trust me, u won't be disappointed!! \n\nGITA.....YOU ARE THE BOMB!! C ya ladies again when i go back to SIN CITY for X'MAS!!!!!!!!!!! Cali ain't got nathan on threading like Henderson do!!!
