The cafe space inside The Center has finally reopened as Little Rainbow Cafe- fitting name for the setting, apparently same ownership as MTO Cafe but with a smaller menu of coffees, toasts, salads, and smoothies to fit the smaller kitchen space. Love the smaller price tags too- very affordable, think $5 toasts and beverages, vegan items available.\n\nThe Bravo toast (avo, bacon, watermelon radish) and a hazelnut latte were my go-to for their first day. I'm champing at the bit for them to release the Rainbow Latte they've been promoting on social media, but it's definitely a place I see myself revisiting (for the PBJ one Elizabeth was raving about!) so not worries about that.
