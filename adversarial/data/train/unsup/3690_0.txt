Worst customer service ever, called up to find out if my order had come in, I get a girl who clearly cant speak or even understand English I had to repeat myself 4 times to her and she still couldn't understand me, then I get put on hold for 15mins, I then hang up and call back oh and what happens same girl I mean seriously why dont they get some decent staff I then tell the other girl that comes on the line how unprofessional it is and poor communication and I don't appreciate to be put on hold for 15min, She didnt even have the decency to apologize just carried on. Will not be going back there.
