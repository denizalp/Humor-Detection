I really like this place. Glad they are still around a few years after my first visit. The decor is great. The bar looks to be mail with rails from tracks and, of course, the chandelier is beautiful.\n\nThe food is normally very good. I love their proper Rueben. The butternut squash ravioli is delightful. The pork schnitzel is delicious. The prices are very fair for the sandwiches. Some of the entrees and beer are a bit pricey.\n\nMy only suggestion for improvement would be the service is sometimes in need of improvement. Regardless, great addition to Homestead and I wish them continued success!
