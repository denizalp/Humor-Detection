I had to take a friend here a few years ago and they were great...very gentle with her and supportive.  She had already gotten a pregnancy test at Planned Parenthood (in another state) but when she spotted, she thought she might not be pregnant anymore so I took her here.  PP had offered her $100 to help pay for an abortion at another clinic (they didn't do them in that state) and my friend didn't want one.  She asked for help if she didn't get an abortion and they scoffed and said there were other places for that.  Well, I guess we found the other place.  This place was so helpful.  My friend's pregnancy was definitely not her first choice, but under the circumstances, this center made it a lot easier and they respected her choice to carry the baby and didn't judge her.
