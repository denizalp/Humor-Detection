I had a great time here just before Christmas. The home fries were terrific and so was my bacon . It has a great little atmosphere and is a lovely place to go to in the mornings. My  waitress was super nice. I had a lovely breakfast when I went. The only thing is I asked for rye bread and I got white bread Instead but it wasn't a big problem as her friendly disposition was so welcoming.
