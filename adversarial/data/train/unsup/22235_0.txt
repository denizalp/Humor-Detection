Good cafe. Good baked goods. Great cheese shop. Fantastic wine store! \n\nAlthough more reminiscent of my strolls through New Orleans than Paris, French Grocery is a solid destination for fulfilling some of the finer, rarer cravings I've had.\n\nPerhaps it's the chicory-infused coffee that feels reminiscent of my visits to NOLA's iconic Cafe du Monde. This spice, the taste of which I'd compare to anise or licorice, has roots in the 19th century. During coffee shortages, most notably in the civil war, it would be used to stretch the supplies. The trend stuck, and even today this particular type of blend persists in the area. On my next visit, I'll pair it with their famous beignets! \n\nThe sweets are legit. I have only had a couple of the tarts so far, but they were delicious and affordable. For more savory baked goods, you can't go wrong with a ham and cheese croissant for breakfast It's surprisingly light, and you'll enjoy every bite. Since they open at 7am, it's a nice, peaceful spot to drop by during your morning commute!\n\nOther noteworthy products include a small, but fancy cheese selection. The largest selection of all, of course, is the wine. I have only perused it, but look forward to indulging. \n\nFrench Grocery isn't French enough to please those missing ventures across the Atlantic. Ironically, it's not even resembling a grocery. Still, it remains a solid spot for any time of day. Dine in, and grab some goodies to go.
