Okay... so the first time I ate here I was suuuuuuper hungover. Go figure in Vegas, right? \n\nIt was my last night there and my genius friend suggested we eat something SPICY. No bueno on a tummy full of leftover alcohol. NEVER. EVER. This left my last memory of this place a little tainted to say the least. \n\nI didn't return for a while, but finally made the effort when I saw they changed to being open 24 hours. Nothing like a big pot of goodness anytime of the day (or night)!\n\nCame here after clubbing and even though it was 5AM, there was a wait! Seats are first come, first serve and after that you wait in line until one of the 20 seats are free. My party of 3 ended up waiting about 30 - 40 minutes.\n\nTwo words of advice: COME. HUNGRY. \n\nTheir portions are so large, they're almost 3 meals in one! And there's a fee if you share with someone. I'm not really down for that, but once you try one bite, you might want the whole bowl to yourself!\n\nDefinitely come here and get the pan roast! There is nothing else you should order! All kinds of fresh seafood sauteed with brandy, cream and tomato and served with rice. SO. FREAKING. DELICIOUS. And they don't skimp on the seafood at all! You can see the cook dump in the goodness in your pot and cook it right in front of you! You can even pick what level of spiciness you want. You can pick anywhere from 1 to 10. Level 3 is good for a light kick, but you can still taste the flavor of the sauce. \n\nI know there's a lot of options for 24 hour late night eats in Vegas, but this is one of the better ones out there. I mean, any place with a wait at almost every hour of the day is definitely good eats!
