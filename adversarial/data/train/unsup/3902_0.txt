For a long time I have been needing to write a review on this place. And now, after all the times that I've been here, I am finally writing one. :]\n\nThis restaurant, or barstaurant, has become one of my fave places to eat in the southwest part of town. Not only are they conveniently open late, but their food is bomb.\n\nOne of my fave Korean comfort food is Spicy Tofu Soup. That is usually what I order from here and it's actually what I make the drive for if the craving is just too real. lol And because this restaurant has bar-styled food, I gotta get my side order of fries to go with it. Try the squid too. The portions of some menu items are great for sharing. And like most Korean restaurants, they include free banchan (mini side dishes) when dining in.\n\nFrom all the times that I've been here, customer service has never really been a problem. The staff is usually quick, but it can get pretty busy here. Seating is pretty limited, as the restaurant itself is not that big. They do have patio seating, which is nice for those not so cold nights.\n\nAll in all, if you're in the area, give this place a try. They are open late so keep in mind that Spicy Tofu Soup! lol Hands down, theirs is one of the best in Vegas.
