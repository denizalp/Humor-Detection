We had a large party so we had to wait to be seated but as you come in the decor is all Asian Fusion flair and  and modern.  Once seated we got our drinks pretty quick and ordered a ton of small plates of: springrolls, spicy tuna rolls, prawns, yummy kobe sirloin, lobster wontons, etc.. Everything tasted pretty good but I was not wowed.  I ordered the chocolate parfait and it was the best!! Service seemed very prompt overall.  I think the place is nice but pretty pricey and maybe just a place you go one time and that is it.
