The cocktails here are strong, mixed really well, and are reasonably priced ($6-8). The trifecta of drinking, really. The ambiance gets interesting around 10-11pm. Before then, it's just your chill, laid-back neighborhood bar. After 10, it turns into da club (loud, thumping club bangers and all). Get ready to see middle-aged couples spanking each other and taking photos of their date's derriere. I could think of worse places to spend a Saturday night.
