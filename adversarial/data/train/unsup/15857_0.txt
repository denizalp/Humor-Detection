This place opens at 8am.  I got here at 815 with ticket #185!! What the?! -_- \n \nTry to avoid this place if you can. Do not procrastinate.  Re register your vehicles early online...or if you aren't computer savvy come in and use the self kiosk.  \n\nLuckily from past experiences of being late on registration the fees are not that bad. If you just explain that you've been on vacation they'll drop your fees to one day vs whatever they may actually be. \n\nThe people that I've encountered here have never been rude or unpleasant so the experience isn't that bad.  Its one of those errands that have to be done. I always find a parking spot. AC is always blasting. Bring some headphones or a book with you and you're set.
