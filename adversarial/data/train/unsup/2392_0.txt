WOW, i've never been sooo negatively surprised by a shipping company. the comments below saying how it says \"delivered\" on the status but no one even knocked on the door is TRUE. same this happened to me, just now as i'm typing this complaint.\n\ni order from amazon, it was suppose to be delivered yesterday but they said my address was an empty lot. i check google maps to see if it was, but there it was...my house. i called ontrac and they said he'll come back the next day.\n\nso i wait and wait, but nothing. i check my status on amazon and its says DELIVERED at 1 pm. i was HOME at 1 pm and NO ONE KNOCKED and NO PACKAGE. i call customer service again and AGAIN they say the driver will come back the next day to locate the package. IF HE DIDN'T EVEN COME HERE THE FIRST TIME, HOW THE HELL IS HE GOING TO FIND MY HOUSE THE NEXT TIME. \n\nvery very DISHONEST drivers and company. PLEASE SOMEONE TELL AMAZON TO SWITCH.
