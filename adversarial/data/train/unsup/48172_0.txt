Coffee quality is great! Capuccino with almond milk was excelent - no bitterness, that's usually comon for such bev. elsewhere. I tried Gluten free version of BLT from lunch menu. Very delish. Ouside garden is simple, but qute. It's simple hipster coffee place with friendly staff and quality coffee. \nOne improvement suggestion: to put less sause on a side salad or serve it on a side.\nThank you!
