Working in this part of downtown is making me food rich and wallet poor.  TMI serves amazing comfort food in overly satisfying portions.  Their atmosphere is fantastic and the weather now is perfect for sitting on the porch and enjoying their happy hour that really, everyone else should study as a benchmark.  I've enjoyed their sandwiches and green chili pork stew that was almost too hot for my taste but like any self-respecting addict, I keep ordering it anyways.  I've been stuck on their Cobb salad which boasts more food than I really should eat but in the true spirit of American overindulgence, I clean my bowl every time.  Service is really good and I can be in and out quickly if need be.\nParking can be tricky but lets be honest, it's 7th street and parking is at a premium.  Pet friendly patios are a nice touch but watch your dish if you plan on feeding the local cat a sliver of bacon.  Not that I did it, just saying...
