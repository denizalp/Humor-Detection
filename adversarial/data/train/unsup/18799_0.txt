I've been to Marvel many, many times and had good to great haircuts. Unfortunately, the last time I went, I ended up with the worst haircut of my life (literally: one side was longer than the other). But that's just the chance you take at a haircutting school; some of the students are near the end of their schooling, and some are just starting. At $11.96 for a cut and dry, it's at least a cheap gamble.\n\nMarvel is good for people who have a lot of time to get their hair did (2-3.5 hours), a simple hairstyle, and those who are not fussy about slight imperfections. I count myself as all of the above, which is why, aside from this time, I walked away from Marvel feeling pretty satisfied. I think it also helps to have a good sense of humour, so that you can at least laugh *if* the stylist ends up \"butchering\" your hair (my poor stylist's description of my coif post-cut, not mine).
