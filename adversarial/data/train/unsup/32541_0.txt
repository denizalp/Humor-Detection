On the positive side I special ordered a cake for my sisters baby shower and it was fabulous!  Beautiful,moist and flavorful.\nIt is a small restaurant so I called 3 weeks in advance to coordinate a table for 15. I will sum it up by saying their communication needs a complete overhaul.  None of us would go back.
