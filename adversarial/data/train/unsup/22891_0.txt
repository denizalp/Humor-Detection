I enjoyed my maiden voyage to First Watch this past Sunday. My wife and I were here early before 9am so there weren't the crowds that I have read about in past reviews.\n\nI had \"The Traditional\" which consists of two eggs scrambled with 4 turkey sausage links plus an English muffin and fresh seasoned country potatoes. This was a filling breakfast and just the right amount of food. I really enjoyed the Turkey Sausage Links plus they gave you 4 of them instead of the standard 2 you get from most places.\n\nThe service was perfect, not overbearing, not too little. And what is really cool is that other servers will pick up the ball and refill your drink or answer questions, etc. Prices seem reasonable as well, so it looks like I have found a good \"go to\" breakfast place.
