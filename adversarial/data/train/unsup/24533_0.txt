Walked in around Happy Hour. Nice crowd, but LOUD MUSIC...meh, I get it; A bar with a she-devil theme must have Mick Jagger screaming at the top of his lungs as part of the shtick. \n\nNot for me.\n\nAlso, I don't like waking around and around the bar trying to meet the gaze of a bartender that seems determined to ignore me. I gave up and left: Suggestion to Management, if you're going to attract a crowd to your humongous bar, then you may want to adequately staff bartenders that know what they're doing.....Its how you make money?!? Also, newsflash: 1 + 1 = 2
