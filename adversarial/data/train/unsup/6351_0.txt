Yes, I'm a fruu-fruu girl that loves overpriced designer goods.  So you know that I loves me my Louboutins!  My only sadness is that I was with my girlfriends instead of my mom.  Don't get me wrong, shopping with the girls was way more fun...but when one shops with mom...one doesn't need to look at price tags.  Heh.  Yes, I'm a brat.\n\nSuper cute store, well laid out with an awesome selection - especially their classics and tried and trues.\n\nHeart!
