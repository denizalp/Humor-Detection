After a night of drunken debauchery, friends and I were all craving Filipino food. And thank gawd, I came up with the brightest of ideas and yelled out \"Cafeeeee Modaaaa.\" -- I swear, that was, like, the best idea of the new year for me.\n\nOur party of 10+ left (crappy) Haze and went to Cafe Moda on a Saturday night @ 2am. And, boy, were we pleased.\n\nThe music was hip hop and R&B -- better than the last place we were at *cough*cough*\nThe dancefloor wasn't crowded -- we could dance\/walk clearly; forget that we were dancing next to old men (tatas) and old women (nanas)\nAnd they had food there -- *sisig, plabok, lumpia\n\n*Granted our breathe was crazy from the onions in the sisig but, we really did dance our asses off...\n\nI woke up smiling and talking with friends about \"how fun last night\" was =)\n\n\nI highly recommend doing this if you wanna end your night on a different kinda of bang-bang-BOOM!!!
