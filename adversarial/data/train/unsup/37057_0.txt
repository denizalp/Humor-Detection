First I'm very glad to support a local business. Second I'm not a handy person and I don't usually need a hardware store but I was recently working on a project and I was having an issue with some of the supplies I had bought somewhere else. I brought in the supplies (I had to make a couple trips back) and they were very friendly and helpful in finding exactly what I needed. My project turned out perfect!
