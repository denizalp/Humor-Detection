Now that I have been going out a little more since moving to Phx, I have found other restaurants that I feel very at home in. This has been on of my favorites.......till now.............  I usually come during the day time to avoid the   candle light atmosphere. I bring my lap top (WIFI free) but I came in  tonight and found the music so annoying. If only they would get real musicians that sound good while dining instead of the young kid who is ALWAYS there, Don't they ever change their songs.  Pizza still good but anything else is boring like the music. Boring shouldn't be LOUD. I found Cibos and will stick with them for now
