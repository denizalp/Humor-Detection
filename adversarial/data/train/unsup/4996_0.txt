Ode to babu!  This is one of the best places I have found in my hood.  First off the cleanliness is unbelievable...they have glass everywhere so everything from food to kitchen is visible to all who enter.  Secondly, the service...wow!  Just the friendliest bunch of ppl you will ever meet.  Not like a Chinese restaurant where you may be won over by price but with a serious doses of bad service with matching attitude...lol.  Thirdly, the price....just ridiculously inexpensive with the large and in charge portions.  But above all...the taste is just fantastic.  \n\nAlthough there are sometimes no signs...the staff will always encourage you to try...and their sample size could get you full.  They aren't cheap.\n\nHave yet to try their sweets but will definitely do it next time we are bk and have enough hands to carry it all out :)\n\nNom nom nom....babu rules!
