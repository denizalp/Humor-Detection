If you live on Nellis AFB,  I strongly recommend this school! The principal, Kori Deal, is outstanding.  She is invested in the education of her students,  supportive of her staff and connected with the parents. I met her on my son's very first day of kindergarten (he started 2 weeks late because we moved from Alaska). She recognized that we were new and introduced herself to me. She holds a bimonthly parent meeting, where she and the VP make themselves available to share info and address questions and concerns. \nThe teachers are generally wonderful, there are always one or two bad apples in every bunch. In three short weeks my son's first grade teacher, Mrs.  Harbour,  has formed a connection with my son and ignited a spark for learning in him I have never seen before.\nI have had the privilege of being involved in the PTA,  and I have received an abundance of help and support from the staff as a whole!\nThe drawbacks to this school are:\nKindergarten is only half day. (Maybe because I am from MN where all kindergarten is full day I am spoiled).\nThe Common Core learning module.  This is a NV thing, and is pretty common around the nation. I don't like the way this module is structured,  particularly the Language Arts portion. It does not a focus on literature and reading for enjoyment, instead it promotes reading for necessity only.\n\nOverall,  I love this school!\nWhat other place do i get to dress like a pickle and beg 600 kids not to eat me!
