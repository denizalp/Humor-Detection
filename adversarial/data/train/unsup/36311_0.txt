I always come here for their bento lunch specials and\/or their gam ja tang :)\n\nIf you're taking your bento lunch specials to go, it comes in this organized bento container and they're lightening fast with their service.\n\nThere was one time where it only took 5 minutes from the time I ordered to the time I picked up my food to go.\n\nIt's affordable and fresh!
