I went to the downtown location for lunch on Adelaide St.  I got the regular size steak & chicken burrito.  It was a mealpal pick-up.  The ingredients consisted of rice, beans, cheese, cilantro, onions, salsa, tomatoes, sour cream, corn & burrito sauce.  This is one big hefty burrito,  no need to get the large.  The taste was just satisfying, this is just like comfort food.  Good fresh ingredients that is why Burrito Boyz is so popular.  I tried their burritos before and will try again.
