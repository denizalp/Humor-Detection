This place is no different.\n\nThis is your typical car dealer ship folks, they advertise a plethora amount and that is why I was there.\n\n I was under the impression that they might be different with bad credit, bankruptcies, auto loans, and all that bad stuff.\n\n My salesman took a circuitous route to avoid telling me that I didn't qualify because I co-signed for my sisters car a year ago, but according to them I do qualify I would need 40% down or a co-signer.\nI told them upfront my situation and they still decided to just ignore, 20% down and $250.00 a month.\n\nThey have a lot of different programs.\n\n1.) They will finance you even if you don't want one of their cars (if you qualify)\n\n2.) They have over 50 lenders that can finance you (if you qualify)\n\n3.) If you do get financed you can bring your car back within a year and they will increase your credit limit by almost 50%\n\nThere is so much more I just could remember it all.\n\nThe thing that gets me the most is the sales folk, they are so unprofessional just like the receptionist. They are horse playing on the job running around taking pictures or non sense. \n\nMy sales person was very professional I will say that. \n\nPaul the finance manager was the slowest though, I had to wait on him at least 30 minutes just to get a response.\n\nThere is nothing special about this place.
