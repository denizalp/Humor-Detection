LIVINGGGG FOR THIS PLACEEEE \n\nWe were staying at the palms and decided to spoil ourselves on dinner. Later that night I thought to myself how should I spoil us some more.\n\nUsed the power of Yelp! to find that next door at the palms place there was a spa. I was upset at first that the palms didn't have one. But hey, what's a small walk next door. Plus there is a bridge connecting both hotels so you don't have to actually go outside.\n\nWe had 10am appointments for a couples massage. We got there at 9:30. We didn't have to wait. The girl who checked us in was very friendly. She told us we could go relax in the spa until our appts were ready. We got some fruit and cucumber water in the lounge and got a tour by the ever so friendly Xavier. He gave us a tour of the place and made sure we had everything we needed. \n\nAfter that we got a couples massage by John & Jennifer. I had Jennifer and she was AH-MAY-ZING. So professional and relaxing. It was a full body massage so leaving that place I felt like jello and every part of my body was relaxed for once. So thank you Jennifer and John. Thank you for making this staycation even that more relaxing. \n\nAfter the massages, we relaxed in the hot tub and just drifted away. The steam room was great. Really helped open up my lungs and breath better. This place is amazing. I hope if you are at the Palms or Palms Place you choose to try this place. Prices are very reasonable. When you get a massage the spa is free for the day! Just a tip.
