I can see why there is an average on 3 stars- well I give them 1 and that's based on my room looks at a fake Eiffel Tower ... we come to Vegas probably once every 2nd  month- have never stayed here before- prefer Vdara, Aria, and the Hotel at Mandalay... where the customer service is excellent and I  HIGHLY RECOMMEND those hotels - Here the service STINKS-  the front desk female can only be described as a witch with a capital B- the casino is the worst for smoke - and that's just walking through- god help you if you want to work from your room because their premium Wifi is horrendous. After explaining to the witch at the front desk that the  premium wifi service I paid for is not working and I need it because I'm not here in Vegas and outside having fun, but  stuck in my room working - she  had the nerve to respond \"well I have to work too\" - well maybe miss smart mouth can then pay my hotel room bill. Oh, then our room wifi mysteriously got turned off.
