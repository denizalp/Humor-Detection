This place is a cute little Mexican Restaurant in Old Town. I use to come here a lot when I worked in the area, but haven't been back for a while since I moved. We visited this place last Monday night and I have to say it's as I remember it. The staff is very friendly and quick; the atmosphere gives off an old, rustic Mexican village vibe and the food isn't too shabby. The best thing about this place is their meal portions. Anything you get here is huge! You definitely have to take home left overs because there is just so much. This last visit I enjoyed the nachos, all by myself (getting my food baby on) and I took home half my platter. Of course in this case these nachos come out pilled with meat, beans, cheese, jalape√±os..... on a pizza pan! Holy nachos!!! I feel the meat could have had a little better flavoring but the abundance of cheese was perfect! I love cheese on my nachos! My friend ordered their enchilada plate, along with that he got rice and beans. The enchilada was nice and spicy and the refried beans were pretty tasty. Im not a huge fan of rice, so in my book it was ok, a little dry.... But ok. The food didn't blow me away, but it hit the spot!
