We bought our couch and chair here months ago and it was the most painless experience! Unfortunately, I don't remember the name of the gentleman who helped us, but he was awesome. He asked us if we needed any help, and then left us alone until we were ready to ask questions. We were dead set on finding one of those huge, comfy round chairs. We found the exact chair we were looking for at a great price, and an awesome couch that matched. \n\nI will definitely be returning for any furniture needs!
