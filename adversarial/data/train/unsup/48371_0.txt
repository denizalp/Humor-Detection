If I could give this hotel more than 5 stars, I would most certainly do so. I was greeted immediately upon entering the door. The entire establishment is clean and every staff member that I encountered was helpful and genuine. The room that I booked was a standard queen room, but was surprised to learn that I was the guest of the day. I have been to many hotels in my travels in the US and I have never seen this before. Being guest of the day gifted me with a free upgrade to a suite and a $5 gift card to their gift shop. I'm sure the standard room would have been perfect, but the suite was absolutely lovely! Almost as big as my moderately sized apartment! \n\nEven if guests to come aren't chosen for \"Guest of the Day,\" you won't be disappointed. I have been so pleased with my stay at the Huntersville Hampton Inn & Suites. I will definitely be back next year when I attend the Renaissance Festival.
