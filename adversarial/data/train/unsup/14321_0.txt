Located in downtown Phoenix. We wanted to see Transylvania and it was only playing at this theatre. We didn't know that parking is validated by the theatre so we parked on the street. The theatre is definitely older and outdated. The theatre we were in was small didn't have movable armrests. \n\nI probably wouldn't go back to this theatre again.
