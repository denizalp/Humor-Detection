I am crazy about these wings and I'm not even a chicken wing person!\n\nMike's used to be a different name under other ownership but has re branded and the chicken is AMAZING!! This little place is a small chicken wing shop that offers fries, Boba and other snacks. The shop has a few tables with fun and bright decor but the whole place is all about the TWC rub.\n\nThey offer wings bone in and bone out along with combos. The smallest combo comes with 4 wings and you can get a side. The seasoned fries are so flavorful and perfection. Every time you order food, it comes out piping hot. They offer a ton of different flavors, half are dry rubs and the other are sauces. You have to get the TWC because the mix of flavors is beyond any words I can describe. You get a side of either blue cheese or ranch and it's extra for another sauce. \n\nLots of free parking out front and it's about time you run over hear and eat some of the best chicken wings you will ever have in your life! You're welcome.
