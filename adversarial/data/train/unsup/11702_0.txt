Supercalifragilisticexpealidocious. I'm serious. It's that good. \n\nAnd I'm talking everything here. The food (priority number one for me), the atmosphere, the service... EXCELLENT.\n\nThis was  my second time back and I was even more blown away... I got shivers, I closed my eyes, I made \"mmmm\" sounds. I think I embarrass Kyle when we go out to eat... whatever I like my food beezies!\n\nI ordered the Caprese sandwich again... the bread was a little crispy and made my mouth hurt but it still tasted like it was made by the gods. Instead of the caprese pasta salad (which is BOMB) I got the sweet potato pasta salad which was extremely good! I was SO FULL. \n\nKyle got the Picnic sandwich, which had him talking about flavor combos and \"mmm-ing\" to himself... so I'm not the only one here people. \n\nSo even though we were full I'm a dessert person I made Kyle share the bread pudding with me.... WORTH IT. It's smothered in the best whipped cream I've ever tasted and it's so eggy and delectable I died a little.\n\nWe also had coffee! The barista was awesome, so friendly and he recommended Kyle try the cortadito which was sweet but so perfectly blended with the espresso that I almost drank his whole drink instead of mine. I got a soy latte which was just ok bc the soy milk flavor was too strong. \n\neveryone was so helpful and friendly here. The busser even stopped to tell me the bread pudding is made with their cinnamon roll bread! Ahhhh-mazing!\n\nSO GO HERE
