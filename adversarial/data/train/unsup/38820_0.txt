It was a dream come true when this place opened right near me! Before this location opened,  I would go to their first location (near Christie Stn) and was impressed by the prices. Then, this location opened, and light broke through the clouds, angels sang and we all held hands, skipped and ate lollipops - well pretty close anyway! I compared this store to 6 others (including Essence of Life in Kensington Market, overpriced Noah's, waay overpriced Carrot Common, and a few others). In almost every item I compared (one was the same as Essence of Life), this place was cheaper! I love the variety - I make my own facial cleansers, washes, toners, lip balms etc and they have everything I need for to make them - at the best price! Their protein powders prices are fantastic: RAW ($35 - or $30 if you go now and they still have coupons - don't forget to ask for a free shakey bottle w wire ball inside w purchase), VEGA is also the cheapest I've seen in the city. Tons of spices and fantastic quality\/range of vitamins and supplements. Essential oils, and more expensive supplements (and some matcha teas) can be found over the counter at the cashier - which makes it a bit of a hassle when there's a line and you're trying to decide between a few products. Ear candles for $1.99 ea, great Sukin body products (and others), Dandy Blend, I always buy my $1.99 almond milk here, fantastic selection of products, foods, some organic produce, organic, hormone free meats in the freezer, Daiya cheeses etc etc. The staff here know me because this is my go-to place. It's my convenience, grocery, health food and potion store all in one!
