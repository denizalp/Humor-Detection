It takes a lot for me to write a one star review...but this place was incredibly disappointing. \n\nI met up with two girl friends for lunch on a perfect Saturday afternoon. We hadn't tried Garage yet, but had been excited to do so as we frequent the area often. The atmosphere was great! We were really looking forward to our experience and our meal. \n\nUnfortunately, we were severely disappointed. Our server was attentive and nice, but didn't followup the way I expected or hoped. I ordered the Caprese Mozzarella Salad (one of my favorite options on many a menu) and was shocked when my plate came full of tomatoes with two skimpy pieces of mozzarella and a tiny piece of basil (about as big as my thumb). There was no way that I was interested in paying $10 for a plate of tomatoes. I hate complaining at restaurants (being a past server), so I kindly asked ours for some extra mozzarella and basil. My frustration increased when I saw that I was charged another $2 for the extra two pieces of cheese. \n\nMy friend's meal was also a disappointment. She ordered the flat bread special of the day and it was drenched in grease, which made it very difficult to eat, let alone enjoy. She was only able to finish half of her meal. I expected our server to at least ask if she was unhappy with her food, but she just took the plate and walked away. \n\nAs great as this new joint seemed, I will most likely not be returning. It's a shame because the place really looked like it had potential. Unfortunately, the food was overpriced, poorly executed, and lacking quality and flavor. Sorry Garage...you're going to need to seriously up your game to earn me as a customer.
