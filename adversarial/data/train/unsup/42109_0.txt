I know they have been busy tonight and that is understandable for February 14th but I do expect my food to be good when it comes out. I should have know because we have had problems the last 3 times that we have come to this location. I had to ask for lemon 3 times to go in my water. My husband and I ordered a pick 3 to share. The ribs were very good but the grilled chicken breast was chewy and dry.  I didn't even attempt it after 2 bites.  Oh yeah... we got the chicken tortilla soup that should be called chicken flavored thickened broth because it was a stretch to find chicken or tortillas in it.  We ordered green beans as a side and we got seasoned vegetables. The waiter went to get the green beans and brought out a plate of dried whatever. See the pic and judge for yourself. I have never had brown green beans. This is it for me. I will make the hike and go to another location because it's apparent that this location does not want to do better.  Yes they are aware of my past disappointments because the last time we came they emailed us a survey to fill out and I was very detailed about our experience.  I would not recommend anyone come to this location unless you want to roll the dice on service and the quality of food.
