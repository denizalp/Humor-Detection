Looking for seafood in Vegas? this is your spot.  DÃ©cor was very nice, the wait staff superb, we had the Ahi Poke with avocado as an appetizer and it was by far the best ahi tuna app I have ever had.  Ahi tuna was marinated in a soy base and presented with micro greens and avocado.  Maine Lobster was the star of the show.  We each ordered 2 lb.  The waiter came back and said that they did not have any 2 lb so upped it for us...... presented on its back, cut open and easy to eat.  Very sweet meat.  Comes with the choice of two sides, I had the mushrooms and a baked potato.  All of which were briefly touched due to the Lobster being the star of the show.  The Makers Mark and water was a very nice pour.  At the end of dinner you are presented with a wet hot towel with lemon.  I have been to Vegas many times and this is a winner.
