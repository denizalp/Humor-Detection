I cannot claim to be an expert on Thai food, but it know what I like, and this place is very \"zen\" like - by that I mean that no matter how busy they are, the service is always smooth, never stressed.  The quality is consistent, never had a bad meal there.  Wish I lived closer, would be there once a week!
