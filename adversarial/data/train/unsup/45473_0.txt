Got quotes from 3 companies for removal of a King size mattress. It was bulky and hard to move. Eric was the first to quote and gave the best price. They scheduled time Tuesday morning at 7:30 and called 15 minutes before arrival. They were in the house and the mattress was gone in 1 minute. Great guys and highly recommend for junk removal
