One of the selling point for this place is dinner & a show, not much a show indeed on a Monday night I guess.  We sat at the noodle bar area, facing the open kitchen, there's nothing much to watch, no pulling noodles no juggling dumplings, haha it's ok it was fine with me, I was there for some succulent noodles anyway! \n\nWe ordered Lan Zhou beef noodles soup, beef brisket with tomato noodles soup & chicken mushroom pancakes.  The Lan Zhou noodles soup served with clear beef broth, top with thin sliced beef shanks.  It tasted a little bland compared to the tomato beef soup, well it wasn't fair, because soup bases were different, the clear broth supposed to have more delicate flavor while the brown broth should be more intense. \n\n While the beef brisket with tomato noodle soup served with brown beef broth tomato base, more like a beef stew soup with chunky briskets. Both beef soup was very light and seasoned to perfection.  The chicken mushroom pancakes was very juicy however it did have a little gamey aroma.  \n\nGlad we found this cute little noodles restaurant in this neighborhood, saved us a trip to spring mountains area!!
