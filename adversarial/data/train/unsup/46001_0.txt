Recently suffered devastating water damage to our newly constructed home. Thankfully, Edgar from AFR came in and took charge. He and his team immediately began the remediation process. They brought in state of the art water mapping equipment, infrared cameras, specialized blowers, dehumidifiers and a whole demolition crew. They fully explained and communicated their scope of work and performed it efficiently and effectively. Their professionalism was evident not only in their work, but also in their detailed reporting and final inspections. I can't say enough about this company. They were instrumental in mitigating our loss!
