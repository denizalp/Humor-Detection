Hidden from the main street, you might think you'd get a happy ending at Imperial Health Spa. Well, you do -- but not that kind! (If that's what you want, you're better off collecting those hooker cards. I hear some of those chicks are running $35 specials!) \n\nI missed out on the Onsen experience in Japan, so I heard about Imperial Health Spa and decided to at least get something similar. It was worth it. Thanks Yelp!\n\nUnfortunately traveling chica didn't want to come out here. Sharing bathwater and getting nekkid in Vegas just wasn't her thing! (Whether or not that's my thing will stay in Vegas!)\n\nBut hey -- I went in the morning around 8:30am and there were only a handful of people here, and most were in the co-ed area. The entire 1 1\/2 hr I was there, I only saw 1 person in the nekkid area, aside from the staff who was walking back and forth carrying the laundry. \n\nJust like in Japan, they have the rows of wash stations lined up in a row, each station supplied with a hand-held shower and shampoo, conditioner, and bath gel dispensers. \n\nAfter your bath, you can choose to soak in the pools. There are 3 types: the cool one, the warm one, and the hot one, which is a jacuzzi. I didn't feel like the cool one, so I sat in the warm and hot ones. Ironically, the \"hot\" was only warm, so it was weird sitting in a warm jacuzzi. The \"warm\" (which was really the hottest) was nice and relaxing and there was a TV beside it so you could occupy your time while relaxing. I stayed in this one the longest. Aaahh....\n\nThere were also massage rooms and a dry and wet sauna in the females only area. \n\nI decided to go to the co-ed area since it was covered in my fee (they provide some pajamas to wear in that area). They have more hot rooms. One was simply a big room to sit in, another contained little cave-like areas for each person to rest in (kind of reminded me of a dog house, Lol), and the best ones (there were two like this) had boxes that contained rocks that you lay down on. Soooo relaxing! Two types of rocks -- smooth and rocky (har har). I preferred the smooth type. \n\nI wish there were Korean spas in the South. Or Japanese spas. Or just something similar. There is a place by my house that says Tokyo Health Spa, but alas, it was just a massage parlor. And it isn't even run by Japanese. Not such a happy ending for me Lol. \n\nBut any day relaxing day spent at Imperial Health Spa is a happy ending, in my opinion. The spa is located far from the strip, so get a car and head north. It's worth it!
