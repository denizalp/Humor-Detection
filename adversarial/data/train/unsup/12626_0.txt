The part of old Vegas that needs to die.\n\nThis is the only spot we went to in this town that has a metal detector. That alone should have warned me off. The surrounding area is down and out. It seems dangerous even in the daytime. The interior looks like it hasn't been updated since Dean Martin hung out there. The wait staff puts in a good effort, but it feels like their spirits are broken. We ordered cocktails with ginger ale only to find that the soda was flat. We left before things got any worse. If you're in this area, you're better off going to Lady Silvia's (assuming you can find it.)
