Seriously, never again! We booked a room with a King Size bed and received a double Queen size bed... Don't try to tell them you don't want it because you reserved a King Size, they will treat you like an idiot and even start yelling at you! Not only the employee but the manager as well (so don't call him, it's useless). They will argue that it's not because you have reserved \"that type of room\" that you'll get it... Doh, what's the point of a reservation then? Just setup a website saying \"I want a room, deal with it!\". \n\nThe bedrooms (at the \"Paradise\"), are dark, very dark! There is also only a shower (no bathtub?).  \n\nThey also messed up at the checkout, charging the wrong credit card (they charged my friend's credit card who was in another room.  So he has been charged twice). \n\nI almost forgot to mention the nice radio wake up at 6:30AM, volume at the max! I couldn't find a way to turn it off or even turn the lights on (the light switch is at the entrance), so I had to reach the plug! Goddammit room service can't you check that thing when you setup a bedroom???\n\nI can't see one good thing for the Hard Rock Hotel in Vegas... The worse hotel we've ever been! As I said in the beginning, never EVER again!
