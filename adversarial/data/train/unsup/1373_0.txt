What's with Indian restaurants and great appetizers and going bust on main course. Anyways, appetizers are fantastic, drinks and main course is ok. Recommend trying Veg Mixed Grill platter comes in half (14$) or full (24$). If you are indian-chinese noodles fan try chowmein (NOT hakka). It's spicy and tasty.\n\nTry going in non-peak hours else you would be dead before your food is served as their service is pathetic and they tell everyone, everytime \"Oh, today we are short on staff\". I have heard it at least four times :-)
