The food was really good at this restaurant, and reasonably priced, but OMG, the table LOCATION was awful. This seems a silly thing to get worked up about, but the table was crammed up against a \"private\" party room with windows. My chair stuck halfway out into the entrance of the party room, so when a party of 15 came, I had more ass in my face than if I'd been at a strip club. Each time someone entered or left I had to move my chair for them. \nHonestly, though, I just about screamed when a man's rather large ass bumped into my face as he tried to move around people. Seriously, how can you enjoy sushi with a faceful of buttocks? \nI wouldn't mind going again sometime if I'm in the area, but I'll just sit and wait thank you very much, until a better table opens.
