My wife and I are San Fernando Valley Sushi heads all the way. Some of the best Sushi in the world on Ventura Blvd, it's a fact! \n\nWe have been searching all of Las Vegas for an all you can eat with great quality sushi, comfortable upscale decor, and friendly atmosphere. Sai delivers on all fronts. \n\nGreat job guys! The nigiri is buttery soft and delicious. We couldn't get enough. The apps were equally tasty with all of the guilty pleasure type rolls to match. We will be coming back soon!!!!!!\n\nChoi the chef killed it btw. Complements to the chef and Jay our server
