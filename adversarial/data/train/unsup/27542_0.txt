Green is by far one my favorite restaurants in the valley!  I've been a pescetarian for about 10 years but I try to eat vegetarian when I can.  If every restaurant was like Green, I would have no trouble!  Even my carnivore boyfriend loves their food, especially the Original 'G'!  I've rarely had something there that I don't love and most of the people I've dragged with me have said the same.  Do yourself a favor and try one of their sandwiches ASAP and don't forget the thyme fries!  YUM!
