I cannot recommend this place. They nickel and dime every chance they can get. Perhaps I would let that slide if the customer service was acceptable- it wasn't. There are plenty of places to stay in Vegas, I expect to be treated with respect of not royalty for the money being spent. \n\nPerhaps there is a disconnect with cultures, as many of the rude staff were obviously not native English speakers... Perhaps they can do some sensitivity training and at least try to not come off as rude, short, annoyed, and disrespectful. There did not seem to be much management available. \n\nSorry Aria, we really wanted to like you, but we have such a bad taste in our mouths, I cannot recommend but only warn others of our mistreatment. We even gave them the chance to right things at the end of our stay, and were once again disrespected. My wife has allergies and the staff commented to her the guest in line \"God I hope she's not contagious!\"... Haha have had better experiences at a cheap motels..
