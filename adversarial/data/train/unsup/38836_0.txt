I have been a patron of Il Bosco for a while. Being an X New Yorker I love pizza and noisy restaurants.  I have noticed that Il Bosco hardly ever has hardly any patrons in the restaurant.  The wine pours are very small and that bothers me ($8.50-$10.00) for a 4-ounce pour.  Some of the appetizers are quite tasty but recently the Cesar Salad (twice) has been tasteless. The pizzas are always tasty.  The restaurant looks old and tired, I believe this is a major turnoff to visitors and is a reason the place is never busy.  Basically, it lacks any atmosphere and character of an expensive restaurant.  Plus there is lots of noise from next door from a cowboy bar which is very annoying if you eat outside.  The bottom line, good pizza but when you drop $50-$70 for dinner expectations are not met. I hope the owner totally renovates or moves and builds an upscale place.  It will drastically improve the image and make him more profitable.
