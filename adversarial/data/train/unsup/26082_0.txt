This is my go-to nail salon because it's right by my gym. The OG staff is great. My nails always come out looking great. The reason why I'm giving 4 stars is because one of the new staff members kept hurting me while she was taking off my gel polish. She was using a rotating nail file and I kept getting painful\/ burning sensations on my finger nails. I let the first time go because I was on a moving massage chair. It hurt so much I asked them to turn the massage chair off so my body stops moving while she takes the gel polish off. It happened a few more times and I could see that she was starting to get irritated with me because when it happened, I would yank my arm away. Natural reflex. I felt the need to apologize because I felt like I was making her job harder for her, but it was painful. This has never happened when taking my gel polish off with the other nail techs at the location. She did apologize and made sure my nails weren't sensitive when putting on my new polish so that was nice of her. \n\nShe also made me feel bad. I came in at 5:30 and they close at 7. She said \"next time you come in, come in earlier so it's easier for us. It takes two hours to do what you came in to do\". And I get it, but if it was a problem and she told me when I checked in that there's not enough time to do both, I would've happily came back the next day as I don't like inconveniencing the staff. It's nice that they still did both a pedicure and nails, but maybe she kept hurting my nails because they were rushing to get me out before closing. \nBesides that, she also did a good job painting my nails and I left with nicely painted nails. \n\nI'll still go to their location because I'm loyal to the OG nail techs, I think I'm just a little traumatized from this last experience.
