This place is right next to my gym and so I'll stop by and check it out. I've asked myself why I keep coming back and the only conclusion I can come up with is that I'm a woman and I can shop the hell out of any place. \n\nI'm going to start with the parking lot. There's like 3 rows of handicapped parking spots and each row has at least 5 designated handicapped spaces. So we're talking 15 parking spaces dedicated to handicapped parking. THEN they have an additional 4 spots reserved for associates. I do not understand the logic behind giving employees the choice spots. They are going to be there for 8 hours, I'm going to be there for 15 minutes... well 30 once you take into account all the walking I have to do in the parking lot. \n\nOnce I'm finally in I head straight for the shoes. The shoe department is hit or miss. After shoes I round the corner to housewares and browse through the sale items and the I finish in the unmentionables department which is ALWAYS way over priced. \n\nIf I do buy anything, guaranteed the line will be long and there will be a lot of eye rolling going on. The staff is meh. The store could benefit from being more organized.
