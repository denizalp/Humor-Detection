If you love everything PUMPKIN, go to Sprouts, right meow. They literally have a massive display of all pumpkin products at the front of the store. I walked away with pumpkin spice peanut butter, pumpkin tea, pumpkin puffins, pumpkin seeds, GF pumpkin bread mix, literally anything your pumpkin loving heart desires! :) Just had to share for my fellow pumpkin lovers!!
