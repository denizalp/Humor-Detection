This place is so unique. What I love about it, is you can decide what you want on your hot dog (or vegan dog) by checking off items on a list. It has almost everything you can think of putting on meat, even fruit loops. I had the refried beans, egg, and curry peanut butter. It was an explosion of flavor. I recommend this place to anyone looking for a casual dining experience.
