Great locations coz it's at downtown summerlin but I have a felling that this restaurant will close down in a few months. The place is ok, not inviting. Music is not good, not cozy I guess! The food is ok, calamari was too salty, the meatballs were not so good with linguine, we were told it's spicy and we said it's ok but the flavoring and the consistency of food does not go well with too much spicy. Cute coke in a bottle drink, fried chicken waffles were OK, I've tasted better! Dessert is ordinary and simple. So all in all nothing to look forward to, I don't even like beers and most of their alcoholic drinks are beer and wine, I wish they have fruity mixed drinks as an option!! I gave 2 stars for location. Will probably not go back here until they upgrade their menu and music
