By far the BEST smoked meat sandwich I have ever had. Tried a few and really like the pastrimi one the most. Meat is tender but juicy and smoky. The perfectly toasted bread and sauces just make the sandwich perfect (mouth is literally watering as I speak). \n\nVery reasonably priced too!! Be sure to check it out!!
