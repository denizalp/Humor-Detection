So I want to start by saying the food was good.  The service was atrocious.  \n\nOur waitress had a major attitude and was absolutely put out to serve us.  This was perplexing since there was hardly anyone else in the restaurants.  Several times I would thank her to only get nothing in response except a dirty look.\n\nThe diet soda I was served tasted awful.  Someone I was with ordered water only to be served soda.  When he mentioned it, the waitress snagged up the soda, threw it away and as she walked away she mumbled \"I heard you say diet pepsi.\"\n\nOnce our food was ready some guy who had been sitting with another party and was dressed in regular clothes got up, walked into the kitchen, and came out and served our food.  This took me a little off guard but in the end it was okay because he was great!  Polite and attentive.  \n\nI ordered the pollo fundido burrito.  The green chili sauce had a kick, the tortilla was fresh and the chicken inside had great flavor.  The chicken was juicy, shredded, spiced and overall great.  They used high quality cheese and the beans and rice were good.\n\nThey offered two salsas, one chunky and one hot sauce style.  Both were good.  The complimentary chips were tasty.  \n\nI always put food above service when I review a place that is the only reason why they get three stars and not two.
