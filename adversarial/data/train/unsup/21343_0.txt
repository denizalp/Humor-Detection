Stopped by for for Vegas version of David Chang's restaurant from NYC...atmosphere amazing!! Perhaps had THE BEST waiter of all time as Joshua was something special...not your typical waiter, very open, friendly and NYC rugged but amazingly realistic style...everything he recommended was right on point!! Tried both alcoholic smoothie drinks and both were tasty!! Started with hamachi from raw bar menu with caviar and crispy rice and mustard seeds...amazing!!! This was a corrected order as demanded by Joshua since we told him we are big foodie eaters...and he was 100% spot on. We got the pork belly bao which is 100% must!!! This you seriously cannot miss or else you will be missing something in your life that you don't even know about!! Then had the pork belly ramen which was full of flavor...I was concerned from some \"plain tasting\" broth reviews but I personally thought it was perfect and full of flavor and I personally loved it!! Finished with ginger scallion noodles which you have to mix before eating and was pretty perfect meal!! Loved every part of it...with Joshua leading the charge!! Great meal and will definitely come back!!
