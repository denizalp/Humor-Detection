After a week here I guess it's time to finally make a review. \n\nWhere to start?  First off, the Palazzo is a newer section of the Venetian-Palazzo hotel.  The Palazzo was added years after the Venetian was here and it's a welcome addition for sure.  \n\nBetween the two hotels you have over 7000 rooms so it's huge to put it lightly.  There is a wonderful shopping mall called The Canal Shops\" which is one of the nicest shopping areas in Las Vegas and it houses many of the top brands in the world.  There are also many of the top restaurants in Las Vegas here as well.  You can easily come to the Venetian or the Palazzo for a week, never leave the facility and never get bored.  But then, this is Vegas baby and you need to get out and see what the city has to offer.  \n\nThe rooms here are what I believe are some of the nicest in the city.  Even the basic rooms have full baths with a soaking tub, walk in glass showers, dual sinks, separated toilet and floor to ceiling marble.  They are spectacular.  Did I forget to mention the flat screen in the bathroom too?  It has that as well.  \n\nThe beds are super comfy and the rooms are posh with two more flat screens (three total), a full fridge with tons of selections, a snack bar, huge sectional sofas all set into a sunken living room.  To continue, there are floor to ceiling windows with electric shades, dining tables for 4, etc.  The rooms won't disappoint.  \n\nThe service.  It's he best.  Period.  Need anything and I mean anything?  Ask the concierge and they will take care of it or steer you in the right direction. \n\nOverall, I would probably give 4.5 stars just die to the slight aging of some of hotel amenities but I'm not going to post 4 and dock this great place.  \n\nIf you want to stay at a top location in Vegas, look no further.  \n\nEnjoy!!
