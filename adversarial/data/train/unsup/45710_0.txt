I liked this place but wasn't wild and raving about it. I ordered their classic burger with pepper jack cheese and done medium. I took a bite and noticed how greasy it was. The fries were a little bit tougher than I thought. I got a mixture of sweet potato and regular fries, but really couldn't tell the difference. \n\nTheir beer selection was par. Only wished there would have been more local brews. \n\nThe service was fair, at best. It really bothered me that after we were done eating, she brought over the check without asking if we wanted anything else. There was no desert menu that I saw, but what if I wanted to order another side or have another beer?
