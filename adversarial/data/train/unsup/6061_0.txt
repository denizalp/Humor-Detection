With Musashi, as with other places I enjoy, its all about the food. I don't need a greeter with a plastered smile, or somebody doting on me every 15 seconds. If I have to wait 15 minutes for a table at Musashi, that's fine, cause I know the food more than makes up for it.\n\nThat said, I know this place is hit or miss. My sister and I absolutely loved the place, as did my Japanese roommates (always ALWAYS a good sign that your Japanese roommates love the same Japanese restaurant you do.) But, my brother and sister-in-law weren't too impressed. I think Musashi is good, solid Japanese food. Nothing too fancy. What they did they did well. Their agadeshi tofu is the standard against which all other fried tofus are measured. Light, crisp, with a flavorful, but not too salty, sauce. The katsudon is how it should be, hot, eggy, with just the right amount of gravy to flavor the rice. There is also a special Japanese menu, with \"snacks\" which make great accompaniments to beer and sake, or if you're in the mood for \"tapas\". I especially like the grilled cod and the beef tongue. There's also an excellent sukiyaki. The lunchtime bento boxes were also very good.\n\nYou gotta understand. When you're living in Charlotte, there's not much in the way of Japanese food. And when you've been to Japan three or four times, you start getting a taste for more than just the same tired sushi rolls. That's where Musashi comes in. They've got more than just the same standard sushi, udon, teriyaki and potato salad items that you find at the generic Japanese places dotting the US. And they don't try to get too fancy. \n\nAnd try to remember, its all about the food. Not about the lines, not the lack of greeting when you enter, not the crazy eyed lady who doesn't call you \"honey.\" It's the food.
