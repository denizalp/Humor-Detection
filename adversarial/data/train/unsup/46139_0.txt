$18.99 for all you can eat (AYCE) on a weekday is not bad, especially when you get 10% off when you pay in cash.\n\nThe food is good, not outstanding, but slightly above the usual AYCE quality.\n\n-- Rolls aren't padded with rice to make you full\n-- Sashimi is good\n-- Tempura and other fried food are prepared well too, especially the two types of shrimp they have (shrimp tempura and Osaka golden shrimp)\n-- Pork cutlets are super thin so they tend to be on the drier side\n-- Salmon is great, but the belly is my favourite\n-- Calamari? Not the fried kind. It wasn't great.\n-- Beef tataki has always been a miss for me, either warm or sliced too thick. \n\nService is economical and efficient. They're good with refilling tea if they see it, but otherwise, there isn't much interaction to judge. \n\nDuring our most recent visit, they missed a few orders entirely, which hasn't happened before. But they're pretty good with giving you what you ordered unlike those other AYCE places that decide you'll only get half the quantity of sashimi you ordered.
