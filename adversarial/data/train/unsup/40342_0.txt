We were seated at 3:00, and the food arrived about 40 minutes later which seemed slow considering the place wasn't very full. We are most of our meal without drinks since refills weren't given until we were almost finished. We repeatedly asked for extra salad dressing. The fourth time we asked, she brought it. The food was correct and good, but the service was really off for an Olive Garden.
