Where do the homeless go, during the day?  At night I see them in their jolly hobo camps by the tracks, heating cans of pork 'n' beans over an open fire, playing banjo and singing \"The Old Rugged Cross.\"  I always wondered how they spent their waking hours, now that the railroads have discontinued their \"Free Boxcar Rides\" service.\n\nThey're right here!  At the Twinsburg Public Library, surfing the web, snoozing under the daily Dacron Republican-Democrat newspaper, sink-showering in the men's room.\n\nAnd do you know how the staff handle these and other patrons?  With warmth, humanity, patience and professionalism.  My heart soars like a hawk.
