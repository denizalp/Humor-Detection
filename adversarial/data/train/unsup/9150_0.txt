In the relatively Cantonese dominated Chinatown of Cleveland, OH, it's hard to find very good Northern Chinese food. Han Chinese is a fairly solid entry in the Northern Chinese cuisine fare. The skewers are solid, as are the dan dan noodles and zha jiang mian. My parents are not big on sweets so we did not get the deep fried sweet potatoes, but I definitely want to try those in the future.
