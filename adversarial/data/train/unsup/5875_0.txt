This place is pretty tasty - came here under fellow Mississauga worker bee Mryem D.'s recommendation and guidance. It's basically a fancy subway with fresh\/high quality ingredients. They use ACE bread for the paninis. I had veal and eggplant with a chipotle mayo and a side of organic quinoa. Quite good! Maybe slightly too pricey @ 12$ for that plus a drink. \n\nI'd come here again...def better than most of the places in the surrounding area (chains).
