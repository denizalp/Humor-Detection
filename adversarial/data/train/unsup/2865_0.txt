Buffet was ok, if you're drunk, hungry, and pissed because you gave most of your money to the tables and slots this will the place for you.\n\nNo frills. You get what you pay.\n\nThey had oxtail soup and kahlua & cabbage.\n\nIt is in the older part of vegas and it reflected in the decor. \n\nThe service was pretty good, the waiter kept ou table clean and our cups filled.\n\nI can't say I'd come again, but if suggested by local family to go dine, I wouldn't object.
