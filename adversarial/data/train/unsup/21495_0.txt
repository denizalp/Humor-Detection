*** MUST READ *** **** MUST READ ***\n\nI honestly WISH I would have read the reviews before I went to try and get an apartment at Borgata. Worst experience of my life! I just wanna start off by saying FUCK ANNE AND ROBIN. Excuse the language but I am enraged. It all started when I got a call from Anne (leasing agent) sometime late August, she told me the apt I toured a few weeks earlier was going for a lower price and to come put a hold on it if I was still interested. I ended up going the next day because I was desperate for an apartment and put $270 down to hold it. Me and my girlfriend filled out some paper work that same day and like the review below me says, she will blow your phone up!! The old hag is annoying! Every little thing she would call, most of the time she called because of some papers she forgot to have us sign. I swear we came up to the office 3-4 different times because of their mistakes and it got to the point I just let the calls go to voicemail. She was verrrrrry unprofessional and sooooooo inconsiderate knowing I had to go to work. So a few days go by and they already start giving us a hard time, long story short it took weeks for us to get them to do a job verification because of some issues they were having with my gfs job. At one point we almost backed out because of all the shit we were going through and my gf straight up told Robin (manager) to cancel her application. A few days later I called and told her NEVERMIND that we are still going through with it! After that they tell me everything is going good and they were gonna finallllllly run our credit! A week goes by and here we were waiting for a phone call to find out if we got approved on the credit check, but I never got one so I called asking Anne if we got approved or not and when would be a good time to come sign the lease, she responded by saying she didn't know, all the paper work and information was in Robins office and she was gone for the day. Sooo another few days go by and I ended up calling this morning and spoke with Robin and guess what I found out ?! I got approved and my gf got denied. I just wanna know WHEN WERE YOU PLANNING ON TELLING US ROBIN!? She basically told us not to worry that she was gonna have a phone meeting with her boss and she would let us know if we would still be able to move in. She called me later that day and said we would be all good to move in Saturday but the grand total we had to pay was around $1,100 ARE YOU CRAZY? She said it was $300 extra because she didn't get approved! No way way in hellllllll we were gonna pay that much to move into some apartments, specially not one that had such a horrible staff. I called right back after she gave me the news and told her we are definitely not moving in. I asked about getting the $270 deposit back and as soon as I heard \"no\" we aren't able to get that back I instantly hung up on the bitch. Both Anne and Robin need to be fired if you ask me. They wasted so much of our time and money and at the end of it all we have less than a week to find a new apartment!!! Honestly I just don't want anybody to go through what we went through so I took the time to write this long review! Thank you if you took the time to read it all.. Hopefully it keeps many people AWAY from this place.
