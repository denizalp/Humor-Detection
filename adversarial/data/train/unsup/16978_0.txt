I visited this company in Oct 2015 with a prescription for 2 pair of thigh high compression stockings.  Mike was very helpful with the fitting and explanation of how to use the  stockings.  He told me that Blue Cross allowed 2 pair and the cost per pair was $110.   Within 2 weeks the stockings were slipping down.  I went back and saw Bill who gave me a bottle of glue to hold up the stockings.  (Excuse me, but I'm not going to glue stockings to my leg!)  I received my billing receipt from BC and Precision had charged BC for 4 pair totaling $400.  I called BC to tell them about the gouging and BC called them and got some kind of song and dance from them.  I went back to Precision and asked for the number for their billing dept.  She would not give it to me but dialed the number and handed me the phone.  This person double-talked me but it boiled down to them charging whatever they had to in order to get the full cost of their product.  Just today I called Precision again and asked why my receipt said I received 4 pair.  I was told they had to list it per leg and not by the pair.  She informed me each pair cost $100.  I will never use this company again because they are crooks.  Even though I didn't have any out of pocket expenses for these stockings, it's companies like this that cause our insurance rates to keep going up.
