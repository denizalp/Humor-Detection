Frozen fish filets and \"shrimp\" product straight from your grocer's freezer at fresh fish prices!   This place is so gross.  Their fish basket special includes one small rectangular piece of frozen fresh and some very questionable fried \"shrimp\".   I've never been so disappointed upon laying eyes upon an order before.  Please don't go here, it's disheartening.\n\nAlso they charge $.50 extra for tarter sauce even though you already paid $8 for a stupid fish stick and $1.00 for a refill.  I could understand if they had to keep fresh stock or something but they don't.\n\nThey should change their name to Pete's yuck and chips.
