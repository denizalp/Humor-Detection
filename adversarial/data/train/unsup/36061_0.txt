WORST CAKE EVER!!! I ordered my mother's 80th birthday cake 7 years ago from what used to be a phenomenal bakery. Now living out of state, I ordered a birthday cake for both of my grandchildren that were turning one year old. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT! Not only did it look like a 5-year-old had made it, but the cake was pretty much inedible. Bits of salt and\/or baking soda not mixed into the batter properly and basically just horrible. My daughter-in-law tried to fix it up to look more presentable, but unfortunately, that did not fix the cake itself. \nI emailed the bakery and received a reply about how the decorator looks at the written notes, and then determines how to decorate. She went on and on about that, as if perhaps it was MY FAULT  for not communicating exactly what I wanted. There was no explanation as to why the cake the was so bad, but of course you CANNOT DEFEND POOR QUALITY.  The owner also stated that of the 60 customers they serve every weekend, only one is dissatisfied. I think not. Read the rest of the reviews. For almost $60 bucks, I could have easily ordered a grocery store cake for much less money, that at least tasted and looked better. These people are SUPPOSED TO BE PROFESSIONALS!  I think not! And for all of the \"nice girls\" at the front and answering the phones, I would advise you to seek out other employment. Your sweet demeanor is not going to save this place. Reputation is everything, and this company's reputation is quickly being flushed down the toilet. Maybe they shouldn't have let all of the previous employees go, at least they knew what they were doing!!!
