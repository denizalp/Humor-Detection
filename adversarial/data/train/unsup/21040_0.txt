TRAILER MINUS \nI bought a trailer, Curt hitch and curt ball joint. Had it all installed by trailer plus one year ago and drove it 1200 miles from Phoenix to Seattle, went over a speed bump and the trailer popped off the hitch, so I thought I broke it myself. So I parked it and left it till I had the time and money to fix it so I Brought it to this store recently to get the trailer fixed but Come to find out they installed in Phoenix a 1 7\/8 ball joint, the trailer required a 2\" (This store even charged me for a new ball joint SHAMEFUL!!!) I called their corporate office and they lie to me and tell me they don't sell Curt ball joints? I bought a Curt hitch? So I guess I just brought a ball joint from them then took it off put a smaller one on on purpose then loaded my two small children right behind the trailer with a couple of thousand pounds behind them and drove it for a couple of states? I called them to see if they would help me fix the scratches on the back of the vehicle that were caused by the trailer sliding into it when it popped off, I'm not even asking for any money for when it popped off the hitch while I was unloading and fell scuffing and bruising my shoulder or the risk my children took, or even when it popped off at 55 miles an hour and I was able to slow down with it chained to my vehicle, I still have trouble driving with the trailer cause I can't focus on the road, I can't stop looking in my mirror fearing it will pop off... so if you want to buy from this company and have an issue you have been warned!
