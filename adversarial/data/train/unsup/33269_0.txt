I have been going here for multiple oil changes over the last year and after my last oil change my car started driving weird so I took to the shop and thought nothing of it. Turns out Jiffy lube forgot to put oil in my car! I had been driving for a few weeks with no oil in my car. Please check your oil after getting it changed. This mistake cost me 250.00 in repairs and new oil
