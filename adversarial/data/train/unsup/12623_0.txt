Can't say that I have dined at every Indian Restaurant in the Phoenix Metro area but I sure have dined at many... Yes, it's true I LOVE me some good Indian food.  We'll anyway, the point I was making (yes, the point!) is that so far, The Dhaba is the best of the best.  Perhaps the most expensive too but like they say, you commonly get what you pay for. \n\n4 stars not 5 because I have been to London and the Indian food there is just off the chain!  If this was rated in comparison to all of London the folks at The Dhaba would not be happy with me as there would be one less star.  However, in all fairness... Best of Phoenix!  Thank you guys!
