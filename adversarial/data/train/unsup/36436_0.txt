Very unprofessional I contacted Bright Beginnings so that I may tour the facility for my infant daughter.  I thought I had called the wrong number the way I was greated over the phone was shocking. The associate did not even state the name of the childcare facility and seemed very clueless. She answer the phone and said this is Brittany, I looked down at my phone and made sure I contacted the right number once again I was very shocked. I asked her if this was the childcare facility and than asked if I could tour the facility. She answered back and said uuuugh yeah sure. I will not give this Childcare facility the time of day after that phone call. FYI FIRST IMPRESSION ARE EVERYTHING.
