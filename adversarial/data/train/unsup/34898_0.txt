My mom & I came in for mani pedis. All of the workers were very nice and welcoming. We got our pedicures first. We were offered a beverage as soon as we sat down, which was very nice. A few minutes after I sat for my pedicure another worker came to start my gel mani, while I was still in the pedicure chair. I felt very rushed and by the time my pedicure was done, the worker had already applied my color coat to my gel manicure. My cuticles were not cleared up very well or pushed back and my nails were not shaped, like I asked for them to be. In the middle of applying my second gel coat, we had to move from the pedicure chair to a nail station to finish. When I left I realized that my nails weren't neat and fully filled in like they should be. A few days later the gel began to lift on the sides. Now a week later and they look terrible. Things get stuck under because they are lifting. I'm very disappointed in the quality. The three stars were given because whole staff was very nice and talkative during my service, but I wish more time and attention would've been spent on my pedi and gel mani. I feel like if my manicure was started at the manicure station and not rushed, it would've came out good. :(
