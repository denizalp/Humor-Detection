for anyone who hasn't tried Basil Box, it is a MUST. \nas one of the only healthy places on campus, it not only makes you feel amazing after you eat it, but it's actually absolutely delicious. \n\nit works as a build your own box, you can choose your base (salad, rice noodle, rice etc), choose your veggies, meat, and sauce. there's LOTS of vegan options, in fact, everything is vegan (except the meat!) for veggies there are sweet potatoes (this is absolutely delicious), corn, peas, and edamame. for the vegan options, there's coconut curry tofu which was flavored just right! The sauces weren't all very attractive, but as someone who can't tolerate spice I went with the tangy sauce and it was actually pretty good! \n\non top of this, the customer service of this place has got to be one of the best! the workers there are super inviting and always make sure you're enjoying the place. i love the culture and vibe of this place, definitely will be one of my new go-to's on campus!
