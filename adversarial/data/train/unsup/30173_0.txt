I've been here a couple of times already. The test of good milk tea for me is if they can make it sugarless. They had to water it down here which means its made from a premixed powder so I'm not a fan. Their iced latte is good. Their service is the main reason I still give them four stars... super friendly and helpful. And they have stamp cards.
