READ THIS IF YOU ARE ADOPTING:  The workers at this Shelter have been trained for many years often, and they do know what red flags to look for when it comes to adopting.  I have read the negative reviews and can see why they wouldn't allow an adoption of some of the animals immediately.\nRemember when you deal with this Shelter that they are on the animals side always and not the humans.  They will do what they feel is best for the cats and dogs first and foremost.\n\nYes, they do a number of adoptions per week.  I know as I see them all the time.  I asked and found out they make their money primarily off the Thrift Store and not the adoptions, so there is nothing in this for them turning an adopter down--unless there are some critical issues that would put the animal at risk--and they will not take a chance on an animal being harmed.\n\nI have been here many days to look around at the cats, and the one thing I know is that I have never been treated rudely--if anything, they have encouraged us to play with the cats and get to know them.  My friends and I have always felt welcomed.\nIn addition to that, we can say that they treat the animals extremely well and with great caring for their health and safety.\nThe facility itself is very nice, too, with a lack of smelly odor I found at other shelters.\n\nThis is an overall excellent facility for any cat or dog to adopt from, and, since the Vet is in the same building, they are well taken care of.
