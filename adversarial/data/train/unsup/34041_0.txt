I took my two teen daughters in here for the first time. My 17 year old left in tears. We only managed to get one brow done. Apparently she has very sensitive skin and maybe less pain tolerant and the lady was very rough and had no empathy whatsoever. I got the feeling that she had no patience for this. My 15 year old did a little better, though a few cut marks were on her brow where the thread had pulled the skin. She also did not speak English at all. So for two girls who had never had this work done, this lady was not a great choice. I however, had my lip and chin done, she did a good job. She also did not charge me for the one eyebrow on my older daughter, so I guess that's a plus. I hate how this place is out in the open. There is nothing covering the windows so everyone in the mall can watch you get your lip and chin done. It is embarrassing enough to have unwanted facial hair, but to have to sit like you're a fish in a fishbowl, not fun. There was NO privacy whatsoever. You have the work done in the 'lobby', 'waiting room' whatever it is called, right in front of all the other people who are waiting. She gets two stars only because she did a pretty good job on me.
