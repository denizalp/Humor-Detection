Hot Taco is completely off the hook!! Food, Drinks, Atmosphere. ..all amazing! I ordered the mini street taco platter...every one of the tacos was good, with super special praise for the carnitas, the as ads and the molida!!! wow! Moved from Cali to the Charlotte area over a year ago and finally discovered South End. Great neighborhood with an excellent Mexican joint. Feel like I am home in central Cali having a great meal and an awesome margie!!! Will definitely be coming back and people with me!!!
