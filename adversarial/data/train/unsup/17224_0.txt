Happy hour 2-5pm and 9-11PM everyday, half off house margaritas and all appetizers. in vegas, unless you're gambling, i think its a great deal!  for $2.00 i had a huge basket of chips and salsa and i literally couldnt stop eating the chips! i dont know what they put n the chips but it was soooo good. the house margaritas are HUGE but of course, not strong enough for me.\n\nour server was really nice and even though she was the only one on the floor, she was very quick and did a wonderful job assisting us with our order and even suggested what to get and what not to.\n\nthe whole ambiance of the place is rock and roll and las vegas. 1980's rock music videos blaring through the televisions and even the clientele is very....1980's. LOL you cant beat the happy hour here and for 3 margaritas and a giant basket of chips with salsa for $16, we walked about pretty happy and slightly tipsy.
