We went to Romados shortly before we left to the airport to go back to NY. There was a short line that moved along pretty quickly towards the back of the store. We ordered a chicken dinner platter to share amongst the three of us and it was the perfect amount! The platter came with chicken, a nice salad, and fries. We upgraded our fries to poutine fries for a couple of dollars and it was well worth it. The chicken was nice and tender with a crispy skin and had a nice spicy sauce to it. The fries come well seasoned with herbs and spices and taste even better when you upgrade it to poutine. This was a pretty delicious quick meal and relatively cheap too! Definitely a must try if you're looking for amazing Portuguese  chicken.
