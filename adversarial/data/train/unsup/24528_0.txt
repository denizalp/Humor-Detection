BEWARE. Stay as far away from this mall as you can.. There is literally nothing here. Waste of time and space. Why is it still even open? \n\nI've seen homeless people hanging out in the parking lots asking for money, and you see the sketchiest things in every corner. \n\nPlease don't walk here anywhere alone, unless you have pepper spray, hehe.\n\nI remember growing up this was the mall to be at! Oh memories.. Blue neon lights adorned the overcrowded food court and there was people people everywhere! And stores!!\n\nIt's so sad and terrible to see what's left of this mall. They need to just tear it down ASAP.. as there is no shops left, WAH. \n\nOh and please hold on to your purse as hard as you can if you do tend to visit this place... or don't carry one at all..
