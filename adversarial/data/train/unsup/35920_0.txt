I was not happy with my experience. The staff interaction was terrific but lacks overall management. My brownie was crunchy because they are kept open to the air and it didn't taste fresh. The other issue with this coffee shop is cleanliness. For a relatively new business, it is quite dirty and worn looking. Look around and you will see what I mean. I would most likely not come back to this location especially when there are so many other choices in the area.\nThe only thing saving this business in my opinion is the amazing frontline staff.
