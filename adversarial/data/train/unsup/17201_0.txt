Sadly disappointed, waste of $90. My wife and I had been to Blue Hound the first few years when it opened and loved the BBQ ribs, deviled eggs and drinks. We planned to have a nice night out again and eat some of the traditional plates we had but they changed the menu and sadly disappointed in the portion sizes, lack of creativity and flavor of and in the food. \n\nTo begin the deviled eggs were nothing compared to the ones at Del Friscos. Lacked flavor and taste. My wife had the Swordfish which was good, and I had the Neiman Short Ribs - bad decision - it was mainly thin flat meat with fat and tasted bathed in salt.  When I told the waiter he looked at me as though I didn't know meat had salt and said they were \"salt friendly\" as though I would have changed my mind.  The manager walked over shortly after and asked how the sharing of our first dish was going instead of apologizing and asking if there was anything they could do to make the experience better. \n\nWhen the next dish was brought out, Trout, it too tasted over salted but as I was too hungry I ate it and just wanted to call it a night. \n\nI WILL NEVER GO BACK!
