(Duck review)\nI know no Vietnamese Lasvegan favor this place because everytime I talk to Vietnamese people, they don't recommend here. They recommend me Saigon 8. I've been here a couple of times and the food and the service is always good to me. I never had authentic Vietnamese food in my life. Well, I come here for duck. I eat pho, too but the main purpose of me coming here is duck. Their duck is reasonably priced and pretty good (not too fatty). It's super crowded everytime I come here that I have to wait 30 min to be seated.
