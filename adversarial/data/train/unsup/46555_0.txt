First and not last stop here, was in the neighborhood and decided to stop after seeing the outside grill and of course the grill smell is a favorite. Entering the establishment right away the ribs in full view being cooked in rotisserie fashion enter the ordering line with all food in full sight.   Clean and the freshness of that food now has me anticipating...ordered sat and wait time minimal to receive order, I had a combo baked beans and salad and also at the table a bbq sandwich... Now the sandwich was a surprise of a mountain on the roll with slaw... Myself, I do not care for a soggy sandwich so pass,, But the combo made up with the Rotisserie style ribs... NO SAUCE NEEDED,salad FRESH, beans had a zing to them that I liked.... all in all in my opinion and observation, the quality of the cooking far outreached other bbq establishments that charge  a while lot more and yet the flavor and enjoyment did not match.... cant wait to go again.....
