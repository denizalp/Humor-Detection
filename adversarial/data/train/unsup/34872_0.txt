I am a big Beatles fan. I have also had the soundtrack album for this show for years before finally getting a chance to actually see the show. I was very excited to finally go. Call me biased, call me the right audience for this show, whatever. This show is amazing!\n\nAs soon as you walk in you're immersed in Beatles history. A huge multi-colored light up walkway takes you towards the bar serving several Beatles-themed cocktails. Entering the arena (in the round) you're confronted by four large sheets with projected images of the Beatles on them. In the background you can hear mostly instrumental Beatles songs, which put me in the mood to hear an hour and a half of Beatles music. They did exactly what I would have done; they played almost exclusively Beatles songs NOT featured in the show itself, which I appreciated.\n\nEverything about the pre-show sets you up for the fun and exhilarating show to follow. An actor walking in the crowd snuck behind an audience member and sat in his seat before he could. It was this type of unnecessary fun that made the entire experience fantastic. The show itself starts with a haunting display of acrobats slowly descending from the ceiling and ascending from the floor on wires in slow motion to the song \"Because\" but only the vocals.\n\nSoon after the show bursts to life. I won't ruin it for you. You should go see it. There was so much visual spectacle happening at once that my girlfriend and I often didn't even know which amazing stunt to look at! A note: watch the guy on the swing high above the stage, it will make your heart stop. I was overwhelmed by the amazing acrobatics happening in front of me. The people at Cirque know how to dazzle.
