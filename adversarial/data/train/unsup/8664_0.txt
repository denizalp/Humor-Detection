Please take this review with a grain of salt.\n\nI like yoga, in fact I really like it - and this would include Hot Yoga.\n\nBut I had one of those group deals, prob. the same one as Catherine L ($20 for 20 classes), and went to only 1 of the classes.\n\nI came home, complaining about the experience -- it just wasn't for me.\n\nI'll start with the good - good for you, me, for any of us who want to exercise.  Sometimes the hardest thing, is to get out there and just do it!\nLocation was downtown, clean place, nice staff.\n\nNow the not so good...  I get the feeling this is one thing that you're either going to like or not like.  I guess I really don't like Bikram.  The instructor was good, but I was the only person who was a newbie in the entire class.  The class had about 30+ participants.  The instructor spoke with confidence, structure, and focus.  One person slowed down, and got in trouble - he said matter of factly, that it wasn't the time to slow down - and told her to basically catch back up.\n\nHe put us through series of movements, of which Bikram consists of 21 asanas\/poses.  His version of a reward... after we did multiple and consecutive difficult poses... was a sip of water.  Ugh.\n\nNo one, is allowed to leave during the session.  I think this is to keep the VERY HOT HEAT, IN.\nBest you go to the washroom beforehand!\n\nThe instructor himself, who teaches more than one class of Bikram per day, did not do the poses himself.  He kept an attentive eye on us all, and how our poses were.  I would have liked the exemplar model (the instructor) to instruct us on the poses, by showing us how he'd do them.\n\nIF you're high in endurance, if you're hardcore, and possibly slightly masochistic, this might actually be your highway to heaven.
