Luna's is my surprise new favorite restaurant in Charlotte. I travel to Charlotte a lot for work, and finding healthy places to eat is difficult in a new city. But Luna's fits the bill perfectly. \n\nI'm by no means a vegan, nor even a vegetation, but I do love vegetables and often find that restaurants focus too much on the \"comfort\" of meats and fried foods rather than veggies. That's where Luna's is different. \n\nFrom the moment you enter, Luna's feels like you're entering a hip yoga studio rather than a restaurant. \n\nI've only ever had take out, but the two \"entrees\" I tried were excellent. The rawco taco salad was big, spicy, and garlicky goodness, served with a side of delicious seams crispy things. Honestly I don't know what they were but I loved them. \n\nI also tried the pad Thai. I've never had zucchini noodles before, but these were super. At first I thought they had used real noodles instead! The dish is a delectable combination of 'noodles', bell peppers, bean sprouts, and lots of other veggies, mixed together with an amazingly tasty spicy peanut sauce. I'm actually not a huge fan of pad Thai in general, but this vegan version is amazing!
