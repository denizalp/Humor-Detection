This was our first In-N-Out burger experience, and it was a good one. It is definitely one of the better fast food burgers out there. This location gets excellent marks for allowing us to walk in 5 minutes prior to close and actually seem happy that we were there.\n\nWe had the Double Double and an order of fries. The double double was flavorful without being greasy. The fries were good, obviously very fresh. This place rates pretty high for me among fast food joints, a close second to Wendy's in the flavorful burger department. It actually gets a bump above Wendy's for their fries, since In-N-Out Burger has much better fries.\n\nAll in all, a solid choice for fast food with great employees that care.
