From being a tourist to now a local, I've always wanted to try this place. Located at The Forum Shops in Caesars Palace, you won't bypass this restaurant. It's literally located by a popular photo spot. We opted for \"outside\" seating. Perfect atmosphere with the faux sky and people watching. \n\nWent on a Monday night for dinner. Boyfriend and I looked at their online menu (obtained from their official website) and we had our heart set on a couple items...only to find out when we're actually seated that the Spinach Artichoke dip was no longer available. What!?! =( Even our waiter was like \"yeah it was a really good dip too.\" Okay now...if it was really good, why did the chef remove it!? Boo. Not good.\n\nSo we settled on a different appetizer instead. We got the POLPETTI DI GRANCHIO-crispy crab and pasta balls with marinara-like dipping sauce. This was delicious! I tasted more crab than pasta. It looks like the pasta was little macaroni so it wasn't too noticeable. It was so good I forgot to take a pic of this.\n\nWe also got a Caesar salad and pepperoni pizza to share. The pizza was delicious....thin crust with some basil added which was a plus. Almost a perfect rating but the pizza was on the smaller side. Even with the two of us, and we're light eaters too, we were able to completely finish it. Plate completely empty. We each had 4 slices but they were very small. (almost like kid sizes) So 4 slices here is like 2 slices at a Dominoes or Grimaldi's Pizzeria.\n\nSince I'm always here shopping...we will definitely be back. There were some pasta dishes\/chicken parm I want to try next time.
