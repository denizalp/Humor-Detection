I have to say I haven't been to this location in a long time. This is right in the middle of my old neighborhood. I went here with my amazing girlfriend for lunch. I was wondering how it would be. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. First off the place is very clean. They still have the same d√©cor that was up 10 to 15 years ago but instead of having an inch of dust on it everything was sparkling clean. Now the booth we sat in had a small tear in the seat and the cushions sunk in a lot when you sit down but that wasn't a big deal.\nI realized while looking at the menu that I had never had one of their Chimis and they claim to have invented the dish so I guess I better try one. Have to have the specialty of the house because if that is their specialty and it is no good how can anything else be.\nTheir salsa was really good. It had some different things added into it but it worked. I could have filled up on the chips and salsa. Good thing I didn't because the chimi was great. The sauce they put over the top of it was just great. I got the pork but next time I want to try the shredded beef. Even the rice and beans were good.\nOur server Christine did a great job too. My water and my girlfriend's iced tea glasses were never empty. Plus she was really nice.\nI don't know about the other locations but I will be back to this one for sure. It is nice to see an Arizona institution still going after all these years. Still making good food too. I was pleasantly surprised.\nI am happy that this was my 100th review on Yelp. Good place for that milestone.
