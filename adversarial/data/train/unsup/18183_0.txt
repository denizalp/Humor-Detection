They have some of the purest tasting, high quality, matcha drinks I have ever tried!  Other places like coffee shops or boba shops that offer matcha drinks are very diluted and\/or sugary.  \n\nI like that the matcha flavor is very prominent and the intensity of the green color is indicative of how good it is.  The foam layer complements the drink well and provides a subtle creaminess and sweetness without overpowering.  I love the tiramisu foam here because of the faint coffee flavor I get when mixed with my matcha drinks.  \n\nWhich grade to get?  The imperial is your highest and you can taste and visually see the difference.  It is a brighter green color and has more bitter notes.  The Uji (replaced Fuji) is a bit more duller green and was just as delicious.  I have not tried other drinks here yet, but they do offer other teas.\n\nI cannot wait to try their food items here!  Someone come with me and share the toast!  The interior is amazingly cute. I love the decals on the wall, very instagrammable.  Colors are nice, very soothing and relaxing.\n  \nPlease deliver to me when I am working across the street *wink ;)
