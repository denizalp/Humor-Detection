I love a place that greets you with this kind of enthusiasm.. they make you comfortable when you walk in.. they walk you through your options so you never feel like you don't know what you're doing .. \n\nI had the Marinated and spicy tuna over half brown rice\/ half salad greens .. crab & seaweed salads (extra) .. avocado (extra) ... how pretty is the mango and watermelon radish.. with the sesame dressing. Delicious and filling.. every bite is different.\n\nThey sell watermelon water, cold brew and boxed water (funny).. we had the peach green tea .. \n\nFresh and yummy.. they get busy at dinner time .. dining room has limited seating .. we'll be back .. don't forget to get a punch card for free food
