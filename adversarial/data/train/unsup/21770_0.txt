Here's how my story usually goes: It's the middle of summer, every place has the air conditioning set to Arctic, to prevent hypothermia I'll need a hot beverage.\n\nWhile walking around the Grand Canal Shoppes at the Palazzo, i spotted this place to warm up my bones.  Yes, even in the middle of summer I need any drink of mine to be hot.  I was greeted immediately.  I noticed on the signage of their use of Lavazza Coffee.  Hook, line and sinker.  The lady and gent behind the counter were helpful and friendly.  They asked extra questions about my drink to make sure it was how I liked it.  Very nice!\n\nI ordered my usual skinny SF vanilla latte.   Some places have actually screwed up this drink before.  Luckily Cafe Presse got it right.  Perfect balance of steamed milk and espresso.  To make things even better, I could absolutely taste the smooth and rich Lavazza flavor.  Delicious.  \n\nIf you happen to be near restaurant row or by the Sands Showroom, you're in luck.  Coffee lovers unite!
