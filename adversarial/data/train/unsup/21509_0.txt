Oh the Calgary Stampede. If you've never been to Calgary or are planning a visit, the 10 days in July during which this event takes place are when you'll want come.\n\nThere's a lot of work that goes into pulling off the \"greatest show on earth.\" Thousands of volunteer hours, oodles of committees tackling different aspects of the event... I'm not sure anyone realizes just how much goes into the production. Anyone you know volunteering for any committee throughout the year... buy them a drink the next time you see them! I know a few good Yelpers who help keep those wheels going round... \n\nStampede is one of those things you need to experience at least once. Heading to the rodeo, watching the chucks, walking through some of the exhibits on the grounds... and of course the almighty parade of products... There wasn't actually much disdain in that sentence, I do enjoy doing a walk through and seeing what gadgets everyone's getting all excited about.\n\nThe midway has gotten a bit old... and a whole lot of expensive! Although for the foodie in you, the ridiculous finds at some of the food stands can be fun to explore. I really quite enjoy that the concerts on the Coke stage are still free with gate admission (that could very well be the thing for me that makes or breaks a 3 or a 4 star rating!). Or if you pop down before a certain time of the morning, free altogether :). And there are usually at least 2-3 acts I want to go see.\n\nOver the years, Stampede and I have found a common ground. I spend a couple of days checking things out, and then I go back a top my hill in Renfrew and watch their pretty fireworks night after night. Seems like a fair trade, yes?
