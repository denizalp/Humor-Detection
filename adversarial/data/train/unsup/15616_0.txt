Crispy, crunchy, juicy, hand battered chicken marinated in Louisiana seasonings = one happy belly.\n\nWhether you are a fan of Popeyes' mild or spicy recipe, \nIt is sure to satisfy your hunger cravings.\n\n4 Stars overall due to prompt service. I was in and out pretty quickly and the food was piping hot. Chicken was cooked perfectly- crisp on the outside and juicy, moist on the inside. Seasoning is delicious and I especially enjoy the fact that their chicken isn't as greasy as other fried chicken establishments.\n\nI must add that the cost was a bit higher than your average Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen locations but what else would you expect from any business located in an airport.
