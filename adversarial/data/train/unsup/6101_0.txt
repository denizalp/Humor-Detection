F#%$ this noise. \n\nI take clean over fancy anytime. \n\n\nThe beds were NASTY-no mattress cover- did not use fitted sheets. Had a naked down comforter (no duvet) with stains. \n\nThis one was the icing-After a hot clean shower I go to put on the robe they provide. As I start getting ready I notice something in my pocket--------I find disgusting DIRTY g-string panty in my robe pocket. \n\nI don't think I'll be staying here. \n\nThe hotel is  beautiful, hip, trendy, and yes a great day club and night club but when I'm paying $$$$  to stay here-please keep up the quality. Starting with the rooms first and then move on to the disgusting carpeting around the halls.
