Where is everyone? Srsly Middleton! Show up. Represent! \n\nAfter an exhausting... er I mean underwhelming trip to World Market Tom, Ryan and I decided it was time to make the drive west worth it. Tom had been craving Korean for some time and because I don't make decisions I was game. The interior is pretty fancy pants for a small strip off the beaten path. Nice booths, tasteful artwork, cool color palate. But the paper napkins? That's like going to L'Etoile and eating dinner with a spork.\n\nHere's the thing though, I'd eat K Peppers with a spork, with a spatula or with my own bare hands, heck I'd eat K Peppers with YOUR bare hands... it's that good. We started with Topokki, Korean rice cake and a boiled egg cooked in a sweet and spicy sauce. We all thought 2 stars (spicy) was pretty darn spicy, but the sweetness balanced it out. From there, I moved on to Bulgogi which was unbulgogievable (wah wah). Tender meat, sweet soy, some veg for good measure... it was bomb, more than I could polish off after the app, but great for breakfast. \n\nA little bummed that we were the first table there at ten after six, and the only table dining for the hour-ish we stayed. But maybe people just don't know K Pepper's brilliance just yet. \n\nGet to know.
