Whenever I'm in Montreal I visit this shopping center.\nVery easy to find in the downtown area, and although it can be busy on the weekends but it never really feels crowded. Lots of variety here and great food court area with good food. I will usually stop by here in the afternoon for lunch and have a panini sandwich.
