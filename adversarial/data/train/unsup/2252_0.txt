My wife is still convinced that everyone who was a volunteer on the show was a hired hand but there's no way he could've pulled off some of the tricks he did even with help!  I guess this means we have to go back and see it again.  \n\nGerry was very entertaining and it was quite amazing the kind of information he was able to pull out of people.  Why is this guy stuck at a bar in Hooters?
