Horrible service. Did not even try it. I went in and pointed to a strange looking hotdog while asking the employee what it was. He bluntly replied with a horrible attitude that it was just a hotdog. Asked him what it had on it and pointed at the sign instead of describing it to me face to face as if he was begging to be replaced with a vending machine. If I wanted to read I would read it or gone to an automated restaurant.
