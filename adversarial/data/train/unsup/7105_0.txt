This was home base for this past weekend in Vegas.  Even with a discount and booking straight through them, it wasn't \"cheap\".  It was still like 120 a night and the room wasn't that great.  I was actually surprised by the casino part.  It was pretty big and had fun playing there.  Drink service was good for the most part.  My buddy was having a bachelor party and they were staying next door at the Luxor.  I saw the rooms at the Luxor and they were smaller than ours here AND were like 50 bucks a night more.  Jack move!  I liked how it was connected though to basically New York New York, MGM and Luxor though.  Good times.  Beds were ok.  Couch was small.  If I got a free room here I would stay again but I doubt I would seek this out and shell out more than 65 a night for this place.  I did win a decent sized Wolverine stuffed animal by using my Larry Bird basketball skills and making a shot.  I brought it home so my dog could play with it.  First thing he does is hump the shit out of it.  Funny!  Good times!
