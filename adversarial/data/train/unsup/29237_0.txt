Fresh, not greasy, great flavor! We have eaten here twice so far and have been very pleased. So many Thai and Chinese restaurants seem to be overly greasy, but not so at Jacky Chan! It is cooked to order, so it is fresh, the vegetables were crunchy (we loved the Jacky Chan Combo broccoli with shrimp, chicken, beef and pork!), and the flavor was delicious. We also really enjoyed the kung  pao scallops! They were nice sized, tender, scallops in a very tasty sauce. I like to eat the dried chiles, and these were cooked just enough. The rice is soft and fluffy. The only thing I wasn't too keen on (I would not order them again) was the spring roll. We got a free order of them for spending a certain amount, but they did not have enough filling...it was all wrapper and kind of dry, and tasted mostly like old grease. That was the only disappointment, but at least they were free. Everything else was wonderful!
