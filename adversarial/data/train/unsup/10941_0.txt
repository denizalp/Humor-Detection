In my eyes, this LA Subs is a glorified Nathan's that also sells subs (this location is listed on Nathan's website). When I am spending time on the Strip and am buffeted out or want to eat light, Nathan's is good fast food that satisfies my hunger. Of course being on the Las Vegas Strip, it is pricey fast food. \n\n Going back to the early 80s, and maybe even the late 70s from a little child to a middle-aged adult I have been a fan of Nathan's crinkley cut fries. Now that I live in Las Vegas, the only opportunity to enjoy these delicious crinkley cut fries is when I'm on the Las Vegas Strip. On a mellow day of the recent staycation  hanging out in the Wildlife Habitat, we decided to have Nathan's from the Flamingo food court LA Subs. \n  Where the quality of Nathan's crinkley cut fries have been consistently good the last 35 years, good management has been inconsistent. On this staycation, just the day before we had a lousy experience with the Bally's Nathan's. The experience at this glorified Nathan's was the opposite. As soon as we ordered the food, one lady was starting to make the food while the other processed the order. An expensive order by the way. A Pepsi, crinkley cut fries, and Chile cheese hot dog came to over $17.\n\n  The Flamingo food court featured sufficient seating. There were zero issues with cleanliness. The soundtrack was the oldies hits that poured out from Johnny Rocket's creating the feel that I was dining in the Coney Island Nathan's back in the 60s. \n\n  This glorified Nathan's is good. It would be a 3.5 star good if they offered the super cheeseburger. In conclusion, I might return here if I'm by the center Strip to snack on crinkley cut fries with a Pepsi to hold me over til dinner.
