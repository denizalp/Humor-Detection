I would give 4 stars if the service was better. We love to frequent locally owned restaurants that are not big chains.  The last 2 times we have been here, the service was very poor. It seems this restaurant under staffs. Different Servers, female last time, male the most recent experience. We enjoyed our food,  steaks seasoned well, shrimp fresh, vegetables cooked to our liking, the sauteed mushrooms, were not good & we all like mushrooms, don't know what they do to these but the flavor, in our opinion, was terrible. Our most recent visit,  our waiter, was flippant, over busy, not friendly, took a while for us to get noticed, the hostess was even unaware. Our Server picked up a plate, dropped a fork on the table and a red sauce splattered all over the table almost on one of the guests, he didn't apologize or come back to clean up the mess, we cleaned it up. When questions or concerns, they weren't addressed well - he simply had a bad attitude. The experience before this one was very slow service, forgetfulness, no attention to refills on coffee or tea, felt as though we were a left over table. We sat in the middle of the room and it was very loud, better off sitting against a wall or near the window or outdoors if the weather permits. Don't know that we will be back shouldn't have to feel like an unwanted guest when we are paying to have a good meal & would like to have good & friendly service.
