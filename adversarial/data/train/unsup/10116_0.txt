We were in Vegas for the World Series of Beerpong; and because my husband wanted to take me out on a date before we flew back to the real world; i got to pick a brunch place!\n\nI picked this..\n\nAnd mind you.. It did not disappoint.\n\nWe got here a little after 10am and we got there at a very good time. There weren't any lines yet.... (no f*cking joke; there were like 30 people in line after a good 30mins since we got there. and it was a Monday)....\n\nIncredible ambiance; Attentive servers and AMAZING Seafood bar.\n\nSince this was brunch; i started off with the breakfast items...\n\nIf you know me; you would know that i work out for Bacon. I am Bacon Girl and I had a Bacon themed party and i am not ashamed.\n\nAnyway; they have Turkey bacon (boring!) and Regular Bacon (perfectly cooked with all it's crispness and crunchiness but not overcooked) AND they actually have a Bacon Slab.\nA freaking BACON SLAB. and you know what? YOLO with a capital YO.\n\nI wasn't a fan of the sweet and sour chicken and waffle cone --because i like the southern version.. Fried chicken and waffles and syrup. PERIOD. no fancy schmancy sweet and sour yuck.\n\nThen i moved on to Steak and Eggs. AMAZING.\n\nThen i moved on to the Seafood bar and tasted the JUICIEST Crawfish EVER.\nYeah i've tasted crawfish from New Orleans.. and these were seriously at the same level. NO JOKE.\n\nChef's creations: were mussels and Raw Oysters. YUMMMMMM!!!!!\nAlso..Some Crab. Love!\n\nWith the breakfast and seafood bars; i thought i was already in heaven...\n\nBut come come... there was a LEFT TURN to another room with more FOOD!\n\nThere's a cheese station with crackers and bread... there's a mexican food station; there's a DIMSUM station. oh dear the Dimsum was exceptional for a buffet level.\nand there were some chinese dishes that I didn't even get to try anymore.\n\nand of course there was a dessert station (crepes and more) that I didn't even get to either because.\n\nFULL.\n\nA must try and you really get your money's worth. (especially with the expensive Seafood they have!!!)
