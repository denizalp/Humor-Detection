I came to a realization during my stay here this past weekend: The Cosmopolitan is the modern equivalent of the Hard Rock Hotel when it first opened in the 90's.  Back then, that was the IT hotel.  Everybody wanted to stay, party, and be seen there.  These days, it's the Cosmopolitan where the \"cooler than thou\" people are staying.  And if you think or ever thought Ed Hardy and True Religion are great fashions for men, this is the right place for you as well.  But for a more old school Vegas experience, which I prefer, look elsewhere.\n\nDuring this stay, I encountered a new and unwelcome charge: Gone is the free wifi previously offered.  Also, at some point during my last evening there, my toilet evidently backed up.  Fortunately, I was out, but it made for an unpleasant return to the room.  On the plus side, the room was free and I was only slightly bothered by the bass that could be heard from the club below.  And they gave me money to play here and food credits, which are always nice.  Finally, the person checking me in was very friendly and complimented me on my glasses.  (Yeah, I'm scraping the bottom of the barrel for good things to say.)\n\nI'd hoped my stay here would change my mind on my previous negative opinion.  I'm sorry to report that didn't happen.  This place won't even be the top choice if they offer me another free room, as, quite frankly, I have a few top tier hotels to choose from already.  When I checked in, I was told they were near full occupancy, which is great to hear.  Means they won't miss me.
