This is one of those local restaurants where you know you can bring out-of-towners to that is sure to impress!  The restaurant is built out of the owner Joe Johnston's 1960's childhood home (renovated of course!).  The bathrooms feature kitschy glass box displays of vintage Barbies and GI Joes.  It's a really cool space!  \n\nYou order at the register, are given a vibrating pager, and can choose to sit inside or outside under the trees overlooking the Agritopia urban farming fields.  The vibe is super relaxed, patio dog friendly, and most of the vegetables are freshly picked from the aforementioned Agritopia fields -- as fresh and local as produce could possibly get!  The place has even been featured on the Food Network.\n\nFood-wise, everything here is good.  Great pizzas (I love the veggie one), burgers, (once again, I'm a fan of the veggie burger), fries (regular, garlic, and sweet potato -- yum!), salads, strawberry lemonade, date shakes...the list goes on.\n\nSide Note: Come here on your birthday and get $10 towards your meal (you can also do this at Joe's other 2 local restaurants -- Liberty Market and Joe's Real BBQ if you're up for the challenge!).
