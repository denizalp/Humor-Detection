HANDS DOWN THE BEST LA QUINTA I HAVE EVER STAYED AT! Amazing hotel for the rate! Couldn't believe it! 1st class rooms. Top notch. Brand new facilities. and the staff! OMG so friendly and helpful. Don't think twice! Trust me! I will come back to this hotel EVERY TIME! The pool, hot tub, and facilities are TOP NOTCH. I don't know what else to say other than I feel I should have paid much much more for what I received! Pull the trigger! Reserve this hotel! It is SOOOOOOO worth it!  Use the money you save and have a great dinner on the strip. This is 1st class all the way. Why waste your money anywhere else?
