This is such an amazing restaurant!! The service is so wonderful. Everyone is so sweet and work very hard. Never had to wait for a refill on sodas or drinks! The food comes very quickly. The food is the most authentic Mexico City food we have had in az. The enchiladas and chile relleno are to die for!!!! Salsas are fantastic and I can't wait to try their margaritas, they just look so tasty.
