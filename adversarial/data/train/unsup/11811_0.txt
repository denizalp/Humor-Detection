I stopped in Bombay's yesterday around two for lunch. Who would expect to find a truly amazing Gyro at a place named Bombay's?  They serve Indian food, gyros, and burgers.  So it is definitely an odd mix-up, but I would try anything here.\n\nI ordered a gyro ($6.11 w tax), and the friendly guy behind the counter chatted with me throughout the assembly after seeing my student ID.  He asked me if I wanted Sriracha or pickled vegetables on the gyro. At first I was surprised, but how awesome is that?!?  I did opt for some Sriracha, which was genius. The lamb was fantastic and perfectly spiced and cooked. The best part was that he did not just glob on the tzatziki sauce, it was spread thin and even. Score. \n\nBetween the cheap as can be prices and awesome employee, I will be back.
