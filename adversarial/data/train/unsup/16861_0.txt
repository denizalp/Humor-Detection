Oh Anthro.  \n\nI hate your oh-so-awesome shabby-chic appeal: from adorable kitchen wares, to hand-knit bedding, to amazing dresses, to that addicting Voluspa collection, to gold jewelry accessories, to blouses I can't afford, to house-decor that's too cute to pass up.\n\nI hate you b\/c I wish I could have you replicated @ home.\n\nWOA:\n* This is a nice & large location of Anthro, on 2nd floor of Forum Shops.\n* Friendly service
