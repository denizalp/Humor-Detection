After running some errands my sister suggested we stop by here for dinner as she really likes their Oxtail Pho. \nWhile we were waiting for our food, she decided to give me a brief history about this place. Like another yelper mentioned, it used to be a dingy Vietnamese Karaoke Bar. \n\nI ordered the house special pho and my sister ordered the ox tail pho. Our order came out fairly quick and everything tasted great. The bean sprouts and greens were fresh as well. The taste was great and portions are decent but I feel its a bit pricey. There are countless Pho restaurants in Toronto and GTA that tastes just as great or even better.\n\nThis restaurant is out of the way for me and if I was in the area and craving pho or banh mi, I'll definitely stop by but otherwise, I wouldn't go out of the way to eat here.
