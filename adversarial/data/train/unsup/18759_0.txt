It was hard not to like this place even though the dining experience was a little weird. I couldn't tell if we were going to be served table side, or if we picked up our food at the counter... The whole experience was rather awkward. But our food was memorable and plentiful for lunch, with lower prices than i paid for any other lunch that week.
