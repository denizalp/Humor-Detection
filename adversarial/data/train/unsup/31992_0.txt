We stopped here on our way to a local soccer tournament. \nUpon entering we found the establishment to be appealing and welcoming.  \nThe smells of fresh bagels cooking and the smiling greeting waitresses was a pleasant way to start a morning breakfast. \nOur service was prompt and friendly.  \nWe ordered the lox plate, fruit parfait, pancakes with bacon a plain bagel, and another plain bagel with cream cheese.
