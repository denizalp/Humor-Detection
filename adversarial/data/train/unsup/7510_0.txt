This was this first time I had been to this Hot Sauce store. This store is small and is located in the Bazaar Shops at Bally's. \n\nI didn't buy anything as I was just \"window\" shopping, but will definitely will be back to try out some of their stuff. There was so many different kinds..from mild to stuff that looked like it would burn anyone's insides out!! Being a person that loves spicy stuff, I'll be buying stuff more on the hotter side. \n\nNo one greeted me or even said hello. Didn't look like they were very busy either. Just sitting at there. \n\nWill do an update review when I actually buy and deal with the staff.
