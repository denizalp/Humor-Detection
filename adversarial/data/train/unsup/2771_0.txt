Omgosh! This place is a big rip off!\nAll the perks... Aren't actually in place.\nThey charge amenity fee even though check in is 4pm. POOL CLOSES AT 5pm!!\nBy the time you get your belongings upstairs you're unable to utilize any amenities .\nThe slides and 2 of the pools are closed until May! But they don't tell you this when your making your  reservations. The BBQ food promised and burgers.... Not available!\nMany people are wandering around in circles complaining. The attorneys are going to have field day! Never staying here again.
