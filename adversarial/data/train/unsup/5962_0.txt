The husband and I went for our 11-year anniversary dinner.\n\nReservation was at 7:30 and we were seated right away in a cozy circular booth.  We had drinks and each ordered a salad to start (Fleming's salad and wedge salad).  Both were super tasty.  I got the petite filet mignon with the flavor sauce trio, and the husband had the regular filet.  They were both cooked exactly as requested (mine warm red center, his cremated).  We found them to be delicious.  The flavors were awesome - sweet onion bacon jam?  Are you kidding me!?  Yes.\n\nFor dessert we had the turtle pie, which was also awesome.  Seriously, no complaints at any point here.  Our server, Eric, was absolutely fantastic.  It was like we were his best friends, but that kind of friend that's only around when you need them and never hangs around too long.  \n\nWe had a $25 off coupon for booking the reservation online, plus a gift card my MIL gave us for our anniversary, but still spent over $100.  The place is pricey but I found the experience + food combo to be worth the indulgence.  We'll save this place for special occasions!\n\nI saw a table full of people come in about an hour into our experience with three kids under five.  Leave the f*ck trophies at home, please, Chuck-E-Cheese this is not.
