This is the Burger King that corporate forgot. The food is awful (which doesn't help because BK is generally nasty), service is slow, and the ice maker makes a weird slurping sound....like someones in there. This place has such a lousy reputation that the line around the half gas station McDonalds can be wrapped around twice and no one will wait at Burger King. King Nasty!
