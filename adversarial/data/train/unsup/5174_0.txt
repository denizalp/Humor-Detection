AWFUL. Brought my brand new maxima in to get an oil change. They ran my car through the \"complimentary\" car wash with the FLIPPIN WINDOWS DOWN. Absolutely refused to take responsibility. Said I brought in that way. These people are out of their GD minds. Now my car smells like mildew. Awesome.  Service person Leo is Horrendous A$$!! Service manager is a tool. Left 2 messages for the GM to call back over a week ago. Still no response. Please take your business anywhere else. Their only saving grace is their cashier anna. She should be running that place.
