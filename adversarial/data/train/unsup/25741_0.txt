Still being fairly new to the area we were not sure where to turn when we had a tire issue. Our son got a nail in his tire and needed a repair. We called and they told him to come on in and they would repair it at no charge. Once he got there it turned out that whoever had the car before him had a crappy patch job done and they were not able to fix it. The team at the tire shop went out of their way to help him get a new tire that he could afford. They even allowed him to come back and pay the next day which is unheard of anymore. Their prices and super competitive and their customer service was awesome. Happy to have found our go to tire place.
