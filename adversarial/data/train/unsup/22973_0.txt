Oh Fuel and Fuddle...  Why don't you have waffle fries anymore?  My Smashed Potato Pizza doesn't taste the same without the soft potato-ey goodness with the sharp creamy horseradish bite every now and then...\n\nNo longer shall I brave the harsh cold winter nights waiting half an hour just to get a table to ease some late night munchies.  No longer shall I deal with your loud atmosphere and mediocre service.\n\nOh Fuel and Fuddle, you broke my heart.  You have forced me to rebound with Mad Mex and Sharp Edge.  Farewell Fuel and Fuddle.....
