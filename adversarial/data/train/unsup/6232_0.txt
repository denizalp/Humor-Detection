2.5 star. Let's be honest, this place is really quite crap. \n\nI feel bad saying it because our server was incredible (GREAT service) and the interior is okay - decent decor.\n\nBut the food, ugh. The pizzas we had were so uninspired and bland, they tasted like something I bought in the freezer section of Rabba. I ordered a quattro staggioni - which is supposed to have a different ingredient in each quarter of the pizza (representing different seasons) but instead it was just four ingredients placed all over the entire thing. Sigh. And the crust was thick and hard like cardboard.\n\nMaybe their non-pizza items are better, but ugh!
