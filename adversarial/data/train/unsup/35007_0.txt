I know a girl that I attended UCLA with that moved out here to Vegas.  She's Chinese. I'm Chinese. My girlfriend is Chinese.  And so were some of my girlfriend's friends that happened to be in Vegas the same weekend we were in Vegas.  So like any good motley crew of Chinese people, we decided that we would go try some Chinese food in Vegas.  \n\nSam Woo is a great chain found around Southern California, so know the  food well.  However, instead of doing the traditional family style like good Chinese people would, we ordered individual plates of noodles and such.\n\nOne dish we got was zazang (black bean) noodles.  (See my previous review of Zazang Noodles in SF for a quick history of the noodle).  However, these people here serve zazang noodles HONG KONG style! WTF man!? Who DOES that??\n\nApparently the way to know if it's HK style is in the Chinese name.  HK people will call it Zazang Lo Mien, instead of the normal Zazang Mien.  Bunch of wierdos.  Girlfriend included, who is Cantonese and apparently likes the HK style. WTF woman?!  That's like blasphemy, since my familial roots (from my dad's side) is from San Tung, and we happen to be the ORIGINATORS of zazang noodles.  I never even knew that our very own Chinese brethren would bastardize my beloved noodles so much that I wouldn't even recognize them.  Even the Korean copycats actually copy the recipe pretty well.\n\nOther than that dish, the noodles were good.  And since the gf liked the HK interpretation of San Tung's great noodle dish, I won't dock stars for that.\n\nFour stars cuz the food is good.  But I'd also like to check out some of the other smaller restaurants in the plaza.
