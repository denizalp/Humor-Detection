I had a very great experience with my first tattoo with Josh as my tattoo artist. He really knows his colors and different shades to use on different skin tones. I gave him some some ideas in a brief sketch of what I wanted. He came up with an amazing design and concept that I'm still blown away by. This man really knows his craft. I'm so happy with my tattoo that I'm telling all my friends and family about him. I highly recommend Josh to anyone looking for a professional tattoo artist.
