Brief Intro:\n\nVaughan Mills is a Fashion Outlet with Dining and Entertainment.  It's a tourist attraction much like Eaton's Centre therefore popular during those Statutory Holidays.  It is near identical to Arundel Mills of Hanover, MD nearby Baltimore in terms of design but not Shops and Restaurants.\n\nThis is my LOCAL mall and my personal mall of choice.  Top ranks for the \"The Guys Survival Guide to Malls\" as you will notice that it's fun for the whole family which includes YOU(The Guys) if you ever found interest in reading a Mall review.  Bowling & Drinks at Lucky Strikes? Go-kart at Nascar SpeedPark? Bass Pro Outdoor World? Pro Hockey Life? Safari Pet Center?\n\nSeating Comfort Level:(*****)\n\nIf by chance you're not at one of the places above or the CENTRALLY located Roadside Picnic themed Food Court(Entry 5), then grab a seat along the corridor where every \"Neighbourhood\" has it's unique seating feature some comfortable while others whimsical.  Take a Massage Sofa nearby the Food Court which if you desire can pay some coin to get it operational.  The BEST option however is nearby the Nascar Speed Park (Entry 4) where you will notice the Lounge Seats that direct you to the 360 degree LCDs tuned to the local Sports Channels.\n\nSafety Zone:(*****)\n\nRoadside Picnic Food Court is your safest BET not only because it is right in the middle of all the action but it is where all people will congregate.  It is surrounded by everything food & beverage, such as Starbucks, Ben & Jerry's, Rocky Mountain Chocolate, Villa Madina, Taco Bell, Sukiyaki, Grill It Up, NY Fries, New Wok New Wok, etc...\n\nYou're SAFE anywhere man! It's an Outlet Mall and the ratio of guys stuff to girls stuff is evenly matched.  If anything, the ladies have to watch out for their men spending too much time and money here while the ladies wait on the side.\n\nExit Strategy:(*****)\n\nWhat Exit Strategy?  Why do you want to leave this place if you ever had to be dragged to a mall, this is THE mall to be dragged to against your will.  Still, the place to stage your exit is once again the Food Court where you can mingle with the patrons while grabbing a bit to eat and then decide if you want to leave on the North(Entry 2), South(Entry 5) or walk about the big LOOP that is this mall.  Most larger shops have a 2 sided entrance\/exit which doubles your chances of escape.\n\nEntertainment Level:(****-)\n\nGo-Kart, Bowling, Fishing\/Camp Shopping, Sports on Display, News on LCD at Food Court, Tons of structural design elements at every Neighbourhood.  You won't even miss your Iphone3 or 4 or whatever they have out now.  If that doesn't get you, just watch some KIDS jump and climb on one of the many statues\/structures at your nearby exit.
