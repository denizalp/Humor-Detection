Terrible today compared to usual. Ran out of everything around lunch and started making our food. No veggies and so the line was held up. Then when they brought them out they weren't cooked and slapped together our food. Was the first time there for my friend and was disappointing for her. Not even a friendly smile in the bunch while serving. Sorely disappointed today. Even my burrito wasn't put together properly and fell apart.
