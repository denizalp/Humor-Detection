Came here for lunch with huge regrets.  Not only was the menu lacking decent lunch options, the price tag was steep.  Very steep.  I could eat similar items at mom and pop shops for half the price.  8 steamed pork buns was $15.99.  They were small and the taste didn't blow me away.  It doesn't taste bad, but at $2 a bao, I expect more.  The smoked pork platter was decent though, but the price tag was $15.99 as well which I find steep, but not as steep as the baos.  The hot and sour soup lacked the \"hot\".  Black pepper taste overpowered the soup with a hint of sour. I didn't like how they added pork blood jello in the soup....meh.  If you're eating here, you're literally paying more for the decor, high quality tea and service.  I rather pay less for better tasting food at half the price.
