Three words: unbelievable customer service.\n\nThat is all I have to say....\n\nA few months ago I had an unfortunate experience at this salon and left a negative review about it saying that I would never be back. However, Andrea, the creative director, recently reached out to me and wanted to meet in person to discuss what went wrong. After speaking with her and Damon, they insisted I come in for a correction and although I insisted to pay for it, they insisted even harder that I consider it a credit for my previous experience.\n\nI met again with them today and had one of the most excellent experiences I have ever had at a salon - so much so that I am convinced my previous negative experience with someone else at the salon was likely a one time thing. Andrea and Damon were extremely gracious, kind, and patient despite this being something free of charge. Once done, I was super happy with my haircut and great color adjustment. I tried again to pay for the service but was repeatedly told that it was not an option. On top of this, they wouldn't even let me pay for the shampoo I wanted to buy! \n\nI've never met people more keen on providing excellent customer service and have to say with confidence that I will 100% be back. I realize that my previous review was not accurate of the salon and therefore felt a deep need to take it down.\n\nThanks Andrea and Damon! You're amazing!\n\nPs. Please know that my positive review was neither because of the fact that I didn't pay for the service, nor was I asked to remove\/change my review. This is 100% unbiased and based on hard and simple facts.
