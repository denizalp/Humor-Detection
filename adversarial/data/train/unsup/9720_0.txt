Got here early but the lines were obscene. After waiting more than an hour (meanwhile getting trampled by frightened pre-teens) to get to a sign that read the line was still 45 minutes from that point, I spoke to a staff member to get a refund. After 20 minutes of waiting to speak to a manager, manager Jeff Pippin offered no refund or empathy. Biggest waste of $40. Would've rather tried my luck in Circus Circus. If you love waiting in line, this is your place.
