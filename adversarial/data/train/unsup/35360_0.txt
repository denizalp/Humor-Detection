Hands down the best radio station in the city. This station plays a little bit of everything, and I really mean EVERYTHING. Indie Rock, Delta Blues, Modern Rock, College Rock, older hip-hop, funk, the list can go on and on. In addition to music WYEP also has great additional programing, my favorite being This American Life.\n\nThere are lots of different DJ's and each seem to play the sort of music they personally enjoy. My favorite had to be Bumble Bee Slim (seriously what a great name) who used to spin blues every Saturday night. I think he retired last year, but he had that quintessential DJ voice.\n\nI definitely like some of the DJ's better than others, mostly because of personal music preferences, but  have noticed that everyone who works at YEP is extremely passionate about music and aren't afraid to play something other radio stations won't.\n\nFinally, the greatest thing about WYEP is no commercials!
