Came here to watch the game, have some beers and apps. Had pizza, fries and the ghost pepper wings. If you like spicy then the ghost wings were amazing! I would order that again but be prepared, it's spicy! The pizza was good as well but the fries was nothing special. I was surprised at how pricey the beers were and therefore gave it three stars instead of four.
