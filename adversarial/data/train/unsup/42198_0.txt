It was my first visit and I had high hopes.  It certainly looks the part of a sophisticated, uptown restaurant, but that may have been the highlight.  I started with the Tomato Bisque and it was quite good, but for my entree I got the Mahi with a Miso-Pineapple glaze and it was just completely deviod of taste.  Disappointing.  On the side I had spinach sauted with garlic, golden raisins, and pine nuts.  This was pretty good.  My wife had the NY Strip and said it was tough and slightly overcooked (she ordered it rare).  I tried her mashed potatoes and they had no flavor.  I finished with a pear-almond tart with ice cream which I really enjoyed although the portion was on the very small side, especially in these days of overly-huge desserts.\n\nAlmost every woman there was wearing their coat as they ate.  It was really cold in the restaurant, and I am never cold.\n\nThe bottom line is it was an okay dining experience, but not for the money.  There are too many other choices.
