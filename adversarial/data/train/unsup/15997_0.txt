Within the patio, faces rise, glowing otherworldly against twisting columns of trash-fueled flame. Their eyes are watery kaleidoscopes from their many draughts of rich black rum and all their delicate pilsners. They're busy cackling at acerbic remarks, and breathing smoke from the curling lettuce boxes, divorced from technology, from the city's diurnal drudgery. The wooden walls are slatted and curve up to the low, low ceiling--giving one the impression of traveling down via oaken cask into eternal perdition. Welcome, dear reader, to McNamara's, an off-the-grid dive where one can perch and grin out back like a figure out of Dante (or a conjurer's fable by way of Charles Burns), and\/or bask inside while the bartender, sage-like and striking, administers shots of Buillet for a mere $4.00. The regulars run the gamut from affable oddball attorneys to ancient vodka-mute ruffians raising fists in protest against crude shadow-things the rest of us won't have the pleasure of seeing for decades. There's always a chance you'll find yourself on the edge of a mystery here, pulling at the curtain's hem, or else fumbling toward the abyss on fumes. So it goes in this mini carnivalesque utopia. Take a look inside. I dare you.
