I come here because of its location, sandwiched between Bier Markt and The Old Spaghetti Factory.  Bier Markt is often times my first choice, then I might decide to have a few beers at Scotland Yard first.  Just like other reviewers, this place is a standard pub.  Good service from what I remember.  And I watched the superbowl here a few years ago when NYG pulled off the upset over NE, and it was good times.  Neverly overly crowded.\n\nOh, and one other warning.  I went to use the washroom, which is shared with The Old Spaghetti Factory, and it took me 20 minutes to get back to my table as I got lost!  I had a few beers in me, and I guess I headed in the wrong direction when I left the washroom.  Embarrassing stupid mistake, but can happen to you!  I ended up going outside and reentering Scotland Yard to get back to my seat lol.  \n\nDerek
