Very loud and crowded atmosphere. Tables are almost stacked on top of each other. Very over priced for so-so Mexican food(Tacos\/Enchiladas\/Taquitos.....). Portion sizes are very small. 14.00 drinks. The service was also terrible. There are many other options in Vegas. I would not recommend this establishment. The best part of the experience was the Management!
