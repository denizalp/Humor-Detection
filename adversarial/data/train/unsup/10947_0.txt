Honestly, folks, I rather like Saga. Yes, last weekend consisted of back-to-back Asian dine-out dinners, and just like my experience in Robinson, I found that this Saga satellite is also worthy of patronage.\n\nAfter FINALLY seeing \"The Dark Knight Rises,\" Kay and I stopped in and had a meal that was stone-solid and done with a flair for the dramatic. \n\nNo, we stayed away from the teppenyaki business since we just wanted some quiet. \n\nIt's strange how I sometimes \"complain\" that sushi usually tastes about the same whenever and wherever I have it, but it's really the best kind of \"same\" you can get. The Osaka rolls were filled with tuna, avocado, and I forget what else (these aren't on the online menu), and had crispy roe atop them. A mayonnaise-based sauce was smeared all over the plate, and I eagerly dragged each meaty, sweet seafood medallion through it, treating each piece like a pastry or piece of protein candy, relishing their oceanic flavors and juxtaposed textures, both soft and crunchy colliding in my mouth. \n\nSliced and cooked with amazing precision, the Steak Teriyaki was a gorgeous, glorious medium rare and was served with exquisitely presented fruits and vegetables, including ornately cut oranges. \n\nThe atmosphere was as \"nightclubby\" as expected, but being that this was a late Sunday afternoon, there were more families about, and at least one birthday bash was in full effect.  The service was adequate albeit somewhat cold and aloof for most of our meal, our server loosening up a bit by meal's end. \n\nNo one can stop them now, Saga's on the loose.\n\nAnd if you \"got\" the above reference, you are a fan of Canadian AOR and prog-rock and have my deepest sympathies for the current cultural landscape is hostile towards thee.\n\nHey, I almost ordered a Green River roll, one that would have required a more critically-correct link...\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=GuK9hBGGyDg&feature=related
