Higly disappointed!!!  I recently ordered a cake for my nieces birthday and although they did a great job in matching the cake decoration with the party theme, they failed in the freshness of the cake. I ordered a Dominican Cake and what we got was a stale pound cake.  I went to the store with the entire cake in the box with the intent to diplomatically resolve this issue and received nothing back but complete disservice, THE OWNER litterly kicked me out of the store, threw the cake out front and locked the door!!!  I didn't deserve that kind of treatment and don't think anyone that politely walked in there to resolve an issue should.  There was no apology, refund, discount..NOTHING!!  If you're in the service industry, then you should know how to provide customer service.  I am Dominican, my uncle is a bakery owner AND I KNOW WHAT A DOMINICAN CAKE IS.  It is the same here in the US as in the Dominican Republic.  Don't tell me that what I ordered was their version of a Dominican cake...if that's the case then rename it  to something else.  DON'T ORDER ANYTHING FROM THESE PEOPLE.   I DON'T RECOMMEND.
