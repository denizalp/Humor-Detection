Normally I don't like the restaurant that serve a combination of food from different countries. I came to this place looking for Nicaraguan food. Even though the personal were not Nicaraguan, the food was definitely Nicaraguan. The only think I didn't like were the beans. Back home we use the small red beans, that it is called Frijol de seda. Here they use what  most of the places use, big red beans. Not the same flavor but it was ok. The place doesn't have a good presentation. More ghetto style. They don't keep it up but that is ok. I came in for the food. The girl at the counter I believe she was from Colombia and the waitress Mexican which gave me a second thought. Nevertheless, food was good. They give you a good portion. Next time I may try something else.
