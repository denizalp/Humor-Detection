Great place to come for good, cheap food but because of recent service experiences I'm sad to have to downgrade them because it's no longer of 4 star quality overall when you factor in their terrible customer service. If you want take out be sure to call your order in before showing up to avoid being questioned why you didn't call in advance. And when dining in, don't ask for split checks because this just pisses off the lady too and she'll likely tell you off like she did to us. Prices also have gone up in the last few months because they now charge sales tax, whereas before it was always included in the price.\n\nI usually get the same few things when coming here: hoi nam chicken w\/ seasoned rice, fried chicken or the chicken wings. I've been avoiding the fried items lately because I'm always told that it takes an extra 20-30 min...is it never prepped in advance? Very odd. The only thing I would NOT recommend getting is the beef ramen because this is a Chinese place and they don't make it right. I think they're only offering it to compete with Monta next door and it's definitely not worth getting despite the cheap $5.95 price tag.\n\nPeople think this place is fast but it's really not. I'm always waiting a while for my food whether I'm dining in or taking out. There is usually only 1 server and a couple of kitchen staff which is likely why...Not sure why the people working here are always so grouchy...especially the lady that serves the food!
