We love this place, it's sure thing, the food and service are great.  The wings are delicious, messy.. but they serve them with wet napkins to clean up after.   My boyfriend always gets the pizza, he thinks its one of the best in Arcadia, and I have to agree.    \n\nI also LOVE the Caesar salad here, it's one of my favorite Caesars and I eat a lot of them.  I highly recommend the artichoke as well, french fries, and I'll stop there....  I've never had a bad meal here, this spot is in regular rotation for us, you won't be disappointed.
