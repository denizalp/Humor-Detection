I came into this location as soon as it opened, Upon arrival I was immediately greeted and pointed towards a table. After choosing a seat my server offered me a drink and took my order. Everything was good and the food is great. I just received a lot of dirty looks from a few people which made me feel awkward 1 of which was a server who was wearing a pink shirt and a pink hat. Other than that I'd say this visit was very pleasant for me and I'd return on my own time for sure.
