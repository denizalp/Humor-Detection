I came here looking for bachelorette party supplies. They have a decent-sized aisle dedicated to it, next to the wedding supplies. Their selection is more x-rated than Party City because their selection actually contains items with male parts on them. On the contrary, a bachelorette party kit at Party City was $20 and the same product at Party USA was $30. That is only one comparison. I thought Party USA had funner stuff than Party City though.\n\nThe store is large! They have A LOT of stuff --- costumes (around Halloween, but don't know if it's year-round), chafing fuel, party favors, etc. Customer service was friendly and happy when I entered.
