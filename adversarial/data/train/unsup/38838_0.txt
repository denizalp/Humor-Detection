Horrible customer service\n\nDon't you hate when someone is quick to take your money but slow and rude when delivering their product\/service?\n\n If I pay for a dress in full the day I order it, I don't think it's too much to ask that it be delivered on time. Am I crazy? I also do not expect to be yelled at or ignored ...  I've worked in the retail business and from my experience places like this don't stay around long. \n\n\n Brides- save yourself the headache and find a competent wedding retailer.
