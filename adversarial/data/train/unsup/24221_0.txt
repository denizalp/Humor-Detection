The security guards at Brooklyn Bowl are ridiculous.\n\nFirst off, they don't even start their shows on time so you're waiting in line for hours outside. If you go to the bathroom or go out of line in general, you will lose your place in line, even if you're with friends who hold your place.\n\nI've been to a few shows & there are always lines outside when the show already started. It's like they're never organized.\n\nI'd think twice before going to this venue for a concert.
