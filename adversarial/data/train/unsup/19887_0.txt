Very disappointed. Landscape crew showed up to my house unannounced and without appointment at 0615am expecting me to be available and flexible on the spot. Trees and shrubs planted with new drip system installed. I specifically asked to be shown how to run the new drip system meter and Jeff's response \"don't worry the plants will be getting plenty of water and I'll come by at the end of the week.\" 5 days later meter was never set, nobody stopped by and 2 plants died. I had to follow up in person at the nursery to state my concerns. The 2 dead plants will be replaced but no apology and response to me \"don't worry the plants don't have feelings.\" I paid a lot of money for this project and am very upset in the way things were handled.
