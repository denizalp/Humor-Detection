I honestly would LIKE to review this place, but the owners seem to be determined to make it as difficult as possible.\n\nI've gone there several times on saturdays in the mornings, or at the end of their posted hours, only to find it shut down with no indication they were open, no note if there's a reason like illness, or whatever.  \n\nWhat especially annoys me is that at the end of a deal coupon period, I looks like  that they deliberately closed for the entire WEEK before the deadline (as I was one of those that week that found out it was closed from others who had been trying to redeem it) and thus cheating a lot of people from trying out their wares.  If the goal was to really piss off a lot of people, congrats to the owners, you managed it quite successfully.\n\nI give up really.  I love supporting local businesses and always looking for a new place to try out, but I've driven all the way down to Braeside 4 times (once during the coupon thing, 3 times out of genuine curiosity based on local word from the people who did manage to find them that the food was good).  But with mercurial random opening times, no phone and so on, it's no longer worth my time and effort to even try now.  If you ever want me to try to review it, FOLLOW YOUR OWN OPENING HOURS for heavens sake.
