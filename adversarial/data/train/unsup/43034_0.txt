My five stars are because the instructor here, Nat Moore, has developed an awesome cardio\/muscle program called Katacize that delivers what we were looking for. He also does a mind and body class, Kataflex, that improves flexibility and balance. The ladies at the desk, Dolly and Kristy, are cheerful and welcoming. When my schedule allows, I also like the gravity class. I wish the Peoria location had gravity. All in all, very satisfied with the Surprise location. We live closer to the Peoria one but my husband and I have been attending Nat's class for two years and it really is an awesome workout and he gives a lot of personal attention.
