Being a fan of Giada's cooking shows on the Food Network, when I knew I was coming to Vegas I immediately booked a dinner reservation at her restaurant at the boutique hotel Crownwell about a month in advance.\n\nWe went there on the Halloween night and it was surprisingly quiet that night. My girlfriend and I were probably the most dressed up there and the patrons were definitely not the 20 to early 30 something partying crowds.  After looking at the prices on the menu I understood why, but what do you expect from a more refined, celebrity chef restaurant at a hotel in Vegas?\n\nI enjoy Giada's style of cooking; Italian with her southern California twist; elegant, rich, flavorful yet not too heavy. The small bites (appetizers) menu is extensive: you might get full and not need the main course if you pick a few dishes. We only had the chicken marsala meatballs and roasted eggplant parmigiana with smoked scamorza cheese; both of which \nwere delicious. The eggplant dish tasted like a vegetarian lasagna dish.\n\nWe also had the scallop and crab risotto dish and the lobster ravioli, both were delicious but the portions were very small. \n\nI wish I was hungry enough to try some of their meat or fish dishes, which by the way were a little pricey. \n\nFor dessert we only had room for a tiny cake, which was a special for that night and I can't remember the exact name but it contained some nuts like almond or hazelnut. It was good but a little too sweet to my taste. Maybe we should have tried their chocolate tiramisu instead?\n\nThe service was very good and prompt. The ambiance was modern and nice. Good place for a nice or romantic dinner night if you don't mind shelling out a little more from your wallet and not looking for cheap eats.
