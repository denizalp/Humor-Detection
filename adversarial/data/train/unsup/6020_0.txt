I know that I shouldn't review a hair salon until I've been twice, or at least until I've had time to let my new 'do sink in.... but I'm just so super excited about this salon!! I'm giving it a conservative 4 stars (b\/c of the aforementioned reasons.)  \n\nIn a bit of synchronicity, I met Hillary of the eponymous salon at Bar & Bistro just as my old stylist was preparing to leave town.  So, after tracking down the salon based on a few hazy memories, I made an appointment, and she was able to fit me on the schedule the same week that I called.  Yay! \n\nThis is a single-chair salon, so when you make an appointment, you will get Hillary, and you will be the only client there. (Yay!)\n\nI arrived a few minutes late because I am directionally challenged, even though the salon is literally but a few meters from 3 other businesses at the Arts Factory that I patronize regularly. (It is upstairs, use the set of stairs closest to the bathrooms.)  \n\nLet's cut to the chase: you can drink while you get your hair did.  Hil's business manager escorted me to the bar, and got me set up with my first of two sangrias (I went on Thurs, when B&B has 1\/2 price happy hour, score!). By the time we returned, she ushered me in to the adorably appointed salon to begin my hair transformation.  I usually like to let a stylist make suggestions and do what they will with my hair (color and cut), and she did a great job.  \n\nShe's super fun and friendly, which is important, since my giant mop of hair takes about 3 hours to do.  She also uses cruelty free (not tested on animals) hair products, which makes my vegan heart happy.  The service was very reasonably priced.  \n\nSummary: personal attention, good hair, fun, moderately priced, booze.
