I remember going to a wax museum when I was a kid and being enthralled by COOL and REALISTIC everyone was....Elvis is just as I remember. Come to think of it, Michael Jackson kinda looks the same. Creepy. I wanted to go up to the model and poke a hole in the nose with my pen, to make it look more realistic. It just doesn't hold the same appeal any more, I'm not going to lie. Maybe it's the Damn I'm Getting Old? The \"I can Photoshop my own celeb photos\" factor? \n\nIt was fun because I had family members with me, and they got their money's worth filling up their camera memory. The whole time I was here I was envisioning mass melting. I'm sorry, Madame, but I'd rather go to Ripley's to see the torture implements. No offense, you do make very sexy paraffin paraphernalia but it's just not my ball of wax. *groans from fake studio audience
