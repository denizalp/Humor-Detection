Ate here this fall when I was visiting the area. Of course I came because of the show, but I wanted to try things for myself. Smaller menu than what was in the show and only Amy working the kitchen this change must have been the right move for them because everything I ate, including the desert was phenomenal. I went back multiple times in the week and a half I was in Scottsdale. Also, Amy and Samy are two of the nicest people I have ever met. What most people do not understand is that they were approached by the kitchen nightmare casting group multiple times. They did not call the show for help. I can understand why Amy was defensive in the TV show; yes, her and her husband are eccentric, but they are passionate and Amy has a true talent. I encourage everybody to try the place for themselves before passing judgment.
