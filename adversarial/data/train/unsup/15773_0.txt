Do not go here. You've been warned. Dr. Langdon doesn't even know how to use the machines in HER OWN practice. I asked to hear the heartbeat of my baby that she was seeing on the US screen, but she \"doesn't know how to do that.\" WTF And then she tells me I will need Rogam because I'm A negative blood type. No lady, I'm A+, I've had a baby before, I know my body. How do you get someone's blood type wrong!? (Side note: I paid the \"convenience\" fee and had my blood drawn there. BAD IDEA.)\nDr. Langdon is exceptionally short with patients, I've never had an OB come and go so quickly. There are even signs in the rooms telling you not to ask questions, those should be saved for the \"consultation area\" after your visit. Every single wall in the office, bathrooms, and clinic rooms is covered with advertisements for \"rejuvenating\" procedures for your cellulite, wrinkles, and frown lines. Way to make a pregnant gal feel real awesome about herself. Seriously, I dread going to this place for my prenatal care, I won't be letting her come anywhere near me or my baby for the birth. Just waiting for a referral to the perinatologist and will have them tend to the rest of my prenatal\/birthing needs.
