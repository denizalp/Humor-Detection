My friend and I both ordered a wrap, me, the south of the border, her the LA wrap. We both took a bite and looked at each other like, what the heck. It was the most flavorless, disgusting thing ever. It was basically like eating a head of iceberg lettuce, and plain chicken. \n\nI tried a second bite, but couldn't do it. I ended up eating sweet potato fries.  You would think the waitress would say something seeing that I left an entire wrap untouched, but I'm assuming she knew how horrible it was.
