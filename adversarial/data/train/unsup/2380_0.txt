Have lived here for 2 years. Would not have moved in if new owners had been owners when I moved in. Attitude of staff deteriorated markedly.\nFor example, I reproted tampering with my front door lock. I waited one week after placing a work order in the office door mail box. Had to call again to get response.\nRecent change in ownership results in standard 3R procedure.\n1. Run current renters out\n2. Refurbish Apartments\n3. Raise the rents.\n\n5.26.2015\nRegrettably this update is not yet the positive update I hope to include.\nCAM (Corp. Managemt) does not respond to either voice messages or emails.\nLeft \"Field Supervisor\" a voice message on 5.6.2015 - no response.\nSent same \"Field Supervisor\" email on 5.8.2015 - no response.\n\nWould like to provide positive review at a later date.\n\n6.18.2015\n\nIf you decide to give this property your $, be certain no remodeling is being done in the adjacent apartments. Have just endured a night-long headach from paint fumes from next door, Called the repair line to ask them to have the on-site \"maintenance man\" open the windows of the painted apartment to improve ventilation away from my apartment. No response. Maintenance man lives a few hundred feet from the painted apartment and receives calls for emergencies. Response is apparently discretionary.\n\n6.28.2015\nWould like to post a \"pool pic.\" is there any way to include pictures in review?\n\n11.17.2015\n\nUpdate from Dog Town: \n\nHave had to consider (twice) the possibility that barking dogs were going to bite my feet. 1 was on a leash & 1 was loose. Not chiwawa (sp) & not Great Danes. Dogs are numerous here and I no longer cut across the lawn on the way to my apartment.\n\nHave also had non-office items taped to my front door. I attribute these events to the type of people management choses to rent to.\n\nNext update may be from my new residence.\n\n2.5.2016\nReview being written from new residence.\n\nOn 12.29.2015 Manager (Marsha D.) did final view of apartment and said no problem; will receive full refund of move in deposit.\n\nHave not received refund yet.\n\nReally regret complex \"went to the dogs\" which owners did not have social intelligence enough to train dogs for apartment living in a complex. Sad for the dogs who have owners who do not spend time with them.\n\nReview date 3.5.2016 Have not received refund of move in deposit yet. Wonder what would have happened if I had been (never was though) 2 months late on my rent. Maybe I should do what CAM management would do with such a late payer. Legally, of course.\n\n4.9.2016 Called CAM Property Management to inquire about my refund. Learned their staff person had created a forwarding address that could not be delivered to (wrote #14 instead of Ste. H) and check had been returned. New check ordered. Last problem resolved.
