These shops are amazing! If you don't give this place a five star review, I'd like to see what you'd consider five star shopping! Seriously, this place is cool. \nIt's such a luxurious experience, all in the Ancient Roman style- with faux marble columns, statues of Roman and Greek gods, ceilings that look like the sky, different shops made to look like temples, fountains and statues! \nIn one of the main rotundas, there was a fountain full of statues that came to life in an animatronic fashion, and told the story of a king whose feuding daughter and son threatened each other over their being heirs to the throne. Water and fire exploded from the fountain as they garbled their way through their mumbly speech. \nThis is the only place that I've seen curved escalators! They curve around a giant statue of Pan (I think). \nThere were plenty of restrooms, and a wide variety of shops to choose from. I really appreciated how they blast the air conditioning here, which is a welcome respite from the Vegas heat. \nMost of the shops are a bit on the expensive side, with mainly high end merchandise, but that's to be expected on the Vegas Strip.
