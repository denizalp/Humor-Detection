I love this little neighborhood cafe\/wine bar.  Great HH for wine & beer although the selection is limited.  What they do carry is delicious.  The menu is small, but fresh, tasty and very reasonably priced. The bruschetta might be the best in town (sorry Postino's). The dingy strip mall surrounding the restaurant is a real eyesore, but they do an admirable job of creating your own little oasis in the cement.  They are pet friendly which makes it great for a Sunday morning bike ride with the pooch (the bloody Mary will knock you off your seat).  Be prepared to sweat. It is REALLY warm inside during the summer months.  The patio is cozy, covered & there is a mist system, but being surrounded by a huge mass of concrete diminishes the cooling effects.  Although the interior is cramped, everyone is friendly and the barkeep will remember your favorite drink and dish and the owners are often your neighbor on the bar stools. There are very few neighborhood watering holes or coffee shops around here and I am so happy for this spot. I would recommend it to anyone!
