Ruse has the best vegan gyro in town, hands town. I start salivating just thinking about this plant-based lamb gyro ($7). Ruse Vegan Kitchen has limited operating hours which you can keep up with by following them on Facebook or Instagram. They're at the Las Vegas Farmer's Market every Wednesday from 2-8pm and at Lovelady Brewing in Henderson on Sundays. So far, I've visited Ruse back to back on Wednesdays. \n\nThere's about 4 options on the menu, to include tofu tacos, a falafel burger, and a chimichurri special. I would like to try all the menu options, but it's so hard to stray from the gyro when it's so damn good. Make sure to get the gyro spicy, by the way. It's actually very mild in heat. \n\nGood to know: As of now, Ruse does not sell beverages or sides.\n\nYELP'S 2018 REVIEW CHALLENGE: #20
