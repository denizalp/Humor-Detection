The management here is hideous, they don't care for their customers and will fight you over returns or exchanges.  The company advertises their return policy as hassle free but oh boy does this store go against everything they advertise.  I bought a pair of uniform pants for my daughter about a month ago and noticed they were wearing down at the bottom rather fast, I went to the store to exchange them because I don't believe they should wear out as fast and the cashier and manager questioned me as to why I bought those pants and why was I exchanging them instead of taking the $2.95 they offered to give me instead.  I paid $14.99 for them, and they offered me $2.95?!  Their reason, because they were worn, but that is not part of the store policy.  If I knew that they would not stand by their policy and satisfaction guarantee then I would go to Walmart.  The manager argued until I said, forget it. I won't shop here EVER.  You can be happy to have won the $2.95 girl uniform pants battle, but you lost the hundreds of dollars I spend on clothing here.  The manager actually told me, \"well,if your daughter wears these pants every day it's not our fault\". Wow!  I will post pictures of my daughters uniform closet so that this manager can see his insult was unwarranted.  THANK YOU JcPenney!  Thank you for your managers insults!
