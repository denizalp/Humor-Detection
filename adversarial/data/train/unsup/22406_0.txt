Ordered two pizzas well done, two large diet cokes, and garlic bread. One cheese pizza, one pepperoni and sausage. \n\nThe pizzas looked and smelled like heaven. When we ate them, they were soggy with sauce and so salty that they could have been used to preserve a mummy.\n\nThe garlic bread looked ok, but it was chewy and obviously microwaved instead of baked.\n\nThe two diet cokes were spot on and the only items fit for human consumption in the order.\n\nDO NOT ORDER THE PIZZA OR GARLIC BREAD!! Unless you are a mummy who recently went swimming and need the salt. I for one will not return.
