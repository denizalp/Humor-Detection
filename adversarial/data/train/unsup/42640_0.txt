Living in Charleston for the time being means I have to look else where when it comes to finding a new pair of CL's. I was a bit nervous due to the fixed reviews however could not be happier with the way the entire transaction went. I called to see if they had my style and size in stock and received nothing but amazing customer service the entire time! Three days later my new shoes made it and in the wraps g and the attention to details were incredible. Nice to know I still have a way of getting my signature shoe until I move to a closer Location. \n\nDefinitely will be ordering more shoes before we move!
