This place has great ambience ... however the food could be better. The fried calamari, shrimp and smelt was good and I would recommend that. But the mains were not as I was expecting.  The portions for the mains were small. Not that I'm a big eater ... but larger portion woukd be good. Over all though... it was an ok experience.
