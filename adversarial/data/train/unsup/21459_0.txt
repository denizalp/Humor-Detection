Ok, so you know how family is important to me? Well, if you didn't you do now. We, my niece and I, spent six days total at the Wynn. It was her birthday. We requested (from the concierge) a great table with a view. My partner flew in for the occasion. We were told 9:30 was a good time. We knew to schedule and plan. We showed up at 9:30 ready to go. We were told to wait for a table.  45 minutes later we were ushered to the very back near the kitchen. Do you eat at 10:30? I don't. What would you do? What could I do? How about just be humiliated? Talked to the hotel manager. He said he'd look into it.  Wow,  hotel manager offers Allegro as a compromise. Really?  A walk in bar off the gaming tables at 10:30 at night.  Thanks Steve Wynn, great staff, great experience.
