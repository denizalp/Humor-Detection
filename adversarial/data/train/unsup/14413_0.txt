Ok, if you have no other options. \n\nI work graveyard, and this is one of the only places that delivers near me overnight.  Their pizza is ok, NY style.  But, aside from their pizza, I'd advise to stay away.  I don't think there's a single fresh ingredient anywhere to be found. That includes their meat\/chicken.   It's not too hard to throw a chicken breast on a flat grill, but this place insists on using pre-cooked chicken on it's items.. And you can really tell.   All of their appetizers are frozen, and fried.\n\nIf this is your last ditch resort, then go ahead.. But if you have other options, exercise them!
