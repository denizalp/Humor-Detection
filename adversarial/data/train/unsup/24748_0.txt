Since we had time before our flight departure, we thought we would fit in a sushi dinner instead of the usual airport offerings. We are always on the lookout for quality neighborhood restaurants. \n\nWe were incredibly disappointed by this place! We mistook the name change to be a new restaurant, but the quality was so poor. Such a sad representation of sushi. The sizing of the fish was so small, but since the quality seemed poor, I'm not sure I would have wanted to eat a generous piece. \n\nNeedless to say, we left for our flight worrying if we would get food poisoning. Luckily nothing happened, but that's not a concern I ever want to have with a restaurant.
