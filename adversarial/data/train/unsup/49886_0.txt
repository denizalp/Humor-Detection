This Chili's understands that people are in a rush, but want to eat something better than an overpriced premade turkey sandwich. They are quick, friendly and the food is the same quality you would get at any other Chili's. If I'm not in a full out sprint for my connecting flight, I'm stopping here when I'm in Charlotte.
