One of my favorite hotels on the strip. I like the venice theme. The food here is fantastic. The Grand Lux is basically a cheesecake factory ( i think they're related`). Rooms are always clean and comfy. I did venture downtown to check out a new show at the Plaza hotel called LIMELIGHT! loved it. Its what vegas shows are supposed to be like. In a city filled with cirque shows everywhere its nice to see high energy sexy dancing with real singers and comedy elements. Its only there for 2 months before they move on. Definitely check it out if you get a chance.
