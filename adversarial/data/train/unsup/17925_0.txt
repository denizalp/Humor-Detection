Humble Pie- Humble is right.  It was not all that I had hoped for... First of all the server took and quite a while to come over initially and was pretty scarce for the rest of the night. Second of all he forgot my glass of wine- which wouldn't be such a horrible faux pas except that when I gently asked if I could get my glass of wine I got a snide and curt \"yes\"- I just had to hope that he remembered what I had ordered. Fortunately he did and brought it without so much as a word about forgetting it. It just kinda put me off. The food was decent- nothing that I don't think I couldn't get somewhere else. Overall, nothing about the place made me think to myself I can't wait to come back here.
