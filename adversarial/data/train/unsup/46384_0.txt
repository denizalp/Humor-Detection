This place is great. I read some less than stellar reviews and thought about cancelling our reservation. I am so glad I didn't as my wife and I had a great time on our anniversary. Fox concepts knows how to run a restaurant. Very professional and well staffed. The charcuterie is fantastic, oysters on the half shell and giant shrimp cocktail were fresh and excellent, try the jalapeno vinaigrette. Seafood stew was great and authentic and the carnitas nachos were over the top. Great, fun atmosphere, wine selection and service. Two for two with Arrogant Butcher, will be sure to revisit.
