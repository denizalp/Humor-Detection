Came in for breakfast on a Thursday morning. Located in a strip center parking was no issue what so ever.\n\nI saw the chicken fried steak was popular but instead ordered the ham & eggs with hash browns and wheat toast. The price was reasonable and the portion was generous. The ham was tasty, hash browns crispy and even the coffee was yummy!\n\nThe service from all the waitresses was spot on and I would return here in a heartbeat, no wonder this place  is popular with locals!
