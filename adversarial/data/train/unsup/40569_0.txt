Everyone in our party loved The Statehouse. The food is excellent and the service was very attentive.. The view of the lake is beautiful.  However it was discouraging to see that it was only 1\/4 full. The only minor drawback is that the bottle of white wine that we ordered  was not as chilled as it should have been. The server did a great job of getting it into an ice bucket immediately and getting it chilled to the proper temperature. I will definitely return.
