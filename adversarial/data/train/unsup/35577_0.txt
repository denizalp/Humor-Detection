There were four of us who decided last minute to go out for dinner. We wanted to try a restaurant that we had never been to before. On a Saturday night at 6 p.m. we arrived at D.C. Steak House. They were already filling up and had many reservations. The hostess was kind enough to work things out to accommodate our party. From the moment that we met the hostess and the minute we paid our bill we had an enjoyable dinner with delicious food, outstanding service and friendliness from every employee we encountered. The steak and prime rib was fabulous. My husband and friend each has fish entrees. One was walleye and the other was an evening special. They were both delicious as well. I highly recommend D.C. Steak House and encourage you to make a reservation. We were so lucky that the hostess went out of her way to get us in. We WILL be back!
