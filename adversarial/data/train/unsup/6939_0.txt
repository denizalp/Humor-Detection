I love going to park. But I never thought that I would love a park as much as this park. I have visited pretty much almost every single park in Las Vegas area. I usually go to park either to walk a dog, reading a book, or just to smell the scent of fresh green grass. \n\nThis particular park strikes me the most. If this park is an iPhone, than it really makes other park looks like a stupid calculator. \n\nWhy do I like this park so much?\n\nThe grass, it is so green to the point where it almost like being sprayed by a green paint. At the end of my park exploration, my blue jeans has turned into a green jeans. \n\nThe temperature, I swear it got to be the same temperature as in California, without the humidity of course. I usually go at night, and at my area where it's about 80 degrees at night, it feels like 70 degrees here. \n\nSecurity, this is the only public park where I could actually see the security guard. It just adds an extra layer of safety feeling, especially at night where some weirdos seem like to show up. Most other parks I've been to? The security guard never seems to exist.  \n\nCleanliness, you can tell that someone actually takes care the restroom. One of a few parks with a clean restroom.\n\nBicycle trails and walking paths, which is one of my favorite part of the park. It lets you wonder on what can you explore. I saw a wild rabbit during my walk. I tried to chase it down, but I afraid I will ended up at the Wonderland. \n\nLocation, since it's not located at the center of Las Vegas. This park is not affected by the Strip light as much. It makes the park a little darker at night. And that's a good thing! It just feels more intimate.\n\nThis is the only park in Vegas that I am proud to tell friends to go, especially for those that need some soul searching. Seriously, it's good for your soul. \n\n\n\nPS: Please don't crowd this park and destroy it. I don't want to regret that I ever written this review...
