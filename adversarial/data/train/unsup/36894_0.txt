Previously my wife and I would occasionally go to Filibertos until we moved on to Los Favoritos and then most recently became frequent Rubio's go-ers. But Rudy's really has the best of all worlds. Top quality ingredients are always fresh (you know it's the real deal when you can actually see avocado in the guacamole), reasonable prices (something I think we can all agree that Rubio's lacks), and overall great service (every meal is accompanied with chips and salsa, served family style if there's more than 1 at a table). The first time we at here, we were so in love with that food that we came back the next day  to try out their breakfast burritos, which DO NOT disappoint. Also, they offer $0.99 fish tacos on Wednesday! Honestly the fact that their ingredients always taste to fresh and the food feels so homemade alone, warrants 5 stars. If you're in the area, I highly recommend this joint.
