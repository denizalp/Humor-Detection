This is the late night little brother of Johnny's Downtown, that while attached to Johnny's, is only accessible by walking down a trash filled alley...but my oh my is it worth the trek.\n\nWe were looking for a late night bar in Cleveland after our convention ended for the night an exhausting the hotel bar.  The bartender said that some of the bar staff would head to Johnny's Late Night on occasion if they were going out after close, and that sold us.  We got directions and meandered our way through the foreign streets of Cleveland, and down the aforementioned trash filled alley, and there it was: Johnny's Late Night!\n\nIt was divey, dark with regulars looking at us like the strangers we were, although they still engaged us in conversation which was very much appreciated.  We all ordered food and drink, with no complaints.  My mixed drink was poured deeeeep and the chicken fingers we're perfect to soak that drink up...the chicken undoubtedly came from an genetically engineered mega-chicken, and it must've gone through at least 8 dips in the deep fryer...perfect.\n\nWe stayed still close, and by the end I was sold.  As we returned back to the hotel all we could talk about was how great Johnny's Late Night was, and of course the hundreds of bats circles the lit skyscrapers of Cleveland.  Still waiting for an explanation regarding the bats, and awaiting my next trip to Johnny's Late Night as well!
