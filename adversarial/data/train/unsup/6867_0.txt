I am slacking on my reviews.  We've been here probably 40 times in the past 4 years.  What's up with not giving them some Yelp love?  \n\nI think 37 of those times were for breakfast and we have worked our way through most of the breakfast menu.  Love the huge omelets and fried potatoes that come on the side.  Never had a bad meal here.\n\nMost recently Mr. M and I had had a very long day of work and house hunting and were exhausted.  I suggested Chompie's because I was craving some soup.  I had the matzo ball soup and he had the clam chowder.  Both were delicious and we were passing those bowls back and forth.  I ended up keeping the chowder and taking a large bowl of it home for Saturday.  They only have the chowder on Fridays, but they have 5 or 6 other kinds of soup every day.  \n\nI also had the Jewish sliders and he had a half sandwich with hard salami and Havarti on sourdough.  I can't even type hard salami without getting the giggles, let alone say it.  Their famous sliders were excellent as always and Mr. M's sandwich accompanied the soup perfectly.  \n\nThe bakery counter is amazing and full of all kinds of goodies.  I try not to look at it when I'm in there or I will get sucked in.  \n\nOnly once out of all the times we've been here have we had bad service and that was an older broad working the bakery counter who was ignoring everyone so she could chat with her friend about how things used to be in New York.  blah blah blah.  She needed a reminder that she was at work, BUT I haven't seen her in a long, long time so maybe she moved back East.  Usually the employees are very friendly and efficient.  I would say Chompie's is my #1 breakfast choice and then the Biscuits on Dobson.  Excellent food every time!
