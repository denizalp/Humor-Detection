Man, OHSO's getting some flak on here.  We've traveled a good amount, and airport restaurants are usually overpriced chains with poor service (probably due to overworked waiters who have to serve hundreds of people per day in a small restaurant setting) and less-than-stellar food.  Phoenix's airport has done a great job of setting up local businesses in the place of the usual food joints.  Although Airport OHSO doesn't serve up the same dog-friendly lazy weekend vibe as Main OHSO, it still is way better than the alternatives.\n\nPro tips:\n1) Don't try to eat here with 30 minutes until your flight.  If you want to eat a relaxed meal in an airport, eat a relaxed meal in an airport.  Give yourself 60+ minutes until boarding so you can chill.\n2) The Cobb Salad is delicious.  My husband and I were really just there for drinks, but we decided to split a salad, and our server was awesome and showed up with two cute Cobb salads on separate plates that looked like their own dishes.\n3) Roll with it.  We ordered a bloody mary and a beer.  We got a bloody mary and two beers.  Waiter realized he was serving us an extra immediately as he brought it over but still gave it to us, saying the bartender probably just messed up.  We were happy to help the bartender correct his mistake.  ;)\n\nOverall, OHSO put up stellar service and reasonably-priced food for an airport... and of course, great beer.  I won't think twice about coming back here again next flight.
