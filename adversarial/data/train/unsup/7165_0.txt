Wanted to give this place another try and again they failed me. I ordered a soft flour carne asada taco and got a soft corn taco instead and I actually really hate the soft corn tortillas. I also got chips and guacamole. If you love guacamole and are a snob about it like me don't get their guacamole. It's some sort of bland, cheap green stuff. And then they throw raw shredded cheese on it... Ugh. Sorry Someburros, I should have listened to my guy and drove over to you instead. Waste of money. Oooh and that's another thing!! A small drink, a taco and chips and guacamole was $12!!!! Rip off.
