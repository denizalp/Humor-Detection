Awful, just awful is the best way to describe this mall. \n\nThe architect that designed this mall and planners that approved it should be forced to drive through this area every day at rush hour, morning noon and night. It stinks.\n\n- Horrible traffic patterns that causes traffic to backup forever. Last summer I made the mistake of going in the mall and then discovering they had the east entrances closed for asphalt sealing. It took almost an hour to get out\n- Insufficient parking. There are way too many businesses packed into a tight space to accommodate the number of cars the mall generates. And that's now when we're in a recession. If they ever fill up all the vacant storefronts again they're in trouble\n- It's convenient in that it's RIGHT off the 101, but that also causes traffic problems. It adds to an already overcrowded Tatum Blvd north of the 101.\n- It's missing some stores that a mall of this type should have. Sporting Goods is one I can think of.\n- Very few locally owned businesses. All corporate chains - stuff you can find anywhere and everywhere. \n\nToo bad it's the closest and only thing close to the house. It means I'm banished to going here over and over and over again for the last minute items. Otherwise, I make the trip to similar stores elsewhere just so I don't have to fight the traffic in this awful place.
