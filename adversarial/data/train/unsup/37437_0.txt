Ugh. The Sands as a convention center is just wrong.\n\nThe main reason for the ugh is the parking situation here. Where is it? I've lived in Las Vegas forever and I've been doing conventions for two and a half years. I've worked here a few times, but I always park at The Palazzo and walk through to the convention center. \n\nNext reason for \"ugh\". The place has long, dim, dark hallways leading to meeting rooms. Often convention-goers and workers are bustling around in places that seem inappropriate for them to be doing so.\n\nIt does have a lot of space and it is connected to The Venetian\/Palazzo, which I believe is its one true saving grace.\n\nAlso they have renovated the carpet recently which in turn has made the place have a fresher scent. Still, I feel as though this place could be improved by being completely torn down and made new again.
