Alright, where do I start!?\n\nAria is the BOMB! By far the nicest hotel on the strip....Wynn, Encore sorry but you don't got shit on Aria at city center.,,,,\n\nFrom the moment you open the doors to the Aria hotel you get smacked upside the head with the most beautiful vanilla fragrance, the design of this place is F****N beautiful, the layout of the entire resort and casino is perfect. \n\nThe rooms are class!!!  Everything in the room is controlled from a tablet, meaning you want to open your blinds from bed, NO PROBLEM! the bathroom was the size of my apartment, having a bench in the shower is excellent especially if you plan on having some company  :)  and the beds.....WOW!!!!! the most comfortable bed i have ever slept on in my life. \n\nThe service at Aria was fantastic, from room service to check out everything was just perfect and all the employees at this resort seem so happy . \n\nThe buffet was perfect. my weekend was perfect. my drinks were perfect. the service was perfect, the girls were perfect. Aria you are F*****N PERFECT!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\nPeace & Love
