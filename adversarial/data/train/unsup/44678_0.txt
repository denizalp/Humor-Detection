Wow!  Really loved this place!  The food, service, atmosphere were all fantastic. We were surprised that they had live music that was just a perfect accompaniment with the roaring fire.  The warm brie appetizer was delicious as well as the duck and pork chop entrees. Will definitely be back -- can't wait to return.
