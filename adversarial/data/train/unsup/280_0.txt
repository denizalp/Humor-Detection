Would I call these the best doughnuts in Toronto? No.\nWould I call these the most unique doughnuts in Toronto? Definitely.\n\nFor my first visit I went with the Elvis. I figured this was the way to go since that seems to be the one everyone talks about and you see in all the pictures. The pastry portion itself was ok, nothing spectacular, I've definitely had better. The topping combination however was delicious. My only complaint about the toppings was that it was a little runny which made it a mess to eat.\n\nThis isn't a place I would come regularly due to the price, but it's for sure something that needs to be checked out. Then take a few months to consider coming again and make a return trip. \n\nNovember challenge 1\/30
