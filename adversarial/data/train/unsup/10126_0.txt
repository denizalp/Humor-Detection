We were eager to give this place a try, but were terribly disappointed.  Several people waited outside of what was a half-empty restaurant while staff looked to us blankly and lifelessly milled about.  \n\nWhen we were finally seated, we were sitting partially under an umbrella before a server completely moved it, exposing us directly to the afternoon sun and glare.  We asked if he could move it back, but it appeared language might have been a barrier. After a few moments of him misinterpreting us, we were offered to move to another table, which we did.  As we looked around, people were seemingly leaving in a huff about something, and we noticed a dish arriving to a table just as patrons were getting up to leave.  This should have been a red flag prompting us to leave, but we still wanted to see how the food measured up.\n\nWe ordered steamed and pan-fried dumplings, one in which had undercooked pork.  Yes. Undercooked pork.  The noodles that came, Dandan and Sesame, were covered in what looked and tasted like a bland peanut butter paste. We are pretty open-minded with food, but this looked and tasted awful.  \n\nWe left the bowls as they were, and asked for the check, and left. The staff seemed overly preoccupied with everything other than their customers and the pride in the product was apparently on vacation.   \n\nA major disappointment.
