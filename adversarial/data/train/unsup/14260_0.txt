Banh Mi Boys lunch lineup can sometimes get insanely long. There's a lineup for you to order your food, and then a lineup for you to pick up your food. However, it's most efficient in my opinion for the amount of people they serve. A part of me wishes they would hear my name correctly, because people always call Christine or Krystal, and I tell them every time that my name is Kristy.\n\nI got the five spice pork belly bao - which was a little under $5. It wasn't too big of a meal, so it's debatable if you think it's worth it to purchase - it's mainly just the soft man tau bao, meat, some veggies - the total cost of buying the ingredients for this and making it on your own is probably $0.50 or less. \n\nFor a 10 minute wait time, it's definitely debatable if it was worth it, with no additional seats either. The taste of the bao was good, but oily, it was literally finished in a few bites. It did taste okay though - maybe another less busy location would have been a better experience.
