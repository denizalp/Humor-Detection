If you're looking for really fast service and a delicious dessert with your beverage, this is the place for you. The baristas are always friendly and efficient and never seem to be idling around.\nThe seating towards the back is perfect for study sessions with friends, which is why I appreciate this location being open until late. Overall, one of the best coffee spots on campus!
