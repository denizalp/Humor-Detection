Clean, knowledgeable and kind. The first time for my daughters and a friend. Robert pierced both my daughters and was amazing... so professional, informative and funny... was the perfect experience for me as a Mom and my daughters... and he promised to address any issue - amazing.\n\nAaron tatooed my daughters' friend... was awesome, patient and helpful... it was our first time.\n\nAmazing experience... would highly recommend.
