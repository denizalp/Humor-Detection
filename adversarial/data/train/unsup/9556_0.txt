Since the dawn of time philosophers, religious scholars, and drunken frat boys have debated the same question: What is the top fast food burger place- 5 guys or Smash Burger? If you said In N Out please stop reading this review and flog yourself. \n\nI have to say that while it's close I give a slight edge to Smash. Sure the burgers are smaller, sure you don't get an extra 5 lbs of fries shoveled into your bag, sure you can't eat salted in the shell peanuts and throw the shells at the staff (your supposed to do that right?) - but damnit they have milkshakes and sweet potato fries and that is what it takes to win.\n\nLet's start with the burger- the only option for any self respecting Vegasite is the Sin City. There is no other burger like it in the counter- certainly not any of the exact same burger with a different city- specific name in every other town with a SmashBurger- this thing is unique to Vegas. Bacon, fried egg, onion strings- the most delicious threesome since that time I met your mom and sister. Its a tad hard to eat without it falling apart- but the poor structural integrity just means you have to shovel it into your pie hole faster before it collapses mysteriously like tower 7. \n\nThe Shakes- I enjoy Haagen Daz ice cream regularly while wearing a smoking jacket in my study, sitting in my rich leather recliner having my feet massaged by a faceless servant- and with Smashburger I can replicate that somewhat out in the world amongst the unwashed masses. The ice cream is really rich which improves the flavor of shakes like Oreo but doesn't match well with shakes like Butterfinger so plan accordingly. \n\nThe fries- Sweet potato Smash fries are the move- and make sure they come loaded with lots ofherbs and dripping with oil- otherwise reject them like a deformed Spartan Baby. \n\nAre you supposed to bus your baskets at this place or leave them on the table? No one knows...
