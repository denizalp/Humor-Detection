The Safeway on Elliot and McClintock is about 20 years old. I know this because I was part of the crew that opened the store! This store replaced the old one on Warner and McClintock in grand fashion and has remained a superior option even today.\n\nThe store was refreshed a few years ago to the modern Safeway format. Parking is plentiful with easy access. Staff are great as always with a good selection of options in every department.\n\nEven after bagging the groceries, cleaning the toilets, and collecting carts in the summer heat as a teenager, I am glad to see my store still shining bright.
