I ordered the oxtail plate and my mom ordered the stew chicken... we loved it. I would take the white rice and beans over the coconut mixed rice and beans but neither is a bad choice. Definitely coming back here and bringing my dad when he comes to visit. The space is huge and decorated with Belize flags all while Belizean music plays in the background.
