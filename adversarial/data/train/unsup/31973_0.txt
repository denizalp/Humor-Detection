Haven't been here since my college days over 20 years ago.  Not the same place at all. I brought my wife along and she said, \"what is so great about this place, they don't even keep there condiment bar full, it was empty when I went up there.\" Needless to say the service wasn't the best either.  Maybe when I was in college I thought this was a great place to get some good bar food, but no more.
