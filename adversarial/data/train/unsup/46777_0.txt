First time here...under whelmed. Ordered (took a long time..no one was in the place) Steak tostados...three tiny tortilla the size of a silver dollar...$7...rip off. Ordered Carne Asada street tacos...served ice cold...had to be remade. The manager made it right..chomped the cold food...I'll try this place again....to be fair...
