Hi, may I have the Cuban please? Very rudely, \"Uhhh, you mean The Cubano?\" \nOh, not a good way to start our little transaction here. \nWell let me tell you that your little Cubano is horrible. I'm pretty sure if I owned a George Foreman Grill, had some miracle whip (CUBANS DON'T HAVE MAYO!!), Oscar Meyer ham, Vlasic pickles, and week old stale bread, I could still whip up a better sandwich than you served me. And probably quicker than in the 10 minutes it took you to make it. \nI definitely won't be returning here. \nRude service, terrible sandwich, and too long of a wait, especially in an airport location.
