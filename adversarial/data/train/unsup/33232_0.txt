Susanna completely came to the rescue on my vegas vacation!  I had picked up the perfect vintage dress for going out on the town on Saturday night but unfortunately the hemline had been cut so unevenly by a previous owner that I thought it was beyond repair, the downside of collecting second hand clothing.  I hadn't realize the extent of the damage to the hem was until I tried it on with only a few hours to go before my event, I went into panic mode calling all over town until I found Susanna.  She told me to bring it in and she'd get to work on in ASAP, even staying an hour past her closing time to make sure it got finished in time for me to wear that evening!  In addition to superb customer service her work was impeccable, even and clean!  I can not thank her enough for helping be apart of making that Saturday night so special!
