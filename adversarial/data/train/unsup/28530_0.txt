One word...WOW!  I have had my fair share of steak houses from Del Monicos, Flemings, Del Frisco's, Donovan's, Etc. and I must say this was one of the best meals I have ever had!  Sangria, Gnocchi w\/ truffle cream, sauteed mushrooms and onions, lobster pot stickers, surf and turf, the garbage salad...all of it was top notch.  All the staff are first class, bartenders, servers, hostesses, etc...everyone  and everything was absolutely wonderful and i will be back!!!!
