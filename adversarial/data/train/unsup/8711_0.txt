This is an update to my previous 5 star review 24 days ago on the day I got my nails done. Here goes! After 3 days, my tips began to lift. I asked My to fix them (4-5 nails) & came in on the next day. I told her (as I did on the day she did them) that there wasn't enough glue, so that's why I believe they lifted. She then began to make excuses for the abd gel process & said another was better. If that is true, why not say that from the get go? Now that there is an operator error, excuses come out? Hmmmm...anyways, she only fixed 2 nails & merely put glue on the rest in hopes they wouldn't come off completely, I'm guessing? Then she asked me, are you happy now? Who says that after you fix sub-par work? It wasn't my fault they came off!\nThe next week I went to a different nail shop & had them take hers off & give me a whole new full set...needless to say, I haven't had any issues. \nAlso, while she was doing my nails, she looked at my eyebrows & asked me who does them? I replied, I do my own. She then said, ohhhh! They look very bad...very, very bad!!! Then My said, I do eyebrows too, I do for you next time & make them look better! Really? This is not how you speak to people in America...or at least not how I speak to people. A lesson in tact & manners would be helpful.  Unfortunately, I will not ever return.
