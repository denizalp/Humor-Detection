I like the location but this establishment could really use an update. The cardio equipment and machines at the front of the gym are perfectly fine if that is what you come for, but the weight room has some issues. There is no open floor space, and a fair chunk of the weight room is filled with nonsensical equipment that nobody ever uses. As an example, there are five different leg presses and at least three different types of lat pulldown machines with different handles, yet only one squat rack. I wish the management would consolidate and get rid of this stuff and make room for more of the things that people are always standing around and waiting for. \n\nThe staff are all helpful and all the other customers seem to mind their own business, except during bro social hour (6-8 pm). If you go during peak hours, expect to stand around and wait.
