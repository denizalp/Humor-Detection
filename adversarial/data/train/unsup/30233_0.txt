There are no words that will do justice to describe how amazing the staff and the food is in this restaurant. Got there at my appointed reservation time and I got a table immediately. My server was amazing and very attentive. He made sure we got everything before our cirque du soleil show. Jason , the manager, takes the cake for the most wonderful treatment a girl could ever ask for on her birthday. The food was exquisite from the bread with caramelized onions, to the calamari, shrimp with polenta, truffle oil chips, delicious prosciutto pizza , and amazing chocolate cake. I'm probably forgetting several items because we got so many dishes. I 100% recommend this place. If you have any doubts , throw them out the window!
