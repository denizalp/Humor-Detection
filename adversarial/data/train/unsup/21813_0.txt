I got delivery from this restaurant! One of the best deliveries I have ever had. I ordered the paneer makhani roti and the samosa chaat. \n\nThe samosa chaat was a little soggy by the time it reached me, but that is to be expected. I think I might request for the sauces to be on the side when I order next time. Despite the sogginess, it did not affect the overall taste, which was sweet, spicy, and savoury all rolled into one. Haven't had better samosa chaat in a long time. For those of you who don't know, samosa chaat is basically samosas covered in chana (curried chickpeas), chutneys and yogurt. \n\nThe paneer makhani was rich, tasty, and very filling. I had enough food to last me until the next day. One of the best parts is that delivery is free if you order more than $15. With taxes and tip both items came out to less than $20. Would definitely order again!
