We came here last night for dinner for somewhere we have never tried before.\nNice big parking lot ,lots of room. The place was semi busy for a Thursday night.\n We asked for a booth, which we got in the bar area.\nWe had enough time to fully read the menu before our server came to the table.\nBuckets of Peanuts adorn all the tables and you eat the peanuts and throw the shells on the floor. Which my girlfriend felt bad doing , but that is what everyone does here they tell us.\n So we ordered our drinks, along with water. All came quickly, then ordered our food. A runner brought out the food.  I had gotten the Sirloin ,my girl got the Filet mingon.\nBoth were cooked perfectly,that is an A t. However the runner said, we are out of Baked Potaoes. What would you like instead?  \nHow do you run out of Baked Potatoes at 6:45pm when you are a Steak house????\nAnyway after that we ordered the Sweet Potaoes, They came out shortly after, and it was all good.\nI think it is very high priced for a low end place. Plastic glasses and a very rough look in the place. They may be going for Rustic looking, but all I see is a cheaply made room.\nIt is an odd vibe here, can't quite put my finger on it.\nBut, service was slow ,our server seemed as if she had too many tables and was stressed out.  So I do not blame her. \nWe won't return, too many good choices out there for the $$.\nAlso the restrooms were dirty and not kept up.
