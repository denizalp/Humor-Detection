I decided to take advantage of AMC's epic Black Panther opening weekend and do a movie day with the family. Eight of us came out and checked out the hype and we were not disappointed! \nMarvel Studios has a hit on their hands with this all star cast bringing this action packed comic to life from the start to finish! \nAMC theater and Fandango made the process of getting tickets to this sold out weekend simple and easy! You can select your seats and pay online and as an AMC Stub member you can waive the convince fee associated with purchasing tickets on line. Your Stub membership also offers free and upgraded concessions at the movies. \nOh yes it's free to become an AMC Stubs member.
