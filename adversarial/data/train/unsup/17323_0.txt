Just to the point, the chef needs to go back to cooking school and the owner needs to learn how to run a successful business. I believe is just matter of time before they go out of business. The service was very poor and the taste of the food horrible. We didn't finish our meal that's how horrible our food was.\nThe worst part to us was the sauce.
