I went to Ace for over a year. I overlooked my first visit where I waited for a few hours for a 'walk-in' because the 45 minute cut was high quality. After many months of patronage, I made a Sunday appointment using Styleseat per Kevin - said Sundays 'by appointment only'. I showed up and no one there. I was told it was basically a limitation of the app. I overlooked that too, but it was very frustrating. Today I rushed over from my office on hwy 17 and Peoria for my 5:30 appointment- the last of the day. 5:31, I tugged on the door and it was locked. They unlocked the door for me. Kevin was finishing up a cut\n... remember I mentioned these are 30-45 min cuts... he then took another customer at 5:45. Didn't say a word to me. At 6pm I got up and walked out. I'm a regular, I've supported the business with referrals and reviews, and I tip 50%. That's $10 on a $20 cut. I think I deserve better service. I won't be back. I'm a professional so office hours are 8-5 so I guess that's out and I'm not going to deal with wasting time on my days off- I just don't have the time. Good luck to your shop.
