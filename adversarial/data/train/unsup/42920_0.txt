So this is an Akron tradition, thus I had to try. Maybe the build-up was too much, but I wasn't overly impressed with the burgers. They were greasy, but a significant upgrade over normal fast food. However, I don't tend to eat fast food, so I was comparing to other restaurants known for their burgers and swensons just doesn't measure up. If I was in a rush, I'd eat it again. But I'm not going out of my way to get swensons despite the pleas from the masses in Akron that claim these are the best burgers ever.
