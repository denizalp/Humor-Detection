Literally could not even PAY to add oil and vinegar to my sub. The only explanation I was given was \"NO, it's a weird thing we can't. No you can't pay extra for it.\" Called corporate customer service to see why this oil and vinegar was so unattainable and I was accused of \"looking for a freebie.\" Not sure what that oil and vinegar is made out of but it seems like it's hidden in some temple for Indiana Jones to find. Well Jersey Mike's it is!
