Don't waste your time! It's a bad sign when it's dead and it takes forever to get your food! ....seriously as I was typing this waiting for my check (that I had to ask for) they just brought out a 4th roll they had obviously forgotten! One roll had brown old avacado on it--that's a simple enough thing that should NEVER happen! They were very pushy that we do all you can eat- we didn't and they seemed upset by that! We won't be back! This was your warning! ---have it a two star but changed to 1 after the high bill with bad service and bad food :(
