When you don't feel like being around Ed Hardy douche bags, there aren't many places in Vegas you can escape to.  Enter the Gold Coast Bowling Center.  This place is the shit!  For $4 we got two pairs of bowling shoes, and a empty lane.  Ridiculous right?  I know!  This place wasn't only cheap, it was huge!  It looked like they had about a million lanes.  I gave up trying to count.  Not because it was too big but because I only have a 1st grade education and am not sure what comes after the number 7.  But anyway, yes, this place is rad.  It seems like the kind of bowling alley they shoot professional bowling in.  \n\nAs I was leaving the bowling alley I couldn't help but say thank you the man behind the counter.  Not only did he have great service, but most importantly, great balls.  Seriously!  Most bowling alleys have small balls with cracks in them.  This place had shiny balls, and lots of them!  Blue balls, black balls, everything I needed and more.  I had no trouble finding balls with the right sized holes for my fingers.  There is no doubt in my mind this is the place with the most available, smooth balls I've ever seen.  Thanks again Gold Coast!
