Several blocks long, covered with the infamous ceiling with lights display.. I appreciate the concept.. And Large parking structure is convenient. But totally NOT my scene.. \n\nWent here on a Friday night around 11pm, and all the crazy people were out. Each day I'm realizing how more and more conservative I actually am!... It wasn't necessarily dirty, but it FELT dirty. It wasn't completely clean either, with small trash here and there. It was crowded and full of rowdy, drunk people making fools of themselves. Not cute. It felt like a fight could break out at any moment! \n\nAside from that, this strip is lined with entrances to hotel\/casinos, restaurants, and a lot of souvenir shops. Along the streets are various performers, and people in costumes inviting you to take pictures with them. There's also random stands and vendors. There's also a stage at each side with bands playing live music. The ceiling is a light display. And zip liners can go from one end to the other. So yes, it sounds like an awesome experience, and I really do think the concept is pretty cool.. But the crowd is what makes it so crazy.
