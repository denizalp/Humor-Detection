Authentic sichuan food, all the spicy dishes are good if you can withstand the heat. This is probably one of the best in Brossard (please note that if you go to Toronto you will get much better Sichuan food, but in Brossard, this is the best)\n\nFor the main dish, I would recommend the spicy boiling fish, very tasty fish fillet with bean sprout. The appetizers are all good as well. Just beware that the dishes are a bit oily.
