Blehh tastes like wayyy over priced microwave pizza! Bland! Weird cheese. The only reason we got food from here is because Sofia's best was closed. Sofia's is 100 times better and for half the price. I will never go back to bambinis just because the food tastes like crap. I would rather have little Caesars than this place
