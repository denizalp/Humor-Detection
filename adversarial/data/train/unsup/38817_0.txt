The beef brisket was not only the best brisket I've ever had, but the best meat ever bbq'ed!! This place deserves all stars. However, I ordered the plate with the brisket and a few slices of turkey and a soda, it came to about $21.00. The amount was 'enough to eat, but not to have leftovers'. So will I be thinking about how great the food was? Absolutely. Will I be thinking twice before spending that amount again, at a bbq shack with paper plates, plastic silverware, and a few wooden benches outside? You betcha. Food 5 stars. Value 2 stars. Location 2 stars. Ambience 2 stars.
