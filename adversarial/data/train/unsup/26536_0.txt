Wonderful vegan cuisine at a fare price and good atmosphere. Unique place to take visitors or go on a date. \nI went twice in one week. First, with a group of people and then we went back with visitors to Pittsburgh. The food is delicious and unique and I am typically a picky eater\/not vegan. I enjoyed every dish we had. Do not miss the pirogi's or mushroom\/miso dish.
