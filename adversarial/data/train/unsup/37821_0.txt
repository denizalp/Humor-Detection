This place is sooo good! I'm so glad my Mom and her husband took us here when we were visiting last month. The service was excellent and the food? I'm salivating just remembering it. My Mom was surprised to see they'd expanded it since she was last there but I only know it as it now stands. It has a clean, cool and laid-back vibe which was perfect for our evening out. They do have high chairs...but there's no changing table in the ladies room. Luckily they had a table that was the perfect size so I moved the items off of it, put down my mat, changed the little guy, and put everything back as it was. That's my only complaint but since we had something to work with other than the floor I'm totally okay with it. I'm guessing there aren't a ton of babies in the area per se, but probably a fair amount of grandkids who may visit. \n\nMy Mom insisted we get the crispy egg rolls (we had the vegetarian ones) and they were DELICIOUS. We also ordered the chicken skewers as half an appetizer and half an entree for my son, they were also deliciously good and full of flavor! I was bummed we were leaving the next day and couldn't bring our leftovers with! There were 3 Filet mignon shaken beefs ordered and one Sizzling Salmon and everyone left stuffed and satisfied. I know my Mom will continue to enjoy this spot and whenever I'm back in town I'll be adding it to my list of \"must-do's!\"
