If I have a Jen K's Top 10 Restaurant List, Joe Beef would definitely be on it. \n\nAnd in fact, I might even able to say My Last Meal on Earth I want to have it here. (Yelp's profile question and they do serves uni!)\n\nI have been to Liverpool House, Joe Beef's sister restaurant right next door but Joe Beef is the real deal.\n\nThe menu is seasonal but interesting. A mixture of seafood and meat and even vegetables. And of course foie gras!\n\nEverything we ordered were amazing. And the wait staff is just so knowledgeable with the menu and able to make awesome recommendations.\n\nThe vibe is relaxing especially out on the back patio on a nice summer evening. \n\nAnd of these for a reasonable price! \n\nJust make sure you make a reservation ASAP, Joe Beef is just so popular and definitely worth all the hype!
