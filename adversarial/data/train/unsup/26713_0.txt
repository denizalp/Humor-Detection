I've eaten here many times and always go back for my favorite: veggie delight sandwich and crab salad.  The crab salad has got a nice kick to it, so if you're not into spicy, this may not be for you.  But here's the clincher...I'm not a spicy-type gal and I STILL love it!  Their cute bakery offers a variety of cupcakes and bars of which I've tried several and have never had one I didn't like.  So if you're tired of fast food chains and want fresh food at a reasonable price, \"2 Gals\" needs to be your \"go-2\"!  Great atmosphere, live piano player on occasion is a nice touch, and decor is lovely.   So good!
