This is def a fast favorite!  And they are consistent.  My biggest concern is that working so close may definitely have me broke by the end of the summer!\nI love that most of the food is locally sourced (look at me, doing my part to support local agriculture!)  Its also pretty darn tasty!\nFor a long time I would only get the spicy avocado bowl because it was so freaking good, but this week I have ventured out and tried the zucchini spaghetti with eggplant 'meatless' balls....and they knocked my socks off....SO GOOD!  I did something a little outrageous to this veg friendly dish and added BACON!  Yup i did it and it was soooooo tasty!  But bacon makes most things that much better right... Even so, the dish stood pretty well on its own.\nThe avocado toast is pretty good too.\nI love that B.Good has a fountain of all natural sodas, that my kids love.  \nIf you are looking for a healthy fast food option this is definitely the way to go.  \nNext i think I will try the smoothies because they look pretty tasty too, with a variety of blends.  Great addition to my dine out roster!
