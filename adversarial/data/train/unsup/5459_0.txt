I bought a round of for two of my friends and I and it came out to $42 dollars. HOLY CRAP! O well! Back to our table we went... the only reason I even went to the bar was because I couldn't wait for my alcohol!!!! LOL! I'm not an alcoholic, but the Vegas side of me was taking over! \n\nI LOVE TAO! \n\nFor you shy fellows out there, here's a tip for you guys... If you're to shy to talk to some girls, just tip the security, and they'll start pulling hella girls to the table you. After that, it's all up to you work your magic!
