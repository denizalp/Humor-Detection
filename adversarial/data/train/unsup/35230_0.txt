Been frequenting this place for years, for the  coffee. Highly recommended for a great coffee in little Italy. Made just the way you like it. And from time to time I may grab a panini there. Usually just the veal with provolone. Have never been disappointed with one. Hits the spot, and a great bargain for a sandwich.
