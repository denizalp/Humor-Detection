The best thing about my involvement with Genesis Medical Group\/Parkway Urgent Care was Physician's Assistant, Marie!  She has the right conception about what an individual working in the medical field is.  She possesses listening skills, she's professional, gives great advice within her realm of authority and definitely is compassionate!  Way-to-go, Marie!  Otherwise, this so-called healthcare facility is one of the worst I've seen in my entire life.  Nevada healthcare needs to step it up a few notches.
