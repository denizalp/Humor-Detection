Taco Bell is Taco Bell....unless you're in Las Vegas. And then, well, it's still Taco Bell. You're still gonna get your staple cheesy gordita crunch and chalupas and all that jazz. But one thing that sets this Taco Bell apart from others (besides the name) are the drinks. \n\nYeah, you don't need a PHD in Taco-ology to figure out what I'm talking about here. You want a frozen drink? Sure. You want it with a little extra kick? Well now you're talkin'! \n\nThe females of my family heard about this not-so-ordinary T-Bell before our Vegas trip and after flying in late to Sin City, we made this our first stop for food. But again, it was more for the drinks. \n\nI mean a frozen Baja Blast is good on its own, but when you add rum to the thing? Woah. And you could get it with said liquor or choose vodka, whiskey, or even tequila. Nice. Very nice. Beyond that it's basically nothing special (service was friendly though) outside of a pretty well-themed, contemporary-style Taco Bell complete with taco hats for purchase, of course....\n\nOverall, Taco Bell Cantina is worthy of a stop, especially if you ever find yourself at your neighborhood T-Bell at 2:30 in the mornin' after a night of drinkin'. Instead, come here and get those drinks along with your \"fourth meal.\" Enjoy, mis amigos.
