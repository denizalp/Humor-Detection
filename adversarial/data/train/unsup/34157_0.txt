This is by far my favorite \"fast deli\" restaurant.  Their flatbread is really spectacular.  I usually order the roasted vegie flatbread sandwich which is wonderful.  If you're not watching calories, the cracked pepper chips are great too.  Their pizzas also look fantastic - plan to try one soon.  And maybe best of all, the counter employees are consistent - same people every day I've been in during the week - and they're smiling, happy and friendly.  An unusual twist for a national chain, I think.  The interior is really nice too, with pretty upholstered furniture that doesn't look generic.  Love it!
