This place is the ultimate ASIAN KINGDOM!  You get an ultimate shopping experience with samples and music.  Now how cool is that?  I really, really, REALLY LOVE how this place gives you pre-marinated meat.  I love to shop for all my Korean food addictions here, and I get it all in one sweep.  Kal-bi, bugolgi, kimchi, and pork belly! All crossed out in one area.  I also love their various choice of ramen, I could stand in the aisle for hours reading every single one and putting them into my cart.  And get this, THEY EVEN HAVE MY CHILDHOOD DRINK! Milkis = YUMMMMMMM!
