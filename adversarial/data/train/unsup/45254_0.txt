This place has to be one of the best Italian restaurants in all of Scottsdale. The food is amazing and the service is quick.  I ordered the meatballs as an appetizer and was almost so full that I couldn't eat my salad that followed! We also had our office holiday luncheon here in the back family style rooms which are great to seat 7 or more people.  I have gone here over four times and have NEVER had a bad meal :)
