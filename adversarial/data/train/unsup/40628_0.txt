If you ever need tickets, Lu Ann is the person to see! Great events and Customer Service second to none. My best experience is when something went wrong with the venue and Lu Ann personally took care of the situation immediately! She didn't have to at all, but did it in such a comforting, personal matter, you felt you were important to her. Many people do not realize the importance of customer  service. It is easy when everything goes right, it's when it goes wrong is where a company separates itself. You do not need to look any further for tickets than here!
