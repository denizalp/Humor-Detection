NYPD Pizza AZ New York Pizza Department...when it comes to pizza there are many choices, but for the Reilly's our tradition around the Holidays is a night out at NYPD...Great location and and just enough seats to make you feel like your at a local pizza joint in NY.\n\nBig shout out to Matt and his staff as they are a Customer First restaurant with great service and great PIZZA! One of the cleanest restaurants I have eaten at in Arizona!\n\nFirst the Wings are a must...we go for the Upstate Style Wings (Traditional) a family fave. Just enough spice and a TON of flavor! Now the Pie...with so many choices you can't go wrong, but you must try the Brooklyn Family. With each slice loaded with Pepperoni, Sausage, Fresh Basil all on that Awesome traditional NY style crust...Could Be Award Winning!\n\nNope we're not don yet. You have to try the Zeppoli, deep fried pizza dough tossed with cinnamon and sugar a new favorite...
