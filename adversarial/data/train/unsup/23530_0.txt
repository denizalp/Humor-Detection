One word....HORRIBLE! Interested in medicating patients, not truly \"helping\" them for long term purposes! My son has been to this facility repeatedly, and repeatedly, they accept him, changing nothing about this routine, accept medicating, possibly increasing his dosage, changing his medications. My son has never discussed with me, how this facility has helped him. It's a place of shelter for him, when he has nowhere to go. Horrible way to \"TREAT\" the mentally unstable. Medicating them, is not the sole answer, especially when you have repeat patients.
