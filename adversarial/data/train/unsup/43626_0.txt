I had excellent dental care at Red Mountain Family Dental in Mesa, AZ. The front desk was friendly and accommodated my schedule. I had one of the best teeth cleanings that I have ever had. The dentist was friendly and professional.  He showed me the xrays and explained the treatment plan in detail.  He  completed my dental work pain free and I am thrilled with the results. I will be referring friends and family to Red Mountain Family Dental.
