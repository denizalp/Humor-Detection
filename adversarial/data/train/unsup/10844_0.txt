3.5 Stars!\n\nMr Tokyo is a Japanese restaurant located in Charlotte, NC.  I was there for a business trip, and my boss \/ manager picked this place to eat for dinner after we got off the plane.\n\nThey are known for their AYCE (All You Can Eat) \/ unlimited Sushi & Hibachi ($18.99 per person for adults).  Be careful as they do charge for leftovers!!  \n\nI rated it 3.5 stars because it's not exactly authentic, but for the $18.99 AYCE price, it's really worth the value and the quality of the fish.  I came with my boss and another colleague - all of us agreed that their salmon was really fresh (at the time).  Good variety and selection for the price.  \n\nENJOY!!
