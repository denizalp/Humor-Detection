I always come here for breakfast. A nice fruit cup or parfait for me, ham and cheese panini for the bf. White choco mocha for him, double espresso shot for me. Then there would be the times when we see pastries we just HAVE to have--their pumpkin cheesecake is good, as is their dessert trio (rose macaron, PB lolli and creme brulee on a milk choco tray YES PLEASE). There hasn't been a dish I haven't liked and it is still my fave breakfast place so far (beats out Payard, which is my second fave breakkie place).\n\nDesserts and coffee...COME HERE!!! Note that it CAN get pricey though.
