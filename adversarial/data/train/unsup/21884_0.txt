I've now given Red Orchid two chances, and have been disappointed both times.  I ordered the vegetable pad see ew each time, and even with some spice, I can't say there was much flavor compared to others I've had.  My biggest problem is that for the price, portions are rather small.\n\n***Update: Against my better judgment, gave this place one more shot.  Ordered online - got there 20 mins later as stated on my confirmation page, and my order had not been started...I was told it wasn't even received.  I officially give up.
