It was Saturday day night at The Cosmopolitan Las Vegas...we were starving and didn't want to wait in line for food. We decided to give the Wicked Spoon buffet a try. I've been to a lot of buffets in Las Vegas (Aria, Mandalay Bay, Wynn, Red Rock, Palms, etc.) I found that the Wicked Spoon compared quite nicely. I like that there was no wait on a Saturday night; I liked that the food was all fresh and extremely tasty; I especially liked the crab legs and salmon. The desserts were great, my favorites being the chocolate covered strawberries, white chocolate mousse and sorbets. $44 for diner seemed worthwhile. We will be back!
