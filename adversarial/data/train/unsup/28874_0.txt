I've made two purchases so far and both have been nothing short of flawless experiences.  Mind you I picked up both purchases so I can't speak of delivery but my customer experience has been nothing short of wonderful. \nMy last purchase yesterday I purchased a bar and they not only took my $25 survey coupon from my last purchase but also took my $25 sleep test coupon.  That made me smile as it was about 15% off my purchase.  \nThen I was looking at a couch debating on a custom color\/fabric and an associate shoes me an additional set of searches with my perfect color and material I've been searching for and it won't be an additional charge.  \n\nLoading dock staff is super helpful and friendly.  I I have nothing but praise for the store merchandise and staff.
