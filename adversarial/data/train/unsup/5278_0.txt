$16.99 for lunch I thought \"Hey buffet style All you can eat sushi and hot entree's sounds good to me\". Totally thought wrong.\n\nHot Entree's: I didn't even touch this, SUPER SUPER Greasy. You could see the oil bubbles. This wasn't Japanese hot dishes more like Americanized fast Chinese Food. \n\nSushi: It wasn't fresh at all I'm guessing because they make it then its left out till someone grabs it and they love to pack on the rice, ONLY great thing about this place is they don't care if you eat the rice or not. So I had myself a lot of shashimi. \n\nSoup\/Udon Noodles: There was a small area were the udon noodles were already pre-put into bowls and all you had to do was fill the bowl up with soup. The soup lacked flavor, the noodles were were out so long they dried up. Also no good. \n\nDesert: Their selection of deserts were very limited and mediocre, Sorry Mr. Makino I guess I was expecting more? The only exciting this about their desert selection was the fondue chocolate fountain (which was a mess) chocolate splatters every where. On the floor on the counter every where. Also the strawberries were half frozen still so the warm fondue chocolate quickly turned cold once it touched the strawberries. I like my chocolate strawberries either hardened or warm and melty\n\nThe place: First off this place was disgusting, when I first walked in I couldn't help but notice the floor had bits and pieces of food all over it. When we sat down our table was still wet, I'm assuming the waitress just finished cleaning the table from their previous costumers. Then I noticed the towel she used to clean our table... it also had bits and pieces of food on it...which she then used to wipe another table... Gross
