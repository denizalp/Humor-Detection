BBQ in the middle of Winter?  Why the hell not, I said, as I participated in a UYE organised by Ryan F., driving out to Brampton on one of the coldest nights!  Actually, it was the best.decision.ever. as the food at RD's made me believe, albeit briefly, that it was Summer!!!\n\nI've had RD's bookmarked for the longest time, but never found a reason to be in this area.  So glad I ventured out 'cause I finally had a chance to experience what all the amazing reviews were all about.\n\nThe \"Skinny\" (ha ha!) - Since we went as a group, I was able to taste a bit of everything, including some Hush Puppies (corn fritter apps), Creole Rice (yum!), Cole Slaw (it was a side for my Shrimp PoBoy), Bake Beans, Mac & Cheese, Mammoth Poutine (oh my lord, mammoth is no exaggeration!), Catfish PoBoy, Pulled Pork, & Beef Brisket.\n\n(I think the only thing that was on the table that I didn't sample were the Ribs + Big Daddy.  I'll save that for my next visit!)\n\nEverything was delicious!  And although I liked my Shrimp PoBoy, I'd say that RD's standout is DEFINITELY the BBQ, re:  ribs (probably, but I never tried), brisket, & pulled pork.  So if you're a first-timer, I'd go with the BBQ meats!\n\nOwners were down-to-earth, very friendly, patient, and knowledgeable about their food.  You could tell - & it shows too - that it is their passion and I love going to places like this!\n\nWhile we were there, owners told us that they are opening another location within the next few months in the Hurontario\/Derry area, so great news for people like me who live in 'ssauga!
