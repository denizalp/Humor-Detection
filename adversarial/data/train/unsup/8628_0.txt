The health department need to pay this place a visit.  It was so grouse in my opinion. The guy was sweating and dripping all over the place.  He had a glove on, but was touching everything with his glove plus using his glove hand to take and count back cash.  Then he uses that gloved hand that whipped his brow, touched my money and grabs a handful of bagels.  I took my bagel and dropped it in the trash on the way out.
