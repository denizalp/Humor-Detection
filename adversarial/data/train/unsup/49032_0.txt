Best service I have ever had in my life! I like to sit after work and gave a beer while playing some slots. I don't ever expect much from the bartenders considering bartenders are a dime a dozen here however; at Steiner ' s on Cheyenne the girls have been there a while and remember every guest. They also get you a new drink before you finish your first. They are very personable and make you feel like you have a home with them. \n\nAfter my first time with each bartender they remembered my drink and food order. They are very knowledgeable,  caring and funny. Have a sense of humor and you will love this place!
