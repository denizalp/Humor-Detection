Unless you've managed to wrangle an exceptional deal on the price of your room....and I do mean exceptional...stay somewhere else.\n\nThe Luxor is okay....but many of the rooms are in a state of disrepair.\n\nWe'd requested a \"No Smoking\" room... and we'd alerted them to the fact that our plane was due in late.\n\nWe were issued a non-descript \"Smoking\" room. They claimed to be at \"full capacity\"....with all 4,500 rooms \"booked\".\n\nNevertheless...when we complained...they magically \"discovered\" a non-smoking room.\n\nJust like every other property on the strip...this one is constructed like a maze inside. \n\nThey have rather low balcony railings for the upper levels...overlooking the central casino & lobby. I'm surprised no drunk or despondent guests...haven't yet leaped to their death from the upper levels.\n\nDo yourselves a kindness....book your Las Vegas stay at a different property.
