I'm a sucker for popcorn, so when I saw a \"now open\" banner along with the \"My Popcorn Kitchen\" sign today, my car swerved around the parking lot and grabbed a spot right in front.  I swear, it was out of my control!\n\nIt turns out, today was the first day this adorable little popcorn\/candy shop was open... so lucky me, I get FTR (first to review)!\n\nKim Brush, the owner, was front and center, and welcomed me as I walked in.  She also had a team of people working there that I assume were all training.  They were friendly although it was obvious that I was one of the first customers, so it took longer than necessary to package up my small bag of kettle corn.  The customer before me appeared to have been waiting awhile on her large bag of Puppy Chow (which looked pretty amazing).  The kettle corn I ordered was just the right balance of sweet and salty.  I had to dig deep to exercise my self-control and not demolish the entire bag in one sitting!\n\nI took a menu to go as well, and now as I look at it, I can't wait to go back to try more of the unique gourmet popcorn flavors.  Not only do they have the basics (Buttery and Low Salt), but they have all kinds of savory flavors including several different cheeses, Dill Pickle, Salt & Vinegar, and Southwest Jalapeno.  If you're more of a Caramel person, they've got you covered as well, and of course there are a rainbow of Fruity Delights and Decadent Chocolate flavors too!  Popcorn Bags come in all sizes from Mini to Party and range in price from $1 to $149.95.  You can also order tins, boxes, and\/or pots of popcorn and this place ships anywhere in the U.S.A.\n\nCongrats on your Grand Opening, My Popcorn Kitchen.  Let the popcorn parties begin!
