I usually go to MGM Grand quite often when I find myself in Vegas.  Not for the overpriced food and definitely not to get to see the lions that rarely ever come out from their little habitat there.  It's to take money from the tourists on the poker tables.\n\nMGM opened their new poker room about a few years back (I was there) and it's probably one of the nicer rooms IMHO.  For starters, the room is right in the smack dab middle of the hotel and is quite spacious and roomy.  The tables are spread out enough so that you don't feel like sardines like you do over at the Bellagio poker room.  On popular club nights, you can check out the hot ladies all dolled up walking to Studio 54 which is the hotel's club.  But most importantly for some reason, a lot of fish tend to throw their money away at the MGM and I've been there many a time to catch them.  \n\nAs far as restaurants go, there are quite a few places to go within the MGM. Wolfgang pucks, Wichcraft, Diego's for fine dine Mexican and the list goes on and on.  There's even a food court if you feel like a quick slice of pizza of Mickie D's and of course there's the buffet, but theirs is nothing to write home about.\n\nThe hotel casino hotel over all is decent but I consider it 2nd tier to all the nicer ones like the Venetian, Bellagio and the Wynn for example.  Still that doesn't mean I don't stay here once in awhile when they send me free rooms in the mail.\n\nVan The Man's Must Do : Watch Cirque De Solei \"KA\"
