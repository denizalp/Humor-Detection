I wish this was still Fazio's, the old grocery store that once occupied this building. I was once an avid supporter of government organizations and unions. I have changed my tune after working for the government and a union. The people that work here have no respect for their customers. They act like Steven Seagal Above the Law or they just hopped up out of the trash can a la Oscar the Grouch. Don't think you cannot be fired. It is no surprise that more people are using companies like FedEx to get the job done. The level of disrespect and incompetence is at level red, severe.
