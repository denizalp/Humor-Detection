Truly one of my FAVORITE Yelp events yet! \n\nThe night started with some cocktails from Tanzy's robust cocktail menu, live music and yummy appetizers. The fresh mozzarella, charred bread and bruschetta were all phenomenal. I peeked at the full menu and I cant wait to try literally everything on their menu.\n\nJust when I thought it couldn't get any better we headed into our private Yelp theater for the viewing of First Man. I was completely blown away by the pods (so cute for date nights!) and recliner leather seats. The team at iPic were so genuinely nice they had placed a blanket, pillow, seasonal cocktail and cookies at our seats. I gotta say.. those cookies may have been the highlight of my night. The customer service and attentiveness definitely puts iPic and Tanzy over the top. \n\nThe movie was awesome and I can see why Tanzy and iPic are so popular. I will definitely be back for more dinner, drinks and a movie. Thank you so much to Hailey and her team for planning this one and the awesome staff at iPic for setting this up! It was a great night!
