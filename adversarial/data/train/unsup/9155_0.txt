I have to say that Ivan Kane is losing his street cred in my book. Forty Deuce used to have such a great reputation for sexy entertainment, and exclusivity in both Los Angeles and Las Vegas. Nowadays it seems as though they just let any Joe Shmo off the street come into the club, and the FD located in Mandalay Bay is a perfect example. After taking the tram from Excalibur to MB we walked through the hotel and casino to find that there was no line for Forty Deuce, and no cover on a Thursday night (score), which probably was the reason why there were so many doucebags up in the club. The music was a great mix of 90s hip-hop and contemporary rock, funk and more hip-hop. After waiting for a drink at what must be the smallest bar in all of Las Vegas we took a few laps around the place and I was surprised at how small the club actually was. We waited for what seemed like an hour before the live entertainment started. The stage wraps around 2 walls, has stairs that descend on to the stage with a drum kit posted up in the corner. The band that accompanied the vocal tracks was great, especially the drummer and bassist. The dancers were on point, and put on a really great performance, albeit short, but they most definitely got the crowd going dancing to songs like, 'Another one bites the dust' by Queen, which was a stand out for me and what I have decided would be my signature stripper song if I am ever to fulfill my lifelong dream of becoming one. I have a long way to go on the South Beach diet before that dream comes true. I love the concept of Forty Deuce, but the delivery is a bit weak in my opinion, especially for a modern burlesque show in Sin City. Three solid stars, are however totally warranted.
