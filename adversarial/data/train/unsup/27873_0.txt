I have a love\/not love relationship with Monty's. I used to love them for b-fast when I ate omlets. Now that I'm vegan, it's kinda hard to love them. Many of the items can't be changed, so if you're not a fan of onions or even allergic to them, they can't come out of items because they are pre-made in batches. They are my last ditch place to go to if Lazy Jane's, The Green Owl or any other place is busy or closed.
