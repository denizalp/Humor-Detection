I did not see many pears on the menu, and it is a bit large to be a \"bistro\" but I will not hold that against you.\n\nThe menu is full of salads, melted cheese sandwiches and pasta, there are several interesting asps too and a few local beers.\n\nThe decor inside is a bit eclectic as this space has leftovers of it's predecessors.\n\nA nice feature of the menu here is that most dishes here are vegetarian friendly, then meat, or fish can be added for a few $ more. \n\nI oped for the \"Athena's garden\" A pesto linguine with a few veggies in it. It was light despite having a fair amount of oil. We also tried a salad that was well assembled and fresh. \n\nThe real winner for me was the creamy mushroom Marsala, There was cream but not an excess just enough to coat the pasta, The caramelized ions gave it a deep rich flavor and the mushrooms added to the textural delight. \n\nIf you are in the area and want a nice, good meal at a new local place give PPB a try.
