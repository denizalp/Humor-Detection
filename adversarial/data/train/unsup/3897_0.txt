Was hoping for something great but didn't even get mediocre. Have been twice and assumed the first bad experience was due to them being new. The service was really bad the first time but improved the second, slightly. The food also improved to barely average at best. Keep in mind we ended up at McDonalds after the first visit because even the kids didn't like their meal. Both trips they were out of multiple menu items. Cocktails list is creative but not executed well. Both of our drinks were very weak and not what we expected. Best part of our visit was listening to the staff argue in the kitchen about what it takes to run a restaurant. Don't waste your time or money.
