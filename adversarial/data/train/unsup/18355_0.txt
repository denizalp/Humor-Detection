I think Popped might be my new favorite place for a quick yummy snack savory or sweet! Who would have ever known that popcorn can be so delicious with so many different flavors?! I walked down here during my lunch break thinking that it was going to be packed, but luckily there was only a few of us there so the waut was not long.\n\nYou can ask for the flavors that you want to try and I've been eying the Salt and Vinegar since reading reviews last night. Jose gave me a sample to try of the S & V and the dill pickle since that was his favorite. I favored the S&V more, but the dill pickle wasn't bad. I asked him which sweet one he recommended and he said cookies and cream or the smores. Both sounded delicious, but I ended up getting the cookies and cream for the husband along with the Marilyn Monroe (White Chocolate with Coconut!). \n\nA cool concept for a cool snack! I know I will be back with their frequent stamper card to try the Smores if not some other flavor like Dirty Vegas! \n\nI was also won over by their use of an Ipad as the register\/credit card machine!\n\nPS. Today is National Popcorn Day! Get some popcorn at Popped today!
