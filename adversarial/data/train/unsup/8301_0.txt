I'm surprised by reviews honestly because it's basically gas station ice cream with more selection.  That flavor is very chemical and fake and I can buy better elsewhere easily and even a grocery store really.  At least they are able to keep it at a great temp but could just use better ingredients.\n\nI'm sorry but banana ice cream shouldn't be yellow - something which is my best hack to figuring our which gelato places in italy were worth a visit even if you don't buy banana as it tells you who uses the real bananas.\n\nThe lines certainly are long and it's close to the river so that's probably the reason it's so popular.   \n\nHonestly,  I wouldn't really go there again unless I was bribing a kid and that was the closest place.
