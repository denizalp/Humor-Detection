If you're visiting Montreal, Cafe Touski is a unique and delicious place to eat. It's down to earth, alternative, and friendly. \n\nAnd the food is pretty good too! I went for Brunch. The portions were generous and really tasty.\n\nThere's a huge back yard space to sit with a garden, picnic tables, and big trees. Inside is a mix between cafe and restaurant with some over stuffed chairs thrown among the tables. Certainly not the fanciest d√©cor, but that's what makes comfortable. It's relaxed and more like a community place than a restaurant  because it's run by a worker's collective. Next time I'm in MTL I'll definitely be coming back.
