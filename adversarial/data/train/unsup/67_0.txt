I went to the 1st Street SW Calgary location. The staff were less than friendly. Nothing was explained to me. I had \"mink\" extensions applied. \n\nThe next day I noticed they were poking & scratching & uncomfortable. I assumed this was normal, since Lola Lash didn't tell me otherwise. I also noticed there were no lashes on the corners of my eyes, the lashes, although long, were sparse & went every which way - some leaned to the left, some to the right, & some went down instead of up. \n\nI did some research 2 weeks after having my \"mink\" extensions poorly applied at Lola Lash Bar, drove 45 minutes to Live, Love! Lashe! in Airdrie in blinding snow to have the botched job fixed. Carolyn took the time to give me a real education on lash extensions before painstakingly removing the wonky lashes, replacing them PROPERLY with silk lashes, filling in the many \"bald\" spots & applying corner lashes. It took her over 90 minutes to fix Lola Lash's botched job!  It cost me $110 & over 3 hours of my time. \n\nNeedless to say, I won't be going back to Lola Lash Bar!!!  I'll gladly make the trip out to Airdrie to get beautiful, comfortable, professional results from Carolyn at Live, Love, Lashe! \n\nI cannot in good conscience recommend anyone go to the terribly unprofessional Lola Lash Bar.
