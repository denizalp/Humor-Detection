A bit of background information- I ate at Wing Lei a couple months ago and ever since then, the restaurant is now headed by executive chef Ming Yu.  There was a slight change in staffing, one that I'm not particularly fond of.\n\nAfter being to several fine dining restaurants in Las Vegas and other parts of the countries, I've noticed that it's quite difficult to find a ridiculously stunning Chinese restaurant.  For example, there's a reason why you don't find French fast-food.  It's just not built that way.\n\nAnyways, me and a client of mine went to Wing Lei with reservations, and we ordered the carpaccio and the potstickers for appetizers.  They were fine- they tasted fine and not as bold in flavor as other Chinese restaurants, so I don't think they were worth the money that you pay for.\n\nAs far as the main course goes, they were pretty good- even though the menu items are similar (if not the same) to other items you see at regular Chinese restaurants, you can tell the difference in taste.  Where the appetizers lack, the main course dishes compensate in terms of the strength in flavor.\n\nIf you went to a Chinese restaurant off the strip with chefs who DIDN'T go to cooking school and learned recipes straight from the mainland, you'll notice a difference in taste because when a dish is spicy, it's SPICY, or when it's sweet, you taste the sugar.  At Wing Lei, it's a little toned down because it's catered to tourist, but you can still notice the small distinctions of the dishes, like the sauce used in their General Tsao chicken and shiitake mushrooms used in their braised tofu dish.\n\nI think that if you wanted a fancy Chinese restaurant with all the decor and all the service- this is certainly the place to take a date on.  This is NOT the place to take a large family with children.  As far as food goes, you can find other Chinese restaurants off-strip, or Pan-Asian cuisine that is loads better than Wing Lei.
