Was having a bad day so needed to get myself a treat.  Enter Marshmallow Latte ($6+tax) from Bulldog Coffee.  Shortly after drinking it, everything seems right in the world. A unique drink you won't find anywhere, martini glass is filled with marshmallows and drizzled with chocolate sauce and a shot of espresso. Not overly sweet (provided you don't finish the marshmallows) and pretty with the torched marshmallows.\n\nStuart the owner, is such a sweet guy and always smiling.  You can tell how passionate he is about his coffee place. Prices are reasonable and justifies the drink cost.  Can't wait to come back and try their rainbow latte.
