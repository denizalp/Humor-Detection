Diana is absolutely my most trusted source for not only my health care but our own patients who we refer to her! I drive 35 miles once a week to have her balance me with her magical arsenal of acupuncture, Reiki, aromatherapy and customized blends of Western and Chinese herbs. \nIt's my escape from daily stress and as a practitioner myself  I need to have the best, most competent herbalist and acupuncturist to take care of ME....so I can give my best to my own patients! \nYou instantly exhale when you enter her tranquil waiting room and leave even more relaxed and centered. She is extremely caring and passionate about her work and her clients.\n\nAnyone with any stress needs to consider Bright Path as a corrective and maintenance therapy for better health.\n\nDr. D
