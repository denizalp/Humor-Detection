I will and forever have a soft spot for TIABI. When they first opened, I LOVED the welcoming vibe the owners gave me and my friends. They stopped by our table and shared with us that they were UNLV alums (go rebels!) and friends who decided to open up this cute spot together!\n\nSince their opening, I've tried plenty of their menu items. With my go to being the West Coast. It's savory and refreshing (thanks to the avocado). Other notable favorites include Kisses and the Red Velvet Waffle for those with a sweet tooth.\n\nThe only thing about this place is that you never know what to expect with service. There are times when it would be swift, friendly, and efficient. You are going to be welcomed with a bright smile from the cashier and get your order in a reasonable time. But there are times when you are greeted with a blank, cold stare as if you've obviously interrupted them with their cleaning and get your order after a longer than usual wait.\n\nDo yourself a favor and if you are return guest, do a call-in order. You wouldn't wait as long and you have more time to eat and less stressing.
