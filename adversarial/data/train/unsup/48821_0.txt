Went here with the hubby and normally we enjoy this place..but something changed. The food was not very good at all. I had the ribs..they lacked flavor and sauce.\nHubby had the sirloin and it was stringy and blah..his words.\nThe blooming onion was good but thats it.\nWe wont be coming to Outback again..
