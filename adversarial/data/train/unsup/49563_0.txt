This is the place I would go if I was a nurse from Hillcrest.  It's small, good music on the juke, decent food, and has a lot of fun potential.  Yeah, I know the Fox and Hound is right across the street but I'd settle for a heavy hand and scratch off lottery \/ KENO before fuzzy butt, loud, obnoxious, can't hear the person next to me, kind of madness you get at the Fox.  Don't get me wrong, there's a time and place for everything, but M-W I'll take CNB over FNH any day.\n\nBack to the food.  I've had the pizza, burger once, steak sandwich once, and wings, all I've enjoyed and a good price.  Parking could be a little better seeing I drive a F150 but I'll find a spot and pony up to the bar for a drink and wings again soon.\n\nThe owner is usually there too which is always nice to see.   Darts and a dance floor are also there for you to enjoy.  Check out the pics http:\/\/www.cork-n-bottle.com\/index.htm.
