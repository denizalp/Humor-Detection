I went to see this show during the week and I had a good time.  Most of her music is for the older set, but there were some younger people in the audience.  \n\nShe started with a number of songs from Xanadu and then transitioned to some country and western (a bit twangy but tolerable).  There were some songs that I hadn't heard before which is always good.  She ended with a medley of songs from Grease--not my favorite movie nor group of songs.  There was an audience sing-a-long with her and then more with her back up singers while she went off stage to change for her final numbers.  The concert ended with a real favorite song of mine--Peter Allen's \"I really Love You.\"\n\nThe band is excellent and the singers with are are very good, too!  I was a bit disappointed to see three monitors at different spots on the stage with lyrics scrolling by.  I guess it's just a safety feature in case she might get stuck on remembering the lyrics to a particular song.  At least it wasn't scrolling when she was talking about her career or parts of her life.\n\nI think the show is over-priced but nostalgia sells.  It's not a show I'd see a second time but I had a good evening and her voice is still quite nice!
