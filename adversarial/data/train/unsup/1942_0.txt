Stay away!! The promise of 3 day and two night stay will cost you more than most of the hotels on the strip, all they ever seem to want is cash, this concerns me, and we should have let then!!!  Please don't waste your time. Full of false promises and a grinding sales pitch, passing you from one sales man to another, you will come out 3-4 hours later, angry and exasperated!! R U N as fast as you can in the other direction, we will never get the 3 hours, and 70.00 for promised show tickets back!!
