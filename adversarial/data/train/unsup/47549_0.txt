This chipotle has very slow service and it is consistently gotten worse since web ordering has been implemented. The staff appear to care more about the web orders than the 40+ people waiting in line. Specifically on December 19 I waited 30 minutes in line (I could have had faster service at a sit down restaurant) and saw 3 people walk out because of the slow service. I don't usually write negative reviews, but this is the fourth time this has happened. It has become so bad that I don't want to come here anymore. The food is great, but the service is bad enough to make we want to stay away. Something with the processing of catering and online ordering needs to change or they will likely lose more customers.
