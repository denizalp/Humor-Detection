The place is small and the selection of books is miniscule at best. They are always out of most everything I am looking for. It stinks like old cigarettes and it is a hang-out for the homeless. (I can't really blame them though at least there is AC). They're closed Sundays and Mondays. There is a security guard patrolling. \n\nOne star because it is a library. One star because they have books. That is all.
