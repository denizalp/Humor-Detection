In Response To The Owner: Swirls is swirls, I don't care how many towels or colors you have, it is only a $10 car wash. Do you think I would make something up and waste 15 mins to write a review? Do not tell me there are three steps. I know what I'm doing okay? And actually you missed the most important step which is the prep, you have to clay it before polishing. I just did not mention all the steps I did. First, I washed my car. Second, I clayed my whole car. Third, I used V36 cutting polish with medium cutting pad from Chemical Guys. Forth, I used V38 finishing final polish with a light polishing pad. Finally, I put carnauba paste wax on my car. As far as complaints, do you think I would still let you guys touch my car after all the swirl marks and scratches you did to my car? No, THANK YOU. I headed home and spent hours polishing them out. I use a dual action polisher, and professionals only use dual action polisher or rotary polisher. High speed buffer? Do you mean the ones you can buy in Walmart or AutoZone? I will upload the result and the receipt to prove that I came today. Why would I make complaint? To let you guys fcuk up my car again? Or do you think I would want my $10 dollars back? Hell no, I do not even have time to argue with you guys to get my money back. $10 bought me a lesson, never be lazy to wash my own car ever again... Your standards may be high, but definitely not your workers. \n\n\nThey scratched my car not only swirl but also real scratch they bend the cable of the air blower on my car. And you may ask, how could you know if those weren't there before they washed my car? Well, I just polished my car two days ago using two step polish, I removed all the swirls, I know what I'm doing and it is a 2015 car! They are okay if you want to polish your car after they wash it.
