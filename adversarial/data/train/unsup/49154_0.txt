If you're ever hungry late at night, you can always count on Perfect as it's open 24hours.  Dined here at midnight with my friends and ordered five dishes.  The food here is standard compared to other Chinese restaurants.  They usually give free soup and red bean for dessert when you order \"family style\".  However they ran out that night when we dined in.
