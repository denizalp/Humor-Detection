I absolutely love the chocolate double fromage cake they are so good that I can have the whole thing by myself!\n\nI like their cheesecake as well but I think I will need to do a side by side blind tasting of uncle tetsu and cheese garden to see if I love which one more.\n\nI'm lining up for the 50% off matcha tiramisu.. it was good but is it worth the $12 not at all. \n\nThe cheesiness from the cakes and the tarts are just so good. Sometime I feel like that cake just melts in your mouth when you take a bite!
