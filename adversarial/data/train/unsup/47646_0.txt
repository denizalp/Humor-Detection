I had a really great experience here. It had been a while since I had been threaded. I am really picky when it comes to threading. I am very sensitive, so I need someone that can go fast and do it right. I also like to have the correct shape for my eyebrows.  Farida was very experienced she was fast, knew how to do the correct shape and knew when I needed her to stop so I could have a quick break. I also had no little bumps afterwards, which sometimes you get from less experienced threaders. Relaxing atmosphere, very friendly, quick and good pricing. I would recommend Farida for all your threading needs.
