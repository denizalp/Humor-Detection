I heart burritos that are the size of my dogs head, therefore, I love Chipotle! I am not a huge chain restaurant kinda chick but Chipotle is top notch for when I'm looking for a burrito. I love that they only offer burrito, salads and tacos and you aren't in menu overload and their barbacoa is just delish, I seriously don't know how they make it so tasty. Top that sucker with some beans, cheese and sour cream and I am all set. The place is very clean, modern and staff is quick to make a burrito and always so sweet. Another plus, they were playing The Killers when I went in this past time. Burrito and Brandon Flowers?? Bring it!\n\nAlso,  I don't know what they do to their soda but their Coca-Cola rivals McDonalds which has the best Coca-Cola in the world!!
