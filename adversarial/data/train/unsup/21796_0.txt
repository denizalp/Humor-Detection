This pizza is the shit.\n\nCafe Porta Alba is one of only thirty of so places in the United States recognized as serving authentic Neapolitan style pizza, certainly the only pizzeria in Madison to boast such a stat. San Marzano style tomatoes, bufala mozzarella cheese sourced from Italy, and dough that's hand-pressed with Italian flour, Cafe Porta Alba is the real deal. \n\nThe quality of this stuff makes it for sure one of my favorite pizza spots in town, if not the favorite. \n\nWe ordered the Quattro Formaggi (fresh mozzarella, parmigiano, fontina, gorgonzola, basil) and the Vomero (roasted peppers, soppressata, fresh mozzarella, crushed tomatoes, parmigiano). Both were of course killer, but I rank the Quattro Formaggi above the other. I'm biased towards white pizzas though. Both pizzas flaunted their fresh made mozzarella, and boy was that heaven. \n\nHaving scanned through Yelp photos prior to our visit, we decided that no matter how full we were from the initial pizzas, trying the Nutella Pizza for dessert was necessary. And indeed it was. That Nutella Pizza was out of bounds. It is unquestionably one of the best things I've eaten in Madison and anywhere. A generous helping of the chocolate hazelnut spread is lathered on between two homemade portions of dough and prepared in their wood-burning oven, just as the other pizzas were. The cappuccino gelato we asked to be served a top this concoction took this guy to even greater heights. \n\nBoth the savory and the sweet, this is pizza that I dream about; and at one bite, you will too.
