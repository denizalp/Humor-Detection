STAY AWAY FROM THIS COSTCO!! I'M SERIOUS! \n\nNow that I have hopefully scared away those who only read the first sentence, let me explain that this costco is usually empty, there is never a line for gas, check out, or even food.\n\nThey carry short rib, prime cuts of new york, filet, and ribeye, and serve a variety of fresh poke on Friday's and Saturday's.  Add that they are less than two miles from me in an abandoned strip mall and well, you can imagine why I want it kept as secret as possible.\n\nAgain, stay away! Leave local costcos for locals!
