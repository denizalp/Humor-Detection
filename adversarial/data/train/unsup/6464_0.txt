I could say I'm pretty jaded when it comes to Thai food, but that would give the wrong impression. I try to walk in to every restaurant with a completely open mind. Because more often than not, especially when using Yelp, I find myself pleasantly surprised. Also I think that our expectations can completely control our ultimate experience in every aspect of our lives, so going light on expectations is a sure fire way to enjoy life more. \n\nThat said, I am a little spoiled, coming from Portland Oregon, with our insanely good Thai food. And Le Thai did not disappoint. I was shepherded here by Nate M, the local Vegas CM, and thoroughly enjoyed my dinner. I sampled a few dishes and was impressed by all of them. They don't hold back on the spice level, the service is solid, the venue is cozy and vibrant, and the gin n' tonics are plenty strong. The menu does have a few interesting dishes I don't often see at your run-of-the-mill joints. And to top it all off, there's a Yelp check-in offer for a free hug. \n\nI saved my hug for the next visit.
