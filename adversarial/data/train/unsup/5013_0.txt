Whew! That's my first impression when I walked out of the show. I recommend watching this with your significant other, especially if you're in a \"what happens in vegas stays in vegas\" mood. \nIt definitely heightened the sexual tension in the room and they did a good job making everything look sexy. \nIt was HOT HOT HOT!
