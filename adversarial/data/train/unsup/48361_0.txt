We genuinely enjoyed our evening at Il Bosco, a tucked-away restaurant just off Shea and Scottsdale. The owner and staff were super friendly, the ambiance was what a good neighborhood restaurant should be (though so many aren't) and, of course, the food was great! We began with an appetizer plate of roasted brussel sprouts with mozzarella, an unexpected combination that really works! We then had the Joanna pizza, a fantastic, wood-oven, thin-crust sausage and pepperoni that had great flavor and crust. For dessert, the days special was a lemon sorbetto, packed into a real lemon, a perfect ending. I should also mention the great music selection which added quite a bit to the flavor of the evening. I'm already looking forward to the next visit!
