The buffet was okay... It reminded me of an Old Country Buffet plus crab legs. The selection was not very surprising or large. Online it said that the buffet was max $3, but they charged us $40.99 each. $88 for an average buffet was not worth my time or money... Very disappointed and I wish I could get my money back...
