I went to this AMC years ago and took it off my list of places to see a movie - and then they remodeled - and wow did they remodel!\n\nNow there are amazing seats, and a bar in the complex. This has become my go to place for a movie. I do not really have any complaints. Did I mention the new seats? Nice cushy seats that recline deep and electronically. Very nice and contributes to a good experience. \n\nThe only complain I have is that the popcorn is ridiculously expensive, Sure popcorn is expensive at theaters, but not this expensive. I mean seriously $8.00 for a Large popcorn is ludicrous. This might be my only complaint.
