I really want to give Dr. Levins five stars, because he's a superb doctor. \n\nWithout digging too far into my medical history, I've seen Dr. Levins for a number of conditions, including a handful of serious allergies that I hadn't suffered from until moving to Arizona. He's prescribed medication when needed and follows up with regular appointments to ensure that I am a healthy patient.\n\nAs my PCP, Dr. Levins has referred me to a number of specialists for my various injuries, illnesses, and other unnamed maladies, including: an allergist, a urologist, two physical therapists, a dermatologist, a radiologist and a medical clinic.\n\nWith regard to his bedside manner, Dr. Levins is second to none. Although he sees hundreds of patients per week, I always feel that he personally cares about my health.\n\nI'm giving Dr. Levins a less-than-perfect rating solely because the reception in his office is mildly abominable, and unfortunately, that is not an exaggeration. I won't go on a tirade about how people in professional settings should put on their big boy and big girl pants and fake a smile in client-facing roles...\n\nHowever, one receptionist in particular always seems to have a problem with the world and greets every patient with barely bridled contempt. It's really off-putting, and if I didn't like Dr. Levins so much I'd tell this lady to shove it out her ear.
