Did not disappoint. Best tacos I've ever had got sure. You can taste all the freshness in it. I add the Baja fish and my friend has the grenador or something like that. But we're streaming hot and amazingly flavourful. Our orders were finished so fast but quality was definitely not lacking. I've never experienced so many different flavours that harmonize so well between a tortilla. It's was crunchy and moist and tangy and savory and streaming and refreshing. Getting hungry just thinking about it.
