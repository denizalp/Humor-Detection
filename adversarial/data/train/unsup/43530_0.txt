Ran into this restaurant while I was searching for dinner in the Cosmopolitan late at night. I enjoyed the fresh seafood here! The octopus had great flavor and a nice chewy texture. The Milos Special (fried zucchini, eggplant tzatziki & kefalograviera cheese) was a unique dish that is definitely a must try. The fried calamari was fried to perfection and made for an amazing appetizer. I recommend sharing a fish for large parties!\n\nPresentation wasn't amazing, but our servers were very friendly and helpful. The great thing about Estiatorio Milos is that it opens until 12am on Saturdays and Sundays. Arriving in Vegas late at night, my group was able to grab a table at 11:30pm and have a satisfying, clean meal with excellent service.
