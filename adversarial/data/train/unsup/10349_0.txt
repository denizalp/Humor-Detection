I went into this store last week to purchase some firearms and ammunition. I only ended up buying some ammunition and a few accessories. I am a local 6 year carrying CCW holder. I felt the staff was incredibly unhelpful and wasn't taking the time to go through or educate me on the firearms I was inquiring about.They did not have any of the firearms I was interested in purchasing. When finishing my purchase of ammunition, the cashier took a copy of my driver's license, without my permission. When I confronted the man he made me feel very uncomfortable for asking him to destroy it. All around, it was a terrible experience and I wouldn't recommend anyone I know to shop here.
