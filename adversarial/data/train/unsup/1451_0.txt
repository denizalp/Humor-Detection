Notkins really knocks it out of the ballpark. Although the Expos moved back to the states, my friends and I wished this restaurant followed them. Notkins was a serendipitous discovery since it is located across the street from the Courtyard Marriott that we were staying at. The oysters are fresh, the fish and chips are enjoyable, and we wished the lobster burger was bigger. The atmosphere is a little classier rather than casual.
