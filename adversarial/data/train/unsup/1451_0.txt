Great coffee. Problem is, they won't make it the way you want it. If you like your espresso long, they'll refuse to do it. Ask them why and they'll tell you their standards forbid it. I'd say the best standard is to allow customers to order their coffee the way they prefer to drink it. I didn't ask for caramel sauce or sprinkles. In my estimation a long espresso is a pretty nice afternoon beverage. Fortunately there are tons of places that will do me the curtesy of preparing an espresso to my crazy standards!
