EVERYTHING IS GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOOD on purpose -  Not real sure what all the fuss is about this place.  It is an average place.  nothing stood out except that they purposely use genetically modified ingredients, they never use anything organic on purpose. everything you eat in here is genetically modified per the manager who does not believe in organic food...the orange juice is fresh squeezed so what we fresh squeeze our own o.j. daily and tastes the same as here...do not use the pancake syrup on the table it is not made by butters, per the waitress and the manager is it store bought with high fructose corn syrup and a little bit of maple then transferred into their own bottles...I did not like the fact if you want regular 100% maple syrup they will charge you $1.00 for it...which is unheard of...according to Chris the manager, if we gave away the really expensive healthy maple syrup they we would have to raise the prices...which is basically incorrect...I have never been in a restaurants which charge for pure maple syrup and the prices of other places are less expensive than butter's...The manager Chris needs help, his opinions about GMO being healthy and good for you are ignorant.. as well as him thinking they are too good to offer customers coupons...\n\nWe will not be back to this place, the food was just okay nothing fancy and certainly not healthy with all genetically modified ingredients..avoid
