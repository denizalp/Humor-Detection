fantastic for purists, NIRVANA for culinary adventurists. MUST HAVE RESERVATION.\n\n(note: first-visit-only impression)\n--tuna sashimi, best in class. absolutely top.\n--salmon sashimi, just doesn't get much better unless it's still wiggling.\n--yellowtail sashimi, wonderful variety of texture, even in a single bite.\n--don't even think of going without a reservation; you'll be on the patio (parking lot)  otherwise.\n--didn't bring my platinum card this time; could easily rack up $600 next time (but if you're an adventurist, it's the best thing going without a trip through Sky Harbor)\n--service this visit was horrifying, could be a fluke.\n\nSince I had no reservation and was on the patio after a bit of a fuss, and with the tiki torches blowing their smoky fumes and ash in our general direction, I was not prepared to make the investment that this place demands. It could also have been when the giant pink Mary Kay Cadillac pulled up; not even the Caddy keys could get them a table.\n\nNot going after service misses 'cause the runner really tried hard to make up for the mistakes. I'll hope for five stars next time when I take my Amex Platinum.
