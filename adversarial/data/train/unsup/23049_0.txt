I will not be returning to the grand cafe @ green valley ranch. When we first arrived we were told there were 2 parties ahead of us. There were plenty of open tables visible. They should staff better for Sunday breakfast. \nOnce we were seated we waited 15 mins before the server even approached our table. It took her another 10 mins to bring us waters. Considering they weren't extremely busy it took forever for them to bring our food. Its breakfast it doesn't take that long. \nThen to polish the whole experience off, when I went to go pay for the check I was not acknowledged I wait to wait for the server to get their change before the cashier even acknowledged me. There was no sense of urgency during my whole experience there. I will not be returning.
