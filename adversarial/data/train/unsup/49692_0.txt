Service was absolutely horrible, one of the slowest I've ever experienced!!! Our waitress was uninformed about the menu items and it took us over 45 min to get our food. Only good thing was the pop tarts (which were even still a bit too sweet)  and the bacon bourbon Bloody Mary. Needless to say, not going back any time soon (or ever).
