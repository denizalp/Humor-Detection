I am not usually mislead from my fellow yelpers, but both my husband and I were disappointed with this visit..\n\nLike other reviews, there is no signage for the place. It is actually labeled the Park Pub(?) if I remember correctly.. When we walked in, the place was empty except for one person at the bar and another couple eating at a table. \n\nWe walked to the back to order. The waitress was friendly and gave us some recommendations. I ordered the farm house burger and my husband ordered the stacker(?) and added grilled mushrooms. We also ordered the buffalo garlic wings to start.\n\nFor no one being there (the girl at the bar was actually the bar tender and the couple eating had left shortly after we ordered) the service was molasses. Once the wings came out, they were pretty tasty. The burgers came out as we were finishing the wings. The burger and fries looked good, but something was off. I didn't really like the bun (hubby did), the egg was greasy, the bacon was pretty limp, and the burger over all was bland. The French fries were just ok. I've had worse, but I've also had better. The place over all smelled like old fryer grease which was also a big turn off.\n\n2 stars? Yeah, the wings were decent, but the service was slow, the bar tender was inattentive, place had a greasy smell, and the burger just wasn't good.
