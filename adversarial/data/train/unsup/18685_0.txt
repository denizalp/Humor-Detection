We decided to try out this place about 8:00 on Saturday Night. There was a Gyro special listed outside for $5.99 and we were planning on getting Gyro's as it was so we were excited. We come in to a very unwelcoming, dingy dining area with an order counter in the back. The TV was on to some awful news station, and was clearly turned up so the person working could hear it. We could hear little else. Two other students were standing there and a laptop was plugged into the ceiling. Not a great start.\n\nAfter waiting close to 5 minutes at the counter - guessing that the cook was the only one there and that he must be working on the two students order - he finally came over to see us. To say the guy working had a bad attitude is being kind. We told him we wanted the $5.99 Gyro special and a couple of fries. Should have been $16 dollars - he proceeded to charge us $18+ for the Gyro and fries listed on the menu. I told him we wanted the special and he just argued with us. Between his accent and the loud TV, I could barely make out what he was saying - except that the fact that he was going to over charge us if we wanted Gyros and fries. Based on his business and atmosphere, we were guessing we could be his last customer and just paid the extra $2. By this point, I just wanted to leave. \n\nI'm not sure really how this place is in business. Most people wouldn't stay after walking in and the long wait to order. Being overcharged and argued with would have turned away anyone who made it that far. I do have to say that the Gyro wasn't too bad tasting though. The fries were a bit over done but not terrible.\n\nI can't say we will ever go back. . . one star is for not getting sick from eating the food.
