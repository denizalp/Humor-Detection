After reading the reviews here on yelp my friend and I went to Cora to eat breakfast\/brunch.\nWe ordered Waffle Strawberry Mountain and Crepes with Nutella and Banana. It tasted really good!\nThey give a huge portion, which could be split between 2 persons because otherwise, you will probably get a stomach ace. Good service, its an old childhood feeling being there with all of the designs (old cereal packages and so).
