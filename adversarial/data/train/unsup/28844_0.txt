Quite concerned about stars this company has been receiving. Not only did we receive poor customer service, but we were also faced with the company's inability to comply with its contractual obligations, unsatisfactory and partial performance by its employee (Kevin), and the company's inability to provide relief to damages caused to the property by the employee. This company does not deserve the praise that they have been receiving and this should serve as a warning to those considering using its services. Legal action will be taken in order to recover damages.
