The soup base was good. The noodles were good. Overall, the meal was good. I really like how you can customize your bowl of noodle soup. I got the Korean noodles and spam and brisket toppings with Malay soup base. It was delicious.\n\nPrice is comparable to pho or other ramen shops so it's not like you are doing something more expensive than usual. This place can add variety to your diet or restaurant choices!\n\nI like that there were TVs and I was able to watch the games. Although the service was a little lacking. There weren't any servers. More like there were a bunch of college kids hanging out and they happened to be also bringing food and water to you and pretending to be servers.\n\nOh yeah, they should also mark on their menu what is spicy and what is not. Too bad they don't so beware!
