This establishment has finally pressed on my last nerve.  I was appalled today by the way the owner treated my friend and our two 1 year old boys.  We came in to get a coffee and escape the rain.  Our first impression was friendly and we received our coffee and muffin without any delay.  It was when we turned around to take a seat that we were told we couldn't sit there as we were in the way of the counter and furthermore we had ordered take away coffees.  We were surprised and sputtered that we weren't staying for very long.  Fine fine she said.  We sat down and pulled out some snacks for the little ones and began to drink our coffee.  At this point she snapped at us that we were not allowed to bring any outside food and beverage into her restaurant as it is against Alberta health services.  In fact we can't bring in our own water.  This was news to me!  We asked to have our coffees returned since we obviously weren't welcome and she said of course not because we had taken a sip of our drink.  It was then that we left and let her know that we wouldn't be back as her customer service is beyond undesirable.  I am disappointed that the owner chooses to treat her customers this way.  I will drive out of my way to get coffee from now on.
