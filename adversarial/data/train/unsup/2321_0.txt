Pretty close to New York Italian that's I've had so far since we moved here. Looks like a typical neighborhood joint. I believe the waiter's name was Jess and he was awesome. He was knowledgeable and had great suggestions on the food that he thinks that we would've liked, from what we told him. It was Monday and they offer a \"Buy a bottle, get a free bottle of wine\". It was a great deal. We ordered stuffed mushrooms and they were very simple with what I think was an Alfredo sauce. They were good, nothing to write home about. We were given the typical bread basket, which had the BEST BREAD WE'VE HAD HERE SINCE WE MOVED FROM New York! It was warm and crispy and soft inside, great texture and the butter was soft, not like a fuckin rock, which is the way it normally comes. They also give you a little dish of cannelloni bean salad. It's beans with tomatoes, red onions, and a nice dressing of olive and vinegar. Delicious with that bread!! So, we both had veal dishes. Mine was Piccata and it came with potatoes. Frank had the Marsala. Let me say, the veal was nicely pounded thin and like butter!!! Didn't need a knife. My piccata sauce was Devine! It was buttery and winey and tangy. My potatoes were perfectly roasted and were crispy and creamy inside. Frank's veal was just as tender, but the rest of the dish lacked flavor. It would've been great if it had more salt or garlic or if the sauce had more Marsala. Overall, we enjoyed it and we'd definitely be back. Id love to try their pasta next time. It felt like home and who doesn't wanna go home again?! Bon appetito! Honestly I don't know what anyone else is talking about as far as the prices being high. The prices in this place you're not high at all for the quality of the food and it is delicious believe me when I tell you I am from New York!!
