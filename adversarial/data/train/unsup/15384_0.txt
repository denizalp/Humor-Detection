Most people do not expect to find decent sushi in a landlocked city, especially one that is more renowned for things that are...well, not sushi. I was certainly part of that demographic, and was only drawn to Soho by their Happy Hour menu, which boasted over 30 small plates for $5 each, along with over a dozen drink specials.\n\nWith that many options, I also couldn't help wonder if it was one of those \"quantity over quality\" type of deals, but I had faith in the exceedingly positive Yelp reviews, which were absolutely on point!\n\nA few Happy Hour dishes and infused sakes later, the other menu items started to look more and more enticing (who could resist the allure of Hokkaido uni?!). We ended up venturing beyond the HH menu, adding several nigiri sushi, Kumamoto oysters, and the Firefly Squid to our order. I'm all about trying new fish and got to try akamutsu (black sea perch) sushi for the first time!\n\nExcellent food at reasonable prices, friendly and attentive service, plus a fantastic happy hour are all hallmarks of the Soho experience. I will definitely be returning on my next sojourn in Vegas.\n\nTLDR: One of the best Happy Hours I've had, and the regular menu delivers some pretty solid sushi as well! Don't forget to make a reservation or be prepared to wait.
