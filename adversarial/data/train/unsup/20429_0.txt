I went here as a staycation on New Years of this year. I could have had a free room at the Plaza but I chose here since the room included tickets for the Fremont Street celebration and I've always wanted to stay at what everyone says is the nicest place downtown. I was disappointed. The room was run down. The bed was an adjustsble mattress but it wouldn't flatten all the way, they offered zero discounts to any of their facilities, there was no view and the walls were thin so you could here every word of your neighbors. We had coffee in the room but they did not refill it on the second day. There was a mini fridge which was nice.\n\nI'll stick with the less expensive more recently renovated properties.
