I've been living in Boston for a few months where the Mexican food is terrible. I figured if they couldn't get it right, there was no way Canada could. But this place delivered. \n\nI got a chicken burrito. The chicken was well seasoned. I don't normally like brown rice but it was pretty good as well. I loved that they offered chopped green peppers and that special sauce made the whole burrito. \n\nThis place gets my California stamp of approval. Good meats, fresh salsas, I wish we had one in Boston!
