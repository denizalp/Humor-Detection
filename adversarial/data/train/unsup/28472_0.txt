Yes I like this place. There margaritas are for real none of this play stuff. It was half price happy hour on them on a Saturday! We also had an early dinner with house made Doritas ,they tasted like porkies with a corn after taste, first one free and each additional one buck! The menu wasn't to large and our waitress Rosalind was very nice with advise on her favorites which made ordering easy! A nice place to return to!!
