This is my first Yelp review, and I'm usually quite lazy about things like this, but I believe Dr. Perez deserves to be recognized.  As a physician myself, I am very particular about whom I see for health care.  \n\nPrior to moving to Arizona, I was affiliated with University hospitals, and saw only physicians I personally knew to be excellent, often leaders in their fields.  However, after moving to AZ awhile back, I did not have the connections or the knowledge of the local health care professionals to afford me this luxury.\n\nI found Dr. Perez to be the epitome of professionalism both in terms of competence and bedside manner.   \n\nHis office, internet portal, and staff are all top notch, which I consider secondary to competence and bedside manner, but it sure makes things more pleasant.\n\nI arrived 2 hours early for my appointment due to my own mistake, and I was fit in between patients within 15 minutes.  Despite this, my visit with Dr. Perez was thorough, which is difficult these days given the time restraints primary care physicians often face.\n\n\n5 stars all the way.
