This bar is one of the most chill spots I have been to. As a regular, it is nice to go somewhere that knows what they're doing. The place is clean, food is good, and bartenders are awesome. Issac in particular makes me want to go back time and time again.  He is so personable and knows his drinks. Also, he is eye candy for the ladies.
