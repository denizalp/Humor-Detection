Checking out all the Vegas area breweries requires a trip out to Henderson for sure. They really paid attention to the design of this tap room. Before you reach the bar in the back, you'll be greeted by a Super Nintendo and a dart board. There's also shuffleboard of some sort in the back. There is plenty of seating in varying heights available in the spacious, yet cozy confines. The details are mostly dark wood and gray. In keeping with the dark theme of most area bars it would seem appropriate. It's a place I could see myself spending lots of time if the beer was any good.\n\nTheir taster tray is a custom designed round sampler with holes for each beer. I appreciate the work put into this along with the rest of the taproom. \n\nEither it was an off day for my palate or their beer wasn't any good. I was playing the \"guessing game\" with my honey. When it came to their IPA called Hoppy Times, I couldn't even detect any hops aroma, nor flavor. Bad name or bad beer? You decide. The Ace in the Hole was just plain nasty. Who puts basil in a beer? Okay, Bison does, but they do it well. \n\nTheir Gutshot \"dry Irish stout\" was okay, decent, not great. Considering I'm a fan of the dark beers, that's probably an insult. However when I got to the Morning Payoff, described as an Imperial Breakfast Stout, my interest was piqued as to their brewing prowess. The coffee flavor punched me in the face harder than the Top Dollar Machine at The Wynn did my wallet. This beer I would come back for. All others need some work.\n\nIf I'm going to drive to Henderson during our Vegas vacations, I'll stop off at CraftHaus before Bad Beat every day of the week.
