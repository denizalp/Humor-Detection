Excellent location, delicious food, and good service... What else would you like?... We had the risotto as an appetizer and the duck and pork chops as main dish... I still don't know which one was better!!.. The dessert was really good as well and the wine was great!... There was not one thing that do not deserve the 5 stars. I think this should be one of the top 5 restaurants in Calgary!
