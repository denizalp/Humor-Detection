I work right across the street so its easy to go for lunch. I usually eat the hot deli area(The buffet looking) not the \"ready to order\" (which ill mention as well). Anyways, After 7:30 pm its $2 for two diff foods, rice\/fried rice\/ noodles and bowl of soup(Hot and sour or Egg drop) lunch plate special. I go very often so the supervisor and most of the worker know me by now and \"Hook it up\" lol but I stick mainly to orange chicken(when its crispy),beef and broccolli , curry chicken and potatoes(when it was actual bone in chicken) and sweet sour pork(again when crispy looking). All of those choices are best tasting and better looking, plus just reheat 30 secs in the microwave for a \"fresher taste\". \n\nThe steam rice is good, fried rice is ok and lo mein noodles are a little oily so that why i stick to the steam rice. Now the Soups are really good too, the egg drop actually has egg and tons of it but my favorite is the hot and sour soup which tastes like tamarind which i like with some tofu. Also their Egg rolls are the shit!! I dont like egg rolls but these are really good and crispy plus the sauce that comes with it is great as well.\n\nI occasionally have Boba(Bubble tea) when im tired for quick pick me up and I ussually get the original or mango which is my fav. Its satisfies my craving for sweet and thirst at the same time, all in all its really good stuff.\n\nNow the ready to order menu is expansive but ill tell ya my favorites which the manager loves as well.I have the sweet rice w\/ chinese sausage but I tell them to add curry sauce to the mix , it tastes amazing with it!!! I also have the beef pasta cake which is nothing like it sounds, think of an empanada with mince meat inside but softer and crispier shell, its a great starter. I just recently had the Beef noodle soup with egg noodles instead of the traditional and it was great. It was hot , temperature wise and spicy, flavor wise. Very filling and none of the flavors were overpowering. All in all its a great store with friendly deli people.\n\n\nLastly just wanted to add since im latino and have had \"JUMEX\" all my life, they have a great selection of can juice of mango and guava from hawaii and philipines which a lady said make the best juice. I was not dissapointed at all. Very flavorful and nutritious. Also, the bakery is really great too, I have had the coconut custard which looks like a white \"flan\" but its delicious and also the meat\/sweet buns are great as well.
