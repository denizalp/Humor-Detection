I came here after work around 1230am. The store was pretty empty and aisles were being restocked...all of which I prefer when grocery shopping.  The store itself is a little dated and could use some remodeling and love. \n\nWhile shopping, I was walking down the pasta aisle looking for what I needed and surprise! A HUGE rat scurried across the aisle from one side to the other and disappeared under the shelving. Yeah no. I left my cart and walked out as quickly as I could without running. I will never be back here ever again.  Who knows what product these rodents are getting into. And who knows how many make this Albertsons their home. Ewww
