We really enjoy this place. They serve the good ole greasy style New York pizza that you can't seem to find any where else in Arizona. \n\nYou are not going to get southern hospitality here but service is good and consistent. The guys in the kitchen are great with my son wanting to watch them cook pizza. He stand up on the seat and looks over the wall at them. I don't encourage this but what do you do when the cook is handing him pepperoni to eat. :)
