I went here with my friend to pick out her dream dress. Brooke was extremely helpful and I really feel like she listened to what my friend wanted and didn't push her own agenda like some of the other stores we went to previously in the day. I really would recommend this boutique for a fabulous experience, and if you go, request Brooke!
