I was referred to this place by a friend from Thailand.  It is super good and I have been going there ever since.  My favorites if  you want to try them are Chicken Panage  Curry and Yum Neau (#17).  I like it spicy but you can adjust that to your taste.  Dessert would be sticky rice with mango and coconut ice cream, Yum!
