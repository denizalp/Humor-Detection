I decided to treat myself to lunch at Toast today, on my day off. As usual, I was not disappointed.\n\nToast has a mac and cheese special every day, and I noticed that today's mac and cheese was made with penne pasta, ground beef, bacon, caramelized onions, boursin cheese and gruyere cheese. I was curious, but hesitant- and I'll tell you why. I find that mac and cheese is either very good or very bad. Well, maybe not always VERY bad, but let's say less than satisfying. I find that too often it is often too dry and bogged down with melted cheese. Rarely do I find a mac and cheese that is creamy enough for my taste. This one was. Also, it was not served in a casserole dish, which I find sometimes makes it too dry. This was served more like a pasta entr√©e. Calling it mac and cheese is almost doing it a disservice. It was delicious. The ground beef was tasty, the bacon was a nice touch, and the cheese was nice and creamy. At the end of my meal, I was satisfied and full and yet I still wanted more! Possibly the best macaroni and cheese I have ever had. Certainly the best I've had in a very long time. It was served with roasted veggies which I was not as pleased with because they were on the bland side. It would have helped if they'd been cut a little thicker and seasoned more. But it wasn't a huge deal. The mac and cheese was the star, and it was divine. The sweet tea, by the way, is also damn good at Toast, and they kept my glass full. \n\nOn the whole, another fine meal from the nice folks at Toast.
