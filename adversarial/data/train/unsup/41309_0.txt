the good...4 stars for the food, the ambiance, free champagne and free entrance to Playboy club\nnot 5 stars for the service, the wine price and noise\n\nIt was a party of 7 people. We had 3 bottles of wine and food...total $1000 gratuity included.\nI have to say, the ribeye, porterhouse were out of this world. everything else was good but overpriced. The wine was way too expensive. Service was horrible. we had 3 diferrent waiters that did not seem to know the wine list or wine at all...pretty sad for the money we paid. \nIt was really hard to hear the waiters and they had a hard time understand what was going on. It was just too loud and i don't mind noise.\n\nThey overcharged us so we bithed about it and got a free bottle of champagen s that was good. we even got free admittance for 7 to the Palyboy club...that in itself was priceless.\n\nWe enede up getting a pretty good deal but we were lucky...
