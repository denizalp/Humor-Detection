I don't like giving one star reviews to establishments as I always give the place a benefit if the doubt, but for this place I wouldn't think twice.  This review is based solely on my experience for takeout\/pick up.  \nOur boss (a doctor)  asked if we can order takeout from Thai Bistro for a party of 5. One of the girls at work called and she was trying to place an order.  The man on the other end of the line was abrupt and borderline rude to her,  when she asked how many pieces of spring rolls in each order.  He hang up the phone on her.  So I called,  and again introduced myself,  saying that I'm calling from a doctors office and would like to order for pick up.  He then asked me,` were you the one who called earlier'?   I said, ' it was my office mate and apparently you hung up on her.' he said 'she doesn't know what she's talking about.'  so I let it pass and proceeded to order,  then he interrupted me by saying,  'you know I'm just taking this order because he's a doctor (referring to my boss).  I though I misheard him,  or must be difficulty with the language.  So I asked him to repeat what he said. He said' I'm taking this order only because he's a doctor. ' to which I replied, ' so if I call to order,  and I'm not a doctor,  just a regular person,  wouldn't you take my order?  His reply was a flat ' No.' so I told him,  ' that's blatant discrimination,  and I refuse to give you business from now on.  I'd rather give the business to someone who knows the meaning of customer service', and I hang up on him this time.
