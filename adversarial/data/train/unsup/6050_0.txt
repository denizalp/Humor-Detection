I chilled at Am√©lie's for almost an hour enjoying a latte and some macarons and some internet. It's a super busy place but they keep it nicely organized with signs pointing folks to the end of the queue and where to drop off dirty dishes. I like that they have the transponder doo-dads so that the folks bringing food to the table don't have to hunt around. Clever stuff.\n\nNice restaurant with tables inside and out.\n\nBathroom could use a bit of help though. It was clean, just a little beat up.
