\"Pizza is like Sex...no matter how bad it is, its still pretty darn good!\" -Unknown\/Everybody\n\nI won't lie: this is truly the worst slice of pizza I've ever eaten...Dijouro, Frescheta, and Pizza Rolls are better.\n\nHowever, its cheap and completely satisfying if you're drunk, as my wife and I were when we staggered in here after concluding another fun night dancing and drinking with the Yelp Spring Breakers at Vanguard Lounge...which is just across the street.  I wouldn't eat here sober.
