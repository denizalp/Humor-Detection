Fellow Yelpers I'll make it short & sweet!!\nBEST DAY SPA in Vegas - period.  End of discussion.\nI've tried virtually all day spas in LV & the Encore Spa is (dollar for $ - $40) the most posh & comfortable.  Here is the recommended cycle:\n1) standing walk-in waterfall shower - 6 to choose from - just stand under the waterfall & watch your stress disappear \n2) steam room - big hot & the perfect way to start your spa day - be sure to close the door behind you so not to let out a bit of that beautifully hot steam\n3) dry sauna - grab a iced hand towel for ur head & put some cucumber slices on your eyes to address your puffy eyelids & to minimize your hangover \n4) whirlpool bath - soak in one of two perfectly configure rectangular pools with tile partitions between jets - each pool sits 6-8 comfortably \n5) cold plunge pool - cold but bearable\n6) colder plunge pool - grit your teeth & take the plunge\n7) hot stone\/tile lounge chair- stretch out - relax and\/or nap to the tune of some calming Hey spa music\n\nRepeat the process \n\nINSIDER TIP 1 - Check out the serenity room for short nap on one of 12 comfy leather chaise loungers \nINSIDER TIP 2 - ask attendants for complimentary cranberry grapefruit drink - very refreshing \n\nHope this helps!!
