If I would have rated this place when I first started coming here for my brazilian, I would have given them a 2 star rating.  They used to have snobby receptionists working the front, and they made it very obvious that you were judged then talked about when you left. My hubby had caught them in the act one day, as he sat waiting for me.  He said they snickered and whispered to each other everytime a customer left.   And back in those dark days, you could have a 'reservation' and still be made to wait for awhile.  But, they did do a good job and I had purchased a package deal, so I kept returning.\n\nFast forward a couple years later....\n\n I have noticed a gradual change. They have very very much improved in customer service.  Thank goodness!  The snobbery was getting old and I was looking to their new location in Happy Valley. They are more professional now, and they don't seem to be judging or talking about you.  If they are, well, they are at least being discreet about it.  I no longer see the side long glances to each other and smirks on their faces. My appointments have been been on time.  And if I had to wait, it was never longer than 5 minutes.\n\nThe estheticians here are efficient at what they do. Its what kept me here.  They are 5 stars.  I used to get my brazilians done at salons or specialy wax parlours, and sometimes they take up to 35 minutes with maximum pain.  That is 35 mins of exposing my lovely thing to some poor girls face, and then a rip here and hot wax there....and ouch!   Here, I am done in 10 mins with little to no pain.  They are friendly and make the whole thing as comfortable as a wax can possibly get.
