I enjoyed my Alchemy experience so much I've been twice in the past week....despite the cold and rain I had to walk through!  Not only is it a great bar, but the food is amazing...so much better than the average bar food you'll find at other places.  We've brought out of town friends here a couple of times so far and everyone thinks it is great!  Last night I had the hanger steak with rosemary red wine reduction and blue cheese....SO GOOD I've been craving that dish ever since.  The atmosphere is great-with the mirrors it looks much better than it really is but it has the cozy local feel that make you want to come again and again.  I'm really glad I found a new local spot to return to again and again!\n\n#yelpnewvember
