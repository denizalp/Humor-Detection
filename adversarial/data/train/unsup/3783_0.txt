You know the old saying \"Not your Grandfather's this, not your grandfather's that? Well this is your grandfather's restaurant. Basic fifties place with wood paneling, sconces, large light fixtures, ugly carpeting, and a menu without nuance. Steaks, chops, chilled salads (mixture of iceberg, an olive or two, maybe a half a hard boiled egg, purple onion, and a way too heavy salad dressing) and other fifties style entrees. Typical South Hills restaurant, sad and old.
