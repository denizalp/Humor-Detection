The first time I came to this store was right after my husband and I bought our house.  We were doing some pre-move in work and starving.  This was the closest grocery store.  We dragged our tired, filthy asses in looking for something that required no plates, no utensils, and no effort.  When we walked in, it was like a bright light washed over us as the angels began to sing.  I could get away with never turning on my stove again.\n\nWhat should I choose?  Chinese food from the little place in front (I can never remember it's name, but the food is pretty good), a wood-fired pizza (not bad for the price), Mexican food (also not bad-HUGE burritos with your choice of fillings), something from the hot deli perhaps (pork tenderloin, salmon, roasted chicken??).  I wiped a tear from the corner of my eye at the possibilities all in one location.\n\nWe gleefully skipped to our car, giddy with eating something other than 99 cent menu items from Jack in the Box that week.  And though it was June, our car was not 145 degrees because they have covered parking too!
