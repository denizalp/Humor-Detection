The LDV Wine Gallery is just what downtown Scottsdale needed.  wonderful patio, interesting gallery, and great wine.  I picked up some of the flavored sugars and Balsamic vinegar for my \"foodie\" friends, and LDV wine for my clients holiday \"thank you for your business.\"  The Syrah was a huge hit last year, and now there a great white varietal as well.  Lawrence Dunham Vineyards is a great ambassador for the quality of Arizona wines, and as an AZ native, that makes me extra happy.  A great place to just relax a bit during the day, and perfect location for tasting a flight before dinner in Scottsdale.
