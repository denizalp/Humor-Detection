Ambiance:\n-Typical of a JA.\nServer:\n-Not able to provide details on their menu.\n-Forgot to bring drinks.\n-Mixed up the food order once.\nFood Quality:\n-Quality and flavour of the meats was good, not great.\n-I'm not sure about the drinks as the server completely forgot about them, and we decided to go for drinks elsewhere.
