I ordered the sweet potato crepe because it sounded interesting but unfortunately it tasted ONE NOTE. I ate about 1\/4 of it had enough sweet potato pur√©e, thanks. They need to add some fruits to this because it's boring AF to eat, no variety or texture to the dish. On the bright side, I liked the sweet potato ice cream and my friend's turkey crepe was good.\n\nFyi: Don't order the sweet potato latte, it's weird. It's white and looks kind of like congee. It has a weird consistency that makes you feels like you're drinking potato soup. Would not recommend, I mean, unless you're into that.
