I'm not sure there are enough superlatives to describe this restaurant. \n\nWe celebrated my parents' 40th wedding anniversary here, and every dish that our large party chose was incredible. My handmade cannelloni with spinach, ricotta, and veal were the best I have ever had. Scallops, ravioli, veal, lobster... everything was incredible. The hardest part was fending off everyone else who wanted to try my dinner! \n\nDefinitely definitely try the (homemade) cookies-n-cream-esque gelato and the creamy (homemade) limoncello - both were tremendous!  \n\nOn top of the food, the service was efficient and friendly. Plus, the owners graciously spent time with us, which was a really nice touch to celebrate my parents. \n\nParking was the only challenge, as it is on a narrow side street. \n\nA real find!
