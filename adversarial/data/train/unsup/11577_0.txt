The hype is what makes this place going. But the truth is...this place is garbage! The food was shockingly not good. Like the most random menu. No flow whatsoever. The service was unfavorable to say the least. The girl in the front with the really big hair was rude and made us feel very uncomfortable. She even showed up to our table while we were eating to let us know that there was another group of people coming in over an hours time and that she wanted to move us to a smaller table to accomadate a group of 5. I found this to be  very unproffesional and awkward. The music was way to low you couldnt even here a beat. We had 5 different waiters and had to repeat our orders because of this issue. The crowd is w.e mostly ppl are coming to see what the hype is all about...just to be dissapointed. I thought susur lee being involved was going to make the menu an epic experience but it turned out to be an epic fail. The floor plan & decor was nothing special, the decor is like really basic and less then mediocre. The only thing i liked was the alcohol selection louis etc.. the only reason im giving it a one star was because their moms meat balls were actually pretty damn good and the bartender who was 1 out of the 5 waiters who served us, made a really nice drink for us. In addition to all the above, the prices are not acceptable for the shit they serve. Ill pay for quality not over priced garbage that has been hyped on social media.  So would i recommend it? Hell no. Would i go back? Hellllllll naawwwww
