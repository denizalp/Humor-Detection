i have been going to AZ art supply for awhile now. never really put much thought into the store. the selections of supplies are good, they have rows for each type of supply you might need. i can usually walk in and find what i need and be on my way. i still get a student discount even if i'm no longer a student. who am i to complain about that right? i was buying supplies FOR a student, so i guess it really still counts. now why is this not a 5 star review? well i silkscreen, and the silkscreening supplies are dismal, not a whole lot to offer me, and the prices are allot higher then Dick Blick, which is usually where i will pick up supplies because it is more affordable. yes i know supporting your local business keeps the money local, i've read the flyer a few times, but sometimes i need to get the most for my money, especially in these trying times. but if i cannot wait to have something shipped to me, yup for sure i will head to AZ art supply instead of some craft whore like Michael's
