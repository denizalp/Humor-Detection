Some co workers and I came to this chili's 25 minutes b4 close for a beer, and we were poorly greeted by 2 stank faces behind the bar and an uninviting welcome! Once our server approached us asking for food orders before they close, we told her we were servers as well and can tell we aren't wanted here and we'll go. She insisted for us to stay--so we all got a beer. Unfortunately while enjoying our beer, a couple came in and sat at the bar ---where they were NOT greeted whatsoever,  the bartender KNOWINGLY didn't acknowledge them at all for 5+ minutes so they left! I cringe seeing such bad customer service when i pride myself with exceptional customer service! I'm surprised this chilis is still open, it deserves 1 star and you can thank your horrible staff
