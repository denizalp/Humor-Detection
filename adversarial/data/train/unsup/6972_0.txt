My wife brought home a box after waiting 1 hour in line. Excuse me if I jack this up, because I will... But she brought home 3 canollis, 1 brownie, 1 lobster tail, 1 crumb cake.\n\nI wasn't impressed.\n\nCanollis- 3\/5\nBrownie- 3\/5\nLobster tail- 3\/5\nCrumb cake- 4\/5\n\nI'm glad she took the initiative to wait because if I did I would've been pretty upset.  Instead I came home from work, took a bite from each one and said .... \"Meh!\"
