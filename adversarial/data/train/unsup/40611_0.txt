From the reviews, we had to try the crispy kau chee, cold ginger chicken, and almond pressed duck. All delicious. The spot itself gave a SF hole in the wall feel that we like. Don't order the wine unless you like your wine sweet. Do get the salted duck egg and mix with your rice for added salty goodness. Worth the trip from the southside!
