I like Nandos it's a hidden gem. Yes the parking can be crazy, but in my opinion that's a GREAT sign. Gilbert isn't chock full of outstanding restaurants so this one certainly stands out. The service has always been tip top and you can't beat the portion size. I'm a fan of the chips and salsa and the margs. I've enjoyed most everything I've had on the menu. I often bring out of town guests here because strange as it seems it's really hard to get decent Mexican food in this area.
