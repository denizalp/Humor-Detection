If you're looking for a place to grab some beer and some amazing food to eat, I think this would be the place to go in DT Fremont. I came in around noon, there was n ok wait time. The bartenders were fast with orders. The only thing about this place is that it is a little bit on the pricey side. I mean, it is in downtown Fremont. It is worth it though. The Brussell sprouts with peanut and orange glaze was amazing.
