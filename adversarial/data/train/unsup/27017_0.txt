Top notch Mexican food just 20 minutes off the Vegas strip.  My lady and I were tired of the over priced and underwhelming options on the strip, so we swung out in the rental to hit a few desert parks on the outskirts on Vegas, hitting Juan's for dinner on the way back.\n\nJuan's did not disappoint.  We sat in bar area, as main dining area was full.  Waiter took drink orders immediately after we sat, then after offered good suggestions on the menu items. Another waiter brought a big bowl of chips with 3 different salsa, some melted cheese, some beans, a plate of fried onion, and a plate of nice hot peppers, a nice damn little meal by itself.\n\nAn appetizer of ranchers taco's was 6 excellent tortillas fried crispy filled with shrimp.  We both had Jalisco style platters, she had steak Monterey style, loaded with peppers. onions, and monterey cheese, myself the chicken poblano, a deep, dark mole sauce with sesame seeds.  Both came with a cup of soup, beans and rice and were more than ample sized, that we had take out to drop in the cooler for a morning snack in the desert.\n\nFairly priced, superior customer service by the wait staff and great portions of real hearty Mexican food and non watered down drinks make this a must stop anytime I am in the Vegas area.
