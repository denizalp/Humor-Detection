came into town one day after one of those \"lets go to vegas tomorrow!!!\" nights...\n\nluckily we had some friends that were locals, and they brought us to this quaint, yet sexy lil tapas spot right off the strip.\n\nFIREFLY.\n\nit was a saturday night, and it was busy.  we kicked it at the bar while waiting for a table.  finally got seated and was treated to a wide selection of tapas.  came here with a pretty good sized group so i got to sample a little bit of everything.  lets just say... lets just SAY... LETS JUST SAY EVERYTHING WAS DELISH!!!\n\na month later i was back in vegas, and guess where i took my friends...YOU GUESSED IT!\n\nto the massage parlor!!! jk... (ok half serious)\n\nbut before that we went to FIREFLY!!\n\npretty much just what i expected, excellent.
