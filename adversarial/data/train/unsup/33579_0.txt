My husband and I went in today to look around. We were offered help a few times which is amazing. After about 10 minutes of looking we accepted and just told them right away we were only looking and not buying. That didn't stop them from offering amazing customer service. Andrew was amazing. He gave us so much information on CCW's, 9mm and even shotguns. He was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. All the while knowing we weren't buying today. We will definitely be back to see him when we are ready to make a purchase. Great store and I liked that they offered so much information.
