Worst store in Pittsburgh for vaping. Sold me a disfunctional tank. Took back 2 days later, to swap out. Refused to give me a functional tank. They stated that if they knew it was broke they could return to distributor, but since I used it to discover it was disfunctional, they cannot take it back and that I need to deal with the vendor directly. Do yourself a favor and just buy your supplies direct from the vendor. It is about half the cost and it only takes about 48 hours to receive. Worst vape shop I've been to yet. \n\nAdditionally, I purchased another tank there a month prior. Needless to say I ran out of atomizers at some point. I have stopped in 3 weeks in a row; they still don't have them!
