I am beyond excited about this new discovery! I discovered this place last week and plan to go for the 3rd time already tomorrow. I am excited to be a regular here at this locally owned business. They are the definition of a 5 star spot! They go above and beyond with all that they do. The wine selection is good and very diverse. They even offer my FAVORITE red wine, Apothic, which I've never seen in a wine bar before. They also have fabulous, made in-house red and white sangria's. The spinach artichoke dip is the best I've ever had! And believe me when I say I've had my fair share of spinach artichoke dips. The atmosphere is exactly what I look for in a wine bar. I cannot wait until the weather cools down so I can spend more time on the amazing patio. I've only peeked but I can tell I will be in love in a few months from now. The service here is just as impressive! The bartender, Amy is so cute and such a sweetheart! She it also meticulous when she shines all of those glasses. Looks like a lot of work but she handles it with ease. This place is at the top of my list. I better be careful or I will be a wino in no time!!
