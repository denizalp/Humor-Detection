Just to add on to all the other great reviews, hell ya...this is it! You get your bang for your buck here.  \n\nThere are multiple locations on the strip. We made our first stop at the Planet Hollywood location and got discounted refills from the MGM.\n\nThe 190 Octane with an extra shot is enough to take a grown man down. (I know. I've seen it with my own eyes.) I ordered the 32oz Hurricane with an extra shot around 6 pm and ended up missing going to the club, and waking up in my hotel room at 2:30 in the morning wondering where my night went.
