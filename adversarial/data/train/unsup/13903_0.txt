Good Place to Grab a Sandwich \n\nThis was my first visit to \"Even Stevens\". I was greeted immediately and asked if I'd been there before. I replied 'no', and was given a menu and some suggestions.\n\nI ordered a Pot Roast Dip, salad, Brava Tots, and a drink.  My meal was just shy of $14.00, a little pricey, however,  for every sandwich ordered \"Even Stevens\" will donate one sandwich to the needy.\n\nMy meal arrived quickly.   The tots were good as was the sandwhich and salad. The sandwich, had a crunchy baguette, was flavorful and juicy, with plenty of pot roast. I am looking forward to visiting again and trying other menu items.
