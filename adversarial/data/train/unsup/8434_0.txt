As a Cali girl I'm use to Fudds being a restaurant.\n\nThis ISN'T a restaurant... \nThink high school\/CYO snack bar, They share a few tables with a couple other food court type places SBARRO was one.\n\nThis is Inside The Orleans casino, So cool points for that!\n\nSo enough about the place... The food was still good! We had veggie burgers, regular burgers, Steak fries, onion rings and fish&chips ALL GOOD the condiment bar and soda bar are really good...\n\nOur cashier (the one w the beautiful wedding rings) was amazingly sweet, helpful and kind to everyone she came into contact with. Thank you for that!!\n\nAnd thanks for the good food...\nEven in a snack bar setting!!
