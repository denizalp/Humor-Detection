The 'old vegas' showgirl costumes were stunning.  However,  the show was rubbish.  It's a horrible mash of butchered showgirl meets high school recital.  People were walking out halfway through.  If the old school Las Vegas Showgirl production is no longer popular ... this production will certainly kill it off for good.  What a shame.
