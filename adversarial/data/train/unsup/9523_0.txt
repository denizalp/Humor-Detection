You know how it is when you throw up a little in your mouth? That's the flavor of the Chicago-style sauce at Luciano's.  The crust was full of flour and flat. I seriously couldn't choke down more than the fist bite. It was the worst pizza I have ever eaten. The price, however, is reasonable. ;) And,as mentioned in the name, you can get a six pack to go. Maybe you should just pick up a six pack, and skip the darn pizza.
