I somehow get stuck going to this place every time a certain friend visits from out of town. Neither of us are vegetarian, but for some reason she loves it.\n\nThe place is crowded - tables are pushed together too closely on one side of the restaurant, making for awkward conversing since people at the next table are sitting 8 inches away from you. \n\nThe food is hit and miss. The portions suck, some of the \"baby\" bowls cost $10-$12 bucks and come with half a cup of noodles or rice with some beansprouts mixed in and a couple chunks of tofu and sauce. And $8 protein shakes...Really? Meh....\n\nI always stick to the Mediterranean platter which is falafel, hummus, pita, olives, tzatziki and some cucumber and tomato slices for $8. Much better deal. It tastes good. Their sweet potato fries are delicious too.  \n\nAs an added annoyance, it's always completely busy. Even Monday evening, we had to wait 25 minutes for a table. The food takes ages to come out too. The kitchen is busy cooking up a zillion take-out orders before getting to the in-house diners.\n\nI can handle vegetarian food but I'm glad I eat meat and don't need to depend on this place as one of my only dining-out options. \n\n2.5 stars
