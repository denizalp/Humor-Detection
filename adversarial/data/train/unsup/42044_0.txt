This was the worst experience we have ever had renting a car! I reserved a 2-door Camero over the phone, with Budget, after the website crashed. The guy on the phone mentioned NOTHING about needing a credit card for particular cars. We fly across the country to find that certain cars require you reserve them with a credit card!!! We spoke with the manager, who was the most useless waste of space, didn't help at all, and told us we could either have a 4-door camry (which doesn't require a credit card) or leave with nothing. We paid for a Camero and got a Camry. I called the main Budget number when we got home,  and they said there was nothing they could do to help us. Such a disappointment.  Don't waste your time with this company.
