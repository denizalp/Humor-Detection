My coworkers and I are here for a convention and came here for Dinner last night. \n\nOur waiters Scott and Adele were quick, attentive and really nice. \n\nWe have the pork belly dim sum as an appetizer, which was phenomenal! For my entree I had the hanger steak. For the price, I expected a bit more to it. When it says it includes carrots and peas, they meant one carrot and one pea :p But the steak was cooked perfectly ad tasted amazing. The rest of the group really enjoyed their dishes as well.  \n\nMargarita tasted good, but was a little weak, I stuck to beer after having one. Per my coworkers they had a great Pinot. \n\nHad a really nice time :)
