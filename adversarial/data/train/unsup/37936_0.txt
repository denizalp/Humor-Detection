I've been to this club twice. I always guest list so I don't really wait in line, but I did see that the lines got pretty long. \nThey play mostly hip-hop in this club unlike most clubs in vegas that play EDM. With that said the crowd here is mostly hip-hop fans.....\nThe drink prices are pretty standard $14. \nThere is an outdoor area but mostly only for people who reserve tables. \nThere are no spots to sit like at XS or Marquee.
