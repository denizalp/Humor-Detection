If you read my reviews, you know that I love my endless sushi.  \n\nYesterday, after a failed attempt to see a new movie, and a really long drive, we found ourselves at Champagne's for a drink, and REALLY hungry...so I pulled up the trusty Yelp app, searched for All you can Eat Sushi, and found Sakana.\n\nWith a four and a half star rating, and .5 miles from where we were, this was the winner for dinner.\n\nWe walked in, and they were not busy, just a couple tables of people.  \nWe chose to sit at the bar, to make things easier on ourselves.  \n\nThe menu was big, with items that I don't usually see in other places (like a few lobster options.  WHA?!)\n\nYesterday we had:\n\nGarlic Tuna\nSuper White\nCajun Albacore\nUnagi\nEbi\nSmoked Paprikia Salmon\nOcean Trout\nScallop\nThe X Man Hand roll\nTako (Octopus)\nA Lobster Nigiri roll (can't remember the name right now)\nA lobster and bacon skewer\nSeafood salad\nSpicy garlic edemame\nGyoza\nEgg Rolls\nSeaweed Salad\nMini Honey Toast\n\nSo, the really good:\nThe Garlic Tuna. \nFor me, this is just under the quality of Sumo Sushi's garlic tuna, which is the best I've ever had.  \nSakana's was AWESOME.  Super garlicky, moist, and HUGE.\n\nYeah, let me take a moment to discuss the portion sizes.\nRidiculous.  SO. MUCH. FISH.\nOn the one hand, I was thrilled about this.  The fish to rice ratio is amazing here.  Small amount of rice, TONS of fish.  \nOn the other hand...I was able to eat a lot less because the fish portion was basically doubled, so I hit my wall a lot faster than normal. \n\nAlso really good:  \nThe Lobster nigiri roll:  lobster and crab with a bit of cream cheese (I think) was lovely.  Even my fella liked it, and he's not a fan of cream cheese. \n\nThe Smoked Paprika Salmon: I'm not usually a fan of salmon sushi, but this had great flavor. \n\nThe Scallop:  I was really stuffed by the time I ate this, but I'm so glad I did.  Delicious tender scallops on rice wrapped in seaweed, topped with a tiny slice of lemon:  mmm. \n\nThe X Man hand roll: \nSoy paper, rice, beef and salsa, this was like a teriyaki burrito.  Fella didn't care for it, but I'd order it next time for sure.  Really tasty.\n\nThe Seafood salad:  Holy sashimi Batman!  TONS of fish, dicon radish, cucumbers, jalapenos...mmm.  and HUGE.    \n\nThe Mini Honey Toast:  I got excited when I saw this dessert.  A favorite of mine, Honey Toast isn't something I am able to have very often...this was incredible.  We ordered mine, and my fella doesn't usually do dessert...but after one bite of mine, he ordered his own!\n\nNow the good, but slightly different\/strange:\nThe Super White:  Fish was great, but they put screaming o sauce on it...for me, it took away a bit of the flavor of the fish, and my fella hated it.  \n\nThe Ebi:  Delicious, but the small lemon slices on top added just a bit too much to the shrimp.  It brightened the flavor, but was a touch too much. \n\nThe Unagi:  DELICIOUS...but I don't know if they just have a different eel sauce, but this was more of a ponzu sauce.  So it was good, but not what I was expecting. \n\nThe Ocean Trout:  Good fish, good flavor, but the toppings were just a little...salsa like for me.\n\nThe Cajun Albacore was a little weird, with a crunchy topping that I've never seen before. \n\nThe good\/Standard:\nSeaweed Salad\nGyoza\nEggrolls\nLobster and bacon skewer\nSpicy Garlic Edemame.  \n\nAll good, nothing spectacular or amazing.\n\nThe service here was on point.  Fast.  Friendly.  Everything you could ask for in a sushi restaurant, really.\n\nI will absolutely eat here again.  There are lots of things on the menu that I want to try that I didn't have room for yesterday. \n\nDInner is only $24.95, and apparently they have 2 for 1 sake and beer every day...I may try that out next time, since I didn't have a chance to yesterday.\n\nAll in all, a very good spot for endless sushi!
