Having been to japan I've tasted a lot of different kinds of ramen, so I came here with pretty low expectations. Of course you can't compare to Japan's, however Futobuta's ramen was alright. When I came my broth although deep in flavor, was not salty enough. Also they gave me siracha as a side to add to my ramen, no Chile oil, no sesame oil, or seasoning. For 14 dollars, I definitely did not get my money's worth in my opinion. The atmosphere is nice and it has a hipster-ish feel to the place, but ramen wise, I'll pass.
