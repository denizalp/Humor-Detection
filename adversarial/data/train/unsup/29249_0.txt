Dr. Pohlmann is wonderful.  After receiving less than mediocre care from Detroit Dover in Westlake, we sought out Dr. Pohlmann.  Her care is wonderful, she is not quick to medicate, she answers all questions, and she is so kind.  We will never leave her.  Their prices were also cheaper than Detroit Dover!
