I have used this pharmacy for years and never had a problem until recently, which prompted me to write this review.  The pharmacy staff was rude and didn't seem happy about even answering my question or helping me about an prescription for my daughter.  They seemed to even question why I was calling and just talked over the top of me.  I will definitely be switching pharmacies.  I have two small children and can't risk them messing up medications.
