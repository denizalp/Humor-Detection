Stayed there for a year only because of the cheap rates. The area is nasty, but never had problems in the park. In the summer time, we got alot of sewer smell in our spot (pretty nasty) eventually they tried to remedy it, but right before we left last week, the sewer smell came back as the day heated up. We ended up leaving 4 days earlier than planned. We did not get a refund for those days although they had already rented out the spot!! Can you say double dipping.
