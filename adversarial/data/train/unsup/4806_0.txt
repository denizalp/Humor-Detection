HORRIBLE!! did not get scared at all, no one did and it was a group of six! there are no characters, probably one or two throughout the whole thing. i was very disappointed. we drove from milwaukee so a hour and a half. definitely not worth it!! check other places out because this one is just paying 12$ to walk around hills with a lighted pathway and nothing there to scare you. idk what the girl that gave it five stars is smoking because this was not and i repeat NOT a good experience at all.
