Hazy, dark, atmospheric to the point that it's pulpy. The bartender is razor sharp, affable, and no nonsense while still being congenial. Tiki statues litter the lounge, their wooden maws agape and their bulbous eyes in perpetual 1000 yard stares. There is something intangible that makes you feel at home, despite the extraterrestrial surroundings of Frankie's Tiki Room. \n\nDon't be fooled by the bright, innocuous looking drinks that zip and snap on your tongue; the cocktails may endorse the color wheel and taste of fruit and saccharine, but these syrupy concoctions will put your unsuspecting body in a headlock and repeatedly knee you in the eye socket. \n\nA couple of Zombies and a few Ninth Islands later and you'll find yourself talking to the wedge of pineapple planted on the rim of your glass. I think I even attempted to solve complicated math problems in front of my friends, after a few drinks, because I was convinced that I was John Nash. Later on, I figured out that I was simply doing simple addition. \n\nIf you're a louse that screams \"whoooo!\" after one drink, you should probably stick to the strip, but if you can maim your liver in style while not being a confrontational rebel rouser, spin the bottle on Frankie's the next time you're in town.
