Won't recommend this location. First, I asked for warm water but was served with warm water from the tap. The taste of the sizzling plate and mussels was the worst among the many locations I have been. The clams were smelly. Won't go back.\n\nFYI the management: the location is in Newmarket and the date is April 5 lunch.
