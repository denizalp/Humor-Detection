The last few times we ate here the service and food wasn't the best. Our orders seem to always get messed up. We decided to give it another chance tonight and I wish we didn't. Our waitress (Terrie) was horrible. We ordered soup and it took forever to come out. When we asked how much longer, her exact words were \"Every time I ask if it's ready she says that if it was ready it would be up.\" You'd think that soup would be the simplest thing on the menu but apparently not. We asked for a manager and he never stopped by our table. This was the last time we'll ever eat here.
