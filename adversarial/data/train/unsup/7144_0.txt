Great AYCE sushi place that is close to the Strip. Yama has great selection of rolls, nigiri, hand rolls, specialty rolls, side dishes, you name it!\n\nThe price really can't be beat; only $23.95 for dinner and $20.95 for lunch! That's right folks, pretty sweet deal alert here!\n\nCame here on a Friday evening around 630PM and the wait was.. horrible. Really bad. We ended up waiting about 50 minutes for a table for 3. Just be prepared.. really prepared. If you have a big party, they do take reservations so call in advance! The restaurant is very small and cramped but once you sit down, just sit back and prepare your stomachs. \n\nThe names of the specialty rolls are super full and suggestive. Some of our favorite rolls of the night included Sun on the Beach, Who's Your Daddy, Happy Endings and well, you get it. Very amusing names and there are just soooo many different rolls to choose from. TIP: You can get half rolls if you and your table just want to try a roll and see how you like it! Nigiri was also tasty and each order comes with 2 pieces. \n\nThe sides are also plentiful and delicious. I really enjoyed the agedashi tofu and the tempura was really fresh and crispy! Our table also shared the BBQ ribs (kalbi) and gyoza which were good as well. \n\nDessert was a choice of ice cream (green tea, red bean, etc) and mochi ice cream (vanilla, strawberry, mango and chocolate)!\n\nAll in all, great meal for a wonderful price. Everything was good quality and seriously, the price can't be beat for Vegas AYCE sushi!
