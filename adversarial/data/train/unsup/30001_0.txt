Overall things are fine. I have had a couple of treatments that I thought were to fast or not through. There are some very nice people that work there. I also feel that my laser treatment is not very effective. Intotal, I have had 4 treatments prior to Laser Away and 5 treatments at Laser Away. I have not noticed much difference in hair reduction since going to Laser Away.
