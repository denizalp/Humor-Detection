We ate here when we came to Vegas without much spending money. We really wanted to try it and it sounded like the best place to eat in the area. We ended up drinking water, eating the chips with the many dipping sauces and then splitting the Tamale Sampler. We felt bad for the waitress so we left you a nice tip. I could sense she was mentally rolling her eyes at us when she heard what we would have. Next time we will go all out! Everything was so yummy.
