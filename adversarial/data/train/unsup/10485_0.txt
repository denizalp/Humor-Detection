This location is clean and neat, the people at the front desk were professional and very helpful, and I felt comfortable (which is super important to anyone about to show off their birthday suit during a massage). The massause was definitely Massage Envy quality. I have yet to be disappointed in any of my massages at any of the Massage Envy locations. \n\nNote, they allow for tip on debit card if you are using your monthly massage, you dont have to make a purchase to use it.
