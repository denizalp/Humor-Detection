Wow. What a gem. Owners super nice and let us sample everything we wanted. Real fresh ingredients that you can taste in every bite. This is a place that you are so happy to find and will definitely be coming back to again and again. My wife got the sweet corn and also avocado, really unique flavors but really good.
