Tonight was the first time we ordered from wongs and the food tastes as nasty as the name!!! Anyone who says that they have good food must habe been raused on ramen noodles because not only did this food make me and my two kids ill, but it wad also garbage quality!\nWe had two bites of our meal before throwing it back in the box. I got ill almost instantly and when I called them, there \"manager\" was so rude and unprofessional, he told me that I need to go to the hospital and have the food tested and bring a doctors note to prove there fiod made us sick. \nThe quality of food is disgusting, as is the service. I should have listened to my instinct and not gotten food their as they are oporating out of an old building that was previously condemned!!! Lesson learned!
