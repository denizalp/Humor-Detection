This is a cute and independent plant-based restaurant with tasty food and a warm and friendly staff. We had the cauliflower chickpea tacos, house- made black bean burger, sweet potato fries, and garlic and lentils and they all were delicious and satisfying. This restaurant is a nice and cozy addition to the valley's other great vegan places, with indoor and outdoor seating, and easy parking.
