I would not order from this location again. The pizza delivered was not what I ordered. \"We ran out of your ordered size.\" So I got a different size with the right toppings, but wrong crust and it was cold. It seems more like they didn't want to make another, because the \"wings\" were a joke. A greasy pool of TINY chicken nuggets. Not at all what I ordered. Don't waste your money unless you can pick it up and verify you are getting what you paid for.
