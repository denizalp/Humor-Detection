Overall: Appetizers, drinks, ambience, and service were all thumbs up, but the taquito entrees fell flat. I may give this place another try if I am in the area. However, I have generally come to the conclusion that I personally don't like \"modern\" takes on ethnic food. Usually ethnic food is so amazing that it doesn't need to be dressed up, or doled out in small portions on fancy plates.\n\nFood: The guacamole with goat cheese was by far the best guacamole that I've had. Unfortunately, the taquitos were nothing special. Our table got the pork belly, wild boar, beef brisket, and shrimp taquitos. They all tasted good, but nothing particularly stood out in terms of bold flavor. The protein portions were also a bit small. \n\nDrinks: The margarita sampler was good. I had the blood orange, pomegranate, and cucumber flavors, which were all refreshing. They accidentally also gave us the red bell pepper, which I didn't care for (thats why I hadn't ordered it to begin with).  The samplers were much larger than I expected - about 6-7 ozs of liquid in each. There was also a fair amount of tequila in each.\n\nService: Our server was very friendly, and prompt with drink refills. The taquitos didn't come out until about an hour after we had been seated, but we had been warned beforehand that reservations were based on a 2-hr dining experience. It didn't bother us too much because we had the guacamole, margarita sampler, and good company to bide us over.\n\nAmbience: Modern and trendy, but intimate.
