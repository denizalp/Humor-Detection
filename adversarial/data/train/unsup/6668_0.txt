I love local businesses it hurts to give them an A-OK rating.  Service in the beginning was good when they were not swamp.  We waited for the rest of the party to arrive and when they got busy, it was tough to get the attention.  I had to ask for a refill several times.  And with the first group of friends walked in, she forgot my order.  I was trying to wave her down.  So I figure I will just order with the 2nd wave of friends.  I did and of course my order came out last.  But we did place an order in for more pita bread for our humus.  That took forever to get out.  I believe it is the size of our group (14) plus the place was busy.  \n\nThe humus and pita bread was great!  The base pizza with prosciutto was delicious.  Yes, I have been here before, hopefully it was a one time bad experience for me.
