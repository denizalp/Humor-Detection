My wife and I came down to Az for spring training and came here twice. Once for dinner and once for lunch. We had great food and great service. They give you garlic bread which is fresh and warm when you sit down. The bartender, male, not sure of his name, was so attentive when we ate at the bar the first night. He knew the regulars and poured their drinks as soon as they sat down as well as made us feel welcome and gave us speedy and kind service. Will definitely come back to this place next year for spring training. The only downfall is that the patrons are typical wealthy white republicans, which was slightly uncomfortable for us being a young lesbian couple from Oakland, ca.\nThe prices were very low by the way - great food and drink for the low price.
