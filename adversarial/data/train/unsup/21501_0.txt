We came to Made LV American Tavern for brunch and thoroughly enjoyed our visit.  The food was delicious, the service was fantastic, and the atmosphere was low key and mellow.  Perfect for our lazy weekend state of mind.\n\nWe were greeted as soon as we entered and seated promptly.  The space was mostly full, but there were a couple of open tables.  Our server, Gatsby- in addition to having a cool name- was so nice throughout our visit!  She stopped by right after we sat down to give us the scoop on the specials and the AYCD cocktails.  The manager also checked on us a couple of times during our meal.  \n\nWe got the bottomless mimosa $22 and Shandy $20, plus a couple of iced teas.  The mimosa was stronger than expected for an AYCD and very good.  I did not try the Shandy.\n\nCHICKEN CHILI $6.50- Amazing! 5\/5. It was a bit more like a stew, than a thick winter chili, but the flavor profile was complex and vibrant.  Not very spicy either.\n\nBACON CHEDDAR BISCUITS WITH HONEY SALT BUTTER $4.50- ours seemed a a little burnt, but they were still quite tasty and the butter is very good.\n\nBIG EASY BENEDICT $13.00- Delicious! 5\/5.  Country ham, eggs, and creole hollandaise on bacon cheddar biscuits.  Served with home fries.  The eggs were cooked perfectly and the twist on hollandaise sauce was fantastic.\n\nCLASSIC BREAKFAST $11.50- Very good 5\/5.  Pretty standard breakfast of two eggs, bacon, crispy potatoes, and grilled bread, but all items were prepared how I like them and tasted very good.  The roasted tomato chutney was outstanding. \n\nBAG OF DONUT HOLES $7.00- OMG!  The menu says that these warm orbs of heaven come with salted caramel sauce, but ours came with the most deliciously orgasmic blackberry jam that I could have just eaten with a spoon if I forgot I was in public.  So good!
