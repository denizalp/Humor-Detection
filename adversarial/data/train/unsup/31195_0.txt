One star as it's the lowest rating.   Ridiculous wait time and no explanation to the delay.   Arrived early thinking we can be seen sooner,boy was I wrong.   Waited 2hours on friday afternoon to find out the lady next to me is 30 minutes before me and she has not been seen by the doctor.   This is the worst facility I have ever been to.   I called in the same day for appointment.   Why in the world would they book me for the appointment when they are so behind?   This place don't care, they just want your money.  People, do not come to this office.   People are just slow in this office and lazy.
