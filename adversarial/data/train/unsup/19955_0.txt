This was just...  OK.  After hearing and reading so many great things about The Herb Box I was sure I would really enjoy it.  Well, no.  Not so much.  Especially disappointing because my Mom was with me during an all-too-brief visit to AZ, and I really wanted to take her somewhere great.  \n\nWe arrived around 1:30, purposefully avoiding the 'lunch rush'.  I thought this would be a good thing.  What we found was a disorganized and distracted staff and a lot of uncleared tables.  Once we were seated and given menus, we were pretty much abandoned for a good 10 minutes.  At last a couple of glasses of water arrived, but the waitress disappeared again before we could place our order.  She came in and out of the dining area, seating others and even taking their orders, but didn't acknowledge us until I was ready to A) fold the menu into a paper airplane and aim it at her head and B) leave.  Helloooooooooo????\n\nAt last we were able to order.  Hooray!  Wait, don't get excited yet, she didn't enter the orders into the terminal.  Oops.  When we finally received our food it was not exactly worth waiting that long for, either.  I had the Market Sunflower Salad and my mom had the Blackened Chicken Caesar Wrap.  While good, I don't think either dish warranted the $12 price tags.  It is lettuce and chicken, people.  Really.\n\nYes, the location is 'cute' and 'quaint'.  Yes the ingredients are fresh.  Perhaps if we had a different waitress I would have been happier.
