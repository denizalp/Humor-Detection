Going out is a treat for my husband and I. The beginning started off well with the interaction with the hostess's. We made a reservation and were sat immediately. After that it was all down hill. Our server skky was horrible!!! \n\n-forgot our water\n-forgot our straws\n-took our menus but forgot to take our orders\n-when we asked for silverware, dessert menu etc. she would NEVER come back with it\n\nFood-ok but not worth the prices. Happy hour maybe, but dinner, never again!
