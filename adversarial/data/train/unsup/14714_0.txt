The new owners of this cafe are very nice and they made it much better than it was. It is a small, pleasant place. The ambiance is clean and relaxing. Their dishes are tasty, prices aren't too high. Staff is nice and friendly, but the service is a little bit slow. I had to wait to place my order for about ten minutes. That was not a big deal for me,  I wasn't in a hurry, but if you don't have enough time you'll be nervous for sure.\nOverall, this is a good place to hang out if you are not busy and especially when it's too hot outside. You can have reasonably priced variety of drinks and desserts here. Will come back again.
