Really wasn't expecting anything spectacular as we got the buffet as part of a dinner\/show package. But the quality of the food was excellent.  The prime rib was really well done.  All you can eat crab legs alone made it worthwhile. The desserts were of a better quality than what we saw at the Paris buffet this morning.  Service was good.  At $20 apiece this was a great deal.
