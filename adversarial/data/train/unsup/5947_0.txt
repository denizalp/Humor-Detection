I love the food here, it's fresh, tasty and consistent. They have GF and lots of choices for picky eaters. Late morning you can get breakfast and lunch...which I like because I bring my church here once a month and everyone can have what they want. \n\nThe staff moves around from time to time to other locations, but they're all very customer service oriented. \n\nThis location especially is highly recommended! The dining room is large and there's outside seating too. Parking in front gets tight but there are plenty of spots nearby.
