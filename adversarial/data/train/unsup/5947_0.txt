Hey Folks! \n\nSave your money and time. This place was horrible. We went during happy hour and the oysters were not in a half shell. Some were broken shells... some were not schuck correctly; a mix and match of \"no attention to detail\". Some were the lids of the oyster. The California Rolls had fake crab.  The sushi chef was using a dull knife to cut his fish causing the rolls to be lopsided. \n\nWhen we finally got our check, the waitress splashed cocktail sauce on wife's white sweater. As humans we all make mistakes, but at least offer 5% off the bill or something. Humor me...\n\nI am embarrassed by this team. They have a lot of kinks to work out.\n\nWe will try you again, but it will be a while. Oh yeah, for a seafood place don't serve imitation crab in the soups and the sushi rolls. That tip is free!\n#lifehack #training #workharder #careaboutyourjob #comeonman!
