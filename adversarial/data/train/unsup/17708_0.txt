Popped by on Meatless Monday to check out Henderson's newest vegan-friendly spot. I've been to their other location on the East side and this one has the same menu but with a strip-mall location (instead of a food court). It's an upgrade in setting without an upgrade in pricing, which I can appreciate.\n\nThat said, while the menu has a variety of Asian noodle, soup, and sandwich choices with fake meat products, I was a little underwhelmed again. The sauces, like in the chicken curry, are solid, but all of their sandwiches are on bread that is so thick that it is offputting. Bahn mi aren't known for being packed with protein but when 80% of my bite is bread, I'm not a happy camper. The \"chicken\" they use here is not my favorite, the texture is a bit off, but I do enjoy their \"shrimp\". It's a great find for vegetarians and vegans but omnivores may not find much to like about this place.
