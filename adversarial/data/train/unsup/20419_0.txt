Got presale tickets for this spot a few months ago which also happened to be Alesso's birthday. The lines were pretty long as expected which meant it's best to show up early! \n\nI really didn't expect Alesso's set to be so amazing but he really went beyond my expectations. Having also attended EDC this year, I'd have to say his set would be ranked among one of the top performances.\n\nHaving been  here dozens of times, I have to say, it's still one of the goto spots every time we visit Vegas. This place is huge but usually goes beyond max occupancy if such a thing exists for Vegas nightclubs... The decor is awesome and it's probably a good idea to get a table here so you won't be so cramped with all the other patrons.\n\nPS: They have poker tables inside if you're in the mood to gamble while drunk.
