Stayed at this Hilton during my most recent work trip & have to say I was quite impressed\n\nSuper plush room, super comfy bed, pillows, coffeemaker, fridge, awesome water pressure & lovely, smelly bath products.  Free wifi\n\nOnly reason this wasn't a 5-star review was due to their obscenely awful flood lights that illuminate the building.  My room was right above these lights & even with the blackout curtains, it was like daylight in my room.... which equaled NO sleep for me\n\nKept waking up, thinking I'd overslept only to find out it was 1am, 2am, you get the picture. \n\nNot sure if the higher floors experience this but the 5th floor was brutal!
