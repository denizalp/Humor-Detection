This lady is phenomenal. She does great alterations and is SO nice. She altered one of my pant suits as well as my wedding dress and did a great job for both. Her prices are very slightly cheaper than other places I got estimates from, but with her it's not about saving money. You will pay the same or slightly less but receive the BEST customer service. She is genuinely happy to make her customers happy. Very happy with my dress, turn around time, price and customer service.
