Now keung's.... are you really a delight at all?\nTonight is the first time I've tried keung's & ... ugh. Guess we really can't trust a restaurant with a comic sans font logo....\n\nThe only good thing about this restaurant is that the food came at a lightning speed, but that's not enough to bring it up from 1 star. Right off the bat, we were sat down at a table that had not been cleaned... hey, I don't mind waiting. Please just make sure I'm sitting down at a sanitary place for my food. They half-assed the cleaning and left the old teapot from the table before us and a half used cup of tea.... and when we asked to switch, they were super confused and had pissy faces.\nThe waiters are slow and they don't understand what I'm talking about, even when I ask for a cup of cold water in chinese. & When I say thank you, they don't seem to understand me either... am I from mars or something?? Why does this place lack so much communication??\n\nThe food was mediocre at best. If super salty and severely fried foods are your calling, this is the place for you. The amount of sodium in every dish tops the amount of sodium I consume in one day. The plain congee was so salty and it made me thirsty right away. The rest of the dishes (tofu, noodles) were ok.. nothing I'd ever crave though. \n\nThe thing that dropped this rating from a 2-3 to a 1 is the fact that our party went up to pay and then came back to the table to sort out the tips with the remaining cash. Another male waiter came by with a bill and when we said we had already paid, he made a disapproving face like he didn't believe us until we showed him our receipt. Then he stated rudely \"You didn't tip yet.\" (in chinese) ... JUST as we are sorting out the money to tip. RUDE RUDE RUDE. Kudos to my boyfriend's mom for slamming down a five into his hand and shooing him away. Hope that fiver can buy you a new attitude. And everything else while you're at it.
