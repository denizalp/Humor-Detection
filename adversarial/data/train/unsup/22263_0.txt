Came here this past Thursday with a bunch of other Yelpers. I had fairly high expectations given other reviews, and word of mouth, and it mostly lived up to expectations.\n\nATMOSPHERE:\n\nThe place is pretty conveniently located for those living on the west-end, or travelling by subway. There's street parking and Green P's around for those driving in, but seemed to get packed surprisingly fast for a Thursday night. The interior itself is pretty small, but pretty similar to most Korean bars in other parts of town - a few tables, bar area, and a row of booths, and a couple of TV's with K-Pop playing in the background. \n\nSERVICE:\n\nSo the server took a bit on the long side to take my and another's order (ended up needing to go up to the front to catch his attention), but it's possible he didn't notice me coming in. We also had a fairly large table, and our server seemed to be taking care of the whole place while also tending to the bar. I was a bit annoyed when our server also got my order wrong, but he was sincerely apologetic and was quick enough in getting the correct dish over.\n\nFOOD:\n\nI was impressed with friend chicken options and combos available. You can choose from regular chicken (whole and half), boneless chicken, or wings - in numerous sauces that were actually available. They didn't have flavoured soju as I had hoped, but the standard was available, as were beers on tap.\n\nI ended up going with the \"Night Time Special\" (\"Happy Hour\") that was available between 7-11pm. Our whole table was kind of surprised at how good of a deal this seemed to be for $9. Though on the smaller side, the special includes 4 pieces of chicken, fries (or a salad), and a pint of beer - pretty good bang for your buck if you ask me! The fries were nice and crispy (but not oily), just the way I like them. The standard fried chicken was tender, and well-battered, without being too overwhelming. \n\nI also ordered another half order of \"Soy and Garlic\" wings, which was also pretty good. It was a bit on the soggy side, due to the sauce, and a bit light on flavour.  Although I prefer sauces being more subtle, those looking for heavier\/saucier wings might want to dry the \"Hot\/Medium\" options.\n\nVERDICT:\n\nCome for the food, be mildly entertained by the K-Pop. I'll be back when I'm in the area.
