Great coffee, fast service. What more could you ask for.\n\nThis Starbucks is hidden away, well not exactly, on the corner of Marks and Sunset. If you drive past the Sunset Station casino and don't get as far as Costco, you should be able to find this store.\n\nThis is a very small version of Starbucks with only a few spaces inside and a few more tables outside. When we arrived at 6:30 am it seemed to be already too hot to sit outside (September 5) as the overnight temperature here did not dip below 82 degrees.\n\nMy vanilla latte with long shots was just right and the drip coffee was, as usual, almost at boiling point and needed ice to cool it down. The Italian roast was very powerful and will give you a definite boost if you order it.\n\nNot much else to say about this Starbucks. Enjoy!
