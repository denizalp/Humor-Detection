What can I say about this place.  Food is consistent - I have always loved Punjabi food.  The service - just remember not to take anything personally!\n\nHowever, the lady who was keeping an eye on things and the man at the cash register were polite.\n\nThe masala dosa was thin, crispy, hardly any visible oil to speak of any very tasty.  The accompanying coconut sauce, eggplant curry and rasam soup were very good.  Not dripping in oil.\n\nI had the fish tikka.  FABULOUS.  Dry (which I like) and well-marinated.\n\nNow, the piece de resistance:  THE SWEET COUNTER IS OUT OF BOUNDS!  Lots of different barfi (coconut, caju, pista, and of course gulab jamuns) ... and jalebis ...\n\nHave not been there for a long time.  Service is the same (not with a  smile but the food very consistent).
