Hafa Adai! Was looking for a place to eat dinner and found Red Rice on Yelp. I have never had Guam (Guaminian?) food so this was a first and didn't know what to expect. The place is located in a small plaza next to other larger plazas. I am not from Vegas so I relied on Google Maps to find this place as well. The place has a handful of booths and a larger table near the front. Looks like it is family-owned where the family is bringing their culture and food to the Vegas. I ordered the Fiesta Plate and an order of the Red Rice Musubi. The Fiesta Plate has a little of everything. BBQ beef, BBQ chicken, a rib, an eggroll (lumpia?), some type of minced pork, and marinated cucumbers over a bed of red rice. The meats were OK. The beef was really tough. The chicken was kind of fatty. The rib was OK...Of the meats, I enjoyed the marinated minced pork. It reminded me of what you would call larb at a Thai restaurant. The rice is made with achote seed to get the color and flavor. I felt the rice was overcooked and was a bit mushy for my liking. The achote seed is supposed to provide color and a hint of flavor and that was correct. The color looked great and it looked like it would pack a punch but it didn't have much flavor. For $14, it was enough food for 2 people who aren't extremely hungry. As for the red rice musubi, the rice again felt a bit mushi. The spam was fried and marinated in a sweet sauce. There was some sort of sauce in the middle which added some moisture to the seaweed and spam. It, like the Fiesta Plate, was OK. Nothing too special. The red rice didn't add much other than making it look more appetizing.\n\nThe meal was OK. The service was friendly and helpful but in all, the whole experience was just OK because of the food. Remember to check in for a free fountain drink. I might come back to try the other dishes but I wasn't particularly impressed by the meal...
