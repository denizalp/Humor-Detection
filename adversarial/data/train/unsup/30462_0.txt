I have been vegan for 5-1\/2 years, and this is one of the best vegan restaurants I've ever been to.  The staff and service are amazing, and the food is flavorful and beautiful.  Highly recommend the sweet potato sushi, tomatico tart, fire and brimstone burger, pumpkin pie cheesecake and lemon berry cheesecake.  If they have it, the roasted cauliflower soup with rosemary is addictive.  \nDon't miss it!
