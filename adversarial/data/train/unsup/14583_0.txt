My nails turned out great and the guy was very attentive.  I also didn't have to wait.  My only issue really is the price.  I mean, really... it's on another level.  I knew the prices were going to be high, I mean, hello, I'm a yelper, I read the reviews. :)  But I wasn't prepared for it to be 50 dollars for a gel manicure...!?  I'm sure they charge so much because they think they can considering they're in Summerlin.  Well, while they're certainly within their rights to do that, I'm also within my rights to think less of them because they do that.  I understand charging a bit more considering the area they're in... but to charge SIGNIFICANTLY more is ridiculous.  Really, 50 dollars for ONE gel manicure?  I can get a pedicure AND gel manicure for less than that at some salons.  Like I said, whatever.. they can do what they want but with the abundance of nail salons in the area, I'll move on.  Seriously, will NEVER be back to this place.  So, so many other options.  Not even that much farther away either?  No wonder I didn't have to wait.
