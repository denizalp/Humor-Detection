We go here whenever we go to Pho Van a couple doors down, and can't resist having a little gelato no matter how full we are after dinner.  They have a zillion (seriously, no fewer than a zillion) flavors to choose from including dairy based gelato as well as fruit based sorbets.  I've sampled a few different flavors (both gelato and sorbet) and they're ALL delicious!  \n\nIt's a little pricey ($3+ for a small - and considering I'm used to going to the self serve places where I can get little bit of this and a little bit of that for like $1.50, $3+ seems like a lot) however the small is more-than-enough since it's so rich - wish they had a kid's size in fact.  \n\nWill continue to come here and try new flavors.  If you're in the area - it's a must try.
