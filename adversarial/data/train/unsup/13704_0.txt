This my second visit to this location but this time for sure I know I won't be back. I like that they have late night hours but that also comes with the possibility of aged food etc. \nOn my last visit I stopped in and ordered the veggie sandwich which is just cheese, avocado and lettuce -you can get tomato and sprouts too. The sandwich was a sandwich nothing special but the service was iffy. This time we stopped in around midnight on a weekend night and as my beau went in to order I knew we made a huge mistake. I watched the worker not only wipe his nose with his hand but also take his hat off and scratch his hair near the food counter. (No sandwiches were being made at the time) Now this was not the worker that made our sandwiches -maybe he delivers orders or does the register? Who knows but I'm sure he needs to retake a food safety class. \nAs we make our way home I'm a little worried about the choice we made for our late night meal. We get home I'm secretly scared to open the bag and being super hungry - I just do it. The first thing I notice is the brown sludge seeping out of the sandwich -the \"avocado\" spread. EWW. Being so hungry and the fact that I already put a bra on to go get our late night munchies - I just scraped the brown goopy parts off and choked down the dry crusty wheat bread and my dignity -praying that I wouldn't get food poisoning. \nTurns out...this time...I have a gut of a goat and I was fine but still have flashbacks of terrible terrible sandwich. At least the Mrs. Vickie's BBQ chips tasted awesome. \nI've learned my lesson and never again. They should have an \"At your own risk\" sign on the door. \nThe End.
