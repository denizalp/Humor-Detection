The service and food gets worse and worse every time we go there! Sat in drive thru for at least 10 minutes and only 1 car was ahead of us... food was cold was we got it  and when I got home and ate my burger the bun was stale  yuck! I think I'll drive out my way to go to the other location. Never had a problem there.
