Just finished our first boondocking adventure and thought I would take my time to write a review on the place that made this all possible.  \n\nWe absolutely love Johnnie Walker.  My fianc√© and I began looking for our toy hauler last summer and we went from place to place looking for the best one.  Unfortunately our options were limited due to the size (height) of our toy and the overall weight of the toy hauler itself.  We finally met our sales person, Gina and she was attentive and patient, as we explained exactly what we were looking for.  Gina provided us timely communication of different options as they became available.  While we initially went in for a used toy hauler, we ended up buying a brand new one, which really made me happy. \n\nOnce we made our purchase, Chase was helpful as we did our inspection walk through.  He answered all of our questions and even did some demonstrations while we recorded them in preparation for our first trip.  Absolutely incredible!\n\nI highly recommend Johnnie Walker's to anyone considering buying an RV.  Their service is top notch and unmatched from other places we visited along the way.
