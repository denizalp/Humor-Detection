This was my first Vegas show. I usually don't have the attention span to sit still for 1.5 hours, but I've always loved the soundtrack and was eager to see the show. \n\nMaybe I'm retarded, but I felt the plot was hard to follow. I had read the synopsis in preparation. It didn't really help me at all. \n\nAside from that, the effects blew me away. I really wasn't expecting the spectacular visuals. The singing\/music was awesome. It was really moving. \n\nI'd highly recommend it though, for non-retards. Even if you're a bit mental (such as me), you'll still enjoy the show.
