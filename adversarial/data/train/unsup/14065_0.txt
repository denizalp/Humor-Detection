Sick lights! If not for the lights, this would've been a 1 star review. \n\nI'm not a crazy club go-er anymore, because I fell into the bandwagon and am now a huge fan of electronic music. I flew into Vegas last week for the Electric Daisy Carnival that took place last Fri-Sun. Anyway, Hakkasan had Dada Life in the house Wednesday night and my girlfriends and I went. We decided not to go on the guestlist because we were sure we couldn't make the guest list end time anyway. Didn't really matter, because both GA ticket and GL lines were 30-40 min long by the time we arrived. By the time we started moving, and I thought we were going somewhere, we finally found ourselves in front of the elevator to the club after getting ID'd three times and scanned three times by three different people in three different parts of the line - wtheck? I felt like a prisoner! \n\n.. Were in! yay! ugh.. nvm. This place is BEYOND crowded and they allow way more than their \"capacity\" into the club. We couldn't even INCH through the crowd, and we aren't big girls. This place is also like a maze and incredibly hard to navigate. Their bouncers are also total douches. Oh, you can't walk here, you can't stand there, you can only stand here for 10 min because everyone needs to keep it moving, oh don't sit on the ledge, you should've done table service if you wanted to sit.. blahblahhhhhhh. ugh. We did bottle service the next night at TAO for Dash Berlin, and what, Hakkasan? Fire your damn bouncers. Tao isn't the best, but at least their bouncers don't step all over girls.
