Do not go here!  My step-dad owned a business and he got all his trucks serviced here so when my AC went out on my car, he suggested to let them do it.  It cost about $1,000.  I got my car back and then within a few days I heard a clinking sound coming from my engine. i was on the freeway and I started to get nervous so I pulled off the 60 on Priest because the next exit wasn't that close.  I got off the ramp and my engine shut off towards the end of the ramp and I had to roll to the QT right off the freeway.  A cylinder part in my car that has to do with AC in my engine had come loose and got jammed in my engine.  So had i not gotten off the freeway I could have killed myself and others but luckily I got off.  So we took it back and they fixed it.  Well then a day later I am driving and again i hear the same sound.  I was right near my house and was turning on my street when again my engine shut down.  Again, THANK GOD, I was right by my house and in a residential area and not on the main road where again I could have crashed and killed myself and someone else.  The other cylilnder part (there are two cylinders or whatever the part is called) had come loose and was bouncing around in my engine.  So I called irrate at this point and the owner had the nerve to actually cuss me out and yell at me saying \"Are you going to Bitch at me all day long or bring your F***ing car in so we can fix it!?\"  \nAfter that I didn't even go back because I was sooooooooo mad. So I paid a whole other person to fix my AC.  \nSo my advice, DO NOT go here.  If this guy treated me like this when it was his shop who almost got me seriously injured, and my step dad had even gave him business for years and was a good customer, who knows how he would treat you.  I would never give my money to someone so nasty as the guy in that shop.
