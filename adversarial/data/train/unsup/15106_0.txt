I have a confession to make.  Sometimes I go to Goodwill to pick up things to resell them on the Facebook sites.  I can turn $2.99 into $20 pretty easily.  It takes the right thing, though.  My first experiment was with doggy steps that go at the end of a bed.  I paid $7.99 and sold for $15.   The last thing I tried was s framed picture of puppies in buckets. It was colorful.  I paid $3.99. Sold for $20.   The problem is that it's hard to find stuff that will resell rapidly.  That is because there are a ton of other people doing the exact same thing as I am and they are plucking stuff up FAST.  When the employees roll in merchandise from the back room, the shoppers are like vultures.  It's almost not worth it.  Do not go on Tuesday; it's senior's day and they get a 25% discount.  If you are into Vultures, go on Tuesday just to observe the madness.   Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of people buying clothes and things for themselves.   I think, however, that there are more people doing what I am doing.  I need to try different Goodwill stores.  I typically go to the same one that is nearby.   It would be interesting to see if the vultures are everywhere.  Oh, and there is one more problem.  I have a back room at home that has a lot of stuff that I picked up at Goodwill that hasn't yet sold.  (Maybe I need to hire a procurement agent?) I will probably have to take the NOT SOLD items back to Goodwill to donate them. Talk about irony.
