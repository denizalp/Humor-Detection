I heard the food was good. It smelled good as it was being served to others all around us. What I'm trying to say is, we were never served!!! My husband and I went in earlier this week 2\/9\/16 and sat by the bar and took about 5 minutes to read through a menu that made our mouths water. We placed our order with a waitress that was fairly pleasant and brought us our water. My husband and I got into a heated discussion that distracted us from the fact that 20 minutes rolled by and no food. When I checked the time and realized its been 20 minutes since we ordered we started really observing food coming in and out of the kitchen but nothing to our table. We also counted and realized there were 4 different groups of people that came in after us and they got their food. Finally the waitress comes by and says that they were frying my catfish and wanted to make sure it was done right. Come on now! Catfish don't take that long!!! After waiting for 40 minutes total we decided to get up and leave. As we walked towards the door a lady(employee) ran up to us saying no no don't leave yet! She grabbed my husband's shoulder and my arm (highly inappropriate) to stop us from walking out. She said something like please don't leave I'm sorry I will get your check.  I'm assuming she meant she'd comp the meal for being incompetent. I calmly said we were done and my husband and I walked out.\n A. Who was she? \nB. Where did she come from? \nC. If she knew there was an issue with our meals why didn't she come to our table to address it before?\n\nBad service!!! Terrible! They weren't even busy enough to justify that faux pad!!!\n\nToo bad! I had high hopes for this place since It opened up down the street from my home.\nBy the way I gave it 1 star because the water was refreshing.
