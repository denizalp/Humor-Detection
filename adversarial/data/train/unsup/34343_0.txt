If you have not tried it then you defiantly want to! Amazing food & great people who work there. From the meat to the fish everything is always amazing especially their in house sauce that comes with a lot of the meat dishs!  Highly recommended. I have been to a bunch of Portuguese restaurants and for the food this is one of the best. Prices are very fair also. in the summer months the patio is also great to eat with friends. \n\nI have been coming here for years & have brought many new people to this restaurant everybody is always amazed on how good the food is and they always end up coming back!
