I haven't been here since it changed to Kim Bo, and was excited to try to recreate my old memories of the bo 7 mon menu. Our 1st\/7 dish was the raw beef fondue, then next came 3 types of beef rolls (bo la lot + beef wrapped onions + bo nuong roll), then came the ground beef ball (cha dum), beef congee, and shaking beef. Overall, everything was tasty except for the beef congee (way too bland) and the shaking beef had a lot of burnt marks. The entire combo was $28.95 for a two person portion. Overall, Pho Tien didn't leave any super memorable impression, so unless I was desperate for food in the area. There are much better options.
