I have been here a couple times and I can't say I am a fan of the food but the bakery selection is very good. The oreo cheesecake I recently had was flavorless and was too small for the $4.50 price tag on it. The tiramisu however was spot on delicious. If you like carrot cake see if you can get some because it goes fast. It's some really good carrot cake. The burgers and other sandwiches have been just average or under and too pricey. Inside there isn't much space if it's busy so I'd recommend snagging a table on the patio. If anything at least stop by and pick up some desserts for yourself or as a treat for someone else.
