I want to give this place negative stars. I went 2 years ago but it seems the owner is still a jack@ss. My massuese was a female and that was alright. But when it came time for the facial, the owner said he'd do it personally for me. I felt really uncomfortable. I've never had a facial where they massage your back pass the upper shoulder blades. He went a little lower than the shoulder blades and when I came out of the facial, my friend asked why I smelled musky. I had to explain the owner was creepy and hauching over me. It gives me chills everytime I think about this.
