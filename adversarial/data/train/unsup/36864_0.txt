Best pulled pork west of Texas in my opinion! You can't go wrong with their pulled pork sandwich. The BBQ sauces they offer are a tasty addition to the sandwich - I loved the chipotle and habanero sauces. The atmosphere is great. Reminds me of a BBQ spot I would find in my home state of Texas with the adorable country store and gas station attached. Happy to have found a spot to grab a delicious pulled pork sandwich in Arizona!
