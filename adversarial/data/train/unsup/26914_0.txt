This place is great gem off the strip in Vegas.  It has cute rustic decor that's clean and modern.  The menu is simple and made from fresh ingredients. \n\nI went for dinner one evening, and for a party of three, we ordered:\nHEIRLOOM TOMATO & BURRATA\nBACKYARD FAVORITE BURGER\nCARAMELIZED SEA SCALLOPS\nPAN ROASTED HALIBUT\n\nEverything was really well seasoned and delicious!  Would definitely come back for desserts!
