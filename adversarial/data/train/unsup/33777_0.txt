Having just moved into the area and looking to familiarize myself with the local take out offerings I stumbled across this restaurant. The food was good and was out quick. The Hunan chicken and shrimp was loaded with both proteins and vegetables. The back of house was in a heated arguement that could be heard up front would be my only criticism. Will be back.
