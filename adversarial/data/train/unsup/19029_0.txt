We visited the last night of Glendale Glitters, so we expected the restaurant to be crowded. We waited about 1 hour to be seated, but were able to walk around the event during that time. While it is a smaller space, I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't too loud while we ate. They were out of the first 3 beverages we ordered, so we stuck with water. I didn't mind waiting for our pizza to arrive, but was very disappointed from my first to my last bite. The cheese on my pizza looked like white school glue and didn't taste much better. I put several dustings of salt and pepper on my pizza because it didn't taste like anything. My husband and I were so disappointed in our tasteless food that we won't be going back. I didn't mind that they were out of several beverages (I understand that it was a busy night), but there was almost no sauce on either of our pies.
