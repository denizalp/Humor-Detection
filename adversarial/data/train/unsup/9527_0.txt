This is my favorite place to go to in Vegas. I am local and all my gifts for others come from here. Each piece of jewelry is unique. The stones are hand picked and Jean has a jeweler make each piece for that stone. There are aquired pieces and everything is amazing. If the energy is off putting it may be due to the fact that crystals store energy and there are crystals here from all over the world here and who knows what they've encountered, it can be overwhelming for those who are sensitive and they also amplify energy. The employees may not pester you asking if you need help every five mintutes, as I see some people complaining  about, but in my book that is a good thing especially in a store like this. Peace and quite while looking for the stones that call to you is helpful. And if you where responsible for making sure no unique stone goes missing you would also keep a close eye on everyone. The love and passion that goes into this place is phenomenal. If you need help ask just Miguel or Jean, if they are there and they are always MORE than willing to help as are all the other employees. Disregard these bad experiences because they are far and few between. There is something for everyone here. I brought my mother in this last time and between the two of us we spent over $1,000. Well worth it. Thank you guys for everything. Ill be back this week.
