I was going to write a review about \"hey, maybe if you don't like waiting for cheap sushi, fuck off.\"\n\nI've changed my mind.\n\nPut in the order for sushi and an egg roll at 6:50. Got the food at 7:30. \n\nIt wouldn't be such a big deal if you didn't see people who came in after you get their shit. I'm an only child and this the one time I've felt like a foster child taken into a home that just wanted me for government money. \n\nHere's the thing, I was all sorts of boozed up on the happy hour sake bomb at 7:30 when I asked for the check. Oop! Got a catch, I was soberly pissed off at 7:55 when I actually got the check. \n\nSo, here's the deal. If you're in a time crunch, don't ever go. \n\nIf you like cheap drinks, check it out. Decent sushi, cool specials.\n\nStaff doesn't know how to handle more than 2 tables at one time.
