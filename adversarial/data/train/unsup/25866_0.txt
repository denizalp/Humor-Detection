I don't understand how a hospital can have an ER that they cannot accommodate . I have been a patient here for scheduled services and that has been ok . But coming into the ER is a nightmare . Twice I have came here and twice I walked out to go to a better hospital after waiting in hallways and waiting rooms . I Even came by ambulance and was taken out and put into the waiting area without any attendance due to their processing and over extending  patients to available space and care givers . Sure they list quick wait times but that's only to get you registered so as to Bill your insurance and to wait in their halls and crammed wait areas . I was severely dehydrated and could not give a urine sample to save my life , I begged them to do a Cath. To get one and was ignored and told I couldn't be treated without one, really ??? I couldn't I was severely dehydrated and in extreme pain.  It was beyond my choice . Like I said I went to st. Rose San Martin and got right in and treated like a human and admitted for two days due to intestinal blockage and severe dehydration. I guess if you have a scheduled visit they can accommodate you ,  but forget it if you have an emergency !!!!   Ride or die , I choose to ride somewhere that could help me.
