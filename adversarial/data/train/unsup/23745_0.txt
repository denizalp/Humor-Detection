So the Courtyard is another option within the Marriott chain, and what I sometimes turn to when I have business in Scottsdale and the rates at the JW Marriott Camelback skyrocket.  First of all, the service from hotel staff was very good as with all Marriott's I've stayed at.  Why 2 stars?  Since when was it acceptable to stock used shampoo and conditioner bottles for arriving guests?  When taking a shower the first night, there was hardly any shampoo in the bottle to wash my hair.  It was obviously used by a previous guest but placed in the bathroom as new upon my arrival.  The conditioner was about half way full.  The worst ... the body lotion.  Pretty much empty but left for me to desperately try to squeeze just 1 squirt out.  I love being a Marriott Platinum Elite Member but this was disappointing.  Overall, I couldn't believe this Courtyard is recycling and rationing used products for new arriving guests.
