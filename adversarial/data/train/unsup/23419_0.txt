I love Yesterday's. LOVE IT!\n\nWe really only ever make it here for karaoke, or pop in for a round after the St. Rosalia summer church festival, but every other Saturday night, Yesterday's transforms from a Yinzer Greenfield bar into a magical karaoke experiment that should go wrong - but always goes right.\n\nYinzers. Retired millworkers. Cute Yinzer daughters of millworkers. Someone you vaguely remember from high school. A guy in a business suit who is playing some fierce air key-tar. Those karaoke nerds from St. James Place (okay, that one is us). A well-put-together 40something lady who surprises you when she belts out an 80s song. A bunch of bros who, it turns out, really like 90s rap songs and Miller Lite. Two guys starting an arm-wrestling contest at the bar.\n\nYou will meet all of these characters and more on a karaoke Saturday at Yesterday's. And while it seems like somewhere in this mix, something will go awry, what happens instead is an incredible party atmosphere with impromptu duets, a packed dance floor, dozens of toasts, shout outs to Pittsburgh sports, and people from every walk of Yinzer life coming together to drink, sing, and tear Greenfield down until 1:30am.\n\nDJ Mike (of PartyOn Entertainment) may not have the best karaoke system out there, but he packs a decent selection of songs and does a good job keeping the singers rolling through.\n\nI can't remember a time we've been here that wasn't a blast.\n\nDrinks are cheap (less than $3 apiece for well drinks), the bartenders are friendly, and even though they're cash only, there's a bank just next door and an ATM on the premises. And if you're like us and fortunate enough to live in the Squirrel Hill\/Greenfield area, you're just a short walk away from home after last call.\n\nKaraoke runs every other Saturday night from 10pm until 1:30am (since Yesterday's itself doesn't have a website, details about their KJ and karaoke can be found here: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Party-On-Entertainment\/146273945406488).\n\nSo whether you're in the mood for a Bon Jovi singalong or busting out your best Axl Rose impression, Yesterday's is the spot every other Saturday night!
