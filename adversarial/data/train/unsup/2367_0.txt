Came here 10 min before close on a Thursday night and was quickly accommodated in terms of a table. Was happy that they were gracious enough to serve a group of 8 that was hangry and hankering for sushi. Ordered multiple dishes but still the go to was the crispy rice tuna which to this day is some of the best sushi dishes I've had ( enjoyed this first at Koi LA and fell In love). They also had a four flight of Japanese whisky which was a steal. Overall really good food, ambiance and service would highly recommend if your at PH. Why the loss of a star. Felt the hostess was trying to always upsell rather than serving otherwise a winner!
