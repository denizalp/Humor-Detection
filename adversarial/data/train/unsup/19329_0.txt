If you're ever here, just follow your nose and you'll find this place.  Kin Kin to an extent has brought some life to this mall, and has been consistent with its food, and its service.  After all with their advertisement; 6 buns for $4.50, you can't go wrong, and if you dont see their special advertisement, you'll constantly hear this one lady blurting out \"6 BUNS FOR $4.50!!\" every 3-4 mins lol.  Their ham and cheese, tuna bun, hotdog bun, coconut are their popular goodies.  They also serve bubble tea along with cakes at a very affordable price......Its just one of those places where if you're hungry, and passing by in the mall, stop by, you won't be disappointed as I was yesterday evening...yum!
