This is my least favorite sit-down breakfast place in the area (behind Crackers and Mimi's) because:\n* There's always a wait.\n* I always feel under--dressed. (The client√®le appears to be the country club crowd).\n* They have communal jam containers on the tables. I wonder how many kids have licked that spoon?\n\nMy biggest problem with the place, however, is the waitstaff. The hiring manager apparently has a thing for 120-lb, tanned, 5'8\" long-haired 23-year-olds, because that's all you'll see here. It's the Stepford waitstaff. Not a career waitress in the place, which means the service is ok but not great. And it's very, very creepy.\n\nThe food, cleanliness, parking and all the rest are fine. But if you want to feel comfortable as you eat, go elsewhere.
