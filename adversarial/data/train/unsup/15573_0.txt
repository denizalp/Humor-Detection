Overall, I would say this place has decent Mexican food.. the thing is I didn't feel like there was anything above average at this place. I really enjoyed the carne asada and the queso is a really rich appetizer which will leave you wanting more BUT they stop serving food at 8:30pm, and for downtown Mesa, they are a bit pricey. $12 for a cocktail, that is not a craft cocktail, or in downtown Chandler or Scottsdale seems a bit steep to me. There aren't many places to eat open late in downtown Mesa by the Arts Center and I think it would benefit customers if food was served a bit later. While my fiance and I were there they ended up turning 2 groups down at 8:30 since the kitchen was closed, so they walked a few blocks down to go to Desert Eagle. \n\nIf you are downtown and looking for run of the mill restaurant Mexican food, or a $12 grateful dead cocktail- you may want to stop in!
