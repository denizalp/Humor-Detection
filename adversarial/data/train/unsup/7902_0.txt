Excellent beer, in an enjoyable space, at a weird location. No points off for the weird location, just want to stress that this is at the back of a business park. You'll think you've turned into the wrong place. Ass Clown is as right as it gets. \n\nI can't believe I wrote that last sentence. \n\nThe place is well decorated and comfortable. I went twice while in town. It seems they draw a lot of regulars who are welcoming to newcomers...as is the bartender. \n\nThere were a ton of beers available, all brewed on site. I favor stouts, enjoyed each one that I tried. \n\nIf you've got a wine drinker with you, they have two reds and two whites available by the glass and bottle. \n\nEat before you go.
