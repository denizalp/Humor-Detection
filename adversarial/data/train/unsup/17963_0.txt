Summer or Winter Al Baghdadi has on their menu what you need from hot tea to cold smoothies ! Amazing mediteranian pizza, and wraps their sandiwich are very filling and in a bite you there is abundance of fresh ingredients and flavors ! All heated\/cooked in a brique oven the wrap pita bread is crispy on the outside and moist on the inside ! I love to visit al-baghdadi for its amazing sweets of high quality, the staff is welcoming and always willing to serve you like a champ ! Definately needs to be visited for a full meal, for coffee\/tea\/smoothies or for dessert only :)!
