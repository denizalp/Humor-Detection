You got lucky being right near the start line at 6:15am when it was 30 degrees out, the line at Starbucks was a mile long, and my friend and I have this tradition of getting your egg mcmuffins at each race since the San Diego Rock 'n' Roll marathon.  \n\nWe woke up extra early, braved the elements, and you were wonderfully warm.  We decided we would stay inside that blanket of heat until the start of the race.  It turns out everyone else had the same idea but the lines moved fast.  Wow!  How is that possible?  Oh, you anticipated this so you have egg mcmuffins all ready to go as well as coffee and juice.  You made them the night before?  How good can they possibly be?  \n\nI order mine without sausage and your employee freaks out.  He tells me they're already made and if I could just take the sausage out.  I give him a look and say I want it made fresh.  He consults with another employee and ultimately the manager and they agree that I should get a fresh egg mcmuffin.  Gee, thanks.  Also, what's with the $7 price tag?  Did you raise the prices the night before the marathon?  I've never paid that much for a combo meal.  You're supposed to be the cheap breakfast option.\n\nI get my supposed fresh egg mcmuffin and notice it's not so fresh.  The cheese is burnt as well as the muffin and there's sausage residue on my muffin.  How did that happen?  My juice is warm because you left it out in anticipation of a rush.  \n\nNext marathon, I won't be coming back.  I'll buy muffins somewhere the night before and just make do.
