Having been here multiple times, I'm sure there are better options out there.\n\nThe decor is nice, with high ceilings and draperies, and very dark and intimate. But that being said, there's been several times when I get in there, and there's no one greeting at the front, and I'm kind of just wandering around these \"dark, intimate\" halls trying to figure out who works here and who doesn't! Dark clothing on servers means they blend in!\n\nThe tea itself is meh! No real tea taste, lots of powder. I usually order the hot honey milk green tea, no tapioca, and the last time it was majorly sweet. Food is also just MEH. I tried the soy sauce platter before, with the pigs ear and egg and such, and it was, as expected, drenched in soy sauce. So not much can be commented on that. Fried chicken was similar...tasted fine, but it's fried to death so of course it does!\n\nSo I'll be here if friends want to me, but I wouldn't suggest it to anyone else.
