Hooooly moly. This is as good as it gets...worth every penny! Everything is AMAZING!! I came in for lunch and tackled as much as I could...some notables was the delicious prime rib, plentiful smoked salmon, and CRAB LEGS!! Things I don't quite like were the NY steak (dry), other meats that looked dry, below par sushi (thin sashimi, thick cubes of rice), and most of the ice creams were not that great to me. \n\nFor such a large buffet at a great price, you really should expect SOME things to be hit or miss though, and the fact that they add in or switch some items on the buffet as you are eating really adds to the \"OH I GOTTA TRY THAT!\" fun factor. I will be back...once I finish digesting...if ever...
