Not a fan of Hertz. My first impression of this was the guy who was giving me my car trying to almost double my car rental price. He asked me how many people I had (one) and how many bags I had (one traveling backpack and one computer backpack), and he claimed he found a car that suits my needs. It was spacious and had good mileage, and it also almost doubled my car rental price. I was thinking, I have ONE person, how is it being more spacious fitting my need? When I saw the price, I was pretty shocked and said when I booked online, it wasn't that expensive. He said some things that made me think that I didn't pay attention to whether it included taxes and fees, but looking back, I know the price I saw online did include taxes and fees. I basically had to tell him to find a car with just the base price (this car he found for me cost $12 or so more per day because of \"vehicle upgrade\"). BUT, he tried yet AGAIN and found a car that cost $6 more per day because of vehicle upgrade. I REALLY don't like how they try to squeeze more money out of you.\n\nFinally, after taking MUCH longer than it otherwise should have, he gave me a car that matched the price I paid for online. Mind you, this was when I picked up the car. \n\nThe car itself was fine, though it was bad at accelerating. Other than that, no complaints about the car; no problems except that the key had self-locking issues or something, the doors would lock on its own randomly. I never really figured that out. In any case, I'm not a fan of Hertz; really bad first impression, and I'm not going to use Hertz again.
