This is a hidden gem of a restaurant! It's tucked behind the Walgreens at Dobson & Chandler, and boasts a very large, casual dining room with enough space for big parties\/families.\n\nThe menu is an interesting assortment of Mexican & Asian spiced meats, about 5 rice options, either refried beans or Cuban black beans, and each of our meals came with a big snickerdoodle or chocolate cookie.\n\nThere were 6 of us, we sampled one another's meals, loved everything! Examples: Jade Red Chicken, Jerk Chicken, Hengrenade Chicken, Chinese BBQ Pork, Machaca.\n\nChino Bandido's is a MUST-TRY place. Can't wait to return!
