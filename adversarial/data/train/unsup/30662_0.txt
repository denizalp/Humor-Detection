Here's a confession.  I haven't even tried the cupcakes.  HOWEVER, I have found myself getting to Cakes on Walnut as they open (7am) for the certainty of acquiring one of their delicious Cinnamon Banana Walnut muffins.  It should be noted that their Blueberry muffins are delicious artful baked goods in their own right, but the Walnut is indeed something to write home about.\nSaid muffin topped off with a french press coffee is the best way I've found to talk myself out of the house in the morning.\nP.S. Their internet never seems to work but I find you can steal it very reliably from somewhere else.
