Being a recent homeowner I've been shopping everywhere for furniture. Living Spaces has a pretty extensive selection and the prices are pretty reasonable. They have everything from funky modern sectionals, to cushy old man leather couches that recline. It's also a plus to shop somewhere the sales people aren't pushy at all but always there to help you when you need them. \n\nI finally got sick of sitting on the one chair I own and decided I needed a couch like, yesterday. I went in and after looking through probably every single set  on display (and maybe getting lost in the decor section) I decided on the one for me! Cute grey sectional with tufted cushions. The only problem was they only had the floor model left, which I wasn't thrilled about. This has happened previously when I was picking out a Christmas gift for my sister and brother in law. Other places I've bought from offer a discount if you're buying the floor model- not here. After a thorough inspection I decided to purchase anyway. They sold me on the extended warranty (they specifically said it covered wine stains, what was I supposed to do?!) So that was an extra 10%.\n\nThe checkout process was quick and easy- we loaded up the car and now on the off chance I make some friends to invite over they will have a place to sit!
