I went here for my birthday dinner with my family. We haven't been in a while, but I was really in the mood for good pizza, so I decided to give it a try! \n\nWe got the fried seafood, grilled calamari and two orders off the special's menu - both of them mussels. I personally only like mussels in a red sauce, so I asked our server what the italian description meant and if it would be served with a red sauce. He ensured that yes, it would be served with a red sauce, but 10 minutes later, another server brought out our dishes and the mussels were in a white sauce! \n\nI did speak to the waiter, who re-read the menu and said, ah it comes in a spicy sauce. Well, the sauce was spicy, which was the saving grace and essentially was what kept it's 5-star rating. However, I did urge that if he wasn't 100% sure, he should double check next time. He seemed nice about the error. \n\nFor our mains we got the calabrese picante pizza, veal stuffed with mozzarella and prosciutto, veal marsala and another special - venison with a blueberry, wine sauce. Everything was excellent. \n-My pizza was cooked in a wood-burning oven, and it was crispy, gooey and spicy. \n-The stuffed veal was a huge portion, and was so tender, gooey with cheese, salty and yummy.\n-The veal marsala was also a large piece with great mashed potatoes. \n-The venison, though apprehensive to try, was cooked a perfect medium-rare and not drowning in sauce. It was a tasty gamey meat, but SUPER tender. Really surprising good.\n\nNext time I'll hopefully leave room for dessert!\n\nI'd go back in a heartbeat!
