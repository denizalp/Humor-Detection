This place has a great reputation.  It probably makes it more popular than it otherwise should be.  I really tried to sample what they are known for as I do many places I visit for the first time.  Turns out they know what they are doing.  \n\nThis is your quintessential diner.  Friendly, sassy staff that make you feel like you are at home.   Wait for a table (because there will be a wait) or try to snag a seat at the counter either way you are getting big portions served to you quickly.  \n\nI got the jumbot (basically an egg scramble with various meats and veg) with the hot sausage and a side of German potato pancakes.   The hot sausage made what would have been a relatively pedestrian dish quite good. I probably could have ate just a bowl of that. The second best thing I tried there was the potato pancake.  Really nice flavor and they give you the option of sour cream or applesauce as a condiment.  I tried both and the sour cream was the clear winner there.  I tried my wife's chocolate chip banana pancake and it was also quite good.  \n\nNice diner doing a good job serving the community.  The food is probably somewhere between 3.5 and 4 stars but because of the intangibles it gets rounded up.
