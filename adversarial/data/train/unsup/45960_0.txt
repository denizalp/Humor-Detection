Ambience =1| Cafeteria style seating-  with blue and yellow colours. Space lacks character.\nService= 3 | No table service, although owner is friendly and welcoming.\nProduct= 2 | Apple Butter burger came highly recommended. The burger patty was dry \/ not juicy, although the toppings had some taste. The burger looked flat and not worth the $5.89 price. Bun was mediocre. Fries were a little oily. The combo with drink came out to $10.48 in total. Price not worth the total experience. It could have been better- as this burger joint consistently receives good reviews. \nPlace has potential as long as food quality stays consistent. That's why it gets 3 stars!Cash is only mode of payment, credit and debit not accepted.
