Horrible airline. Flight was delayed by 45 minutes. Employees at the counter could get a personality. Pilot could not decide if he needs to turn left or right during flight. Extra fees for baggage and carry on. Taxes tacked on to each checked bag. Upcharge of 25 for overweight bags that weigh over 40 lbs. I highly recommend not to use this airline unless you are desparate. The boarding gate area was nasty with garbage everywhere. They ask you on the flight to pick up other people's trash. 1 star is too kind for this airline, but that is the min rating.
