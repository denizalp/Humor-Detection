My, my, my. Eide's survives. \n\nI remember back when they were on Federal Street, a then seedy area on the North Side. I was 11 when I first ventured there. My poor mom waited in the car for me as I clenched a fistful of greenbacks.\n\nThe smell of old paper overwhelmed me, the only kid in the store. I recall finding some back issues of Tales of Suspense for under a buck each, with the price penciled in on the back. This was 1985 of course. \n\nI especially remember snagging Tales of Suspense #84, with all that beautiful, cinematic Jack Kirby art telling the tale of Captain America's clash with...The Super Adaptoid!\n\nAside from their old Etna location, I've visited each incarnation of Eide's (owned by the mysterious and rarely seen Greg E.) numerous times, but I must say that their current location is the nicest store they have ever had. \n\nWhat you won't find is a dark, dank, creepy place run by creepy people. You will not feel as if you are in an adult bookstore. \n\nDownstairs in the comics section, you'll find a treasure trove of back issues, expensive, premium old comics, toys, statues, trades,  DVD's, and everything else 4 color.\n\nDue to not being Downtown much as of late and the fact that the recession and some creative misfires\/ bad editorial decisions have all put a nasty dent in my comics jones, this was my first visit to Eide's in over a year. I walked out with Blackest Night #1-3, Batman and Robin #4, X-Men Forever (LOVE Tom Grummett's art) #1-5 (!), and Dark Avengers #9 (I hate Bendis and his compulsive snowglobe-shaking, but this is good stuff). The clerk behind The Glass Counter of Silver Age Wonder was even nice enough to special order some trades for me (War of Kings and the first two Guardians of the Galaxy trades). According to him, they don't have room for everything, which is understandable. There's so much product out now. \n\nHey, the way I see it, I now have an excuse to stop back in next week. \n\nI will not blow my wad, I will not blow my wad.\n\nThe comics section is overwhelming in the best way. A comics fan could waste a day down there...or two. It's a shame they don't let ya sleep over. \n\nI didn't get a chance to look at any music today, but based on my many previous experiences here and my Hessian tastes in electric noise, it can be hit or miss. Somedays they have more stuff than you can afford in one payday, others it's kinda blah. But man, the imports I used to pick up here. Now, I buy most of my music (and comics, books, DVD's) online, but more on that later. \n\nIt also must be said that whenever I have come here, the staff has always been very helpful. \n\nMy mother of all people has stopped in to fill many a birthday or Christmas list, and she's always raved about the service. In fact, whenever I would go after she did, people would remember her and compliment me on having such a cool mom that was supportive of my interests in comics and heavy metal. \n\nShe bought from Eide's for me THE last Eddie's Archive boxed set left in stock one X-Mas. Thanks Mum. \n\nOh the times I stopped in here after school with my mophead pals or later in my 20's when I had a job and payday had just passed, money burnin' the proverbial hole...\n\nI still miss the jolly giant with the jet black\/red\/blue hair. Even if he wasn't ringin' me up, he'd ALWAYS have to take a look at what CD's I bought....just to see, y'know? When I got the grin and the nod, I knew I was proper. \n\nHey, ya gotta make sure your fellow headbangers haven't backslid into the realm of poor taste. And don't think interventions didn't occur, not with me of course, but I saw 'em happen.\n\n\"Dude. Static-X? Sorry. I can't let you buy this, man. You know better. Someone get this guy some Dark Tranquility...now!\"\n\nLike I mentioned before, I've been the bad guy ordering stuff online. \n\nForgive me father for I have sinned.  \n\nOne time *sniffle* Jim Semonik saw me come in. His eyes lit up. \n\n\"Hey man, we just got the new Celtic Frost in, the new Amorphis, the new...\"\n\n\"Oh. Uh, I got 'em on amazon.\"\n\n*sob*\n\nChalk it up to Catholic guilt. \n\nBeing in Eide's today reminded me of how much fun a comics shop or record store can be to just...haunt. You'll never know what you'll run across and blow yer wad on or what kinds of conversations you'll get into with likeminded folk. \n\nYes, it's happened to me. Particularly the blowin' yer wad part...with payday a long week away. Yup. \n\nEven if you haven't read a comic book in 20 years AND it starred Jughead or you get loose to Barry Manilow and John Tesh, visit Eide's at least once in your life. You'll get lost, won't want to leave, and will probably walk out with something, even if it's just some subversive decal you'll wanna stick on a Republican's car. \n\nHell, even my little sister tagged along once and walked out with a Cyndi Lauper single.\n\nP.S. I hope this was a fitting review\/tribute to this beloved institution of da 'Burgh.
