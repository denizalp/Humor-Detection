I've only been there as a night spot, and like a lot of the 'scene' in Scottsdale, it's overrated at best.  The dj's have been pretty good the few times I've gone.  They have a decent play list and can actually beat mix (kudo's to real dj's), but there really is no place to \"dance\".  Which kind of blows.  There are a lot of revenue generating booths and rooms on what would be a killer dance floor, but then the premium is placed on sitting, nodding (if you have rhythm), and looking disinterested as if you want to be in L.A., but can't afford it.  LOL.  \n\nIf you're with a good crew, any place is fun.  This place on it's own shouldn't be a destination, but if you're with a fun group you'll enjoy it, but won't be dancing much due to lack of space.\n\nThe bathrooms are pretty cool though, they men's and women's bathrooms are connected internally so you kind of co-mingle in there.  Good and bad....that girl you thought looked dope in the 'club light' is lookin' kinda beat in real light hahaha!  \n\nHave fun!
