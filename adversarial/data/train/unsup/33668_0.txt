Tried their lunch special\n\nKung Pao Chicken with steamed rice and hot & sour soup. \n\nNothing amazing to be honest - the soup was missing egg and had an off taste and egg roll had definitely been sitting out so it was pretty stale. \n\nHowever the Kung Pao Chicken was good. \n\nThey have a great selection of lunch special
