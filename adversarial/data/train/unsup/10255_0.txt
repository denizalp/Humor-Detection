CBC doesn't offer many of the things one might be accustomed to getting at other Costcos, but what it lacks in that area, it makes up for in others.  With that being said....if you don't get caught in the trap of implies shopping, you're in and out in no time flat.  Same with the gas station...in and out.  The savings you get on TIME (the most valuable commodity) it's a solid fiver star experience!
