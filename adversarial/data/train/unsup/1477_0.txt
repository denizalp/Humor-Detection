Absolute crap. If I want to spend $65.00 on dinner somewhere it would most likely be somewhere other than a pub. NOT just two club sandwiches on stale bread with fries that tasted like vinegar, although I had not put any on them. Reusing fries guys??\n\nReally bad service although they were walking all over the place. NO THANKS
