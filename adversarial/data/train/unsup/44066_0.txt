Just bought a new Discovery Sport today from Sibel. She was an excellent sales person. In my over 40 years of buying new cars, I have never found an easier, less annoying process than today. From sending a Lyft car to pick me up to showing me the features of my new car, the process was enjoyable and efficient. I was in and out of the dealership in a little over an hour. Nicely done Sibel and nicely done Land Rover Las Vegas! Very happy new customer, signed a fifteen year loyal customer from a certain German car who just became a huge Land Rover loyalist.
