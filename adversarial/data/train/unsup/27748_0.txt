Juan's was amazing. I expected it to be great based upon others reviews and the food didn't disappoint. This is one of the best Mexican restaurant I have ever eaten at. I was slightly concerned about how far away the restaurant was from our hotel on the strip, but the short drive was well worth it. \n\nThe meal began with with free chips and salsa with a few other additions (Bean dip, fried jalapeno, and grilled onions). All of it was delicious. We also decided to order the large guacamole and an order of queso. Both of our appetizers were excellent and came quickly. \n\nAfter a few minutes reviewing the menu, my wife and I decided to get the steak fajitas for two, smothered in Monterey Jack cheese. The restaurant is known for lighting the fajitas on fire table side, which was really neat. The jack cheese was a perfect combo with the steak. The steak was cooked perfectly and was high quality meat.\n\nService during the meal was excellent. The staff was very attentive and stopped by the table frequently to refill beverages and check in. Omar was our server and we enjoyed his service. \n\nThe restaurant and bathroom facilities were very clean. Overall, an excellent experience and I will definitely return.
