Slots are bad here...lol maybe it was just my luck but I love the black jack tables! Came here with some friends and celebrated a birthday as you only can in Vegas! Rooms are cozy and the PH is also a rare treat. Place is kinda confusing in the wee hours as you stagger to make your way back to the room after a night of drinking or just playing the odds all night long. The lounge is a great alternative if the clubs are packed. Its small but at least youre not rubbing shoulders with people next to you.
