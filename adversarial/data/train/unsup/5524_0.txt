So far, this is my favorite pool to date.  Its a bit out of the way for me, but worth the drive.  Here's why.\n\nFor starters, the only downside is that its buried deep in a subdivision.  I never knew it was there until I did a search on yelp & the internet for swimming pools.\n\nSecondly, this place is HUGE and NOT crowded!  Two entirely seperate swimming areas!  One for the kids, with zero level entry, a water slide and a lazy river.  The \"adult\" side of the pool is entirely seperate, and Olympic sized! Holy Moly!  Diving boards, swimming lanes, a basketball hoop and TONS of room to move around in.\n\nThis place, for once, has ample seating! Tons of chairs! Never a problem to find a place to lay out here! Covered seating is also available as well.  Locker rooms are large and plentiful, with lots of toilets, showers, changing areas and lockers for 25 cents.\n\nI will go out of my way to swim here. $2.25 for adults, and kids are much less.  Go check this place out!
