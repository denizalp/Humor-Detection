Hop Central is a brand new craft beer mecca with 36 beers on tap including at this point in time one of there own - a decent not over the top IPA.  Roughly 1\/3 of the taps are IPAs but they run the gambit from lagers and blondes all the way to Belgians and seasonal specialties.  There are quite a few handles from local Arizona breweries plus mostly western US beers and a few imports from Michigan, Pennsylvania (Victory Pils) and the UK and Belgium.  I am sure they will be rotating handles through the year, fortunately the full list is available through untapped.  In addition to beers they offer some wines and a Cider from Mesa's Cider Corps.  There is no kitchen so if you get the urge there is the Szechwan Garden next store and across the courtyard is a well respected Thai restaurant.  Location wise it is in a small L-mall strip center on the SW corner of Rural and Ray and the entrance faces Rural.  With takeout from 2 Asian restaurants next store,  you can solve the equations for getting great craft beer and Asia food simultaneously, plus across the street in the Fry's Plaza there is Pokewave which has an excellent array of Poke.
