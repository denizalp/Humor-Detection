If I could leave negative stars I would. It's right before Christmas, lots of people are shipping packages...so you would think that they would have more than 2 people working. WRONG. 16 people in front of me and 2 workers. \n\nEvery time I come here the employees are rude. If you hate your job so much find a new one. They all have resting bitch face. \nThey need to fire the entire staff and find new people. \n\nThere use to be a real sweet old lady working here but I haven't seen her in awhile :( \n\nThe only reason I come to this one is because it's close to my house...I think I'm gonna start driving further to get hopefully better service. \n\nIf you're reading this go to another post office. Drive a hour out of way...it will probably be worth it.
