OK so this is really a fun review I am excited to add to my Yelp collection!\n\nAt approximately 2am in the morning my Yelp buddy Jon calls and invites me for a bite out. Yes, even though I was already in bed relaxing watching tv, I accepted his invite as I am very spontaneous and always ready to stuff my mouth! OK so I got dressed, he was at my house in 15 or so minutes and we were on our way headed to Pepe's!\n\nI had eaten here once before pre-yelp days. This time was most definitely Yelp worthy, we were craving tacos so tacos we had!\n\nFirst off they are open 24\/7 to satisfy our late night and early morning munch cravings!\n\nThe tacos were good, I ordered a chicken and asada soft taco plate which came with rice and beans. My pal ordered birria soft tacos which were delicious, I have never had marinated goat meat, he gave me a taste of his and those were yummy as well.\n\nReminds me of the street and truck tacos you can get in town, definitely better than the other more commercial Mexican food joints around. \n\nWe had fun sitting, chatting and grubbing! Although the food was great I still have many other taco joints to check out!\n\nMmmm until the next mouth stuffing rendezvous I am out :) Peace!
