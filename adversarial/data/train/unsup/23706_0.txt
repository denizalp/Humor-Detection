I took the 2 week course in the Morning that was taught by the Best informative fun n yet so chill teacher, Greg. I learned the inside n outs of being a Bartender, bar terminology, what it takes to be the best Bartender and he gives you inside tips on preparing you on interviews once you graduate. We also learned alot of drink recipes and We made alot of them drinks we learned with free pouring n counts. I highly suggest this Bartending school if you want to join the Hospitality industry as a Bartender or just to refresh your skills as a Bartender, either way you can't loose.
