Ok, the bad news. Pool area sucks. Here's why:\n1) You can't sit on the chairs by the pool, you have to pay 100 bucks or so to reserve\n2) Pool area is soooo plain and boring (unlike Bellagio pools, even Excalibur and time share pools like Tahiti Village were superb)\n3)Found a huuuuge lonely booger floating around in the pool. haha gross\n\nAnother downer: \nSometimes you get unlucky with a weird movie themed room.\nThe room we got was kind of awkward (Robocop??), especially since our party consisted of my girl and her sisters (contrary to common beliefs, girls aren't fascinated by big mechanical guns). They were like \"Wtf?\"\n\nOther than that, this is the ideal place to come do what y'all come here to do: act a fool, jump on your beds, run across the hotel hallways drunk to your trunks pretending you're Superman wrapped around in a bedsheet cape... at 5 am in the morning.\n\nThe best thing about it all is that you don't have to call a taxi when you're all done with this gorgeous-looking hotel and your legs can't walk for shit anymore, cause HEY GUESS WHAT, you're already home!\n\nI played, got drunk, and crawled back to my room. Day 2, repeat.\n http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/planet-hollywood-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas-2?select=eZgPKosLmpebFi7j6vIaLg#ikcVFZo89s_prL_OsOrrVQ
