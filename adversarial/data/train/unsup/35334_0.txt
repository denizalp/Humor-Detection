RUDE! Rude! rude!!!  If I could give this dive a minus 5 stars I would. Dont expect any service. It doesnt exist. Self service all the way. Want tea? Get up and go to the waitress station and pour it yourself. They dont care. In fact it saves them work. Need an extra chopstick, spoon, takeout box, plastic bag, etc., etc. -- Get it yourself. People here, wait staff here... even the managers are rude af. This is the epitomy of low class, low service, and mediocre dim sum. If you want a place where you get treated like a homeless person you've found it. Never give them a tip. They dont deserve it. Majority of dim sum is soggy and watery. Not cooked properly. The steamed ceramic rice bowls are cooked with too much water. Comes out soggy at the bottom like you're eating congee or porridge. Yeeesh!! A couple of waitresses actually do their job. However, the tall lady with the short bowl cut and the squinty eyes shorter waitress with glasses need a smack upside the head. I speak english, cantonese, and mandarin. Even when speaking cantonese they are very low class, rude, crass, and terse. Their broken crappy english is better mannered. Bottom line if you want \"cheap\" you get \"CHEAP\". In all aspects from food to service. Again, never tip these folks. Dont deserve it one iota. Stay away!!!
