Ah... Whole Foods... Conveniently located in Hazelton Lanes for the rich folk who have nannies shopping for them, for those trophy-wife, stay-at-home mothers who can wake up, roll out of bed, and just go downstairs to grab something before they spend the next 5 hours of the day at the gym to workout their killer bods... All these reasons are why Whole Foods exists.  They certainly picked the right location, because if you're going to make a weekly grocery trip to Whole Foods - you had better have some deep deep pockets!\n\nFor the average white-collar, 9-5PM office worker like me - it is worth it to peruse and occasionally splurge on the many offerings Whole Foods has to offer.  They have a hot bar serving up Potatoes Anna, Quiche, and whatever it is they decide will be offered that day, as well as a salad\/soup bar.  \n\nIt is self-serve and the food is weighed per gram and therefore can be quite pricey.  The quarter-chicken combo is quite the steal, a quarter chicken (dark or white meat) plus 2 sides comes to about $10.00 and is quite filling.  \n\nThey also have a coffee bar as well as a prepared foods counter that is just visually stunning.  I will give it extra points for cleanliness and ease of navigation as everything is neatly stockpiled.  \n\nThe only reason why it gets 3 stars is because once you rip past the pretentiousness of the supermarket, and take out the organic factor, it really is just your everyday supermarket.  They just charge big money for the experience!\n\nIf you do decide to park at Whole Foods, your parking will be validated provided you show your receipt.
