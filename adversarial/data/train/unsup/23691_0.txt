When I purchased my last house in NorthWest Vegas, it was pretty much exactly what I needed: a home with enough yard for my two dogs and myself to get by.  However, a section of the fence was a tall dog-eared wood paneled fence that had long since seen glory days - the previous owner had also attempted to change one of the panels into a giant swinging gate which ended as a disaster: badly nailed up to support itself until someone purchased it and dealt with it.\n\nI reached out online to reviews and found an interesting tidbit about DATF: They're not just implying their work is divine quality but they are religiously affiliated and proud of it.  Which honestly?  Doesn't make a blink of difference to me.  If they're reliable and great quality, then they can believe in flying spaghetti monsters and sing praises to him while working.  I just want a great fence.  \n\nHowever, they were reliable, finished the job early, friendly, professional, and had my fence up in a few days, finishing their work in the blistering sun.  Bonded and insured workers who spoke English and were friendly.  Half up front, half after job.  \n\nI took one star away due to the fact that I asked for them to get back to me regarding a picket fence for the front yard and never heard anything. Oh, well.  \n\nAt this point my fence is four years old, now painted, looks great, and is holding up very well.  Recommended.
