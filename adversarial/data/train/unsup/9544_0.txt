Gorgeous setting! The thermal jacuzzis are surrounded by stone and nature with a beautiful waterfall. I was mesmerized by the beauty here, it's all very well done.\n\nI don't really get why people go here to socialize  ie \"girls time\". To me, this is a place to go with a romantic partner or alone. It's not a club or bar environment where you can chat and \"catch up\". They play soothing music and the sound of the waterfall is really loud and thankfully masks the people chit-chatting.  On the other hand.. they have a group discount for 10 people or more so that kinda contradicts their \"be quiet\" mantra.\n\nI get that it's so close to downtown Montreal and people in Montreal LOVE to socialize but it's really a place for solitude and quietude. Thankfully, the staff is good at letting people know to quiet down. But really, the strong jet sounds and waterfall sounds do mask the talking to some extent but the sounds aren't overpowering or anything either.\n\nYou can request an indoor massage or an outdoor one in the tents. I opted for outdoor :) During my massage, I heard all kinds of birds from the marshland next to the water. One bird (or toad?) sounded like a rubber band, it was so cool. The tent blocked the wind but the sound of the tent swaying with the breeze along with the nature sounds was very memorable.\n\nYes, the showers are very basic but I think they want to discourage people from lounging around in the changing rooms. If you want to lounge, buy the \"thermal experience\" pass for $37-$49. The price varies based on the day and time of day. I've never seen a spa charge to use their jacuzzi if you're getting a service but I can see why they do this as they have invested a lot into their spa and it's outstanding. \n\nIf you just come here just for a massage or service: bring your own robe (call and ask sometimes they provide the robe, weird I know)  and be prepared for a basic shower. \n\nOf course bring your bathing suit if you're going for the thermal experience and flip flops. The products in the shower are good (from Dans un Jardin) but the lotion was a little strong scent-wise (smelled like cotton candy) so maybe bring your own lotion.\n\nThey provide you with a locker key that you keep on a rubber bracelet.\n\nFYI: Friday nights they have an \"under the stars\" event where it turns into a lounge with a DJ.
