Perhaps I am naive, perhaps I expect a little too much from a business that I am spending my hard earned money on.\n\nI realize that this club probably makes enough money to not care what I think.\n\nJust last night (11\/27\/10) My group of 4 comes into the Firehouse, early to beat the crowd and we grab a nice booth.  We get served our drinks by our waitress.  She was nice, but seemed distracted, which surprised me as the place was practically empty when we go there around 9pm\n\nAn hour or so passes, more drinks, the lights dim, the place gets more crowded.  All of a sudden, one of the security staff comes up to our table and says \"this booth is reserved, you'll have to move\".  There was no sign, our waitress never told us about the situation.  Looking around the club, we see no empty tables.  When we mention this to said security guy he just goes \"well, it's first come first served\". No \"sorry\", not one bit of sympathy. In fact, I could be wrong as my emotions are clouding this a bit, but I recall that this guy had a smug look on his face while dealing with us. \n\nThis is just annoying.  Had we known the booth was reserved (are signs that hard to make? do they need a tutorial on MS Word?) we would have gladly grabbed another table since at the time they were plentiful.\n\nWe ask to see the manager, and we speak to someone claiming to be the manager.  After explaining our situation we get a very meek \"sorry\".  No offer of a free drink , nothing.\n\n\nSo many questions linger. Were we not dressed well enough? Were we not spending enough money for their tastes?\n\nRegardless of that however, we did not deserve that treatment.\nOnce again, we rarely go to Scottsdale because of this type of behavior. I blame my self for even going to the Firehouse. It really bothers me that we got treated this way.  I'm not surprised of course, but still upset.\n\n\nI understand that the lines of men and women waiting outside the club to get in will more than make up for the loss our business.  This is why I am very skeptical they will change their practices.  \n\nI don't need to waste my money for subpar service and rude behavior.\n\nPerhaps you'll get better service, we didn't. \nI will never go back and I will take every opportunity to tell my friends and family not to either.
