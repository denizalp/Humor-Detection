If you use your total rewards card, the dinner buffet costs $36.99 per person.\n\nI think it was about a month after it opened. There are some ups and downs to this place but overall, it was a really awesome buffet and I am glad I went. \n\nDo a walk around prior to getting your food. There was a hidden back room that had more food selections. My friend's friend didn't see it and ended up having to eat a whole plate full of food he didn't really want to eat (because he thought that was all the buffet selections they had). \n\nSeafood section: When you get to the frozen crab legs, make sure you go up to the chefs behind the counter and ask them to boil the crab legs for you (only if you want them warm). It was full of meat and it did not disappoint. Raw oyster bar was a bit on the slow side in shucking the oysters. \n\nMeat section: \n-rack of lambs are freaking awesome! My bf doesn't like rack of lamb, but ended up eating more than one piece! It was really juicy and tender and didn't taste gamy. \n-Prime rib was very tender and juicy.\n\nJapanese section: Sushi bar was not impressive. The fish was just odd in color, the texture was more mushy. Just the quality of the raw fish was not up to par.  I would skip that whole section. \n\nItalian section: They are able to make any type of pasta you want. \n-Lasagna wasn't the best, really salty. \n\nChinese section: \n-congee (with thousand year old egg) was really good! I am shocked that the items for the congee was very authentic. \n-xiao long bao was disappointing and dry. \n\nAmerican section: The sweet potato fries, regular fries and chicken strips were phenomenal. \n-sweet potato fries had a sweet glaze, I want to say it was the sugar from the potato, but man... it was good. \n-seasoning on the chicken strips were addicting, not exactly sure what was on it. Also, the mini ketchup  bottle was soo CUTE! \n-Mini burger was cooked to perfection! medium rare and it was hecka juicy!\n\nSalad section: The watermelon with cheese salad was perfectly executed and the beet salad was awesome! Very light and refreshing \n\nDessert: \n-Make your own dessert crepe! Add two scoops of gelato and nom nom nom! I also added some fresh fruit (ask them to slice up some fresh bananas) and drizzle on some nutella! It was bomb!! \nmini cupcakes were disappointing, the texture of the cupcake batter was really spongy and full of holes, the frosting lacked flavor. It was just all bad. \n-Macaroons had a thick layer of filling and it was overly sweet and didn't have a crispier outside. \n-Banana Souffle came right out of the oven and the lady asked me (after asking someone else... who said no) if I wanted one, I said ok. The lady that ended up saying no saw the dish and said she had to get one too. HAHA. The souffle was SOOO GOOD! Make sure you get one when you go to the dessert section!! It was very moist in the center and semi crispy on the top. The banana wasn't over powering and over all the souffle tasted really light. \n\nService was good. Water refill was lacking a little, but they made sure plates were cleared before we came back with more plates full of food.
