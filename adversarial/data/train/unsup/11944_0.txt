I finally got around writing a review on the Excalibur Hotel. This used to be one of our favorite hotels when we go to Vegas with the children. Not until our recent trip to Vegas that we will never go back again. We stayed here for two nights experiencing bed bugs and lack of follow-up from their customer relations team. I would say that guest satisfaction is not that important to them. I would give this hotel a zero if I could.\n\nThe check-in process was quick and easy. If the check-in person could smile a little then it would make the hotel feels much like a fairy tale castle? \n\nTower I haven't been updated\/refinished in many years. The room in Tower I was very stuffy. It seems like they haven't got around to fixing the ventilation in this part of the casino. The first night we went into the hotel and had to move out to Tower II. We couldn't stop scratching our legs and arms because of bed bugs. \n\nTower II is the newer and cleaner side of the casino. We had minor itching in this room also, perhaps had brought the pests with us from Tower I. \n\nI would go to Circus Circus with the children next time, at least the air throughout the casino is fresher and doesn't feel like an oven of smoke. \n\nIn case you wanted to know, we didn't get comp for this experience.
