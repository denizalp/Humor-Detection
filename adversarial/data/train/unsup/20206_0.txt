My culinary trek to Khao San Road was a magnificent one.  The first thing that won me over was the warm greeting from the staff.  Followed by the overall design and great use of space.  The rustic d√©cor made the entire space feel warm and welcoming.\n\nThe food was equally sensational.  Lovedthe fresh kaffir lime breaded coating on the deep fried Garlic Chicken.  The dish came with a nice homemade sweet and tangy garlic dipping sauce.\n\nGra Bong had a nice blend of spices from lemongrass and red curry paste.  Perfectly fried squash with shrimp paste, I can't think of a better way to eat vegetables.  Definitely try this one!\n\nMy significant other had Pad Kee Mao and gave it two thumbs up.  It was well flavored, a perfect balance of smokiness and spices.\n\nPad Gra Prao easily was one of the best I've had in North America.  The key here is freshness from holy basil.  I want this for lunch everyday.\n\nAnother \"one of the best\" was Pad Thai Three Flavors.  Everything about it was lovely.  Well balanced flavors:  spiciness, sweetness, saltiness and sourness. \n\nAll in all, a wonderful way to pass a snowy Saturday evening with some spicy food and good conversation.
