The service here is fantastic. We were seated right away and our server , drew , brought us over waters as we were being seated. The staff is super friendly and were constantly checking in on us \n\nOur food came out quick and was absolutely delicious. The grilled chicken sandwich and turkey and Brie sandwich was delicious as was our fish bowl Mai Tai \n\nI would 100% recommend this sugar factory location to everyone living in and visiting vegas
