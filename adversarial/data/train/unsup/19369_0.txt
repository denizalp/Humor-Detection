Sunday morning - one person manning the register (I assumed it was the owner) with three in the back (all high school aged).  I must say, I was HIGHLY disappointed with my experience.\n\nAs a former New Yorker, I believe I'm a reliable judge of a \"New York bagel\".\n\nPositive: close proximity to home (walking distance), but then again this is not reflective of my experience AT the shop.  So I regrettably cannot provide ANY positves.\n\nNegative: (1) overpriced - paid $27 for 6 bagels with cream cheese or butter, side order of bacon [two strips], sausage [one patty], two coffees, and two OJs!!  (2) SLOOOOW service  (3) ordered six toasted bagels, all six were served right off the shelf  (4) ordered side orders of bacon and sausage - this was \"forgotten\"  (5) when bacon & sausage were served, the bacon was 85% FAT - absolutely disgusting  (6) coffee is self-service without any option for cold milk or cream  (7) SALTED bagel means you should have salt on it - mine was a plain bagel with a few speckles of salt  (8) buttered bagel means there should be butter, not a too-thin-to-see spread  (9) lox cream cheese had no lox\n\nNeedless to say, \"Bagel Bin\" off Ardrey Kell has nothing to worry about ... New York Bagel Shoppe will be out of business within the year if their operation is not drastically improved.
