Just tried the pizza and it was really good. It was made fresh in front of us and was nice and warm when we got it at our table. \n\nIt was a bit greasy but I like it when the pizza is juicy. Slices were thin but not crunchy. \nWe got the four cheese with extra bacon and one of the cheese was blue cheese. It was a bit strong but I liked it. \n\nThe staff is really great. \n\nI will say the seating is less than ideal. They have four tables for two and half of those wobbled. So get to go.
