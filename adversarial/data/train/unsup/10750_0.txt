Yo yo. I'm a true New Yorker.  Raised in Brooklyn, Forest Hills, Queens and Westbury, L.I.  I've spent time in many states across the US and would rate this joint as the closest thing to getting real NY chinese food.\nFolks here in AZ (I've been here for 13+ years) know nothing about duck sauce and fried chicken wings.  They think I'm crazy when I mention them.\nThis is a take-out spot.  The small tables there are for you to wait for your food after ordering by phone.\nTry this spot.  I promise it's great!
