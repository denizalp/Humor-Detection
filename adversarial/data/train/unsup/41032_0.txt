I have been using Carpet Monkeys for almost four years and I won't go anywhere else.  Rick, Joe and Mark are the most professional people I have worked with.  They always fit us in and do an awesome job EVERY SINGLE TIME!  Whether it's an area rug or one single cushion on the couch they always do a great job.  I have recommend them to everyone I know that needs service and they all say the same when it comes to the quality or work and customer service.  \n\nWe always have Joe as our tech and he always is professional and is thorough throughout the entire process.  He even locked up and shut the garage door for us when we couldn't come out because he knew we were feeding the baby, awesome to know people still have integrity and respect.  \n\nWe had Mark today, first time working with him, called me when he was on his way and  showed up on time.  Had some good conversation and he did awesome work as well.  \n\nThese guys are the best in Vegas, they are always reliable and I would recommend them to everyone.  If you need your carpets or upholstery cleaned and sanitized, then the Carpet Monkey's are the ones to call.\n\nThank you guys for a badass job as usual!
