this was the most wonderful show i have ever seen while in Vegas! this show takes you an 60's era with songs like sherry, walk like a man, big girls don't cry.  we got a pretty good deal with travelzoo and the seats were decent and we were able to see the stage perfectly.   I cannot believe it took me so long to go see this show. \nI sang along, danced, cried and was so impressed with the actors.  It was a very memorable show and I would definitely recommend. SPECTACULAR!
