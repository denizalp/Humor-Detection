Luna used to be my favorite restaurant when it was on campus. It has changed. I don't know the reason, but it is just not the same restaurant.\n\nThe last two times in a row that I went there, someone I was with ordered poultry and received it uncooked. I mean purple and bloody, too, not just slightly pink. I swear to god it could have clucked, Each time, a waitress unapologetically whisked the dish away to be cooked further only to bring it back still bloody. I have never seen poultry THAT undercooked in a restaurant before. Ever. And the cooks couldn't even cook it through the second time? The person who ordered it touched the meat and said it was quite cool. For crissake I know the recession is bad, but can they really not splurge for a frickin meat thermometer?\n\nMeat like that should never be served, but the fact that both times it was sent out AGAIN with cold, purple blood-pools inside was just sick. On top of that, the food isn't as good anymore, they took 20 minutes to seat us even though we had a reservation, and they refused to give us any kind of discount even though the meat was not edible! They didn't apologize or act like they cared at all. \n\nIt kills me to write this, but Luna as C-U knew it is gone.
