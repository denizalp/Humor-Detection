Really enjoyed my Oolong crema tea, unlike most who add salted cream at the top, this was added to the bottom and tasted like straight up custard. Super creamy, loved it, no need to add milk. Great tea flavor, would definitely return!\n\nThe boba was not as good as Tea Space. In comparison, Tea Space's boba is more sweet, chewy, and warm. Kung Fu Tea's wasn't quite as fresh or delicious.
