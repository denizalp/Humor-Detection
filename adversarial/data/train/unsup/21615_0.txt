Dave goes to New Mexico part 1.\n\nWell, I already reviewed my home airport - John Wayne, so I will say that I started my long travel day there after the quick drive from home. John Wayne was, as always, clean and pretty efficient.\n\nMy plane landed at Phoenix Sky Harbor at about 10:00.  I was meeting my boss who was coming in from Ontario.  We were heading to New Mexico.  We had about 90 minutes to kill in Phoenix.\n\nThe restaurants are pretty slim pickings inside security at Phoenix.  My boss needed a pair of sunglasses since she forgot hers.  There was no place to buy sunglasses inside security.  Neither of us wanted to leave the secure area because of the lines to get back to the gates.  We just decided to try to find some seats and wait out or layover.\n\nNot my favorite airport experience.
