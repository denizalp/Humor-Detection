WOOOOO!!  One of my fave shows in Las Vegas!!!!!!!  :D\n\nLove the theater, its circular, so everyone has a great view.  I love that they can change the water effect.  Once you see a platform, a while later, its a pool!  \n\nThe show's storyline is easy to follow.  The artists are awesome!!  They are so talented.\n\nI wanna come back again cuz it has been a while...
