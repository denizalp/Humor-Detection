The food is pretty good if you don't mind your server disappearing for 15-30 minutes before you get water. Then again and again and again and we still didn't have an app! Took forever for bruschetta.  No one was going to quicken a step! The people I was dining with said the service was bad the last few times they were their so they left after app's. They said it was inexcusable. And when I asked the staff to please hurry it up because they were ruining our special evening for our friend they just got nasty. Never again!!
