Is this what stuff costs now?  O.K.\nI was sent here by my pedicurist.  She said it was amazing. Gave me a recommendation on what to order. I was skeptical.  I went only because it was on my way home and it was a hot day. Also, I missed lunch.   \nI ordered the Taro topped with red bean and condensed milk. \nIt took less than 5 minutes to prepare. \nIt was delicious! \nI'm a huge fan of red bean.  I thought the taro color and flavor was beautiful, while the sweet milk sent it right into heaven.  \nA small snoh cup is $5.00. Other beverages for sale as well.\nThere are games for the children to play and a TV. \nOutdoor seating available.
