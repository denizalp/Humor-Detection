I've been here a few times - it's an adorable place with AMAZING pie. But today they really outdid themselves. I mistakenly thought they had full size banana cream pies ready to go any time and needed one for a friend's birthday. This is a special order that they actually don't keep ready to go (my mistake) They could have told me tough luck or turned me away. Instead, at 10am on a Wednesday  they did a rush order and whipped one up from scratch in time for our office birthday surprise just a few hours away....  I am so grateful! Thank you!!!  And learn from my mistakes-  call a day ahead for your special orders! :)
