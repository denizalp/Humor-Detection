3 men for every woman, you have to bribe the bouncer if you want to get in, and even then it's a long wait.  \n\nAt 6:10 AM on 8\/16\/14 my friends and I wanted to leave.  A security guy actually refused to let anyone leave and said, \"you have to wait 10 minutes.\"  Have to wait to leave?  He wouldn't say why and when we tried to proceed out the exit, he physically stopped us.  \n\nAvoid this place like the plague.
