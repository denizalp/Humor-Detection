Our experience here was terrible. My husband and I were staying at a nearby hotel and decided to have dinner and a movie. The interior of Wasabi is absolutely beautiful and the staff was very friendly and quick.\n\nHowever, the food was absolutely horrible. Everything was cold. Everything except for the desserts tasted so bad that I wanted to spit it out the second I put it in my mouth. It was also incredibly expensive. \n\nDo not be fooled by how nice this restaurant looks. It is absolutely not worth the $22.00 + drink per person.
