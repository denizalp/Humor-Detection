This is about the worst manicure I have ever had. I went in for a very simple, regular manicure because my nails grow very quickly and I produce a lot of cuticle. I don't wear false nails but I like to keep my hands looking neat. The lady did a terrible job. My cuticles are raggedy looking, she didn't even remove most of the cuticle from the nails. She forgot to buff the nails on one hand and had to backtrack after the oil was applied. she did a half *ss job buffing the nails and she painted OVER polish from the last manicure that wasn't removed totally even after I pointed it out to her.  The corner of one nail was smudged and when I pointed it out she painted over it instead of removing it and reapplying the polish so that nail is bumpy looking. I would never go here again and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I could have done a better job myself.
