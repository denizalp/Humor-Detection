I visited this place of business Monday with my mom and daughter. We were never offered a beverage like the other patrons were. I was offered a cash discount which seems pretty fishy. My mani\/pedi was rushed but came out fine. My 10 year old daughter had a very nice technician who took some extra time to paint a flower on each of her big toes. I feel that my mother was treated badly. No one went to do her pedicure even though she was the first on in the chair. She has swollen ankles due to age and medical conditions that prevented her from being able to roll her pants very high, in fact they got wet. The man who did my mom's pedicure seemed disgusted with her. It was even apparent to my daughter. My mom tried to make the best of it but it is still bothering me. They let her sit in the pedi chair and you could tell by looking at her how uncomfortable she was. She only got a pedi so she could have been led to the front area to sit in the chairs in the waiting area. I got angry. I turned off the dryers on my hands and feet. I helped my mom sit up. Took out the foam thingies between her toes. Helped her down and got her socks and shoes on. I'd like my money back. I'm glad I live so far away or I'd go get it now. Never, ever again.
