I purchased the year membership for my family and paid full price only to find out a week later that there was a groupon for half off! Grrrrr so not happy! BUT I still think it's worth it. I have two kids and so far have gone five times and every time we enjoy our visit.  I do hate paying for parking, however you get a huge discount if you bring your parking ticket to get validated at the front desk, which makes it bearable.  Every time there are fun presentations and different themes throughout the museum.  Members get a little discount, but still have to pay for the imax and the shows such as the D Day movie and grossology section.  The staff is so very nice and fun, very accommodating.  It is well worth it, would definitely recommend it and would suggest to expect to spend 3-4 hours there.
