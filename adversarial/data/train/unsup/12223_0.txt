Highlighting a few items I have a crush on lately has become necessary.\n\nSo everyone with a soul loves ice cream, unless you do have a soul but also a serious intolerance to dairy. Even then, you'll just have to pop some of those magical fast act lactaid pills and get yourself a Chocolate Peanut Butter Pretzel Shake at DLUX. Yes, it is necessary. The rich chocolate ice cream blends with an intense dose of peanut butter in an amazing way, but it's the pretzel that rocks this milkshake. What had once been an incredibly indulgent, yet somewhat typical chocolate peanut butter milkshake is now transformed by the salty deliciousness of the pretzel. Not only does the pretzel offer a flavor contrast, but more importantly it enhances the peanut butter flavor with its salty bite. If unique and bold flavors is what you seek, then this is the shake that will make even lactose intolerant folks jump for joy.\n\nNow sweet potato fries are all the rage these days. And if you're looking for arguably the best of the best, you must make a stop at DLUX. Their sweet potato fries are crisp, yet not fried so much that the sweet potato loses its characteristic sweetness. The fry is cut a bit thicker so as to retain the integrity of the sweet potato. The fries are then served with a scrumptious Sriracha mayo. DLUX, I'm impressed. Sweet potato fries and hipster Tabasco? Props for fueling the latest foodie trends.
