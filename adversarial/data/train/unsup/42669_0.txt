I enjoy going to their venues thru out the valley  the teachers are fun the people you meet are enjoyable you get to buy cocktails food, you get personal attn if needed my only complaint is that there are so many paintings that are tree related.   It is a franchise and I have ck'd other states where there is so much variety I made the suggestion to the site but so far I havent seen too many changes yet I am looking forward to see Septembers calendar but I highly recommend this nite of fun and painting......
