I needed a quick meal for take out and went to Greenberg's Deli.  It was a cool cafeteria style deli, which meant super quick service.  My pastrami on French roll with brown mustard was plentiful, the meat was juicy, and was about what I'd normally pay at a deli.  Not feeling completely ripped off in Vegas is always a welcome feeling.
