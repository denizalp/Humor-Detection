1st things 1st, when going to this location of LBP the 2 things that need to be eaten are: Smoke Meat, it's moist, and tasty, without being to fatty & the Poutine!\nThe gravy is salty, the cheese is squeaky, and the fries are rustic cut. \nI know the US yelpers aren't use to some of this delicious grease but when you have lived here your whole life this dish is like a warm hug!\nA greasy, dirty hug! LOL
