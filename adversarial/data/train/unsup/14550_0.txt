Located right across L.A Fitness! They have pretty good food and I like coming here for tea!\n\nService is just decent, but sometimes there's that really rude lady that looks like she hates the world, so it really just depends on who's working that day.\n\nSome of their dishes are super yummy and unique (mini french toast cubes) but some are just mediocre. My personal favourite is their mini french toast cubes, SUPER YUM!~\n\nOther than that, I can't really think of anything else to say. Their food isn't bad but pretty average stuff that you can get anywhere. Try some foods from their specials menu, some are quite yummy~
