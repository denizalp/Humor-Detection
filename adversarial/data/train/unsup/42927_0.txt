I stopped in there today to repair my Prada Frames . The gentleman was very professional and honest . Where the frame broke I was missing a big piece of plastic near the screw , he said we can repair it , but with this particular circumstance it may not hold throughout the Arizona heat . But for $20 repair , it's worth the gamble . I appreciate his honesty and the quick repair . I will definitely be a repeat customer
