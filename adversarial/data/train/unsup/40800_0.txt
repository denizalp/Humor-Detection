We got seated & our server asked us for our drinks. My sister & I both asked for coffee. He comes back with water. I thought oh maybe he's bringing later. Took him 5 mins to come back to take our order & we after we placed our order. I then asked again to have him bring our coffee. Time passes by and we got our food & still no coffee. At this point, I'm over it & didn't even ask a third time. When we finished we got our bill & this guy charged us for the coffee he didn't even bring to us even after the second time we asked! I like how he forgot twice, but didn't forget to charge it! Not a happy visit.
