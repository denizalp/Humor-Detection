What's not to love? They certainly have a recipe for success - same delicious food, same great service, same awesome beer and wine options, great new location.\n\nWe came for their soft opening, and it was a wonderful evening. The cheese board and bruschetta boards were on point. Naturally, I had myself some lovely bellinis and the main squeeze had some yummy dark beer. The only downside to the evening was that they didn't yet have a couple of the beers on the menu. My fianc√© had to order 3 times because every beer he ordered was not in stock yet. However, you can't really find fault with that since literally 3 days ago this place still had no windows and no interior. They got everything up and running overnight!\n\nNew favorite spot for an easy date night. Plus, it's right next to my salon so I'm probably going to have some bubbly here before I get my hair cut next :)
