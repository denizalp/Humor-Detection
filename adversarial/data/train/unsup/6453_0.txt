After all the great Yelpviews about the LOL wifey and I had to make the trip. Consider us  major fans after one visit. \n\nAs has been written, if you didn't know it was there you wouldn't know it was there, which makes NO sense...but you know what I mean.  There's an old beer joint exterior which turns into a modern beer joint interior simply but tastefully decorated. And while once I lamented damn TV's everywhere, it IS fun to sit at the bar and see what's going on in the world. \n\nBut what captured our interest more than the TVs was the menu; what a boatload of creativity is happening here. While it was enchilada night we went another direction. I got the Sturgess Burger which had pulled pork and bacon (pig fest--Symon would have loved it) on top of one damn good burger. Wifey had the Reuben which probably could have fed a small Somali village. Damn, they're generous with the goodies.  And while I didn't have any, she said the sweet potato tots are as yummy as yelpists claim.  Add a beer and the whole thing plus tip was $30.00. And it was VERY VERY well spent and worth every penny. \n\nWe are really looking forward to going back and trying many of the other fun things on the menu. \n\nFolks, this is another CCG (Cool Cleveland Gem) that you're going to love once you get there. We LUV supporting the brave and creative locals who make wonderfully fun places like this happen, so GO SUPPORT the LOL! \n\nCool.
