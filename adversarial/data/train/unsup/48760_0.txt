After living in BC we still talk about their burgers. While driving back to Phoenix last weekend, we called in an order and choked down on our drive home. \n\nThe buns have changed, but that's about it. Still my favorite burger anywhere. I always get the pit special with cheese. They have a perfect ratio of burger to cheese. I'm telling you. Pit Burger yummy. \n\nThe fries are good and don't forget the fry sauce. They also have great ice tea. My daughter worked here back in the day and never had anything gross to say. \n\nThe fish and chips are also great!
