Not really a bad place to go on half-price burger night, which is either Tuesday or Wednesday.  They serve cheap pitchers of beer every night.   I wouldn't tell you to stay away, because it's very cheap and the service was pretty friendly.   But be aware this is a dive, although not quite as divey as it looks from the outside.  They have a pool table and the when we were there a guy was smoking the whole time he was playing.  So the Health Code is apparently not a big priority.  \n\nFor a cheap bar\/restaurant in the Falls, try River City Grill or Jimmy Biggs.
