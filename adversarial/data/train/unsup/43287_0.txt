This place is definitely a hidden gem. Clean and welcoming environment and lovely staff. At 11pm on a Saturday this place was like a blessing. We ordered the meat lovers pizza. Definitely the best choice ever!! For people who prefer halal food , the menu has everything a fast food lover craves. Highly recommended, will definitely return on our next trip to Vegas
