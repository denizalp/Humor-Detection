After exhausting myself exploring Total Wine I walked out the door and I was famished!! *growl goes my tummy*\nI walked out the door and low and behold I looked up and to my right and there it was::: Aaaaahhhh!!!!!! Chick-fil-A!!\nI couldn't get there fast enough! \nAs always my experience at each Chick-fil-A always begins with a very welcoming, sunshiny(even at night!), happy greeting... this was no exception.\nfrom the perfectly crisp waffle fries, to my chicken sandwich with extra pickles to the bright-eyed and bushy-tailed employees... I can always count on familiarity even when I'm out if town on vacation.\nThank You Chick-fil-A for doing a swell job!!! \nYour employees are some of the best!!!\n\noh and a quick note:  if Ya'all (using my southern accent I picked up last week in Memphis) haven't tried the Frosted Lemonade...oohhhh.. you're in for a treat!
