Holy moly, this food is FREAKING INCREDIBLE. I came in starving and I'm so glad that my friends and I stopped here. The apple jam is BOMB and the freaking syrup is heavenly. The cocktails are delicious. I want to bring everyone I know here. Christina, our server, was so helpful and cheerful that we felt right at home. I've never felt so taken care of at a restaurant before. Top five best restaurant experiences ever!
