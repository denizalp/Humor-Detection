Let me start by saying, I can't stand having my eyes touched. Period. I avoided lash extensions for all these years, fearing the amount of time spent on someone touching my eyes. When Raina, who's been waxing me for years (seriously, the absolute best in the business. If she can do a Brazilian on me, and have me come back- she's already winning the game) mentioned the lash lift, I was hesitant. \n\nI am SO glad I went this route, and I am hooked now.  As someone who curls their lashes literally everyday, and wears minimal makeup now that I'm 35+, this is LIFE CHANGING. I DONT EVEN NEED MASCARAAAAAAA anymore. \n\nShe kept me laughing the whole time, and made me feel so comfortable despite the anxiety eye-touchery (it's a word now) gives me. It wasn't even annoying. She waxed my brows and lip while the lashes were working their magic and all my \"business\" was handled while it set. \n\nYou HAVE to try this. Lash lifts for everyone!!!
