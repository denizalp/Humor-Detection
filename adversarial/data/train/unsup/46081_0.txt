Great place!   Not mechanically inclined, but these guys have helped me rebuild both my hubs.  This is truly a unique place, with a great team. I visit Phoenix monthly and make it a point to stop by and tinker with my bike when in town.  Each time I learn about my bike, how it works, which helps me ride better.  Also, the cost is amazingly inexpensive.  They have new and used parts as well.  Can't say enough good things about the place.
