Well, well Market Square Park--it looks like you had some work done. Oh, don't be shy, there's nothing wrong with a nip here and a tuck there. \n\nIt was honestly a little difficult for me to see the old park get knocked down when all of my first WSM memories involves hanging out over there. In fact, I remember taking a school field trip all the way from Painesville City just to shoot our high school newscast from the Market. Afterwards we all came out and took pictures in the park underneath those weird awnings. But since then, its been a long, long time since I felt like I could enjoy myself at Market Square park without the smell of urine, seeing human feces in the corners and just feeling safe as a young woman. \n\nNow, I couldn't be happier! To see the park redone, packed to the gills for the WSM centennial celebration--it definitely has new lease on life! First, the built in stage is awesome! I'm hoping to catch some great, live shows here this summer. It's not huge, but hell, it's perfect for the area and I think it's way better than before. I also love that there's nowhere for folks to hide to use the potty in public. That may sound mean, but this is our city, people. We all want to be able to use the public areas to the fullest potential. The tables are great for grabbing some messy noms from the Market and grabbing a seat, although I wish there were even more areas to do so. \n\nI think with the new Ohio City ambassadors and the park renovations, this is going to once again be a place that all Clevelanders can enjoy! Don't miss out on the new series of Open Air Markets hosted every Saturday afternoon this summer, as well. We'll just keep Market Square Park at 4 stars for now until we see how everything unfolds.
