Tuesday evening my bff and I arrive just after 6 pm. We were cautious upon trying this place after some of the negative reviews, but being me, we had to give it chance.\nThe restaurant has 2 tables & bar-like seating along one side, very small space.\nI approach the cashier & he hands me a menu in which to order from, \nFIRSTLY informing me that they're sold out of bread... so much for my pulled pork sandwich I was craving for!!! and NO chicken wings either... The excuse \"oh it was busy for a Tuesday, so we sold out\", This line doesn't work for me.  For me, it simply translates to \"you haven't got your kitchen or staff in order\".  So then we ordered the pulled pork & beef brisket 1\/2 pound each, four corn bread muffins & fresh hand cut fries... $30 dollars later!!!\n\nFirstly the meat, these people should NOT be doing bbq, I'm sorry but if you want good brisket ... Aft.\nPulled pork not tender enough, long stringy strands and served in a CUP??. Appearance reminds me of an old mop head, cannot account for the taste either... what the heck kinda sauces are they using??\nCorn bread ... too dry...no taste\nFries. Oily & undercooked\n\nWe didn't finish our food, had lids to pack it up & we head over to plan B... The Stockyards for some great customer service, juicy fried chicken & pulled pork sandwich ....ON A BUN!!!
