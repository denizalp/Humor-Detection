During the day shift it is a pretty cool club. $10 floor dances and the drinks are the cheapest in the brookpark road area.  There is an old man that walks around reminding you to keep your hands off the dancers during the day.  Free admission before 4pm.  They also have an upstairs VIP section that costs $20 to enter and $20 a song up there for lap dances.  Overall a fun place but I would only come here during the day as I heard it gets pretty ghetto at night.  They open at 2PM and they schedule the dancers to be there at 1:30PM so they are ready to entertain the first people that walk in the door by 2PM.
