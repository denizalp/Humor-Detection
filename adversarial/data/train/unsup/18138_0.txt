$100 a night was the deal which included a $25 food voucher.  Not a bad deal.\nHowever, here's what we got.  As soon as we checked in, we got hit with a $20 fee per night for pool and \"wi-fi\".  I put wi-fi in quotations because it was actually ethernet without a desk.  Luxor wi-fi does not exist.\n\nHere's what we got in the room!  A toilet that wouldn't flush correctly, a bathroom light that stopped working on our final night of our stay, an iron without an ironing board, and a crappy AC unit.  No coffee, no fridge, but we did have a lovely, gigantic, tear in the wallpaper with bare studs to enjoy.\n\nWe thought the $25 food voucher would be nice, but it was only for their most expensive restaurants, Tender and Rice.  Tender, which was business attire only, and Rice which was $10 per nigiri order.  ::roll eyes::\n\nThe best part was that the TV shut off right at the 11:00 checkout time, tacky!\n\nIt felt like an overpriced motel that smelled like pot.  Yuck!\n\nI feel as though Luxor is on it's way out.  There is nothing Egyptian about it inside, but they do have an Aztec pyramid! ::shrug::\n\nThough I will say from an architectural standpoint.  It's a giant BLACK pyramid in the DESERT.  The most surface area in the best color to absorb as much heat from the sun as possible. Bravo!
