I have loved this place prior to trying to exchange a tarp that had torn after the first use. Cashier had said grab another one and we will exchange. After taking the tarp up to the counter I was told that the tarp wasn't a manufacturer default, it was the user's fault. I had had my other tarp for over 8 years and this one couldn't last one trip. Now I know the exchange policy, or do I??
