One of my favorite places to stay in Vegas while with a large posse of girls. \n\nStaff are always SO friendly-- their smiles and greetings are always genuine.  I typically stay in one of the suites... why is it that these things always have huge foyers?  Total waste of space, not that the luxury suites really need more space...
