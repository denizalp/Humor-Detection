What can I say about this wonderful place that has not already been said? I mean, the monastery and connected garden are breathtaking, most of the food is top notch, and the company at the table is always the best Yelp has to offer!\n\nI have gone two months straight now, and both time I have brought my boyfriend. After the first time, we were walking back to the car when I asked him, \"So, did you like it?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nDo you want to come back next month?\n\n\"...Yes....\"\n\nWOW!!! Ok, ok, it may not seem like that most enthusiastic reaction, but from my boyfriend, that really means something! If you can impress him, and make him want to get up at 8am to eat Thai food (he works nights and never likes to eat breakfast), then I know something has gotta be good. His favorite things are the Pork BBQ Skewers. He seriously bought 10 the first time.\n\nI personally come for one thing and one thing only.... THE ROTI!! I know everyone else is all geeked-up over the Curry Puffs. And yes, the curry puffs are oh-so-delectable. But that Roti is what I find myself craving every month. I have figured out how to make it, but I have not figured out where to buy pre-made frozen roti bread..... Hmmmm. \n\nThere are many other tasty treats that await you. The Pad Thai is good here, I have had better, but for being made in a parking lot, it's a damn fine job. There are Thai Ice Teas and this soup that is a lot like Pho, there's Sticky Rice, Tapioca Dumplings and many other sweet\/savory things, so much deliciousness. You just have to get up early and try it for yourself.
