I went on a Saturday afternoon near closing - at 3 PM! If the wait had been long, there would have been some serious star lossage. The hours are exceedingly lame. \n\nThe interior is pleasant and clearly well-contemplated. The wood-fired oven is massive and center-stage as it ought to be. Just as the center piece of all of the food here is the freshly baked bread. \n\nThe selection of sandwiches was lame. I believe there were three. They are all basically salads on bread. Healthy, simple, and fresh, yes. Satisfying variety, no. \n\nI got the Caprese. It was very good. Of course, the crispy, perfect bread, fresh buttery mozzarella, and fragrant basil was a scrumptious melange. The salad greens and oil was lame-o-rific. Bland oil dressing. \n\nExpensivo. \n\nI wish there were more restaurants like this - competition would breed better prices, better hours, and more selections. \n\nI'll be back if I DON'T have to wait in line.   Update - back again several times.  Always fantastic.  Only want to take off 1\/2 star lamenting lack of variety.  I do respect the KISS method - keep it simple, stupid.\n\nGo to Lux and get a killer hot chocolate, tea, chai, or coffee.
