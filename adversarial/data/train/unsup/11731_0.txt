I have been a customer from the day they opened way back when...could be 10+years.  Experience is mostly at the upstairs bar \/ patio during happy hour but I have sat down to several formal meals in the restaurant and would also rate them at 4-5 .  The servers have changed over time as has the menu slightly, upgraded interior decor was well done.   The expanded all day Sunday happy hour has landed Kona solidly back on the Sunday rotation.
