The last thing I noticed, sadly, was that they haven't had a BodySafe inspection in 2 years. I think it's time for a little refresher on their part, so I've made a complaint to Toronto Public Health. I walked in to see one of the staff members doing a threading and holding a lot of the thread in her mouth. That's flat out disgusting. Threading can open tiny holes in the skin and someone's mouth germs going in there? GROSS.  Yes, I realize that's historically an acceptable method, but #sorrynotsorryhere, this is 2018 and we have a lot of knowledge now about infection control. This is not a safe standard taught in Canadian cosmetology schools. \n\nThe woman who did my threading did not clean her hands after the last client\/handling money or before the next. I had to ask her to go WASH them and she was shocked that I would not accept that she use sanitizer only. They clearly double dip in the wax pots. I noticed the stuck hair on them as I sat waiting. There was dust and hair everywhere. Lots of dust collecting personal articles all over. Very poorly kept and dimly lit place. The threading job was so-so. She did not do the clean ups on the right eyebrow as requested. The brows did not have the sleek and tapered look I have gotten in other salons. I had to tweeze some strays. Will not return, regardless of the price.
