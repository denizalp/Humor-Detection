My friend tried to replace the pet damage on my carpet and it was horrible. I called a few other places that quoted my damage for ridiculous amounts. I finally found carpet monkey on yelp and the repair guy was so accommodating and helped me out so much! I'm scheduled for a carpet steaming in a week. I highly recommend this place!
