Sunny SnoBalls isn't the first place that's combined Shaved Ice + Ice Cream . . . \n\nBut damn, they do it well. \n\nSaw Missy F. check in here a couple months ago and have wondered what's the difference between Shaved Ice + New Orleans Style Shaved Ice.\n\nWell, finally got the opportunity to experience it! \n\nFirst of all, yeah . . . It does take a while for them to bring out your creation. But it's worth the wait.  \n\nAnother thing, unless you really want a LOT of shaved ice - The kids size was perfect for me. Small might be a good option too. \n\nMy first visit, I got the Peach Shaved Iced, stuffed with vanilla ice cream. The perfect treat on a blazing day.\n\nAndrew C. and I came back a few weeks later. Tried the sweet and spicy with the tamarind straw. While the spicy cinnamon ice was right up my alley, I could have lived without the salty as heck straw. \n\n$3.00+ for some shaved ice is a little steep, but it was nice to shake things up from the normal Froyo shop visit.\n\nRecommended!
