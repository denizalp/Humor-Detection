Ugh.  Terrible service (our waitress dropped our menus on the table while carrying on a conversation with the people at the next table) and the food was awful.  The pizza tasted like something out of a box, and we couldn't bring ourselves to finish the sticky toffee pudding--and it was the dessert our waitress had recommended! I don't want to imagine what the less-favored options taste like.\n\nI hear there are lots of attractive people here during happy hour, so maybe that's what keeps bringing people in the door, but we didn't have any such luck the night we went.
