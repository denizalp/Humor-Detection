I'm scared to admit that I never watched America's Best Dance Crew!! But I've heard of Jabbawockeez so don't kill me!\n\nThis is one of the best shows I have seen in Vegas. It was funny, entertaining, and made me want to get up and bust a move after it was done. Unfortunately seeing the show does not improve your dancing at all. Sad face. I loved the smaller theater. It was intimate and virtually every seat was a good seat.\n\nYou've seen a bunch of Cirque shows while in Vegas, now go and see Jabbawockeez!!
