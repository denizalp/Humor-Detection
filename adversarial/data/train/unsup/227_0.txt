La Pizza is a good option for late night bites and getting a quick fix of pizza when staying at Paris. They have a deal which is 2 slices of Pizza for $9.99 with a fountain. The only thing to beware of is that the pizza selection although there is a wide variety, it is very limited late night minus a star for that because they were out of the one I wanted to try. There is ample seating along this pizza joint out front and plenty of seating inside as well. The ambiance is nice with the Paris feel and decor along the path of other restaurants nearby when seated along that path or even from the inside dining area. Service is just okay.. it's just like your average quick pizza joint nothing fancy and straight to the point.. tasty pizza! ;P
