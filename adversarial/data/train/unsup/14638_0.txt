My first time in Calgary..and I am sooo glad I found this place online. \n\nSee, I'm the type of gal who hates going to big named chain restaurants...\n\nOEB is completely the opposite. It's chic, warm and cozy, and inviting....they have a wooden counter-height long bar table in the middle of the room, accented with beautiful modern light fixtures under a unique chalkboard ceiling with all the breakfast things and sayings you could possibly think of. \"Great Eggspectations\"...\n\nThe vibe was great. And morning vibe is quite important, right?\n\nMy boyfriend and I came here twice. \n\nFirst time, i had....\n\n*Mariposa Farm Foie Gras Poutine : I swear to God, the world turned silent on my first bite of that lovely foie gras sitting on top of the box. Sure. $24 may be too steep for a breakfast meal...But it was totally worth it for my money. At that point i didn't care. Give me the foie gras. And I'm happy. Not just that.. it totally blended well with the poached eggs and the cheese curds and the black truffle.. The hollandaise sauce is intensely gratifying. The combination of it all was foodgasmically sparkly to the tastebuds. It was heavenly..It was like eating with anything fictional..like unicorns and fairies and princesses. I seriously didn't feel guilty after. (okay maybe a little the next day when i wore my bikini to the hot spings)...\n\n*The Soul in a Bowl: The name describes it very well... If I die, i'd let my soul wander and be part of a box this delicious. The bacon...the brown butter hollandaise...the poached eggs....the crisp but moist potatoes... OMG. Cory devoured everything.\n\nOur second trip here...i got...\n\n*The Gold Digga: Poached eggs, herb potatoes, cheese curds, crisp PORK BELLY, black TRUFFLES and brown butter hollandaise. WHUUUUUUT! again. i suffered from major food coma and sat silently in the car for two hours trying to recuperate my breathing. Amazing. The pork belly was crisp!!!! it wasn't hurried in the pan to fry.. it took it's time to work it's magic...to steam out it's taste..and golden up it's fat. that's what i like.\n\n*Farmer John's Delight with a side of pancake: so i guess Cory ordered the girly plate this time. But man..their pancakes are the best i've had EVER. the edges are crisp and the middle is fluffy and light. It wasn't greasy. It was very tasty....\n\nI SUPER RECOMMEND. Writing this review was tough. I salivated with every sound of my keyboard.
