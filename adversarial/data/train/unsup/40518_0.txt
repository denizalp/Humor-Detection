I love coming here, instead of that cold feeling you sometimes get at a dental office it's warm it feels like you are coming to hang out with friends for a hour. VERY GENTLE HYGIENIST, my teeth feel amazing after and such a welcoming and kind doctor! Plus my husband who had a fear of the dentist not only had a great experience he no longer drags his feet when he has to go! It's been such a pleasant experience and I would recommend them to anyone!
