I wanted to go back since the 1st time was so good.\nWe tried all new dishes.......\nChicken wontons a little doughy, but good. \nPesto Edamame delicious as long as you like salty.\nFish Salad on papaya slaw......dressing was a sweet chile that ran to the bottom of the bowl and did nothing for the generous piece of fried fish and chewy slaw.\nGreen Papaya salad with tofu....too similar to fish salad and the tofu has no flavor since they don't seem to marinate it.\n\nI would definitely go back for the nHouse Dynamite I had last time and the Pad Thai that was also delicious last time.\nToday was a bust.\n\nLast note....the music for the lunch crowd should probably be different than the happy hour crowd.  We didn't enjoy it at all.
