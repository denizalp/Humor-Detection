A little hard to find but well worth it. Tried a hot mocha, berry spritzer, cinnamon roll, and an apple \"toptart\" (homemade Pop Tart). Great prices and a homey atmosphere with plenty of tables and a neat aesthetic. The woman working the counter was really nice and the pastries were super fresh and tasty and re-heated in the toaster perfectly without us having to ask. The mocha was really creamy and well made and the berry spritzer was fresh and refreshing. I wish this was closer - I would definitely be a regular.
