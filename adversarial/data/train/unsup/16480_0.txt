We made a reservation for this Hot & New restaurant in the 7th Street corridor last Thursday night to check it out!  We were seated at the best table in the restaurant...inside, but right at the doors to feel like we were outside.  The atmosphere was lively, the service was super friendly and fun and the food was delicious and hearty.  \n\nI started with an El Presidio cocktail with vodka, pear, grapefruit and elderflower (so yummy), shared a spinach salad with cheese, pancetta, mangos and tomatoes with my hubby (loved that they split it for us) and each enjoyed our seafood risotto and beef risotto too.  \n\nWe'll definitely be back when we're looking for Italian comfort food at reasonable prices!
