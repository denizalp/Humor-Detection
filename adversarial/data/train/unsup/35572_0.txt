Organicare is, by far, the absolute best dry cleaning and clothing experience I've ever had! The owners and staff have the best customer service - amazing! I worked w\/Mariah and Brad. My clothes were actually picked up by a well-trained, professionally dressed concierge and returned promptly.  Now, the clothes were spotless.... And there was a note on one of my shirts that I had stained w\/a coffee dribble that said, \"Sorry, we tried but couldn't completely get the stain out\".  But I searched the crystal white shirt and couldn't find a trace if the stain! Best quality cleaning and service in the industry. Zero hesitation in giving 6 stars to Organicare in a 5 star rating system! Everyone should have this experience at least once in their \"dry cleaning life\"... Call them!
