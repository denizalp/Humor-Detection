The worst water park I have ever been to in my entire life...and I am not exaggerating. The park only has 5 rides, and 2 were shut down. Even though 40% of the rides were closed, we paid full price. Unacceptable! The park wasn't very busy either, yet it took us 25 minutes to go through one ride. Poorly executed rides. I'm all for safety, but this was beyond that. Save your money.
