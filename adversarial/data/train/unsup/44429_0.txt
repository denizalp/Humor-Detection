Quite surprised by the quality of food here.  It was top notch and everything was tasty.  We tried a few rolls, different apps and everything was worth it.  The only thing I thought was not worth the price for the app was the miso black cod, came out very small and not worth the price.  After 10pm a pitcher of Sapporo was $11 which is an amazing deal.  Will come back again!
