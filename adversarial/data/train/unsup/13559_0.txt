I checked out a couple of other gyms but, no where else compared. I have been with this gym for just over a year now & they make me look forward to coming in every morning to work-out. This place is truly unlike any other gym I have ever step foot into & it all starts with the owners. Who truly love their gym & the people who join. Shelly is a bright bubbly burst of energy & Yak is a man of business with a huge heart. They go above & beyond to make sure that the clients are happy. The reason I stay, the reason I enjoy coming in every morning is the people who work-out here there is nothing but, positive energy in the air from the moment you walk in the door.\n   Add all of that with their phenomenal facility from the dance\/exercise room which includes medicine balls, yoga mats, a FOAM ROLLER, exercise blocks, various resistance bands, and so much more. They even hold night exercise classes for those who just want to SHAKE THINGS UP!! If you are looking for free weights well they have it all, clean organized & everyone in there is respectful of the equipment. They have all the cardio you could possibly need. \n    I could say SOOOO much more about this place but, I will leave it at that! Come check out Yaks for yourself! See the facility, meet the owners & you will find no other place in town that matches it.
