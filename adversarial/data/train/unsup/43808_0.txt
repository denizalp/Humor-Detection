Food is a definite 4.5 stars\nMy experience last night brought my rating down to a 3.\nI was beyond exited for Naked Coty Pizza to open right down the street from me in Mnt Edge. I had been to their original location inside Moon Doggies and was a fan!! (Not to mention they were featured on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives....huge fan of that show too)\nSo what happens when it's pouring down rain all day and the mommy doesn't want to cook...you order pizza of course.\nI looked on Yelp at the reviews and menu and the NCP website where they suggested Uber Eats so I downloaded the app and was ready to order.\nI placed my order around 5pm and the app said delivery would be around 556pm.... perfect timing because I usually do dinner around 6pm!!\nLet's talk food... I ordered one 1\/4 sheet which is 6 slices and two 1\/2 sheet pizza along with wings and fingers and garlic fries. \nFood is on point sauce on the pizza is a tad salty and pizza could have used a couple more toppings but whatever it's freaking good!!!\nNow to the problem.... like I said Uber Eats quoted delivery around 556pm and I know it's not always accurate but my delivery time jumped to 651pm at the time I was supposed to be receiving my food.\nAfter 2 calls to Uber Eats they finally were told by the restaurant that they didn't see my order so they hadn't made it so that's why they added an hour to my time.\nI get it mistakes happen but they could have called...it was their mistake.\nAnyway we finally got our food around 642 and we were so hungry I didn't take pics but trust me when I say it's GOOD!\nI will order again and hope we get the food on time.\nBest of luck NCP you have a great product!!
