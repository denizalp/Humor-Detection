When something in your home brakes and that something is an appliance it really sucks! It's expensive and a hassle to fix it. But then I found these guy's on line. They were patient, pleasant to talk to over the phone, and were knowledgeable about the appliance and the parts needed to fix it. Within 3 days the part had be ordered and delivered and installed into my home. The installation technician was very kind. He worked fast and clean. When I had a concern the tech was able to address it and gave me reassurance in the product but more importantly in their company. I also had a concern about the color of the product. I didn't know the part came in different colors and I was concerned about the look. They told me that if I want to change the color they would be happy to exchange the item and they would find the one I want. They made this stressful moment easy and stressfree.     \n    I will  definitely recommend them to all my friends and family. I will absolutely contact them again when an appliance brakes or needs service. I was also pleased with the priceing. They actually came in under what I had anticipated paying. I would like to say a special thanks to my installation technician Mario Molina you are very kind and welcome back to my home anytime. \n        Thank you APC, \n                      Randi
