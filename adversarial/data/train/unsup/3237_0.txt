Salad Creations is the bastard child of Cold Stone Creamery and Sweet Tomatoes.  They even have a crazy spatula-esque contraption to chop up the meat into more bite-sized pieces within your salad.\n\nI'll admit, I was slightly overwhelmed at first, but it wasn't too confusing and the employees are incredibly patient and helpful.  So I decided to have the full sized salad, which ended up being much bigger than I could actually handle.  Next you choose the greens from four different bins hanging behind the the employees: mixed greens, romaine, spinach, and ugh, iceburg.  \n\nThe employee puts the chosen greens into a large mixing bowl, and adds as many options as you choose.  I believe the menu said there were 40 options, but I'm not sure if that included the meats and dressings, or if it was just the vegetables.\n\nMeat costs extra and they have handful of varieties of them.  Shrimp and Wild Alaskan Salmon cost extra. **record screech** Did I just see Wild Alaskan Salmon? Not that crappy farm-raised garbage that is full of pesticides and other toxins?  Whoa!  Now I'm impressed.\n\nI take my lovely salad down to the register and decide to splurge on a cookie.  The cashier points out to me that the cookie is outdated, but says that if I still want it, it's free. BONUS!  And even though that cookie was dated the day before I bought it, it was a moist and incredibly delicious oatmeal raisin cookie.\n\nMaybe eventually I'll tire of this place for salads, but with so many possible combinations of veggies, meat and dressings, I'm guessing it won't be for awhile.
