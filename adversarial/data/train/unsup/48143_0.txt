Don't be put off by the exterior of the place, which looks pretty sketchy, once inside its nicely laid out with indoor\/outdoor seating. Lots of beverage choices and a menu that skews with an Asian fusion approach to its offerings. I found the service very good and it seems to be a good place for cocktails and hanging out.
