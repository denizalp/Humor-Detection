What's not to like?  Beautiful garden seating!\nLove that is BYOB, so bring along your favorite bottle.\nWe had a group and were told we had 2 hours to eat before the next group when we made the reservation.  That is good that it was communicated, but the group before us was 20 minutes late in leaving.  We were taken to a waiting area and asked and received some wine glasses so we could relax.  \n\nWe shared a few appetizers.  The golden bag were interesting, the grilled pork meatballs on a skewer came with some nice sauce to dip, and how can you go wrong with anything tempura so we had the tempura veggies.\n\nI had the Spicy Duck Noodles at level 5, which was just about right.  I like spicy food but want to taste the food too. The duck was tender and the noodles and sauce were very good. SWMBO had the pad thai with shrimp that was very good and not as much a fan of spicy chose level 4.  I managed to get a bite and the shrimp was good but the spice level was higher than 4 probably closer to 7.  \n\nPG has a great garden and good food.  Nice place for a relaxing meal.
