I learned that a bowl of warm and gooey mac and cheese is just as satisfying as a bowl of chicken noodle soup on a cold day.  After playing in the snow on Mount Charleston, had the mac and cheese with hot dogs and potato chips crumbled on top.  Kids had regular mac and cheese.  It was a fine meal indeed.  Lots of other choices for a pasta-based meal so don't be tricked by the name of the place.  Will definitely return and try the other versions of mac and cheese...but only when it's cold.  I know, silly, but that's me.
