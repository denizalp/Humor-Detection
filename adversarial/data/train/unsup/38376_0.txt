We did the Dr. Jones room and had a blast! Have done both Mad Scientist and the Chocolate Factory (Strongsville location) rooms before and, while I loved all of them, the Dr. Jones room was my favorite! In this room, my group was able to get started on solving clues right away, and didn't feel like it took us a bit to know what we were looking for. A great beginner room! We came very close to escaping but were just a couple clues short! We will definitely be back in the future!
