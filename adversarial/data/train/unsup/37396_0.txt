My kids and I were really excited about going here,  but ultimately we all left disappointed with the experience.  Not being TI guests we bought discounted tickets on Travel zoo.  The check in line wasn't very long ,  but still took us 20 mins to get set up.  We decided to use our phone to d\/l the free app and the set up was easy enough.  We then were told to go to an unmarked area and we all just stood there for another 15 mins without any explanation of what to do next.  After finally complaining to a not very enthusiastic worker,  we were finally led up to the exhibits.  No one was around to help us navigate the overly difficult app and we had no idea what we were supposed to do.  We just gave up on it as it just got in the way.   The info on the avengers was detailed, but not anything you couldn't find online.  Some of the memorabilia was cool.  The iron men were the kids favorites.  Most of the interactive stuff was very weak and the ending fight with ultron was extremely lame as there were too many people in the room and the girl explaining what was about to happen acted like her cat just died.  She sucked the life out of the room.  This just dumps you back into the retail store to get you spend more money.  If you can get in free as a guest of the TI,  it's ok.   Having to pay $25-35 a person is a complete ripoff unless you're just a hardcore avengers fan.  The awful staff just made the exhibit even worse.
