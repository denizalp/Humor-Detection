After reading my fellow yelpers reviews for this place we decided to come here for Sunday dinner. We were not disappointed. \n\nThe Ambiance was great, it was clean and inviting (liked the window shatters).\n\nThe  Service was good and timely. We were seated and served right a way'\n\nThe food was delish! I got the Beef Pad Kea Mow, loved it!\nMy daughter had Beef Pad See-ew it was really tasty and she enjoyed it.\nThe Chai tea was good too.\n\nWe will be back soon!
