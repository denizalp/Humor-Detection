All Holiday Inns are equal. Some are just more equal than others (Sorry, Mr. Orwell! You deserve better). This HI has the sort of quirky character that most run-of-the-mill ones do not. It has an English-y pub\/restaurant inside, it is w\/in walking distance to a Bahá'í  Center AND the Bata shoe museum (how often does that happen?), and it is pretty much on the UofT campus. The downstairs computers were OK, as was the WiFi in the rooms, the staff were helpful about places of interest and provided city and metro maps, the central heating kept me warm at night, and in general things were pretty fine. I would go back, but I'd prefer to stay with friends!
