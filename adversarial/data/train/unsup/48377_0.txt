Tasty food, friendly folks. We ate here at the start of Nuit Blanche. We had the shrimp tacos and the porchetta. The tacos were full of bright, fresh flavours and the shrimp was tender. It's served cold, which surprised me at first, but so tasty I got over it. I rarely order pork (like pulled pork) sandwiches anymore because they are usually overcooked (tasteless meat fibres) and oversauced. Not here! The porchetta was tender and porky! The hot banana pepper was a nice addition. Must be pickled in-house because it tastes much better than your usual jarred stuff. If there were a way for me to eat here more often, I would!
