It's time to review the new facelift. \n\nAdded a new sushi bar (all day Happy Hour prices on certain rolls)\nAdded two new private Karaoke rooms (a good selections of both English and K-Pop songs)  \nAdded new furniture and mixed of the old ones. I thought the traditional furniture made the restaurant feel more unique.\nAdded a teppan grill bar.     \n\nQuality:  It's not the best fish quality you will get on the sashimi, however if you order the sushi rolls, they aren't too bad.  According to my friend that knows her sashimi, the Sushi roller didn't even know how to cut the fish.  That's pretty sad!  I guess you can fool the people that really doesn't know the difference between sashimi and sushi.  Banchan (small side dishes) wasn't fresh and ever shrink the portion size. I still like the Soondubu (Soft Tofu Stew) combos and Seolleongtang.  \n\nPrice:  Of course, when a restaurant expands consumer always end up paying for the overhead. The price did go up a bit. They do still have the their $4.99 lunch special.  Thumbs up for the Owner!  \n\nService:  One day is good and another time is horrible.  It really depends who you get. Very inconsistent!   \n\nHours:  Yay, finally another Korean place opening late on Friday and Saturday until 2AM. The best hangover stop!
