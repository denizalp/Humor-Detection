The place was very clean and well organized. The ambience was nice and the selection of gel polish was extensive. Reason for the low review? The lady cut my toenails (big toe) way too short to the point when she filed them it scraped my skin a bit. My gel manicure was very uneven and somewhat lumpy. The best part? OVERPRICED. $40 for a toe polish change and a gel polish change. Only was in town visiting for the weekend, and when I return to town, won't be back.
