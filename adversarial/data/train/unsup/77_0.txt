They sold me a discontinued toilet, installed in an hour, and charged me $380.00.  The toilet, which I looked up the brand and model number later that day, costs $89.00.  So, not only did they sell me a discontinued toilet and didn't tell me which is pretty lame, but they charged me almost $300.00 for one hour of labor as well. Pretty sketchy business practices.
