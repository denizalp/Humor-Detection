It looked very promising from the outside which had me thinking it would be as great as the one on Flamingo off the 215 but it didn't impress me at all.  As big as the exterior was, It wasn't that big on the inside. (that's what she said, about someone else, not me).\n\nLike an idiot, I was running all around looking for the restroom on the 2nd floor.  You kidding me? As big as this place is, they could not include a smaller size restroom to make it more convenient for the members.  And wow the crowd here includes a bunch of no neck protein bar eating muscle heads.  I feel weird having a neck now and being able to have the flexibility to scratch my back.  I seriously hope they don't yelp as well or I'm getting my ass beat the next time they catch me here.  \n\nI didn't like the the way things were organized as well.  Seemed like everything was too close together.  I'm just so spoiled of the way things are in west Flamingo, expecting other LVAC to all be like it since this is the second LVAC that I have been to.  I just thought people here ran fast as heck but found out the track is actually smaller as well.  The aerobic class rooms are smaller too.  There are racquet ball rooms too on the 2nd floor.  Pool and snack bar are on the first floor along with the women's only room.  I might have given this a 4 star if I haven't gone to the west Flamingo location one first.  That one truly has set the standards for all LVAC.
