Oh em gee! I really dig the Lemon Grass. I've been there a few times now and actually think I'm overdue for a revisit. I already gave a partial review for Lemon Grass on my Thai Basil review but thought it definitely deserved its very own from my very own me. This little bit of jade is stuffed into a holy crap I just passed it dirty little strip plaza next to a Sub(standard)Way and a poor golfing Mexican place that enjoys serving very dry (just this side of dust) carnitas. Truly a sin if there ever was one. God\/s why isn't that sin in any of your \"holy\" books? I digress (that's a fun word isn't it?).  \n\nSo yah, look out or you'll miss it. When you walk in you may do a double take on where you just stepped out of. Very cute (said in my most manly of voices) and comfortable. It's fairly small maybe only slightly larger than Thai Basil but there's ELBO ROOM, yahoo! I love canned sardines (especially on crackers with cheese and while watching Saturday\/Sunday brunch time b-movies) but I don't like crowded eateries. The cordial staff is somewhat sprightly now and again and the food arrives in a timely fashion with a toofy nodding smile while eyes properly averted.\n\nOrder the Thai ice tea! Just do it! That's all I'm going to say about it. The Pad Prik King with fried tofu (I've had it twice) and the Kang Dang (I love ordering with names like these) is a happy taste-bud and happy belly maker; absorutly marvolous (now I have that song stuck in my head). The Garlic Lover is pretty darn scrumptious as well. I need to sample more of the menu and add more later maybe even bump up another star. \n\nDefinitely a happy ending every visit.
