I'm so upset because Greens food is usually very delicious BUT the last 3 times I've gone have been awful and I'm surprised I went back after the first two. The first two times I ordered takeout and they completely ruined my order, so the third time I decided to eat there and see if that made a difference. I am allergic to peppers and told the cashier this when ordering he assured me there would be none and I got my food and was about to take a big bite into the sand which when I see peppers. I told the staff and they were very kind and then said they would make me a new one. A few minutes pass and they bring my plate, set it down, walk away really quickly, I look at my plate and they still put peppers on my plate. THIS IS AN ALLERGY so I had to ask them to make a new one to go, they are very frustrated at me, and I get home to take a bite into a pepper. So basically I waited 2 hours to still get hives.
