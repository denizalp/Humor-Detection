If you love music -- on any level -- this is the place to be.  I do business in business in Cleveland and am there several times a year.  And every time I am there I b-line down for a shot of energy.  This time I saw the 3-D U2 movie.  Blew me away.  But like always, something there does.\n\nEveryone needs to get their fix here.  Its over the top!\n\nAnd try out the gift store.  Its got to be one of the best museum shops I have gone to.  And they ship!\n\nP.S.\nOne time I was there, looking at the Lennon exhibit and Yoko called on a white phone.  I picked up!  Life IS good!!!!
