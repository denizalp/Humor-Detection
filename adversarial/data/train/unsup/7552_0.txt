So it's a government mandated requirement that you have to get the emissions checked on your car and Arizona requires you to go to a state-run facility unlike other states that have privatized the system. However, it also costs only $17 and it doesn't take too long. In fact, this location almost always seems to have short lines and you can get done very quickly. The staff isn't all that friendly, but they are professional at their jobs. I've been to other emissions testing stations in the Valley where you tend to always find lines, but this location is kind of hidden and it never gets too busy. Considering that you can't really get out of having your emissions checked, this is a good place to go... and now that I'm done for another two years, feel free to pick this one.
