I used to work in Oakville, if co-workers and I wanted dim sum, this is the only place that's reasonably close AND offers decent food. \n\nMy Dim Sum SSQSW: \n\nServe Style -- push cart. I would have preferred ordering from a menu, but co-workers who aren't dim sum regulars like the push-cart style so they can peek before ordering \n\nSelection -- good, aplenty on seafood dishes (steamed shrimp dumpling, steamed shrimp with chives dumpling, fried shrimp dumpling, fried shrimp with chives dumpling, .... you get the gist). They have all the usual suspects for dim sum. \n\nQuality -- okay. Because it's always busy, we've not had un-fresh food. \n\nService -- so so. I think they try to be efficient, if not warm and attentive. The servers are always in such a rush, who's got time to smile at or chat with you?! If you want something, just be assertive and flag someone down (in a polite way). \n\nWait Time -- avoid 11:45 - 12:45 peak lunch time. Otherwise finding a parking and getting a table will taste your patience.
