Update: I took my family back here for lunch on 2\/22\/17. It was, as usual, amazing. The steak was a perfect medium rare and very tender. The shrimp were plentiful and delicious. They even had Spicy Tuna Handrolls! I also had my signature seafood omelet which consists of shrimp,  real crab meat, mushrooms, spinach, jalapeños and of course lots of cheese! The dessert bar had Creme Brûlée! \n\nWhat I really wanted to make note of was the impeccable service by our server Celia. She was over the top incredible and tremendous when it came to her attention to us. She was very quick to refill our drinks and even noticed that my napkin was getting a little messy due to eating those phenomenal ribs and she quickly gave me another napkin without me even asking. I hope she gets commended for her great service. It's people like that is why your property is epitome of a Las Vegas Resort! See you soon! \n\nI have been to this buffet since 2002. Some things have changed but for the better. I no longer have to wait in that long line that I used to wait almost 2 hours for back in the day due to Mlife. However it's still worth that wait with the quality of the food and service. Some of the servers have been there since the place opened in 1998. They are all amazing. Best Prime Rib I have ever had. They can give u a thick cut rare or however u like it. Beef Tar Tar is amazing. Handmade Spicy Tuna Hand Rolls, endless already sliced crab, giant shrimp, and the omelette bar during brunch are all top notch. Ask for a seafood omelette, it's shrimp and crab with whatever toppings u want. Can't wait to go back there in a few weeks!
