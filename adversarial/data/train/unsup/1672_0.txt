Picking up a pre called in cake for a life celebration party and decided to have dessert before lunch. We got to the store a little early since we thought opened at 10 am, but it is really 10:30 am. The staff shooed is out for about 15 minutes but I totally understand since we're so early. Besides the cake pick up I had a small strawberry sundae with whip and nuts. My son had a small hot fudge sundae extra fudge. There ice cream always takes me back to my childhood too. The service was great even brought them to our table, such a sweet place to enjoy more now that it's going to break 100 mark.
