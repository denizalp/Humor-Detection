AVOID at ALL costs!!! I gave Pat's several tries. Horrible service, rude dumpy male employee with no customer service skills what so ever, he just has poor antics in general. To top it off Pat's is WAY TOO EXPENSIVE for such a dive of a cleaners with lousy service. If you ever have an issue with your clothes it's your fault never Pat's Cleaners. Just look at their cheesy sign in the picture that's missing a cover on the letter N and it's been like that for at least a year. Other Dry Cleaners in the area are much better with very Professional and friendly staff for less money. The owners are too far out of the loop to even know what's going on...what does that tell you?
