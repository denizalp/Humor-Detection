We have driven by this place forever and never stopped. Finally we did. It was a Sunday afternoon and i was surpised when we pulled it it was not crowded. i was actually concerned they were closed. the few people that came in after us did the same thing at the door stopping to look at the hours.  Inside was clean and nothing special. Pop music playing on the speakers, odd choice for an Italian restaurant on a Sunday, but ok. We ordered spaghetti for the kids, and chicken parm for my husband and i. \nthe waitress was super nice and took our orders, and then brought a tiny loaf of garlic bread to the table. ok not a loaf, but you know what comes out of the stouffers box, 2 half slices of that. for 4 people?!  the kids at that right up.  then our food came. the kids liked the spaghetti, i tried it, nothing special, not much flavor to the sauce. I took one bit of my chicken parm and was horrified. it was like rubber. rubber!! i was so grossed out. now i will admit i am picky, so i my husband tried it too. he will eat anything. he could not finish chewing it.  we told the waitress and she took it away.  she came back with another one, which was good, but i admit i had no stomach after the first round. it was very expensive, and we were not impressed. we will not be going back.  i don't even think it was worth a second try.
