Been here 3-4 times and they never disappoint. food is made fresh how you order it everytime and have never had a bad experience with the food here. There are 2 things that keep it from getting a perfect 5 stars. First, I personally prefer soft shell tacos to hard shells, and you can only get hard shells here. They taste fine, but I would like the option. Secondly, this place needs its own way to place an order online. My office would probably eat here everyday as it is so close, but few people in a call center can take time off to place an order. Even accepting orders through Facebook, even Email or something would be sufficient for a small place like this! Until then, once or twice a month is the max my co-workers and I can handle. Great food, just a hassle ordering.
