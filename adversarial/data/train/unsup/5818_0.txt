Okay, saw the $4.99 hair cut signs when they first opened their new location. At the time I was in a rush to go to a townhouse to meet contractors to get an estimate for the repair. Afterwards, I couldn't remember which part of Spring Mountain Rd I initially spotted the sign.  I ended up going to a different barber. After that it was hard not to spot the bright yellow signs planted just a few inches off the ground as I drive past the giant commercial shopping center where Walmart (Rainbow\/Spring Mountain) is located in.\n\nSince it is in this huge shopping center, it took some effort to locate it (hint: If you are facing the stores it is to the left of Dollar Tree, which is to the left of Walmart).  At first I thought it might be located near Panda Express, but after driving slowly and looking for Great Clips that was obviously not the case.\n\nAnyway, for first timers, they will ask for your phone number to put in their system, which is how they will pull up your profile for future visits to place you in the waiting queue.  Hair cuts here are really quick, but so far everyone that I have seen paying for their haircuts have all seemed very pleased with their new dos. And the \"this is way cheaper than other places\" is repeated by just about everyone when they go settle their accounts. Serious? Like the bright yellow promotional signs and the giant banner in front of their door was not enough to establish the fact that they are running their \"lowest price in town since we've just opened\" sales campaign.\n\nEven after their promo period is over and regular haircut for men are $13, it is still totally worth it. Their computer system keeps track of how you had your haircut on the previous visit, which is really nice. And all the ladies that cut my hair have all been very competent at their job.\n\n* They some times have coupons that are delivered via USPS, so look for those in the typical junk mail pile. Saved $7 on my most recent visit.
