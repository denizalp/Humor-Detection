My wife and I went there Friday night and has an 8:30 reservation. Got sat right away. The dinner from the Brussels sprout salad through the Swordfish and the Beer Brined Chicken was about the best we have every had....THE CHICKEN ROCKS...the service was perfect and it has the best garden sitting in the city. We met the manager and he took the time to share the history of the house and the chef. Go try this place.
