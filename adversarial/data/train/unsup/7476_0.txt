It is with great hesitation that I write this review.  I waited and waited, not wanting to be the first to yelp about Cake in a Cup.  But since Kimiko P. was the FTR, I felt it was my time to say something.\n\nI was pretty excited to see another cupcake place in Vegas, especially in the southwest area.  Sure, their location isn't the most ideal yet with endless construction going on making it difficult to get to their little shop.\n\nThey were just about to close up shop, so we grabbed one to go.  As I checked out their various flavors, the Big F chatted it up with the fellow behind the counter.  (Something about them not baking their cupcakes on the premises struck a cord, did we hear wrong?  Where are they baked then?)  \n\nI went for the Holy Cow Cupcake ($2.25) and was excited about my little treat.  The first bite said it all, and the look on my face was disappointing.  I went for a second bite, confident that the first bite was a fluke, but nope, I was still very disappointed.  The Big F could hardly believe that it was that bad, but he had a bite and wasn't impressed.  The cake itself was very dry, as in not moist at all.  Crumbs fell everywhere.  The frosting was so sweet that my teeth hurt.  Sure, when you take a bite of the cake and frosting together, it's barely passable.  But alone, not good.  (Maybe it was my bad luck and I got an old cupcake?)  I ended up throwing it away, and trust me, I'm not one to throw away food, especially dessert.\n\nI so want to like this place and would be open to giving it another try.  But right now, I'm not anxious to make a revisit just yet.  We'll just have to see then...
