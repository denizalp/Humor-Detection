My husband  and I was in the neighborhood and yelp Mexican food, we came because of the carne Asada fries, it was good but for some reason it felt like a big container of calories. The fries were kind of undercooked.  They could have been crispier.  The carnitas burrito was ok but the rolled tacos was the best.  I probably get that if we go back.  My husband wanted the Tuesday special which was a breakfast burrito for 2.99 but he didn't want bacon egg and potatoes so he ordered the carnitas burrito.  The place did not really have a place to eat besides a few tables outside and it was a windy day so we took the food home with us.  This was something I wouldn't go back to but my husband may win on this one.  I think it was just ok \"when it touches my lip it is sooo good\" that didnt happen to me.  My husband loves all good Mexican food especially if he get good gas later, lol.
