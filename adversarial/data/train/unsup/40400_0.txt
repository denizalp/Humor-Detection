I was really craving a hot link sandwich and a quick search brought me to Jon's. I ended up with the Ribs and hot link combo with Mac and cheese and potato salad. Overall it was fine. My favorite part was the bread. \n\nRibs were good. Smoky and tender. \n\nSauce is ok, I like mine a little sweeter and spicier. \n\nHot link was almost great, but too dry to be snappy. \n\nMac and cheese - yikes. It's like someone prepped a good Mac and cheese but instead of baking it thy just put it in the microwave. It's not kraft or velveeta style, but just thick sludge like melty cheese and elbow noodles. The texture is all wrong. \n\nPotato salad - eh. I took it home and added some mustard. Doesn't taste home made - taste like the weird grocery store potato salad where the chunks of potato are too big and kind of rubbery. The only good thing I can say is it doesn't have raisins in it. \n\nSandwich bread and dinner roll - soft and a little sweet. I ate the potato salad and Mac with this and it made it much more palatable. \n\nThe ribs are pretty good so 3 stars over all.
