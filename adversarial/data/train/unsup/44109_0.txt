So I decided to try this place because I am trying to find a go to spot for my Mani Pedis. The establishment was pretty clean and the aroma of a nail salon wasn't too overwhelming. There were 3 workers today and only 3 customers, including myself. Yay, I don't have to wait! I tell them what I want and the guy said to pick my colors on the wall. I will give them points for how their nail polishes  were color coordinated and had a variety too. Then he wanted for me to pay before I sat, weird, but ok! $25 for a regular pedicure. $30 for gel. The pedicure was eh. She didn't scrub as well as other places and they use a couple hot rocks against your feet but nothing too spectacular about that. The girl that did my stuff was quiet and only said a few things. With the gel polish she sort of missed the sides of my nails and I had to tell her because she didn't fully take off my old nail polish so I was seeing pink on the side. So now I'm home and I'm really looking at what was done and I'm not that happy because it  looks like my polish has grown out and I will need a fill soon. Sigh! I'm gonna have to look somewhere else.
