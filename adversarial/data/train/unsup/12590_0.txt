Attended the The Symphony on Tap at the Belk Theater last night. The Charlotte Symphony Preview party was an experience not to be missed if you are into the arts and culture. It was their first ever.\n\nThere was an ensemble that greets as they play you a piece and then invites you into the theater. Belk has a beautiful auditorium. The seats are plush and comfortable. We sat in the last rows on the upper level and the views were spectacular as well as the acoustics. The conductor was very interactive with the audience and asked for participation with one of their pieces. Who said that classical music is boring? It is fun for the whole family.
