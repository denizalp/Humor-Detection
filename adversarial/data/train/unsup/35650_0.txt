This is probably one of my favorites indoor place ever! I had my son 1st birthday party here, end of May and I had over 25 kids here for his birthday party. Every kid and parent absolutely loved this place. Not one complaint. I had a staff member constantly helping my room and me not asking, he read my mind and knew exactly what to do to make sure the 1) birthday boy is happy 2) his parents are happy and 3) birthday boy guests are happy. The staff member never left our sight and helped with everything. ( cleaning up after the kids, refilling the drinks constantly, etc) I already have invitations for my son to go here in the next few months. The place is clean and they are constantly on top of cleaning. The price is decent and will definitely have my son birthday here again.
