I find Big O to be convenient for oil changes for my VW.  Much cheaper than the Stealership and much closer than my next go to which would be Wolf Auto.  The wait times aren't bad and like most waiting areas they have a TV and provide coffee, tea and water.  Of course, at time of payment there is usually something else wrong with my vehicle that they would like to fix, but I pass on that as I am more comfortable with the price and service provided by Wolf in that regard.  The center it is located in has a couple places to eat if you are stuck longer than expected.
