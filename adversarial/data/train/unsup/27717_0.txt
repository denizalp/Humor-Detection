The food was exceptional as was the service provided by Ariel.  She was vet knowledgeable about the menu even though the restaurant.  Being located along the Light Rail in SouthEnd is kind of cool too.  \nBe forewarned though.  The restaurant is hard to find. It's in the back left corner of the Post SouthEnd apartment bldg along the light rail.
