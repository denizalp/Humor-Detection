Read this for a true professional evaluation. I am a dentist and struggle to make time during the regular day to get to the doctors for regular visits. Although this office is pretty good at accommodating my schedule, my appointments are with PA's or Nurse Practitioners. I was originally referred to the office to see Dr. Herrera.  But out of the 20 or so times that I have visited the office, I have seen Dr. Herrera 3 times. I have seen the office transform over the past 5 years into a typical business. If you note many of the poor reviews are due to lack of follow up and other inconsistencies. Additionally, they like to treat one or two symptoms or conditions at a time. Many times in addition to my 6 month wellness check to refill my hypertension prescriptions, I will have other issues that need a treatment. This office will not treat multiple issues willingly. They will always try to get you to come back for another visit which is extremely frustrating for someone like me that has limited time during the day. Furthermore, there is a disconnect in patient management due to the lack of consistency with providers. It seems like tedious notes are taken each visit, but I get asked many questions each visit that would only need to be asked once if they really knew who I was or really paid attention to prior notes. \nIn conclusion, this office does not work for me. If you have plenty of time and can work your schedule around to develop a rapport with the same practitioner,(not doctor) and do not mind seeing a practitioner, then you may receive a decent health care experience.
