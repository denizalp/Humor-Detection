Time for my annual \"this chain is overrated\" rant. Finally tried animal style, and was underwhelmed. I mean, where's the thousand island? Totally negligible here,on the burger at least. Fries become a congealed mess. I should stick to my usual hamburger w\/ grilled onions, which for the price is totes legit. \n\nIt was Monday at 10pm, but there was still a large crowd of mostly teenagers for who knows what reason. It took 20 minutes to get my order. Why did I drop by again?
