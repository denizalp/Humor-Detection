First off I'm a local do not go here it's a scam like no other i was told by the dancer that I can pay 120 for 20 mins private and all i got was 2 songs until we were interrupted  by the lady in charge saying my time was up that we were doing to much . I don't even know what that means the dancer seemed  upset said she was going to talk to the lady I waited in the private for 15 min nobody ever came so i walked out to look for the dancer nowhere to be found the perfect set up i was better  off just paying 40 for 2 regular dances i know this business has to make money somehow  but not like this I will be forwarding the review  to any other site I can maybe get an investigation  opened on this place
