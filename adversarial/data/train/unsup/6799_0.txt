This place is a total bust. The property is nice,  but half the amenities they sell you on are unusable. For example,  the tv's and the music in the gym. They are controlled by a panel that seems about 10 years outdated.  The tv's and radio are always off because no one knows how to use the panel as there are no instructions,  and finding someone on staff that knows anything about anything is impossible.  I get the feeling the don't really care if stuff is broken. \n\nThe AC in the gym is constantly broken, so the \"state of the art gym\"  they promote is always a stiffling 85 degrees (see attached photo)\n\nIf you're excited about the fact that they advertise having the NFL package, don't be. The TV'S that they would have it on never work. And no, they won't show you how to use them, because they don't know how, and do not care to learn. \n\nBeware of the train! If you are in a unit on the backside of the property (facing Lamar), be prepared to listen to freight trains all night because you can almost throw a football to the tracks.  They won't tell you that though.\n\nAnd speaking of Lamar, you can't really drive down that road because park on both sides of the road,  which is narrow to begin with.  However,  it is much more convenient to turn into the garage from Lamar than it is from Hawthorne Ln due to the angle. But you won't want to, because they put the dumpsters right by where you would turn. There is constantly broken glass there for you to get a flat tire. \n\nOverall, this is a big fat joke ran by people who shouldn't be running it. Instead of addressing the issues, they will just start to passive aggressively not talk to you. Look elsewhere.
