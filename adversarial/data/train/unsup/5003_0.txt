The good: the food was tasty, the atmosphere is nice.\n\nThe not-so-good: the food took forever to come. I get the idea that the place is inefficiently managed. Also, I ordered a veggie omelet and got an omelet with ham in it. The server had made a mistake with the computer and was very apologetic and sweet. However, I think they should have comped me my meal. The three bites of the omelet I ate before I realized it wasn't what I ordered was the most meat I've eaten in 16 years, and it was a very gross experience for me, plus I had to wait additional time after the initial 35-40 minutes we waited for our meals. I wasn't about to argue with them about it because it's not my style, but comping an entree for that sort of thing is just good service.\n\nI'd try this place again, because that snafu was probably just a fluke, but it's definitely not worth putting up with that sort of event multiple times.
