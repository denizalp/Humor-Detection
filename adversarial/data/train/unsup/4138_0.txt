Hands down the worst Restaurant Week meal I've had to date. I'm 23 and have the palate of a child so it's rare that I turn my nose up to a filet mignon and macaroni and cheese. This meal was extremely low quality, not fresh, and potentially microwaved. \n\nFirst course Tuna Salad - avocado was browning and lettuce was browning. \n\nSecond course Filet Mignon\/shrimp\/Mac and cheese - I've NEVER had to salt and pepper an entree at a nice restaurant but it had to have been the blandest meal.....and let's not even get me started on the sides. Potentially Stouffer's Mac and cheese straight from the microwave and very questionable shrimp.  \n\nDessert tiramisu - clearly was cut straight from the box from wherever it was ordered from. \n\nI DO NOT recommend this restaurant whatsoever, coming from a young adult who's favorite restaurant is Outback Steakhouse. Please save yourself the trip and the money.
