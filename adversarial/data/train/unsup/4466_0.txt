At Bonanno's New York Pizzeria, there's a quick serve section and an actual restaurant area. Each side has their own separate entrance. On our visit, we ate in the restaurant because the Groupon required we do so. The deal was $5 for $20, which sounds like a bargain, but in actuality the price and food weren't worth getting the Groupon to begin with.\n\nFREE GARLIC KNOTS: I mean, they're free. Served lukewarm and oozing with grease. Served with oil and vinegar, but what it really needs is marinara. 2\/5\nBAKED RAVIOLI ($16): Not the worst ravioli I've had. It was just okay. 3\/5\nCHICKEN PARMIGIANA ($14): The fries tasted pretty stale and my husband absolutely hated his sandwich. He ate about a quarter of it. He vowed never to return to this establishment.1\/5\n\nSERVICE: My husband's soda glass ($3) was perpetually empty. It took forever to get refills for him. The waiter seemed too busy attending to other tables. 2\/5\n\nVIBE: Bunch of tourists because it's the Strip. The music was (mostly) awful and had too wide of a range. Went from Frank Sinatra to a recent pop tune. Pick a genre and stick with it. The restaurant is pretty small and looks like just about any other NY pizzeria. \n\nWorth a Return Visit?\n'Tis not worth it, folks. Be advised.\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #119
