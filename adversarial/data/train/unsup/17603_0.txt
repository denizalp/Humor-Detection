I gave this place 5 stars before I ever ate there and then some Yelper reported me to the Yelp police and my review was removed.  Geesh - people are so serious.  OK, so now I've been there almost 10 times (or have I?) and I can officially say it deserves 5 stars.  Yes, every item on the brunch buffet is great and their bread pudding might be the most incredible dessert ever.  It's also a really cool place to hang out (good bar and drink choices, comfy couches).  The hostesses and bartenders are super nice.  I like to tell my South Charlotte friends how great it is and then watch them wet their pants when they see where it's located (in a strip mall next to a Family Dollar).  But they all recognize the greatness and location quickly becomes a non-issue.  If this place were to ever shut down, I would die.
