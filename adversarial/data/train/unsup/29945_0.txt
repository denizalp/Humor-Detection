Ahhh The Rogue! As alluded to below, the bar has gone through a lot of changes, and has since latest ownership, been righted! As oppose to mentioned below, there is no need to drink your beer through a straw, and the bathrooms are fine, if you are put off by what the Rogue is dishing out, head further north on Scttsdale RD. Great dive bar, awesome sound for usually cheap shows, friendly staff, cheap drinks, great layout, and without pretense! One of my all time favorite AZ bars without a doubt! I would say that even if I hadn't met my wife at this place many years ago! Thanks Manny for keeping the spirit alive!
