\"Best Salad in a Supporting Role\"\n\nNo matter where you go, ordering a salad is a safe bet.  I mean, really, can you ever go wrong with a mixture of vegetables?  \n\nBy the same token, rarely has my appetite for veggies fell in love with a salad extraordinaire?\n\nGallo Blanco gets my award for best salad in a supporting role.  Whether as a first course or a meal by itself, the Ensalada Cortado perfectly compliments the entire menu.\n\nThe texture and taste of the kale lettuce mixed with a housemade ranch dressing, avocado, eggs and a couple surprise ingredients make this a light and nutritious addition to the great tasting steak, fish or pork tacos.\n\nA meal at GB won't break the bank either.  I paid roughly 15 bucks for the salad, three tacos, and an arnold palmer.  Reasonably priced the quality of not only the food but also the service and atmosphere.\n\nI like to find places close to a light rail stop or at least a short walk.  Gallo Blanco is off 3rd Ave and Clarendon, so the Steele Indian School station my be the closest, however if you have a few minutes to spare, the Osborn and Central Avenue station is probably a more enjoyable walk.
