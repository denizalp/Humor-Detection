I would USUALLY give this place 4.5 stars. Me and my fellow roommates usually have nothing but good things to say. We went there about a month and a half ago. I wasn't going to write a review but my experience left such a bad taste in my mouth that none of us have been back since. Which is unfortunate because we went there a lot. ( we went there the night before the bad experience)\n\nHeres how the night went:\n- After just taking our drink orders the waitress had no idea who's drinks went where. Which would not be a big deal if she didn't say \"sorry I've had a longggg day, so I'm like not going to remember anything\" (I'm thinking \"uhhh thanks, I feel so welcome\")\n\n-Never asked us if we needed another drink (when ours were obviously empty)\n\n-Since they don't do separate checks, we initialed and color coded each persons orders, and even wrote the total for each initial at the bottom of the check.  She then picks up the check and says \"you have to figure out tax\" (which in all of the times we have been there we have NEVER had to do before) Even so, If we have to figure out tax why wouldn't it just be included in the price.  Some of my friends I was with didn't even know what percent the tax was. So instead of using a combination of cards and cash we pooled what ever cash we had left exact change.\n\n-we walk out and are almost around the corner when the waitress FOLLOWED US OUT and said we didn't give her a tip and if \"we were going to do that\".  She even had the nerve to ask us \"well do you guys have any cash?\" After 3-4 minute argument, my roommate was so fed up and sick of her following us she just grabbed a bill (which happened to be a $20) and hands it to her.  The waitress then takes it and didn't ask if she wanted change or anything.  (our bill wasn't even $50 so why would we give her such a big tip, especially since we just told her it was terrible service) She just said \"thanks girl you must work in customer service\" and walked off\n\n\nI told this story at work and had people come up to me when they overheard my story and that they have never heard of anyone following someone out because they didn't like the tip they were given
