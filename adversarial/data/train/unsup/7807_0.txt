Wow, what an odd mall. In my head, there is always sad, bumbling tuba music serenading me as I walk through here. This place is ginormous, and I think it actually has a really nice layout (one big circular loop), but soooo many storefronts are empty. It seems like such a waste of space. Compared to other crowded malls in the area (Ross Park, Robinson), there are just no shoppers here. And I can see why....there really isn't much shopping to be had. The anchor tenants are small Penney's, Dick's, and Macy's stores (the Sears just went out of business), with a smattering of other businesses throughout. There are a bunch of totally random things in this mall, like ITT tech, a gymnastics place, an indoor soccer field, a charter school, a church.....which, I mean, I guess it's good that they're using the space? But it's not exactly going to be drawing shoppers. The movie theater is about the only part of the mall that I see have any significant activity in it. Well that, and the Auntie Anne's pretzel shops...it's interesting that the mall hardly has any businesses left, but somehow there is enough demand to support TWO Auntie Anne's pretzels. Only in 'Murica. ;)\n\nI will say that although this mall is pretty much on life support, they do a nice job with the upkeep. It's beautifully decorated, clean, and they cover the empty storefronts with murals or artsy curtains (much nicer to look at than metal gates). So they're not letting it deteriorate physically, even if economically it is going down the tubes.\n\nAs I mentioned, this mall does have a really nice circular layout that's a little under a mile all the way around. As such, it's a great place to come for some exercise. Yes, I have been known on occasion to join the oldsters for some mall walking (hey, when it's 0 degrees outside and you can't bear another minute on the treadmill, this isn't a bad option!) :) So come for your mall walking, go elsewhere for your shopping.
