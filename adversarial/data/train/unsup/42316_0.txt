We had a great time at the cheesecake factory. We sat outside an the weather was great. The food was excellent. I had the shrimp and chicken gumboo....hummm humm.  Goood!!! My hubby had the flip flop salmon special. As usual he is not sure of the item but I know it was a special. It was great. The waitress was good, but we ordered drinks and had to ask if they were coming before or after we finished the food....lol  The Mai Tai made it...an it was gr8. We will definitely return as the summer time has a shorter wait time.
