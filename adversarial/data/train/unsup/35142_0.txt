Went to Noodles Asia, late one night.  Love how they are open till 3:00 AM.  Had a group of eight the service was very quick, we sat down ordered and food came right out.  I ordered the Mixed Seafood Pan-Toasted Noodles it was very good, piping hot I burnt my tongue.  I did think it was pricey but then again your in Las Vegas isn't EVERYTHING :-)
