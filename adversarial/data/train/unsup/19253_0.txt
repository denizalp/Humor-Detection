Food is similar to other chinese noodle soup restaurants like Fudao and Dagu.  I got the curry coconut soup.  I prefer Fudao version better because it has more flavour.  I also got squid skewers and omelette pancake.  Wasn't able to eat much of it because they cleaned off my table when I went to the washroom. Beware don't leave your seat unless you are done with your meal.  The restaurant was also too hot & humid and needs better ventilation.
