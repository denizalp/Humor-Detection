chlorine and pee-pee \nthe crowd is old and leaky \nbut you get floaties. \n\n\nNot too impressed. Sloppy and rumpled front desk people proceeded to describe the facility by saying \"rich people come here!\" Huh? WTF? Locker rooms are laughingly small, and ridiculously inconvenient. One chair, zero room. It is literally cheek to cheek in there. Gross. I'd give them a C- in the cleanliness column. The pool has enough chlorine to peel a few layers of your skin off. Billing department is clueless, sending you bills 7 months later. \nNext round of PT wont be there.\nOne cool thing, they have treadmills on platforms that slowly lower into the water, elevator-like. As the floor goes down, and the water starts to rise its like being in a movie. I kept wanting to hear \"I expect you to die Mr. Bond.\" as the water got deeper.\n\nCarry on.
