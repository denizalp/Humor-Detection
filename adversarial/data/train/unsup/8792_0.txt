Easy 5 star review!  Food flavor, presentation, setting, and hospitality!\n\nThank you Chef Ash and the rest of the staff at Bon Chef for an amazing night!\n\nWe went with the 7 course chef's tasting menu, and it packed a punch! \n\nChef noticed that my one year old was eating everything Daddy was being served, so he brought out some specially made goodies, just for him! Outstanding!  They also have a play area that has tons of cars and other toys for the kids to have fun!  This is a very kids friendly restaurant, with excellent food!\n\nThe highlights of the night were the lobster bisque, which was the best I've had. Most of the time, lobster bisque tastes too creamy and \"cheesy\" for my taste. The first bite of the sauce was immediately \"LOBSTER\"! And the little baked pastry had a nice chunk of lobster hiding in it! Awesome and fun surprise!  I would definitely order the full size next time I am here.\n\nMy other favorite of the night was the steak pyramid, which this is only a miniature version of....They said they marinate the meat overnight so it gets all the flavors and goodies to absorb inside the meat, and then they cook it with love! Super yummy, and I would definitely recommend it!  Probably the biggest reason besides the hospitality that I will be back!\n\nOther goodies like the chicken florentine, Shrimp Scampi in lemon butter sauce, and Chocolate Dipped Strawberries & Petite Fours and Truffles all get honorable mentions!  Especially the petite fours...super rich and yummy!\n\nWe felt very welcomed, with everyone checking on our dinner, the staff interacting and playing with my little guy, them preparing special goodies just for him, and being able to talk directly to Chef Ash and learning about the love and quality of food put into play, having him proudly showing us the kitchen and really seeing the passion involved for him in his environment....it was very nice and appreciated :)\n\nThe food and service here are worth the drive all the way over by St Rose\/Eastern (45min for me), but the prices are stupid cheap right now. We had this 7 course chef's tasting menu for $25 a person....and this included a glass of the best sangria I've had.  Plenty of wine choices for $20-25 per bottle as well!\n\nMaybe it is just because they are only a few months old and trying to get the name out, but as it sits right now, this is THE BEST \"bang for your buck\" dinner in town! \n\nGive it a go!
