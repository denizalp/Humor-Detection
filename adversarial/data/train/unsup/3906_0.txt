I would like to point out that this review is only for the bar of the hotel....now that we have that covered I can start the criticism.  Beautiful bar, nice variety as far as alchohol goes, cool patios too (minus the bugs) but the most horrendous decor in the world. I can understand what they were trying to do but the colorful and uncomfortable chairs missed the mark. A few nice couches would have been better and made the place look less then a play room and more of a lounge. The ones present were not enough considering is such a massive place. Contemporary decor can be good! But what were they thinking? Did they buy the furniture at ikea? The kids section? I am convinced they did. Try changing my mind! I couldnt sit more than 5 minutes. I needed a  massage. Was incredibly uncomfortable! I decided to walk around with my drink. I would like to point out that I am not making this up, nor am I picky, I swear but my friend had butt pain too from the bad aluminum chairs. \nWell needless to say I may return to this place, I am just not going to sit there.
