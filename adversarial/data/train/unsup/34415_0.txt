I can't wholeheartedly give this buffet a four-star, since I'm pretty sure the fresh shrimp I ate made me sick later on that day, but otherwise well worth the money ($23.95 for brunch on Sunday, including fountain drinks with free refills). My cousins who are locals will also vouch for this place. We went on a Sunday at exactly noon, and didn't get seated until close to one. But it was worth the wait! Really good steak, 10 different potato dishes, good mix of vegetables and tons of dessert that's well-packaged in bite-sized portions. There were a lot of different kinds of breads too, which I was unfortunately unable to make it around to tasting.
