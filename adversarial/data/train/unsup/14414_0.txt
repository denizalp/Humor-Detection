Located on Sunset right across the street from the Galleria Mall. It sits in the same parking lot as Sunset Station.\n\nParking directly in front of restaurant and easy access.\n\nCame for late night Hawaiian food right before they closed at 10pm. I was thinking no way they'll have my kalbi right before close. But yeah my sistas got me covered.\nThe kalbi was perfectly cooked, flavor great and of course my Mac salad, 2 scoops of rice and side of kimchee. Everything was perfect except the kimchee was medium cuz I'm not crazy about the kimchee here. But gotta have it. I LOVE KIMCHEE\n\nService was fast and friendly island style.\n\nI only wish they were open later. Prices really reasonable.
