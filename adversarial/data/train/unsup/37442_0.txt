The food was pretty good but the service left much to be desired. We waited much longer than we were told to be seated. We were taken to our table and had to wait while the server cleaned off our table. Once we ordered, we waited a long time to receive our food despite the fact that the restaurant was not full. The server spilled my milkshake and did not offer me a new one and also got my friend's chicken salad order wrong. In addition, the restroom was filthy and the trash was overflowing. This was a pretty disappointing experience as Red Robin is usually clean and efficient.
