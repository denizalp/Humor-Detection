Hey Hailey and the Magical Yelp Staff!\nThanks for inviting me and my plus one to this great event on High Street in Phoenix.  I never knew about High Street and I tell you I will be back to this attractive, trendy, hip quarter that includes interesting restaurants, bars and shops in the midst of a residential setting.  Here's what I got to see once I received the Yelp Passport which gave us a list of participating businesses.  \n\nMellow Mushroom:  We got delicious beef tacos which were served on Johnny Cakes instead of tortillas.  I am a big fan of Johnny Cakes so I will be having breakfast here sooner than you think. \n\nFuchsia Spa:  Clean, attractive, serene environment for spa services including facials at great prices.  This is a must-try location.\n\nAbode:  A furniture and accessory store with the most amazing selection.  Loved the DOG PHOTOS above the checkout counter.  There isn't a piece there that you won't like.  The owner was super friendly and gave us all treats.\n\nAnytime Fitness:  Appears to be a great, clean gym and they offer a 7 day free trial.  Cool and much needed these days. \n \nTorchCigar Bar:  A great vibe, cool music.  This lounge offers cocktails and cigars--a great place to smoke with a great ventilation system and large open \"garage\" doors. Thanks for the free cigar and a sample of your \"Old Fashioned\"--that's an old school cocktail. \n \nDaily Method:  offers barre and cycle fitness.  The place looked great.  Looking for a great workout?  This is it. \n\nYogurt Time:  Offered us a taste of their fine frozen yogurt.  I thought that the Belgian Chocolate which is fat free was fantastic.  The mango gelato was delicious as well.\n\nThe Growler Restaurant and Bar: offers great food and drink.  We tasted the chicken wings and their pretzel bread with cheese sauce and everything was great.  They generously gave us a 5 ounce beer of our choice.  I was definitely be back.\n\nHigh and Rye Southern Kitchen:  This place was packed which really says something.  We tried their signature drink and liked it.  \n\n42 Saint:  You have to go to this men's and women's wear store.  Their socks are amazingly funny.  They have tee shirts and sweats with the funniest sayings.  Perfect for gift giving.  \n\nCast Salon:  A place where you can bring out your inner artist and create projects of your choosing.  \n \nLet us not forget the DJ who provided the most amazing array of music.  I was moving down those streets in rhythm to his music.  thank YOU! \n\nAnd a final Thank you again to Hailey and her Yelp Staff for making this another amazing event.
