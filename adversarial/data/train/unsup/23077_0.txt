Unfortunately I cannot recommend this company or their services. We had a shipment delivered and, unfortunately, it was damaged. What irks me is the fact that, when I called to inquire, they admitted that they had noted the damage at the time they took possession at the terminal, from the inter-state shipper (Roadrunner Transportation). Despite having a phone conversation with me prior to delivery, they did not see fit to mention this fact. To me, that seems shady. Had you told me, I could have worked with the vendor to ensure it went straight back, rather than now having to arrange a pickup at (apparently) the vendor's expense, not to mention adding a few more days of delay to replacing the item. Did not hear even a hint of empathy in the phone conversation either, knowing that a multi-thousand dollar item had been trashed. \n\nFurthermore, they provided inconsistent information about the manner of delivery. Was told it would come down over the weekend to Tucson, that did not happen. Was told they could not enter a private driveway for liability reasons, yet pics clearly show them backed down the driveway. Was told they would use an electric pallet jack, clearly not what is shown in the pics. You seeing a pattern yet?\n\nI would avoid this company and trust your last mile deliveries to someone else that can keep their story straight and who actually cares if your cargo is beat to crap in transit.
