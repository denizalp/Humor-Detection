Great venue for any type of event as they have varying space sizes from small exhibit halls to their Crown Ballroom. Last night we participated in Chef's Best 2017 to benefit Second Harvest Metrolina, with food by Chef Rocco of Fahrenheit-Charlotte and it was top notch! \n\nParking is pretty simple even during a crowded event on the weekend. Go towards the NASCAR hall of fame from Brevard st and the parking deck is on the left before Stonewall. Elevators are on the wall opposite of the entrance so try an find spot nearby! \n\nOur event had nearly 1000 participants with an open bar, hours d'oeuvres, a three course meal, and a wine pairing in between each. The Convention Center Staff integrated wonderfully with Chef Rocco's team and had each course served to the entire Ballroom in less than 3 minutes per course. Impressive, lots of planning well executed! We even had a few requests at our table (extra bread, or San Pellegrino for the table) and they delivered near instantly! \n\nPlenty of space between rooms and exhibit halls for crowd control, as well as immaculate restrooms all around. If you're planning on attending an event, or organizing one yourself, it's a great convention center! Much better than experiences I've had at cons and events elsewhere!
