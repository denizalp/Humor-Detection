The best hotel on the strip! Seriously I had my bachelorette party there and it was absolutely phenomenal. I got there and they messed up my reservation so they comped some things for me and gave me a bottle of champagne. Customer service is key and they nailed it. I also was confused on some charges and Lina helped me out so much! Def will be staying here again, the house keeping, the hotel and everyone was awesome!
