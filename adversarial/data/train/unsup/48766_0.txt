I went to have dinner for the second time last night at New Generation Sushi. The lady that serves and watches over everyone was there and decided to tell her server to tell me that I have to eat all the rice from my sushi. The sushi rice I left was the size of a couple of tablespoons. I was embarrassed and appalled and was not finished my dinner. This happened after 10 minutes of eating. This is an all you can eat restaurant and If I left a plate of food, I understand I would most likely have to pay a fee for leaving food. Never has a server told me to eat all the rice on my plate because they do not waste food there and I ordered it. I liked the food however because of the rude owner who hovers over everyone, I would not go back. So rude and unprofessional.
