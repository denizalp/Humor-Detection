You really have no idea.  \n\nNO IDEA.\n\nThis is not *just* a fish'n'chips place.  It's bliss'n'batter.  It's porn-in-a-pie.  It's a frickin' MOUTHgasm.  OH.MY.GOD, you have no idea.\n\nAs usual, I go on a business trip...what do I want?  Something the wife wouldn't allow.  I want fried chicken.  Cut to me yelping like a hungry, rabid dog...wild in the eyes, empty stomach and drool hitting the hotel room desk.  Wait...there's the Pub Chip Shop.  Oh, but it's almost half an hour away, into the heart of the city.  Traffic, crazy drivers, etc...Awww, what the hell.  Let's go.\n\n30 minutes later, I'm driving down a main drag in very trendy South Side, taking in all the sights.  Tattoo parlor, tattoo parlor, bar, tattoo parlor...WAIT...there it is.  I park and walk to the PCS.  The place is pretty small...maybe seats 30.  But the dude at the counter is cool.  He makes a recommendation:  \"Man, if you want a bit of everything so's you can try us out, get Captain Andy's Platter.  Can't go wrong...\"  So I do.  I get that with 3 sauces...The Thai Chili Sauce, the Beef Pan Gravy and a Bleu Cheese Sauce.  Sip my beer and gaze out the window at all the college kids and hipsters walking by......\n\n...whistling a happy tune in my mind.....\n\n...then the food comes.\n\nI shit you not, it's like a carnival of AWESOME in my mouth.  All three sauces were outstanding.  The counter dude said the Thai Chili Sauce is off the hook good and one of the most popular.  Sooooooooo good.  But my Nirvana was the Beef Pan Gravy sauce.  I don't know what they put in this, but it's like having your grandma's best gravy for mashed potatoes but with an eruption of \"spice garden\" as soon as the gravy hits your tongue.  It's not overpowering...it's just enough to have you find your \"O-FACE\".\n\nThis whole MEAL had me finding my \"O-face\".  I think I'm ready to meet my maker, because I've been to the promised land.  The chicken tender was incredibly moist and the batter was perfect.  Two oysters...SAME.  Outstanding.  The fish......YOWZAA.  Aaaaaaaaaaaaand, all this was sitting on a bed of \"chips\"...fries that were just a religious experience.  Moist and flavorful on the inside but just the perfect crispy bit on the outside.  I wanted to sing \"Amazing Grace\" at the top of my lungs, but the place was too small, the other patrons would feel a bit uncomfortable.  Did I mentioned that when I walked in, the place was empty, but it got packed as I ate?  PACKED.\n\nAs I said, I'm on a business trip.  I've had some crazy good meals this week...Meat & Potatoes, Nine on Nine, Eleven, The Commoner......but nothing, and I mean NOTHING came close to comparing with THE PUB CHIP SHOP.\n\nThank you, inked dude, for recommending Captain Andy's Platter.  Thanks for being so gracious to me, too.  You made the experience even more rewarding by the great service with a smile.\n\nIf you're thinking about coming here.......STOP THINKING and do it.  You won't be sorry.
