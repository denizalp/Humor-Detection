Not bad, Hwaro! \n\nI'll be honest, the first time I came to Hwaro I left before ordering... Due to an \"unfortunate circumstance\" they were not serving any alcohol. I was with two of my Korean friends who wanted soju and were very disappointed they couldn't order alcohol. We left and ventured off to Woonamjung's further down Spring Mountain for AYCE KBBQ and multiple bottles of soju.\n\nI was bummed about leaving because I've been wanting to try Hwaro and heard nothing but good things from my Korean coworkers. I finally tried Hwaro this week and was not disappointed! \n\nThe salad that comes with the KBBQ tasted average. On the other hand, the banchan was on point! Pretty tasty! A nice variety of side dishes were provided and the servers were nice about replenishing them when requested. \n\nServers came by our table frequently - at least 4 different people visited throughout our dinner. They were fantastic and quickly fulfilled our requests (water, sauces, additional side dishes, etc). We were never waiting and they even came by to change out our grill. \n\nFor meat, I'm all about the brisket and don't crave anything else (kalbi, bulgogi, pork belly, etc). My friend I was with ordered all sorts of meat selections ranging from cuts of flank steak, intestine, to pork skin. I enjoyed the brisket... It was fatty (which I ate around) but also very tender. The flank was great and the intestine was interesting. I didn't try the pork skin but my friend enjoyed it. I also didn't try any of the marinated meat so unfortunately I can't speak for the kalbi or bulgogi. \n\nHwaro gets 4 stars from me. The banchan and prompt service gets a 5. Both were much better than some of the Korean AYCE BBQ restaurants I've been to in the city. The meat gets a 3.5. I enjoyed my experience at Hwaro and would definitely consider coming back!
