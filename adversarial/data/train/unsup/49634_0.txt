First of all, it really doesn't have any MSG. I ordered The chicken base ramen, it already comes with half ajitama egg and green onion and the two things normally come with ramen, baby bamboo also taste better than other ramen places. The best thing with no MSG in their soup is you can finish the soup without craving 10 glasses of water afterward. This is the only place I will get ramen from now on. 10\/10
