Atmosphere was good and we had a great server, Kimberly but food was not that great. Burger was blah , no taste. Server offer to help but I was not there to get free stuff. But the funny part is 2 managers just keep walking around and around and not even checking on any table or even talk to guests in the restaurant. Even when we were leaving one female manager just stare at us leaving not even a thank you good bye. Wow where do we get these worthless managers. Food could be better.. Doesn't matter I am not going there anymore.
