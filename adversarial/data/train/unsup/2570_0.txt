Not the fanciest or largest Vegas club BUT they always have the hottest rising hip hop artists. I've been here to see Kendrick Lamar and 2 Chainzzzzzzzz and both times did not disappoint. They do come on pretty late but perform for a substantial amount of time. \n\n1OAK could have a better entrance system though because it seems like everyone just crowds the front in a large half circle.
