Was over at Lollicup not too long ago. My apologies, but I cannot seem to stop myself from comparing one from the other.\n\nI like Lollicup as well - friendly and prompt service. And it is even closer to my flat. \nBut the bottom line is this ...Boba Tea House offer us bobaholics a large variety of flaves than Lollicup. Period. Hence I do not mind driving quite a ways to get my boba fix! ^_^
