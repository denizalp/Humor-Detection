I was here with couple of friends on Feb. 12. Tried Chef's Choice oyster platter 12 oysters for $24. Oysters were very fresh and the\nchoices were all great. Staff are friendly, nice and helpful. Really like this place. I will definitely be back here again for some after work fresh oysters and beer.
