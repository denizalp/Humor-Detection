I came here because it was on the indie cafe passport but I am so glad about that! I of course tried their turkish coffee and I loved it!! Delicious, even for people who like their coffee sweet: they will ask you if you want sugar while preparing it and add it in themselves it is SO good! I went there to study and it was really nice. Of course there is wifi!
