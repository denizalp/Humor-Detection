Definitely a neighborhood gem that we love for happy hour.  Albeit tiny, the bar is where you want to be.   Josh knows his regulars and makes you want to keep coming back.  The food specials never disappoint and the drink list fits the spot.   Only drawback is the very tight space and the reality that sometimes the popularity means that service can back up.
