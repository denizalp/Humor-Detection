So far, so good! This is my first time here and I'm already pretty blown away with the quality and variety of food here, especially for an all-you-can-eat experience. \n\nWe went with the deluxe menu, which included beef\/tuna\/salmon tataki options, as well as unlimited snow crab (super fresh). It also includes 2 pieces of premium fish free for each guest, and that includes some Japanese fish. Overall, I was really impressed with the food!! \n\nThe only thing I would mention is that the portions are confusing. Sometimes it was literally one tiny piece, but another items came with many pieces. So I felt wasteful ordering something but only being served one piece with a ton of pretty garnish! \n\n*Be careful with the teapots. They spill easily!! Haha.
