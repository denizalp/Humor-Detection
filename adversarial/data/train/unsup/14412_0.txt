Have been a regular here for several years. They have a great selection of cheeses, sauces and pastas. They also have a small bread area and produce section. \n\nMost of the reviews online have been positive so I will share my negative. \n\n1. Be careful of the pasta selections. You can pay a high price for a bowl of noodles that tear apart as soon as they hit the water. Know what you are buying or leave it alone.\n\nI have always felt that the people behind the cheese counter were very knowledgeable. Anytime I was cooking a particular type of food or looking for a cheese that would go good with........I had only to ask. This past time I saw one of the regular employees and informed him that we were making mexican food for friends and I was looking for a cheese that would make a good queso.....but I was unable to finish. As soon as I said the work \"mexican\" he glared at me and told me that although I may think he looks mexican - he wasn't.  He then left me standing at the counter while he went to get a drink of water. Maybe he was having a bad day - but he didn't improve mine any.  I bought my cheese down the street. Not sure I will go back, or at least I will try to get someone else to wait on me.
