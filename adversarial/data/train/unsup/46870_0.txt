This restaurant is my favourite pho  place in Brampton!! I've pretty much tried them all and I can honestly say this place consistently is good! The service is not the best but it's pleasant and family owned.  Overall, they are really nice people who try their best.  For $5  you can have a small pho that is fresh and tasty.  I also like their Banh xeo and found their pad thai to be delicious.
