Used an online deal for a message and facial. I arrived 10 minutes early for a noon appointment. The owner did not appear until 12:01. I had to fill out paperwork and didn't get started till 12:15. The woman giving me a massage said they would credit me for the late start. She left the room promptly at 1:01PM. I proceeded to do the facial and during that section I was told I needed a refining masking for my pores? Which my package didn't have and had to pay $10 more for. The location is next to a gym so I was hearing banging noises over the music which was not too bad but a little distracting. At the end while I was checking out and I mentioned the late start and credit offered by the massage therapist and the owner rather abruptly replied \"I talked to her and you got your full time because it's 50 minutes.\" First off,  I was only going by what the other woman said and secondly I only had 44 minutes done. Then she tried to sell me skin care products on top of that!  Anyways,  this was my first time going to a spa period. I will look for other places to go in the future when I go to the Charlotte area. I would most likely not recommend this place but the massage was decent and the back exfoliation was nice too.
