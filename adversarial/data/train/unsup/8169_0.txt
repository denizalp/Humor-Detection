I've been to their sister restaurant (Point Brugge) before and been really pleased and this was no exception.   It's a little out of the way from where I live and in the middle of a residential area but worth the effort to make a trip here.  This restaurant is a little larger than Point Brugge so I would anticipate a shorter wait.\n\nThe staff were really accommodating.  We had a very large group and after requesting a table for 8 to 10, we ended up with 14 people.   They made extra efforts to get everyone seats at our table and making sure we were accommodated.  With a group that large, I anticipated slow service and the food did take a while to come out and drink requests and refills were slow.  I imagine the service is much more personal and quicker for smaller groups.  \n\nI split the dinner moules frites (mussels and frites) in the spicy creole sauce with someone.   The sauce was nice and spicy and had great flavor.   It was great for dipping the bread they provide (which is a little on the crusty side) and gave a nice taste to the mussels.   With a lb and half of mussels, bread and fries, this dish was perfect for sharing.  They also have a good beer and wine selection and a nice bar area to sit at while waiting.
