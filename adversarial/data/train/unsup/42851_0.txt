I had a pastrami on marble rye at Greenberg's Deli. It was the best sandwich I have ever eaten thus far (I haven't been to New York yet). There is almost always a long line at Greenberg's but it is well worth the wait. We stayed at the Luxor, but I walked over to New York, New York a few times just to eat. The price is very reasonable for Vegas and the sandwiches are very big.
