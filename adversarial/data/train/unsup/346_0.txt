Mai Bistro is located near the north east intersection of Burnhamthorpe and Dundas just west of Islington Ave.  \n\nMy old stomping grounds.  The village of Islington is my old stomping grounds in a sense that it's the area my high school used to be before they took those acres and acres of land and turned it into residential land where towers and town homes are now.  The village of Islington has murals on the sides of buildings much like Philadelphia to remind you of how things used to be when things were a bit different.  \n\nI swear I had no idea this place existed.  While I live in central Etobicoke there are just so many places to eat in this city that little places like Mai could fall between the cracks.  Mai is a small, intimate place with nice lighting and serves small plates and \"large\" small plates as well.\n\nBasically their menu consists of tapas but it's a mix of all sorts of things.  Fish tacos, Argentinian steak with chimichurri?  Yes we ordered those.  If you want a nice variety of things to share why not?  This place is a nice experience and they also have a nice variety of libations to compliment.\n\nWhile I'm not really big on small plates (haha) the thing is we literally just ate before coming here.  We had a large small plate for dessert.  Sometimes small plates are just the way to go and if you're going to go that route this is probably the place to do it.  Oh and it's also in central Etobicoke so they're probably the closest place to my home where I can get something that has legit chimichurri.\n\nLooking back at this place, this is probably a good place to bring a date.  Small eating and drinking, intimate...
