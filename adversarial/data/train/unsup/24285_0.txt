I would give 0\/5 if that was possible. Moss Park should be called \"Murder Park\". The gateway to hell starts at the sketchy intersection of Queen and Jarvis where the Moss Park Armoury is to spine-chilling Queen and Sherbourne. This is where all the panhandling bums, crack heads, and drunks come out under the shadows to pry on you.\n\nMoss Park is not a place for Mister Rogers to have his neighbourhood stroll or to walk your baby carriage during a Sunday afternoon. With a drug-driven area, these people are homeless, perpetually addicted to narcotics and have missing body parts. It doesn't get any dismal,ghetto or deserted than Moss Park.\n\nIf you want to play tennis or play ice hockey, go anywhere in this city BUT here. The \"snow pile\" outside the Moss Park arena is rather suspicious and goodness knows if that's even snow or bath salts for those freaks who need to get their next high.\n\nIt's not even safe going with someone during the day, so use your common sense and do not go alone or at night.  \n\nGritty and frightening Moss (Murder) Park must be avoided at all cost, unless you want to walk your life on the tightrope.
