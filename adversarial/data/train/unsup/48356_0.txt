Indeed, I am a fan!!!  Ever since I had an acai bowl near Redondo Beach, I've been craving one.  I've made it but sometimes it's easier to just buy it and now, I can get it at Nekter Juice Bar.  It is sooooo good and sooo yummy and sooo full of good stuff, nutritious and is satisfying as well...  Nekter has a vast menu of juices and smoothies, pre packed juice cleanse and raw food choices.  I heart this place and will definitely, definitely be back!!!
