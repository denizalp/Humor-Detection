Yum, yum, yum! So tasty! Guilt-free gelato. I'm still a little guilty of eating more than my half, as I shared a medium with the hubby. \n\nSea salt caramel--heavenly, paired with the dark chocolate made for a perfect duo.  I'm so glad that they give samples because it was difficult to decide (at least for the second scoop--sea salt caramel is always a must-have for me). So many wonderful flavors to choose from. I wanted them all!\n\nThose tiny spoons are also genius, as they enabled me the luxury of eating this way longer than a normal sized spoon!\n\nLove Frost! The staff--friendly and very upbeat.
