We love Glaze! My kids and I just discovered this donut shop within walking distance from our house and have been two days in a row. We like to take a morning walk to have donuts before work\/daycare. This is also my 6 year old's only allowed Pokemon Go time, so he catches Pokemon while we walk. Imagine his excitement when we arrived and there was a super cute Pokeball donut at the shop waiting for him! The staff is very friendly, flavors are great and the donuts are always fresh. The texture of their donuts is fantastic. It's definitely a perk to us that we live so close, but if the donuts weren't special we would just drive elsewhere. I'm happy to say that we will be back frequently!
