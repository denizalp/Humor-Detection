If you want to eat inside, expect a club vibe. People can ride the gallo (rooster), which is Chayo's take on a mechanical bull. \n\nPlease note that the drinks are absurdly ridiculous. You're basically paying $15 for juice. I suggest that you avoid this bullshit. \n\nService is seriously slow even though there were hardly any other people.  On the upside, you can request for chicharrones as a replacement for chips. Table side guac is ok, I don't think paying $15 for 1.5 avocados is worth it. \n\nBe sure to anticipate the waiter to write on the bill what his anticipated should be. \n\nYou're better off hitting up Hash House.
