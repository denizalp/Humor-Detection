It's so disappointing to see how much this casino has fallen. The parking charges are ridiculous. Comps are really a thing if the past. Besides all the shows there's nothing that really sets this place apart from every other run of the mill casino on the strip. It's not as clean as it used to be. The bathrooms were horrible as well. Only a few sinks has soap and a few didn't work altogether. The machines are too tight for a local the gamble there. Local casinos have looser machines and tend to treat you better because they want you to return. It seems like this trip is just trying to get everything they can from you as fast as I can. It's not even in a lovely disguise anymore of special treatment, fun and entertainment. The service isn't what it used to be. I am finding less and less reason to visit the strip. The parking charges are enough to keep me from visiting.
