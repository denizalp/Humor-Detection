This is a great steakhouse. The service was great. The food was delicious. I tried their filet and it was absolutely perfect. I wasn't as hungry so I ordered the ahi poke. I loved it. I also highly recommend the truffle tater tots. SO YUMMY.\n\nService was good, only I will say it did take a fairly long time to get my meal. That won't affect my rating this time though because I wasn't in a hurry thus I wasn't bothered by it.
