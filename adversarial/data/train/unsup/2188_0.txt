I just turned \"The Jesus Year\" of 33 years old. My license was nearing expiration. I entered this tomb of doom and gloom for a new ID card. I pulled a number like the sign said. There was a multitude of dinky decade old signs plastering the walls. I thought I heard my number called. There were various lady heads popping up from behind the counter like meerkats. It was like Meerkat Manor. I wish it was Wack-a-Mole and I had a mallet. I didn't know who called my magical name. Bewildered I asked a woman \"Did you call my name?\" to which she snarkily replied \"Yes, sir I did. Step up\" so I did. She got me in and out with great speed. I don't need to be treated well in life or have an empty conversation with a BMV clerk. I know that I am an inconsequential being in a universe potentially created by a mean spirited Demiurge. I guess it is true what they say about mankind being created in the likeness because these ladies were angry.
