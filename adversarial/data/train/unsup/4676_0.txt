I will apologize now, just to get it out of the way  :) \n\nWinter in Phoenix is not winter, oh the calendar says December, but in reality it's barely Fall. I know, it's a desert, but people really need to relax if it's cloudy and rainy for more than 2 hours. I swear If I hear \" I hate the clouds and rain\" one more time I'll snap  \"Boston Style\" Seriously it's sunny here 320 days a year, and over 100 at least 30 - 40 days a year. Another 75 days are spent hovering between 90 - 99, and the rest, is like a decent summer day in Boston. So get over it, it's raining, and it's below 70, break out your wool sweaters, and UGG boots, quick!!  I welcome the variety, the change, the difference. I like weather that provokes you, and gives you feelings, and emotions, that sets a time table for understanding the world around you. 4 seasons inspires, the change is welcome, the colors, the scent, the food, the clothing, the difference is great.  So embrace the change, it will be hot as $hit in no time, and sunny everyday, you can all put your flip flops back on, and cargo shorts very soon, don't worry it will be OK. Oh and be sure to drive 25 MPH when it's raining, because modern day tires don't work well on wet surfaces, and wiper blades in AZ, don't work the same as they do in the North East. I know all you complainers are not from Arizona, so you have no excuse for not knowing how to drive in the rain....\/end rant, goes back to planning my move back to Boston LOL! :)
