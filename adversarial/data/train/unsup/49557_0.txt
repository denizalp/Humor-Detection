Hands down favorite place in Vegas for many reasons.  The food is amazing!  The price os right  and everyone who works there is AMAZING!  You really can't go wrong!!!  Also having gluten free options is awesome!  My favorite thing is the garlic knots, or the ceaser salad....well really everything I have tried is so good I can't pick a favorite.  Try the meatball sub and the wings too!  I actually have never liked meatball subs until my husband had ne try his!  So so so good!
