I was getting ready to give a mortgage payment to a strip casino for a massage when I came across this place on the net. Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! \n\nThe hotel's standard massage was 150 for 80 minutes and when you throw in tip, call it close to 200. I know there is a trade off cost for convenience but Massage Pro's 74 for 90 minutes just seems like a better deal. The taxi ride was roughly 20 each way but there were two of us so lets call it 94 plus tip for 90 minutes. They do give 10 dollars off for first time visits and advertise 1 hour for 39 dollars first visit. \n\nThe staff were very courteous and attentive. The massage was great. I kept falling asleep and felt bad for the therapist since I snore (LOUD). She made sure the pressure was what I wanted and at the end used hot rocks and hot towels. I felt very spoiled. It isn't in a pretty building and its in what appears to be an older part of town but I'm going back this week when I'm out in Vegas again. \n\nNote: To take advantage of the 10 dollar first time discount call instead of booking online.
