I tried their special for 50$ the first time I was there - Daphne as great. I was expecting her to tell me how clogged up my face was and I'd need a new face. \nBut she was kind and amazing. She took her time and took care of my issues. I felt amazing and relaxed. \nThis time and why I'm back on yelp I had a sesson with Leah. Her style was different but she was attentive and personable. She figured out quickly that I touch my face alot at work and I'm on the phone quite a bit. She used the most amazing feel scrub and moisturizer which I bought. I haven't done the monthly club bit but I probably should. I love my little facial ritual. I feel so much more relaxed and fresh
