Wow....talk about bang for your buck!!\n\nI paid $13 for the lunch buffet here on a Sat afternoon, and considering ALL THE FOOD OPTIONS, I was not disappointed! I mean, it's no Wynn or Wicked Spoon, but it's also like 1\/3 of the price of any buffet on the strip.  The food is really fresh, and I really enjoyed the multitude of BBQ porks\/meats, which were cooked very well. Things I def recommend:\n\n+Sopas (like a mexican flat tostada)\n+BBQ section\n+Asian noodles and BBQ pork bun\n+Mac n Cheese\n+PIE + gelato\n+Fruit\n\nI was not that impressed with the Italian section as a whole, but otherwise, this place is legit, esp if you're hungry :) Drink service was a little slower than I'd like, but all in all, a good buffet!
