This one is located inside of Red Rock Casino. I was expecting the same service and food, but obviously I didn't get it. I was the only one in line and I felt like they didn't want to help me. Not too many places you can order food from and they don't talk to you. Panda Express is a franchise food spot, so they serve the same exact food and sauce. So why were my noodles extra dry? What is crazy about all of this is that I will still go back and get the same food again.
