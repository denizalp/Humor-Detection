Great addition to SW LV\n\nAmbiance: 5\/5 surprisingly lovely inside! Beautiful center chandelier and flower arrangement. Sure the flowers are fake, but they're still some good looking fake flowers\n\nService: 3\/5 Friendly but rather slow, especially considering the fact that there were really only like two other tables there\n\nFood: We ordered the most recommended dishes...all good but none great...and aside from the gnocchi, I felt I could make the rest of what I had pretty easily at home. And no, I'm not a good cook.\n-Crispy gnocchi: 4\/5 good pesto, good gnocchi. but not exceptional\n-meatball wrapped in date and bacon: 4\/5 also just solid. \n-spicy seafood pasta: 3.5\/5 good, but nothing special. I mean honestly, is spicy seafood pasta ever not good?\n-dessert trio: 2\/5 this fell pretty flat for me. The chocolate cake was meh. the creme brulee was meh. brulee was thick and hard, not light and crunchy. and creme was not super creamy...more eggy. ice cream utterly ordinary.\n\nI still think it's a great restaurant for the area but unfortunately if these three things are the best dishes the Sparklings has to offer, I'm not that interested in coming back.
