My rockstar niece and her bestie have been taking gymnastics here for a couple of years, now. It is a bright and welcoming environment, and very safe - the padded floors should be everywhere they are so great - with learned and caring staff and coaches.  \n\nMy sweetie goes once a week and learns all of the apparatus, and the necessary skills to be healthy and active. Several times a year, they have performances, and family and friends attend and celebrate the growth and grit of our littles. They even give all of the athletes a medal. After two years of observing my niece's budding Olympic dreams, and as a lifetime gymnast myself, I'd suggest anyone enroll their child here, where they are well cared for, encouraged, and loved!
