For a local hardware store, Turney's is just fine. I have been going there for a long time. My dad shopped there when I was a kid, no such thing as Home Depot back then. I have never experienced the \"grumpy old man\" syndrome people are talking about. I think people are just trying to be funny at the expense of a reputable business. They have little bit of everything. Great paint selection, auto parts, keys, grills, lawn furniture, plumbing, electrical, etc. It is so nice to live in Chesterland and run in and out for my hardware needs. I have been in this store many, many times. The service I have received is great!
