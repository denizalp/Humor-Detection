I'm really surprised Cafe Rio has low ratings. I thought it wasn't bad. I went here because my friend is gluten free and she had a BOGO. It's more of a Tex-mex, not authentic Mexican food but it's pretty good for what it's for. The portions are huge and very filling I couldn't finish my food, but I'm happy I have left overs for the next day hehe
