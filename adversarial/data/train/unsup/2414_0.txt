Was not a fan of Sprinkles in Beverly Hills.  Was hoping for a better experience at this location.  \n\nWell, here is what I I liked.  It is located right on the Strip at the Linq Promenade.   The Cupcake ATM looks like an amazing feature.  Should have tried it, but I did not.  Maybe someday.\n\nWhat I did not like.  I was not crazy about any of their cupcake flavors that day.  Not saying that they tasted bad.  Just was not \"Wowed\".  \n\nOverall, I find Sprinkles cupcakes good.  Not great, sorry.  I recommend Sprinkles as a fine 3 star cupcake shop.  Nothing more at this time.
