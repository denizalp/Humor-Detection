This is the second time at this location, where employees think it's prudent to express their ignorant, racist, thoughts against hispanics to me since I look caucasian. Worst of all, the employee was a Mexican-American woman who thought it was OK to say \"I just don't like any Mexicans..blah blah\" I'm disgusted. Racism and generalizations need to end. \n\nThe first ocassion, a member of the animal adoption group inside the store made a similar remark. I emailed Petco and was contacted by the store's manager who was very polite and apologetic. Nonetheless, I believe employees should be taught to keep their thoughts and comments to themselves, rather than expressing them to customers.\n\nOn another matter, I initially started dog training with Deborah at this location. Training with her was a FAILURE. She ficus ed on gossiping and selling products to me, and my dog didn't learn anything. Deborah resigned soon after my training classes had begun, and I was transferred to dog trainer Carol.\n\nCarol truly cares about the animals and gave me a few additional ideas for training. She was nice enough to back date and start from day one, since my dog hadn't learned a thing with Deborah. Traning with Carol was a 3 out of 5 stars. I think Petco dog training is very brief and not many results are seen. \n\nIf Im giving this Petco location a 1 star because of their unprofessional staff, and inefectiveness from dog training. Im done visiting Petco in NW Las Vegas.
