I went to the location on Avenue Mont Royal Est.  This is a great, lively place to come for lunch while in the Plateau district. \n\nThere aren't many tables, so you may find yourself waiting for 10 to 20 minutes. Once you order food, it comes pretty fast. \n\nThe fake crab salad is awesome. \"Salad de goberge\" in Québécois ..\n\nA lot of Food businesses and cafes in this area pride themselves on offering St-Viateur Bagels.
