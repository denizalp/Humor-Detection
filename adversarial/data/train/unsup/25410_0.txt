So you need a new laptop? I have a MBP that I like but Apple seems to have stopped showing love the the MacBook like and haven't updated it in ages. I needed a new Windows laptop that would allow me to run the latest software. The downside to going here is that it's at the fashion show which is inconvenient to anywhere in Vegas. \n\nThe upside is the service is excellent. Everything they sell you'll buy at a big box.  But you would not get near the level of service. Upon entery you are welcomed and there is always someone  nearby to help. All my questions were answered, if they weren't sure about something then they asked someone else to make sure instead of guessing. Overall it was a great experience a day I will buy more items from there in the future.
