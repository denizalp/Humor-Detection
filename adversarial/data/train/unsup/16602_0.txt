This was an amazing experience. Rochelle did a wonderful job on my home. Had never done this before. Saw it on groupon and thought I would try it. I was injured recently and have not been able to do much. My home smells so clean and everything sparkles. I have 3 dogs, so you can imagine. I highly recommend this service. A supervisor even came by to make sure everything was done correctly. I will definitely use them again. It makes me feel better just knowing my house is so clean. Thank you Rochelle.
