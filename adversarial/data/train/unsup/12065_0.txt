I found this lovely gem from a Groupon purchase. Get the deal!!!! CAN.NOT. gush enough about this place. Just across the W's Bliss spa, you can get all the top notch service for a fraction of the cost. Love that it is tucked away amidst the bar scene where only the true treasure hunters would discover this place. It's intimate and cozy without overly imposing on your personal space. \n\nI decided on the dermaplaning facial to spoil myself. I love that they use PCA products because being a desert dweller, this heat wreaks havoc on your skin. The aesthetician was a perfect balance of gentle during the facial but firm for the neck massage. Everyone should indulge in a facial monthly. There's only one you. Remember that. Besides, we age not by years, but by stories!
