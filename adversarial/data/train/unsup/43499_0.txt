I have never had a bad experience at this location, and I've been coming here since it opened (not sure what the other reviews are talking about). We have a few favorite servers we ask for by name.  \n\nIf we try something that isn't great, we let them know. But that is rare.  And usually if we try something new they are promoting, the servers will tell you if it is a good item or not so good (so if you aren't sure, ask them). \n\nThe servers are always attentive and fun. They take care of us and really do great with our 5 yr old.
