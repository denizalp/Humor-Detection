I still stand behind my review of this and the Fairlawn location....\nPortions are small... my daughter brought me a Eggs Florentine for lunch. \nIf i weren't so hungry,  i would have taken a pic...\n\nThe eggs were barely the size of a silver dollar!!! I know. I know....freerange, organic...blah blah....\nFor $12... this prob had a food cost of $1.50 maximum............spinach,  2 slices of tomato,  1\/3 of a half an avocado....hollandaise... \n\nI wont go back...i know what theyre pulling here...\nno thank you. \n\nYou all keep paying the high prices...im done.
