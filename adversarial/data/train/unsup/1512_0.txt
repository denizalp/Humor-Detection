Mario's is full of Brah Dudes. If you're 21 and a Brah Dude yourself or wanting to meet a bunch of Brah Dudes, you might enjoy it.  It's not a place I'd choose to get food; I've tried a few things there and they were super mediocre. The best thing about it is the rooftop deck, which has been nicely renovated since Mario's purchased the bar.  Pretty nice on a summer afternoon.
