Bartender was nice and helpful, but almost every time we come in they are out of certain beers or something has been discontinued.  Our bartender recommended two beers, then came back and said they were out lol.  No surprise anymore.  That is my main complaint.  However, thanks for putting the PB&J sliders back on the menu amen!
