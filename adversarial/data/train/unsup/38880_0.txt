Ambiance is mediocre; to me at least, because I like color. Decor is mostly all white with colored lights that change every so often; it also has a moving piece in the ceiling that is supposed to represent the moon with multi layers that rearrange in different shapes. It catches your eye. \n\nAs soon as we entered we were being rushed to order as the kitchen was closing. No biggie. We ordered and set down and got our water. It was a waiting game from then on. Our waiter took 20 minutes to come to us after I got his attention for the drink menu. He brought one menu for 5 people. No worries we shared the menu then waited for another 15-20m to get someone's attention to take our drink order. Drinks came to the table at a reasonable time and were very good. I had the \"inception\" cocktail. It was delish. \n\nFood also came out at a reasonable time. \nApps: chicken curry puffs $15- 10\/10 curry filling was tasteful and good combination with puff pastry\nMr chow spare ribs $19- 5\/10 not much flavor.\nBeijing meat dumpling $15-7\/10 it was a little bland but mr chow's house sauce fixed that. \n\nFinished our apps and No water refills. Had to get someone's attention for refills. No one checked on us if we wanted more drinks from the bar or anything either. \nEntr√©e: \nSteamed sea bass $45- 10\/10 it's sea bass! The sauce on it was very good. \nVelvet chicken $36- 3\/10 no taste at all! Had to add lots of special house sauce.\nLamb with spring onions $38- 3\/10 again, no taste to it. All you can taste is the lamb and salt. House sauce helped. \nBeef with oyster sauce $42- 7\/10. Oyster sauce added enough salt to make it this dish pleasant. \n\nAgain, finished dinner, no water refills! I mean I am eating Chinese food here. Come on, you know how much salt and oil is In this food?! just refill my water when I am paying $15-20 for appetizers! And They weren't short staffed. They were OVER staffed in my opinion. Staff was just walking around aimlessly. I felt like I had to hunt someone down to get anything I wanted like simple water refills. The staff is friendly and accommodating once you get their attention just not motivated on their own. The worst part of it all was my stomach did not feel well an hour or two after dining here. And suffered the next day as well sitting on the shit pot. (It was only me that had stomach issues the other four diners did not have a problem. so it could just be me)\nIf it wasn't for the suffering I would have gone back to give them another chance and try other stuff on the menu.\n\nmr chow's special house sauce will fix any dish!
