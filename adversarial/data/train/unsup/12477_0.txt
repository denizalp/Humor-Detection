As much as I love the decor and concept I have to be honest...Teapressa the actual tea fails to impress me.\n\nTeapressa is marketed as strong as coffee. I was very curious to try. However, the teas are super light!! \nI would recommend getting the drinks HOT. The iced drinks were not worth it in my opinion. My medium sized rose latte was $5!!! And i did not even get a dairy substitute.  I think the prices need to be more fair also paper straws need to go. Spend less on extras like that and give me strong tea!! Also, if my Ruze cup has \"rose syrup\" it should have rose petals or something if we really want to go high end.\n\nOverall decor: 5 for rose gold decor \nPresentation: 3.5 get rid of those paper straws!! And ruze needs more cupcakes. ( they ran out)\nTea: 3.... I'm being nice
