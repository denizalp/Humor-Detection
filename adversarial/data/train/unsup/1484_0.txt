Last night me, my fiance and a group of four friends decided to try Harlem Underground while the Summerlicious food promotion was underway. We ordered one appetizer, main and dessert each off the prix fix menu. \n\nThe service started out good, got appetizers, drinks and mains quickly but when it came to dessert it seems like they forgot all about us. We made two complaints about the slow service and seemed that only one of the servers took notice and got us our deserts after waiting 45 minutes for them. \n\nWe ordered the Blackened Catfish, Chicken and Waffles, and the Braised Short Ribs.\n\nThe food was good but not amazing, not worth coming back for.\n\nLater that night my fiance and another friend got TERRIBLE food poisoning. I'm not talking about a small stomach ache. I'm talking about severe vomiting, chills, and even a fever that lasted for 8 hours. The food poisoning was so severe that I considered taking him to the emergency clinic at 4:30 am. \n\nI think the owners of this restaurant need to clean up their act as they are serving food that is unsafe for consumption. There could be serious food inspection agency violations here, consumers eat here at your own risk.
