EDIT- for whatever reason they could not fulfill my super easy order on friday evening. Some lame excuse about the line being too long...uh I'm pretty sure thats why you charge a $10 fee...for your inconvenience to do the thing I don't want to do...not using them again. Shame\n\n\n\n\nTIL that I can have McDonald's delivered.\n\nYes, it was THAT kind of wednesday. Slightly hungover (ok...a lot hungover...getting old sucks man..) and anything beyond getting up to occasionally put my finger down my throat was not even an option. In between bouts of nausea every time I looked at my phone I decided to google mcdonalds delivery; because I just knew that if delivery of a mcdouble was possible, it would most likely be in downtown Toronto. I first came across the delivery McDonald's website which just didn't seem legit...I think my total was like $500 or something absurd. then...\n\nI F*CKING FOUND SNAP.\n\nwithin 45 (sorry but this is necessary) f*cking minutes I had a really pleasant man meeting me int he lobby with McDonald's. I didn't catch his name so i'm calling him Jesus. Its happened. The second coming of Christ works at snap delivery and will bring you McDonald's. Or any damn other thing you want. for a $10 flat fee. \n\nyou are all f*cking welcome.
