I was not that impressed with the Bellagio hotel itself, but the fountains lived up to everything everyone says or what you see on tv. It was very romantic and very cool.  I got some great photos from different vantage points.  I think the shows ran every 15 mins. Well worth the walk from Mandalay Bay to see this show.
