As much as I hate airports, and as busy as it gets some days, the service at McCarran is actually pretty damn good.  I've been here probably more than any other airport in my life (which is a sad stat when you think about it) and this is not limited to about 10 times in the last 4 years.\n\nConsidering how big the lines get especially at security checkpoint, they work amazingly quickly.  Mad props to them.\n\nStill ... it's a freaking airport.  How am I ever going to give it more than 3 stars?  Airports by nature are not enjoyable places.
