About 3 weeks ago, I had breakfast at 5&Diner with a colleague, we rarely have a day off together.  It was perfect.  PERFECT!  3 eggs, over medium, and I mean they were perfectly cooked \"medium\", best hashed browns I've had since the Aristocrat in Boulder, awesome!\n\nWent back two weeks ago, ordered the same the same menu; the food came up so quickly, it had to have been just sitting there, an overcook, whatever, it wasn't \"fresh\".  I know this much for sure: it wasn't nearly as good as the first visit.\n\nToday, a late breakfast, I enter about 10:55am and I get the last table.  Now, I've been in the restaurant business and when the hostess fucking apologizes to the waitress for sitting the single patron at the last table, I'm already a little pissed.\n\nI tell the server I heard that comment and \"...I'll TRY to be a good little patron\", kiss my ass.  I order right away, so probably close to 11:00am.  At 11:36, I give her a HUGE EYE-ROLL, \"where is my food\" and she say's she'll check.    She'll check?\n\n[I want to take a moment to talk about CONSISTENCY.  If a restaurant is so prompt so as to have served me almost instantly on my prior visit, you cannot justify a 36-minute PLUS wait for any reason.  More on the \"reason\" why the order was so late in a moment]\n\nI said, \"no thank you.  Allow me to pay for the coffee and OJ and I'll be on my way\".  The server was nice, mgt said no chg for the beverages -- thank you and there shouldn't have been a chg -- I even said to her, \"It's not your fault.  I have no cash, I'll come back with a tip.\"  Which I would have done had she not said, \"...it was the 'extra crispy' on the hashed browns.\"  In other words, my order was 20 minutes late because I wanted extra crispy hashed browns.  BALDERDASH!  THAT'S B.S\n\nLast, TOO MANY FLIES!  GET A PEST-STRIP. SOMETHING!\n\nI'll never come back.  Ever.
