Come here for the beer and not for the service or food.\n\nI came here on a Friday night sat by the window. When we arrived we were told to sit where ever we want. We sat down and waited for about 5 minutes before someone came by. The guy who served us was not friendly. Almost seemed like he's doing a favor to serve us. Anyway, we ordered a flight. Then later ordered our food. I ordered the burger and asked for it to cooked medium rare. We also ordered the Cajun wings. The burger arrived, somehow, it was juicy and dry at the same time. The meat was packed way too tightly and was flavourless. The potato sticks it came with were decent, but portion was way too small - less than a child's handful. The burger was so dry that I had to wash it down with beer.  The wings were ok. Didn't think they were anything to write home about. There was barely any seasoning in it. After we finished eating, the server came by and asked if we wanted the bill....while we were considering ordering another beer. We told him we were thinking about ordering another flight, then he just kind of stood there and waited for us to decided. I kindly of felt pressured and rushed. \n\nAnyway, we won't be going back for food. I'd give 2 stars for food, 4 stars for beer, 2 stars for service. Si 3 stars overall.
