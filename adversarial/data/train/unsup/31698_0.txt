The first time I went I was blown away by the bone marrow poutine at the lunch service. The second time I went was dinner service and we ordered the bone marrow and the fish and chips. Wasn't as great. \n\nThis is mostly based on the food served. The poutine fell flat in comparison to the first time I had it. Could use some pickled shallots or something more acidic to cut through the fat. The poutine was a bit too salty as well. \n\nThe fish and chips were definitely not worth it. Dry as the Sahara desert. Fish were coated in cornmeal breading which doesn't really serve a purpose except leaving a gritty texture. Could be improved. \n\nService and drinks are decent. Good selection of craft ciders and beers.
