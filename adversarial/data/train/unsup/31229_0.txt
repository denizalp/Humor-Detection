The menu claims the empanadas are award winning and rightfully so.  They were the largest empanadas I have ever had and very tasty.  \n\nThe tortilla chips were homemade and served with a very solid salsa.  They serve the chips as part of the entree but I would have much preferred a basket when seated. \n\nI had the fish tacos which were served with a generous piece of tilapia.  The tacos were double wrapped in two thick tortillas which was a little too much tortilla for me.  Plus the tortillas were dried out after being warmed up.
