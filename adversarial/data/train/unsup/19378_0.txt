Talk about a great time.  This trail is one of the most rewarding ones at Red Rock.  Pretty easy stroll through the desert on a varied pathway.  The trail really does go through micro versions of each different kind of terrain you would find at the canyon.  Short under 3 miles round trip.  At the old creek settlers claim you can see wild burro and there is water in the creek, even this late in the hot season.  The creek had some tiny pacific tree frogs hopping around. You even have many cross section trail options to extend your hike at the end of the old settlers house foundation.  When you stay course past the foundation you will reach the marker that leads to the trail through the red sandy path into designated wilderness area.  After that you will find a rocky decline which will lead you further into the Pine Creek Canyon.  On the way back remember there is pretty nice incline to get back up to the parking area.  That'll make you feel like you had a hike, for sure.
