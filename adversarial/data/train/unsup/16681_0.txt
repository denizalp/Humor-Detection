Have been ordering take out from the Butter Chicken Hut for a year or so now and have been very satisfied with their service and food. They do free delivery for the Copperfield and New Brighton area, which is a plus.\n\nWe usually order their butter chicken, rice, naan bread, lamb vindaloo, and at one time we ordered some samosas. We have also ordered their pizzas, but those weren't as great as their Indian food selection.\n\nThe speed of their service is good. We usually order 30 minutes in advance and when we come to pick up the food, it is always ready. Their delivery is quick as well.\n\nTheir food quality is good, like I said the pizzas aren't their strong point. Their butter chicken  and plain naan bread is our favorite. Their lamb vindaloo has just the right amount of heat and the lamb is very tender. Their samosas were a bit dry and wasn't really all that special, so probably not going to order those form them again, but will keep frequenting their restaurant for our favs.\n\nI think the Butter Chicken Hut is a great neighborhood restaurant where you can satisfy your Indian food cravings.
