Yummy!!!! So far Ive tried both the crepe and waffles as the Rebel Special which is Strawberry + Banana + Nutella. Yum!!! My wife has gotten the Banana fosters crepe twice so far.  This place is just like the crepe places in LA if not better. I was wondering when someone was going to open up a place like this. \n\nBest thing is that they serve Thrifty ice! yes they have the chocolate malted crunch!\n\nJust like someone said it would be good if they crisp'd up the crepe and waffles a lil bit\n\nOverall, everything is fresh and tasty.
