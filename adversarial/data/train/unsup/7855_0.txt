This will be a multi-part review.  First, I attended the orientation and this is what I saw.  The classrooms are located in large rooms which are blocked off with partitions (similar to what is used for cubicles in a work place).  The grades are grouped 2nd-3rd and 4th-5th (I'm unsure about any other because those are the grades I needed).  All the kids have their own IPAD, which are not allowed to be removed from the classroom.  Second, I attempted to enroll my child who is special needs.  I was informed that there is not a separate resource room and that resource is essentially combined in a small group and taught by a regular teacher.  I was also informed that even if my child is behind in learning I am not legally allowed to hold my own child back (of course this was not a licensed attorney) a grade. I have to allow the child to be continued to be pushed through to the next grade and next grade.  LOL. And this would be what is wrong with the children in the state of Nevada.  I am actually thankful that they did not accept my child because I would not want my child to attend a school that thinks they are too good to have my special needs child.
