Simply amazing.\n\nMy husband and I recently celebrated our anniversary here and our experience was absolutely phenomenal.  Food was delicious and service was perfection.\n\nThis is what we ordered:\n- Crab bisque\nI am so glad that I found another place in town that has awesome crab bisque because my favorite is actually a lobster bisque that I had once at Treasures (Yeah...not someplace don't find myself returning to just for bisque =P ) It is super rich and flavors are just right.  I loved dipping some of the bread from the bread basket in it. My husband had a few spoonfuls and loved it.\n\n- BLT Wedge salad\nFrom what I tasted, it was OK. Definitely had better.  Still love the \"bacon salad\" at Del Frisco's Double Eagle steakhouse though.\n\n- Stone crab (medium)\nYou get 7 nice size claws. Definitely enough to share between two people.  The best part was the mustard dipping sauce!\n\n- Copper river sockeye salmon w\/ key lime butter\nEver since I had this kind of salmon in Alaska, I've been hooked.  It has just the right amount of fat and is not dry.  Mine was cooked to perfection at medium.\n\n- Dry aged bone in rib eye\nDelicious, no complaints here. \n\nAfter all of that, there was barely any room for dessert; however, we were presented with a complimentary anniversary dessert.  The brownie and vanilla ice cream was basic, nothing special.  We did ask our server about dessert recommendations for next time.  The key lime pie is a gimme and we were intrigued our servers description of the Havana pie (like tres leches!!).\n\nReservations highly recommended! We look forward to coming back =)
