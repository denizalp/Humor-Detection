It was Midnight on a Saturday and I was famished.  Mexican sounded satisfying, so I hit up Taco Mich.  \n\nI've driven by the $.75 Taco sign countless times but tonight I pulled the trigger.\n\nParking was actually difficult at midnight because there was a packed bar next door.  No drive thru, so you will need to go inside.\n\nThe Tacos are $1.10 each which is a great deal, on Wednesdays they are $.75 each.\n\nI went with the Al Pastor tacos and they were  very good.  Small street style, but so delicious.  Next time and every time I come back, I will only order the tacos.\n\nI also ordered the Super Nachos..  No bueno, for how authentic the tacos were, I was surprised these were lack luster.  The nacho cheese whiz and the ball park style yellow circular tortilla chips just didn't do it for me.\n\nIf it wasn't for the let down on the Nachos i'd be giving this place a solid 5 stars just based on the tacos alone.
