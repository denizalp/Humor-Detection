I liked my experience at this Starbucks where I supped down a double espresso (in a paper cup??) and did some Internet surfing while people watching. Good seating inside with some smaller tables, comfortable chairs and a large \"community\" table.\n\nI found the crew to be a little loud with their chatting. One of them is looking to move to a new Starbucks and everyone got to hear about his life.
