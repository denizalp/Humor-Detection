We ordered take out from Dickey's this weekend.  I know the reviews weren't great but we have been desperate for BBQ so we thought we would get a variety of items - they couldn't all be bad, right?\n\nI had the two meat platter, sliced brisket and cheddar sausage, cole slaw and waffle fries.\n\nJust ok portion which worked out well since I didn't feel as guilty tossing it into the garbage.  Brisket was fatty and bland, the sausage - I'm not ready to discuss it yet, I'll update the review if I ever get the stomach to speak about it again.  Cole slaw had a nice taste but there was so much liquid in the container it looked like soup, waffle fries were pretty good.  Roll was soft and pale so I didn't bother and I was so grossed out after trying the meats stuffing dry squishy bread down my throat didn't seem to be a good idea.\n\nHusband had the ribs and gave them a \"just ok\".\n\nI gave it two stars because my sides were ok though I may never eat brisket again and I will burn rubber out of the parking lot of any restaurant that I ever see list cheddar sausage on their menu.  One thing for sure, I won't be eating at Dickey's again.
