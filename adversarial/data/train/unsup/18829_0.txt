Waiting until 9 p.m. to eat means that the pizzas are not going to come fresh and piping hot out of the oven, so I'm taking into consideration that any slice I would have chosen had been sitting around for who knows how long.  \n\nAdding to the woes is that I like my pizzas very crisp, and on that count Villa delivered.  I can't stand it when I ask for crisp pizza, pick up a slice, and have it droop.  This sucker stood up like, well, use your imagination.  But to get it that way, it had to stay in the oven longer than usual, and now I don't know whether it seemed dried out from sitting out too long, or staying in too long!\n\nI chose the one lone leftover slice with spinach and mushrooms. (Gotta get those veggies in). It's thicker than East Coast pizza, but not so thick that it's like having only bread.  Overall, it wasn't bad, but wasn't over the top with flavor, so I'd have to rate it simply okay.  It cost 5 bucks with the toppings, but it was a pretty big slice. Maybe pricey by average pizza place standards, but one slice is enough to make a quick meal, and probably among the cheapest meals you can get at the food court.  Jeez, even an ice cream cone there is $5!
