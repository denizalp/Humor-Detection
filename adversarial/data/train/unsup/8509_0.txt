Had heard about Burgers 2 Beer from other visiting coworkers and trusted their word. Boy oh boy they were right...awesome for the foodies\/hangry bunch as well as the drinkers in your party! Outstanding prices and indulgent food options! There is definitely something for everyone. Burgers ($5.99 for almost all on Mondays!!), wings (59 cents on Wednesdays!), sandwiches, salads, appetizers and they easily accommodate unique requests. Beer prices are fantastic with most drafts around $5 or less. Pitchers follow suit with great prices as well as specialty liquor drinks $6-$8. I had a fantastic peach manhattan for $7.99 and a Grapefruit IPA for $5\/pint. The waitstaff is super attentive and very accurate. I love the atmosphere and will be back again before I leave town. It is located on Wilson Mills Rd across from Progressive Insurance, it is right off of the highway and easy to access. Worth a visit if you love good food, nice atmosphere and libations :)
