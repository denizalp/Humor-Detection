Typical mall with many stores but you must be a smart shopper and know a bargain when you see it.  Food courts seem dull, where is the Burger King, Mickey-D's, Taco Bell?  Hand sanitizer dispensers located at various locations throughout the mall but most are empty and have been for a week or more.  I guess dirty hands spice up the dull food.  Hours are great.
