Visited again today. The doughnuts were as great as my previous visit. I would usually only order raised, this time I ordered cake, old-fashioned, and buttermilk. This updated review surrounds their milk tea. On the menu they offer a variety of milk tea such as, taro, honeydew, strawberry, etc. I ordered strawberry milk tea. Unfortunately, it was not as good as I hoped, but I won't hold that against them. The lady behind the counter simply put strawberry flavoring powder on black milk tea and blended it. I'm not a fan of powders and syrups because they make a drink taste overly sweet and synthetic. To sum it up, I recommend their black milk tea but not their strawberry milk tea. I might try their taro milk tea to see if that's made from powder also (I didn't see taro powder from their supply).
