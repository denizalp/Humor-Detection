I only stop here because it is  convenient  to the location where I am driving to. The place is a mad house, super busy , people driving way too fast in the parking lot, and I am utterly surprised I haven't seen any accidents yet..I just get my gas , and get the hell out of there. I usually won't go in the store because of all the people backing out at the front stalls and not looking. What a stress fest.
