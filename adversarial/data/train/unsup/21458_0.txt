My sister turned 25 today and in true diva fashion told us we were going out to dinner because she wanted Zizi's. I had never tried it before but she was adamant about our family eating there.\n\nLet me explain something here: my family rarely eats out because my folks are super picky. I am the adventurous one that eats raw fish and alligator whereas they stick to what they know and at the end of all visits concur that \"homemade is better\". \nMy father and mother ordered the chef specials tonight (no substitutions no alterations...) \nDad: Grilled veal chop with veggies in a white wine, mushroom and oyster reduction. ($33)\n\nMom: fresh-made pasta with mussels, shrimp and calamari in a rose sauce.($23)\n\nOur table also had: mixed green salad, calamari fritti (fried), minestrone, pizza margarita and pollo rossi (grilled chicken with side veggies in a mushroom cream.)\n\nMy mother's plate was empty. She's a small lady. She will always leave food on the plate. She loved it!\nShe also went home and held my 4month old nephew for the first time so we are calling it a family lunar eclipse!\n\nMy dad \"el asador\" had nothing but good things to say about his meat!\n\nSo here are my final words, no more babbling- I promise:\nThe place is beautifully decorated and the menu itself is very much upscale. The food is deliciously prepared with quality and creativity. \nThe service is friendly and prompt. I ordered a soup and me thinks they forgot it...I would normally make a remark on here about it but they were apologetic and so kind about it that I would not count it against them. (So I'm merely sharing the experience as if you were all there with me).\n\nI loved it, I will be back!\n\nYou made my parents happy and your minestrone reminded me of my sweet Nonna (who I'm certain is smiling down from Heaven telling the angels hers was better but she's glad to see me eating).\n\nPlease allow me to add this note: ALTHOUGH I DIDN'T ORDER ALL THOSE MEALS IN MY\nPICS IN ONE VISIT I DID TAKE MY FORK AND EAT OFF OF EACH FAMILY MEMBER'S PLATE. (My reviews are as honest as I can make them, and I do try) I'm a real person with a real review about food I actually ingested!!
