A few months ago, my mom and I went to Victoria's and met with Doug. Due to the price\/what you're getting ratio, and the big ass cockroach we saw as soon as we walked into the building (that no staff member chose to see, or sweep up,) we decided against them.\n\nToday, 2\/9\/2014, my mom and I were at the M resort for the PWG bridal show. Making our way around, we saw that Victoria's had a booth. We were skeptical, but decided to check it out anyways.\n\nI did not see Doug, the man who helped us a few months ago. Instead, an older man, in a coral\/pinkish shirt approached us. For the life of me, I can not remember his name. \n\nWe told the man that we had met up with Doug at the venue a few months back. How he had forgotten about our appointment, and wasn't dressed to impress. The older man told us that Doug was no longer with them due to his lack of professionalism.\n\nWell, with that out of the way, we decided to bring up the roach issue.\nWe told him that it was the first thing that we saw as soon as we walked in.\n\nHe tried telling us that the bugs are only a \"summer\" issue..and at least they were dead. He has no control of them getting inside.\n\nuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh what?\n\nI've lived in Las Vegas my entire life. I know that rain, cold, hot as hell weather, if bugs want in, they are getting in. Weather does not stop creatures....\n\nOh, did I mention that my future husband is an exterminator....?\nLOL. Wrong lady to try and school on roaches. \n\nAnother thing that kind of made me giggle, he was trying to brush this off as a \"summer\" issue, but my mom and I never told him what month we went and visited his venue....I guess he just assumes when people visit. \n\nWhen I seemed unsold on the \"it's a summer\" justification, he very rudely ended the conversation and walked away from us. Shoo'ing us away because we dared to disagree with him.\n\n...And you got rid of someone because of their lack of professionalism? Right. Go ahead and act like a toddler throwing a tantrum because someone *cough cough* potential customer disagrees with you.\n\nI guess don't have your wedding here in the \"summer months\"..........(?)\n\nGood luck ladies and gents !
