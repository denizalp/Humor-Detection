In terms of wonton noodles, this is as good as it gets in the surrounding area.  I think the restaurant is run by the same guys that opened Jim Chai Kee up north in Richmond Hill.\n\nMenu is small and focused on exactly what they do best - wontons, beef brisket, fish balls, wonton noodles, rice noodles etc.  Can't really go wrong with any choice on the menu.  The wontons though are the highlight of this place.  Huge, juicy, and filled with shrimp.  \n\nSeating area is spacious and casual and comfortable enough to let you take your time with your noodles.
