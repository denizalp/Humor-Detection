I couldn't believe I'm the first one to write a review for this yummy korean restaurant. Whoohoo~~ It's my great honour.\n\nThe appetizers (small dishes) provided by  the restaurants are all great! Jap chae, potatoes are great! They also give us pan-fried korean pancakes on the house.\n\nWe ordered the fried dumplings. Not too greesy as they put some waxy paper underneath to absorb most greese. Really crispy, and definitely home-made.\n\nI ordered the spicy rice cakes with korean ramen noodles....yum...not too spicy but definitely a good kick in the sauce. My buddy ordered the beef ribs (kalbi) dinner. Lots of ribs for the price we paid and the food is really yuuuuuummmmmmm.\n\nOnly 3 people working in the kitchen, but the food still comes out quick. I hope they can hire more staff in the kitchen as it gets busier at a later time. And you can tell, they put good efforts in their food.\n\nThe service is great. The server check on us every some time. Great experience. :) I was debating..whether I should keep this place to myself and my friends. I don't think a lot of people know about this place yet. I don't exactly know when did this restaurant open but they still have the \"Grand opening\" sign on their window. Finally...I am generous enough and decided to share this place with everyone on Yelp after my second visit to this place. :)
