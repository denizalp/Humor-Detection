I went in the other day and i didn't see coffee milk tea on the menu so i asked if they had it, they guy up front didn't seem to know what i was talking about, so he asked the man in the back, the man said no, but that he could make something just like it with mocha. I asked if it was similar and the man stated \"yes, it's very similar\" i said okay that's fine, and when he handed me my drink, i was shocked because it just looked like a chocolate shake, which definitely isn't what i was wanting. I took a drink and it tasted like a watered down chocolate slush, so i went up to the counter and asked if there was anyway i could just get regular milk tea because i didn't realize how different it was going to be, then man hesitated and said okay and a few minutes later gave me a small size milk tea when i initially ordered a medium. I didn't say anything, but i just think you shouldn't say something is \"very similar\" when it's not and then give a customer half of what they ordered.
