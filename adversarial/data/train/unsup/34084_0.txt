I am surprised to be a fan of Applebee's. My first impressions of Applebee's from many years ago were not good ones. I felt that the portions were small and the food too high priced. Fortunately, with recent visits to 3 different Applebee's locations in Las Vegas, my impressions have changed.\n\nMy wife and I have found Applebee's to be surprisingly affordable and delicious. The 2 for $20 specials are a real value! Also, we really enjoyed splitting a bourbon black and blue burger w\/ bacon along with an order of chips and artichoke dip. We both have moderate appetites and were filled up after this meal. \n\nAll three locations were very similar with good food and service and we would return to either of them.\n\n3501 S.
