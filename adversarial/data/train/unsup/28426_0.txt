A year ago I gave this place a 5 star rating. I wish I could now give them higher. Terry and his wife are unbelievable when it comes to customer service. We had a huge problem with our Tahoe stuck in 4 low wheel drive and decided to limp to their shop on Sunday morning and leave the keys in dropbox since they are closed on Sundays. Terry happened to be there and he immediately knew what was wrong and got it unstuck and showed us what to do if ever happened again. What a huge relief. He would not charge us so we gave him money anyhow and suggested he donate it.\n\nWe are fans for life! This is my third interaction with them and it keeps getting better. By the way, they moved around the corner.....
