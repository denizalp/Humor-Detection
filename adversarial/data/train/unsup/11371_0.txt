Ugh!  I was a friend's place tonight and we decided to order delivery from Dangerous Dan's Diner...WTH were we thinking?  \n\nFirst of all, we ordered 3 burgers, 2 small fries, one Greek salad and a side of gravy.  My friends live about 5 minutes' walk from this place and it took over an HOUR for our teeny tiny order to be delivered!  \n\nWhen the food did finally arrived, it was greasy, the meat patty was HUGE and the cheese was disgusting.  We all ordered the same burger, the peameal and cheddar burger.  My bun was soggy and my fries were cold.  The gravy was so thick that the fries actually stood up in the gravy!  Blech!\n\nBasically, service was super slow, prices were okay but the food was disgusting...however, it's a burger joint and it's called Dangerous Dan's for a reason.  You pays your money, you takes your chances baby!
