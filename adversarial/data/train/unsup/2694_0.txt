A large and welcoming non-denominational Christian church in Tempe, AZ.  Pastoral staff are excellent and many resources (classes, groups, etc.) are available to fulfill a wide variety of needs.  When I moved to the area years ago, I tried several area churches but was overwhelmed by the consistent bible-based teaching, and healthy and genuine people who welcomed me in.  As I've grown older, the church has been invaluable in every new season of life.
