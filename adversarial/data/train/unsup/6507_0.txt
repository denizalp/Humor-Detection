Though Drai's doesn't serve as my absolute benchmark when it comes to nightclubs in LV (that distinction still has to go to XS), it's still a solid option for a good time - especially if your musical interests gravitate towards more of a hip-hop flavor:\n\n__________\n\nI've been to Drai's on a few occasions, and it's always a good time here. \n\n+ Getting in is generally a breeze - though admittedly we're big fans of the \"buy tickets, avoid complications\" approach. Our tickets allowed us to fly through the entry line, spending maybe ten minutes at most between the velvet ropes before we were allowed in an elevator up to the club. \n\n+ I can't speak as to why others seem to have such poor encounters with the staff here. Everyone whom we interacted with was pleasant and professional; the employees seemed to have a good handle on things, as evidenced once they began opening additional security lines as larger groups of patrons arrived.\n\n__________\n\n+ I'd say that the lighting and decor setup at Drai's can compete with the best of 'em - though the \"wow\" factor isn't quite at Omnia's level (but come on, how do you compete with that chandelier?!), and the polish\/attention-to-detail isn't as impressive as that of XS. \n\nThat being said, the LED screens and signature Drai's giant glowing party ball are the perfect setting for a night full of shenanigans. The club feels modern and upscale from both a technological and an aesthetic perspective; those that have been to XS will probably notice some overlap in terms of the overall look\/feel of Drai's (I believe that they were designed by the same person\/firm).\n\n- Note that Drai's isn't as spacious of a venue as some of its competitors; for those without a table reservation, the place will inevitably get so packed that you might just find yourself pushed outside of the indoor portion of the venue and onto the patio area. While the view from this outdoor section isn't ideal, you should still be able to enjoy the evening's soundtrack. Additionally, there ARE heat lamps positioned outside during the winter months so that you don't find yourself shivering all night long.\n\n+ Expect to walk out of your visit with some \"only in Vegas\" stories. On our last visit, my GF discovered a girl passed out in a stall (she had been asleep on the toilet for over half an hour, the attendant apparently had no idea that she was there), and we saw a conga line of 4-5 tumble down a flight of stairs, one after another, in a manner not unlike that of the Persian army in the first \"300\" movie. \n\n+ Much as in the case of the other major Vegas megaclubs, the headliners at Drai's don't come onstage until later in the evening - think 1:30-2ish. Thus, if you don't have a table reservation, there isn't THAT much of a need to be there at an early hour.\n\n+ Believe it or not - Rae Sremmurd put on an excellent show during the night that we saw them. The duo have an excellent stage presence and delivery that really had us goin'! I would wholly recommend checking them out any time they're in LV - our tickets were $30 and $50 for the GF and I (respectively). \n\n__________\n\nPRO TIPS:\n\n+ Though many here on Yelp seem frustrated by the lengthy lines at the various bars, we had little trouble getting drinks from the bar located near the outdoor patio (i.e. the bar closest to the pool). This bar is located away from the major walkways - and not everyone seems to realize that it's there!\n\n+ There's also a infinitely less crowded set of restrooms located near the outdoor bar; simply make your way down the set of stairs located next to the Beach Club DJ booth, make your way down a short hallway, and bask in the privacy & spaciousness!
