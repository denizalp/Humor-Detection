Wow where  has this place been  and why have I not seen their sign before?\n\nI know everyone has already reviewed and oohed and awwed , which it deserves.  But I  am going to give it a  better rating , it tasted great and my daughter liked it!   Yeah!  My nine year old  enjoyed it and it was good for  her.  Now we have a place to stop for a bite before getting on the freeway.
