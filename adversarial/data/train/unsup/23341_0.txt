Pristine House Cleaning was the first maid service I have used in Las Vegas and the only one I continue to use. Lorenzo, the manager, is absolutely great at scheduling an appointment time that works for me. There has never been a time when I called him and he hasn't been able to book me an appointment on the time and day that I want. I've even called in the morning for maid cleaning that very same evening, and they were able to come right at the time I needed them. \n\nThe three women that usually come to my condo are Maria, Lourdes, and Joaquina. They are very friendly and take great direction. They do such an immaculate clean of my entire 2 bedroom condo within 1 hour. They come in, get to work right away, and shortly after my apartment looks fabulous! They also have decorating skills as well. I take pictures of how they set up my pillows on my bed and my couch because it looks that good!\n\nI would definitely recommend this maid service. They are great with scheduling appointments, even last minute ones, and always show up on time.  I only have to use them twice a month, and they clean so quickly. Don't waste your money on cheap maid services because you pay for what you get. This maid service exceeded my expectations by far. Worth the price!
