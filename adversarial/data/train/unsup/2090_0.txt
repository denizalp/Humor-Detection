Custard Cup is a LONG-time family-favorite (I have memories of going there when I could barely walk), but today I had such shockingly abysmal treatment from a long-time employee that I felt moved to jump on yelp to say something about it. \n\nSomeone in my group was having trouble deciding between two things while we were ordering, and she said \"just make up your mind, because there ARE other people waiting to order\" in a nasty tone.  For the record, there were two other couples in the place and both had already ordered.  We weren't holding anyone up, and even if we had been it wouldn't be by much... and while it's her job to make sure things move along, it should NOT come at the expense of acceptable customer service. \n\nI left the place stuck between feeling shamed by the employee and shocked at her treatment of us... not the way that loyal customers should be made to feel by any business.\n\nI doubt it will affect my future patronage, because after 20+ years of Custard Cup in my life, one bad experience won't keep me from returning while I'm visiting my former C-U 'hood.  It has soured the magic for me, though, and this can no longer be one of those pristine childhood memories.  Say it ain't so - what's next, Curtis Orchard??
