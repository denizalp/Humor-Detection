Tracking number says package is at this location and has been for days.  My 18 yr. old daughter went to pick it up ( supposed to be 2 day priority, tried to pick up after 10 days of no delivery)  They were so rude to her they actually made her cry because they refused to look for it or even look up the tracking number.   They had absolutely no interest in helping her or finding her package, just wanted to get rid of her.
