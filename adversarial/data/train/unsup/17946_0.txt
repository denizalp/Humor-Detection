Again, great service from Sarah. Cashier and table service from Shari was excellent with great conversation. Greeted upon entry with a smiles from several employees.  \n\nLean brisket, bread, baked beans, cherry cobbler was fantastic tonight. Changes to macaroni and cheese - I don't know... I like it baked but it can be improved. I like the old style of Mac n cheese.\n\nI see many positive improvements at this business!
