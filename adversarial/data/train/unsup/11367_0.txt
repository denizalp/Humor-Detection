Berry awesome place to shop, located in the fashion district of Las Vegas! I loved my visit to this store! \nThe sales associate was super helpful in helping me find the right coat with the right sizes and colors. \nThey are a little bit pricey, but burburry is always worth it when it comes right down to it! Their perfumes smell amazing too!
