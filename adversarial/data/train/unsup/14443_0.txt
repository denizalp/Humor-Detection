Decided to give this shop a try because it's right by my office. Made an appointment using their online appointment setting system for 12:15, I arrived about 5 minutes early. Waited past 12:15 which is cool, I expect a little wait but then 10 minutes pass, then another 10. At that point I ask a guy is he Michael he says no I ask where is Michael. Guy says he stepped out to do something with his phone??? Really???? I had a 12:15 and no one bothered to tell me Michael wasn't even in the shop. When I walked in I told someone I had an appointment with Michael. At that point I left. I can't wait for Mike all day to cut my hair, that's crazy unprofessional. What's the point of an appointment system fellas. Get it together and maybe I'll come back. Till then I can't give you any of my hard earned money. Plenty of good barbers out there
