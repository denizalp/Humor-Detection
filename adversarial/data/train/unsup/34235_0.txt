This little diner is definitely a hidden gem. It looks a tad cheesy on the outside, but the food is amazing. The owner is really friendly and would gladly tell you about how he got started in the food business if you ask. The diner offers brunch, sandwiches, burgers, pizza and salads. Everything is super cheap and under $10. Portions are great and definitely worth it. The food took a while to come out though since it was a one man show.\n\nMy favorite sandwich on the menu is the Cajun chicken sandwich. It has a kick to it and the Cajun mayo adds that silky smooth touch. I also had the chance to try the Tuscan chicken sandwich and the beef fajita Panini, which are both amazing as well. The sandwiches all came with a side of crispy seasoned fries. The best part about this diner is that everything is freshly made by the owner himself. Even the greens on the sandwich come from his garden. You can't get more fresh than that. \n\nOverall, my dinning experience at New Way Gourmet was wonderful. The food was yummy, service was friendly, setting was clean and the prices were affordable. My next target on the menu will be the burgers and pizza, which I'm confident will be equally delicious.
