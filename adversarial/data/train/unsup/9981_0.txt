Pros: Coffee is good, and you get a free refill.\nCons: Food is disappointingly meh, *and* the portions are skimpy. One single public power outlet in the entire joint. Uncomfortable, vibration-prone community tables might drive you crazy.\n\nI ordered \"The Traditionalist\" breakfast which came out with some of the worst breakfast eggs I've ever been served in an actual restaurant. What were supposed to be \"scrambled soft\" eggs came out well-done and weirdly minced. What's going on, chef? Potatoes on the plate were skimpy - less than 2 ounces? The small scattering of mixed greens were out of place (to fill empty space?) on the breakfast plate, and the homemade toast was nothing to write home about. Bacon was decent and average thickness, but you only get 2 small pieces of it. $12 for this breakfast plate is a pretty bad value. You should have to pass a test to serve breakfast professionally. Wow, those eggs were bad!\n\nSame goes for the \"sides\" of protein on the lunch-dinner menu - don't expect a whole, or even half breast of chicken to show up if you order the side. You will get 4 or 5 small slices, for a sushi roll price. I fell for it - oops!\n\nWiFi is pretty fast here, and that's great. And here's an Easter egg: any lone beer order comes with a complimentary side of homemade paprika'd potato chips because of the particular liquor license they possess.\n\nUnfortunately for customers with work to do, there is only *one* single public power outlet in the entire restaurant, *and* the main picnic-table style community tables are disturbingly vibration-prone. If there is anybody else seated at your table, you will feel absolutely every hand movement, fork-to-plate, elbow bump, etc. from the other end of the table. I know this sounds totally crazy, but this is not an exaggeration. I'd be returning those picnic tables to their maker for additional stability supports.\n\nBTW, Makers & Finders' wooden coffee bar also has vibration issues - don't sit there, either.
