Terrible customer service....walked in, no other customers.  Zero prices or information available unless you get it from sales person.  Receptionist pages sales people who are all sitting at desks, nobody comes to help.  So we walk out... We already knew what we wanted to buy, it was an easy $5000 buy but instead we'll go elsewhere.
