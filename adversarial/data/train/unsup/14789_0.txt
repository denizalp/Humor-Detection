Props to LG for telling it like it is.\n\nHonestly - this place has 4-5 star potential, but the extreme ridiculousness of the portion sizes drops it immediately to a 2. W-T-F?\n\nTapas are supposed to SHARED plates. The portions here are so tiny that you would possibly need a magnifying glass if you tried cutting some of the food into pieces. The \"plates\" ranged in price from $8-$15 or so. You would honestly have to order about 10 plates each to feel satisfied. I was a complete joke. We actually had to go and eat cheap Vietnamese food afterward. \n\nI recently ate at Le Bremner in Montreal (Chuck Hughes new place) which also serves up \"shared plates\". The cost of the dishes there were on par with Salt Wine Bar, yet the portions were 5-6 times larger.\n\nIt's sad - because everything else about this place is great. Amazing wine selection, lovely ambiance\/decor and extremely attentive waitstaff. Unfortunately it's just extremely overpriced.
