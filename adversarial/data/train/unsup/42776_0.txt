I love diner food.  The menu is huge, the portions are huge, and the bill is small.  The coffee is tasty and you can have breakfast all day.  What's not to like?\n\nMy go-to for the first time at a new diner is a turkey club.  It's a sandwich I won't make at home because it's rare I have all the ingredients on-hand, but an easy sammie to execute at any level.  I like it with honey mustard over mayo, on white toast, with a pickle.  And Drew's knocked it out of the park for one reason: it's real, sliced turkey!!!  Not some processed, gelatinous deli meat, but actual sliced turkey!  I couldn't believe it and now I'm spoiled on club sandwiches for a long time.  And the honey mustard--house made!  Excellent!
