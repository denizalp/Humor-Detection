Okay, for starters I myself am Mexican and I cannot stress this enough. This is NOT Mexican food. It was so bad. The food was overpriced, everything was bombarded with onions and bell peppers. The service was super bad, took my mom 15 minutes to get a margarita and that was because she called a waitress and asked about it. There were about 4 other parties there, so I do not know what could take so long. The band that played tonight was BAD. I'm all for giving local bands a chance but this band just seemed like a bunch of 30 year old hipsters that needed to prove they could still be in a band. I don't like trashing places but this place was just not a good experience. their water was probably the best thing there. oh, and parking is expensive too, so good luck if you decide to come here.
