yum!  my parents and i enjoyed some delicious homemade italian fare at pasta casareccia's.  half is a lunch eatery that has a 50's meets 80's kitch interior and half displays all the goodies that you can take home with you.  the specials are listed on a chalkboard near a shiny red vespa that is up for a drawing - all you put is your name and number on the back of your bill to enter.\n\nthe spaghetti with meat sauce (i asked for a little bit spicy) was fantastic!  there is nothing like fresh pasta.  the meat ravioli au gratin was also very good.  we finished the meal with the homemade tiramisu which was light, fluffy and creamy with our coffees.\n\nafterwards, we couldn't pass up the chance to buy and take home some meat lasagna and more spaghetti with spicy meat sauce.  after 2 lunches in a row of pasta from this joint - i'm still humming italian tunes.  the lasagna by the way is the best i have ever tasted!
