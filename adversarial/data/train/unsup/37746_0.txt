Great work and study spot during the day. My go-to! The cool, cozy and relaxed atmosphere makes me feel as though I am in a cafe in Venice, California (a nice escape during winter!). Love the healthy meals and daily specials and would love to see more offered on their regular menu. Always great service and I like that the Root is always populated with people, but never too loud to work (bring headphones).  We need more spaces like this in NE Ohio!!
