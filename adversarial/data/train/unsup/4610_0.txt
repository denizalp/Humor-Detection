I am so torn about this place. On one hand, as a vegetarian, do I want a little place serving all vegan food in the middle of the culinary wasteland that is Robinson to succeed? Absolutely. But on the other, I'm rather scared of cults. And there is definitely a creepy vibe here.\n\nWe ordered the crispy rolls and the summer rolls. The crispy rolls didn't seem all that different to me than regular veggie spring rolls (they just taste fried). The summer rolls, however, were excellent-- really fresh, and served with great peanut sauce. My entree was on the specials list, and I've forgotten the exact name but it's something like Sweet and Sour Divine. That was great-- very fresh veggies and soy \"meat\" in a sweet pineapple-y sauce. My husband got something called Guru Curry, which was good, but spicy as all hell. I couldn't have eaten very much of it.\n\nBut as everyone else has mentioned, they have two giant TVs showing a very cult-ish TV channel. It has subtitles in about 17 languages (not kidding). It reminds me of something from Idiocracy. Fortunately the sound is off, but still, you're watching something called \"Supreme Master TV\" while you're eating dinner, and that kind of ruined it for me. The all-white color scheme didn't bug me-- it just looked clean, which is always a plus in my book. But yeah, mega cult vibe... not going back.
