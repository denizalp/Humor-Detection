Green Valley Presbyterian Church is not what I consider to be my home church. Though I have been a member for a bit more than ten years since I first moved to the Las Vegas Valley. I guess that makes it my home church away from home church. Anyhow, I love Green Valley Pres and it pains me that I do not attend more often. I live on the wrong side of the valley to go every week like I used to. But I still come back a few times a year and catch up with some old church friends. After ten years there are quite a few people I know pretty well. None more than current pastor Dr. Ken Harper. He saved this church when he came in several years ago. Previous pastor Hilda Pecoraro left and attendance dropped. But Ken came along and he is great. He is funny and very smart. He has a speaking style that is so easy to listen to and a way of really getting a message across. And he knows his congregation. He walks around before and between services to catch up with everybody. All of whom he knows by name. The church as a whole is very welcoming to everyone. They take time out of every service to welcome any new comers and visitors who care to introduce themselves. But there is no pressure to do so. I have been to other churches that don't give me the warming sense of family as this church does. It may be a big church but it feels very much like the small church I come from.
