Clientele is shady. It's a really, really weird mix of people...good people watching, but don't look too long!\n\nI guess I wasn't sure what to expect, but it's consistent with this part of town. All I could think when I walked in was, \"Huh?\" \n\nThe bartenders are friendly. The drinks are cheap. I'm not sure if they serve food. Even if they did, I'm not sure what it would be or if I would try it. \n\nIt's a little crazy when you walk in. Use you're imagination friends.... It looks like it used to be a strip club and there are volleyball courts outside. I really don't get it. I'm sitting here writing this right now!...and I don't get it. One part pool hall...one part casino...one part strip club= worst shot you've ever had. Expect a hangover!\n\nBut, hey, why not give it a shot?!
