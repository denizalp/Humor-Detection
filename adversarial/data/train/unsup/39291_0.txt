Ok,I gave it a 4 stars based on the fact that the signature burger ,The Applewood was very good. The service was great the guys who waited on us were very nice and helpful, they had no problem kind of guiding you through the menu. I kind of wish they had their own restaurant; It is located in the back of Park Place Pub and there is no sign outside that I could see. So they lost one star for that and that alone. That being said ,i understand you have to start some where, so when you get your own place make sure it is well lit, people like to see their food.  I recommend  you try their burgers you won't  be disappointed.
