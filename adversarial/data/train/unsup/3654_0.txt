A fantastic choice in the midst of the yuppie zombie experiment that is the distillery.\n\nSure, it's very expensive.   Giant mexican murals and heated patios cost money.\n\nBut is it overpriced?   Hard to say.   It must have taken years to train the busboys to squish avocados into guacamole by hand.   To me, that seems well worth the nine dollar tab for the service.  \n\nOne of the best fried fish tacos I've ever had.    Spectacularly spiced and well garnished.   Beautifully sized and well presented.  \n\nApparently everything else there is horrible.    But I don't know that because I keep coming back for the fish tacos and the handful of potato chips with expensive fancy guacamole.  \n\nIt doesn't hurt to finish with Churros.   \n\nWho doesn't like ten dollars worth of glorified donut?
