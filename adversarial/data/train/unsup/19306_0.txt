I love this bingo room. Admittedly this was the first place I ever played bingo, but after venturing out to some other places this is the only place I will ever go again. Its a large, bright room and lots of nice staff.  I love how the smokers are in their own little box, the room smells great, well great for there being a smoke filled room with its doors opening and closing haha. Theres also a great mix of people, young, old this ant your grandmas game anymore.  \nThey also play fun variances of the five up down or diagonal bingo you played in school, hard way (no free space) double hard way, postage stamp (4 in a corner) and double, 6 pack, an X, and probably a few others.  Ive won a few times here, if you get an electronic pack you can play like 120 cards at a time.  Work smarted not harder!
