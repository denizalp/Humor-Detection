\"NAWT YO DADDY\" nacho daddy... hmm? It's the name of the restaurant that drew my family & I to this place, LOL! Until we saw reviews, we really wanted to check it out. Came here for lunch only to get their nachos to-go. We ordered 3 of their nachos to take back to our hotel for a party of 8. \n\n* Ordered: \n- Filet Mignon nachos (5\/5 stars): As soon as we got our order & had to wait for our uber driver to pick us up.... we completely finished this entire box between 4 of us before uber even got to us! LOL! We had to order another box. The mixed fish, cheese, & salsa make this a good combo with chips.\n\n- Seafood nachos (3\/5 stars): This was our least favorite, but was still finished by the end of the day. I think the mango was too fresh that it didn't taste as well with the seafood & my cousin agreed.\n\n- Fiesta nachos (4\/5 stars): This was our 2nd favorite. Packed with meat, cheese, & colorful chips. Definitely looks like a fiesta in a box. There was a lot of meat in this one.\n\nMissed out on the full sports bar & drinks but they do serve happy hour, gear, & games to participate to win in! All 3 boxes were good for a party of 8. Not a full entree, but good enough for a filling snack in between drinking throughout the day!
