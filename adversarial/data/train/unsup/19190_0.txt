I have an abnormal fetish for gelato spoons.  So, I was really delighted that the friendly staff accommodated my request for different colors every time they gave me a sample.  Actually, I didn't ask, they just noticed I was trying to covertly wipe off my slobbered spoons and tuck them into my handbag.  It became kind of a game to give me more and more samples on different colored spoons.  Heh, bored teenage servers.\n\nBut in the end, I couldn't decide between the amarena (sweet cream with sour cherry) or the baci so I got both.  I love gelato!
