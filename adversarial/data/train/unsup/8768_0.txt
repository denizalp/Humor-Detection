Chippy's is so-so. I landed here on a hunt for food to eat in the park. Not the best I've had, but it wasn't offensive or anything.\n\nThe good:\n- not overly battered (read: greasy) fish\n- good location for summertime eats\n- service was relatively fast considering only one person was working\n\nThe bad:\n- the fish to fry ratio is off. if there were two pieces of fish, this meal could easily be split for lunch\n- some of my fries were cold in the middle\n\nThe ugly:\n- extra charge for tartar sauce!!!!! wtf, that's half the reason i get fish and chips.
