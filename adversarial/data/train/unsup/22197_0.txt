Entrance in here is perfect for this space. You walk down a couple sets of stairs and you enter into another decade... the 1920's. The atmosphere is cozy and romantic, perfect place for a date night or a night out with your lady friends!\n\nThe drink menu is varied between classic cocktails with a surprisingly southern flair. I had the Corpse Reviver, which was crafted perfectly. I say crafted because the drink is carefully put together with time and perfection. \n\nThey are not whipping up a cranberry vodka and slinging it to you. They are expertly crafting, hopefully, a delicious drink with house made syrups, fresh herbs and fancy cups. You must wait, and hopefully the wait is for a delicious cocktail. I can say that there's a little wait, clocking in around 15 minutes, but worth it. \n\nWe hung around and listened to a very talented crooner sing the classics. I was very surprised to see a TV blaring in the corner. But I guess you gotta please everyone, just  may take you out of that 1920's haze. \n\nYou definitely need to stop in here for a classic cocktail.
