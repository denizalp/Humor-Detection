A decent buffet, but I expect better from Bellagio. I went here on a Monday evening with a 2-for-1 reward on my MLife account. There was a short line around 6:00pm, but the line for MLife members made it go by quickly. Service was the best I've experienced at a buffet - never had plates cleared\/drinks refilled so quickly. \n\nCarving stations included kobe beef, prime rib, turkey, chicken, and sausages. I liked their selections of pizza, pastas, soups, and breads (especially the pretzel rolls!). Snow crab legs were decent and I appreciate the staff steaming them for me quickly, but I was hoping they would have king crab legs. Made to order tacos...would prefer to make them myself. Chinese dishes were subpar. \n\nSushi had a decent selection, but since I can't eat raw fish my only option was the California roll, which was better than most. I liked how they have the option with or without the seaweed wrap. Also liked their condiments, including a sweet soy sauce and spicy mayo. \n\nGreat selection of desserts with beautiful presentation. My favorite was the mango panna cotta. Good toppings for the soft-serve, like Oreo and Butterfinger crumbs. However, was disappointed not to see any gelato or macarons. \n\nI wouldn't come back and pay full price ($38). I much prefer Bacchanal Buffet at Caesar's Palace since they have a lot more different foods to choose from, even with the higher price tag.
