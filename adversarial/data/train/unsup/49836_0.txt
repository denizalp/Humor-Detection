This is a great place to eat.  It is exactly what it says it is, a fusion of different Asian foods, although it seems to lean heavily towards Chinese food, which is fine by me. The shrimp with lobster sauce is pretty Awesome, although I am not crazy about the Mongolian Beef.  It's still a solid choice for Asian food.
