Excellent cake - Design AND Taste!\n\nI emailed Rondi with an idea of what I wanted for my daughter's 3rd Birthday Minnie Mouse themed cake. She had great ideas and drew up a draft of what she thought would look best from the ideas I gave her. The cake turned out perfect! It looked so amazing, and all the mothers at the birthday party were impressed! Not only did it look fantastic, it tasted soo good too! The top layer was a carrot cake and the bottom layer was a rainbow layered cake which was so bright and colorful, the kids loved it. The cake was super moist and not dried out with the perfect amount of filling\/frosting. \n\nI have ordered custom cakes for my daughter's 1st and 2nd birthdays but decided to go with a different baker this time around and so glad I did. I will be using Rondi for all of my daughter's future birthday cakes. \n\nRondi provided quick response times to all of my emails and pickup was a breeze!
