Called the parts department at Carter Powersports at 9:05 AM. \n\nI asked if they had a particular part. \n\nAfter being put on hold they came back and said they had it. \n\nI drove across town to get it.. showed up at 10:00 AM\n\nWhen I arrived and went to the parts department they said they do not carry the part in stock and would have to order it.  \n\nSo, yeah.. I won't be attempting to deal with these people again.\n\nbtw, \"Powersports\" is two words.
