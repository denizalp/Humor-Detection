My name is David and I am a shopaholic. Depends on how you look at it, please leave or don't leave me alone in this shop. Topshop has been described as a higher end H&M. Unlike their competitor, the material feels less abrasive against the skin. This is not meant to bash the former, and this luxury definitely comes at a price. Most of the items are more expensive than H&M as well.\n\nThe guys section has a selection of casual to business casual attire. What stood out were the accessories. Although they were inexpensive, they do not look cheap. Move over ladies, you are not the only ones allowed to sport quirky jewelry anymore. Skulls, crosses, chains, studs, spikes, ear cuffs, and layered bracelets are available to liven up any outfit. In fact, the store looks like a Korean boy band explosion. I have not seen so many colors and unique patterns since I was in Asia. \n\nThe checkout associate was so nice. She asked me if I was still a student of any kind. With an ID, you get a 10% discount. It is not an opening week special, but will be continuous. Dangerous!
