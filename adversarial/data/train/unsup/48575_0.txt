This place is just overwhelming! If you are into outdoor sporting, they have the equipment for you. This place is massive with two floors, a large fish tank in the center, and a pond with real fish and ducks. This is not the type of place you would normally find in Las Vegas, especially attached to a casino. They have everything from fishing to hunting equipment, and a wide variety of apparel.  It's a cool place to check out even if you aren't into these things like myself. It is just fun to look around at the variety and the size of the store.
