This is my first time here. The place look nice and clean. There is menu on the counter to look at while you in line. This place does get busy. \n\nFor drink I try mangonada. It was pretty good. If you those type that crave Mexican mango snack this is perfect for you and on a hot day to cool off. My boy got Strawberry mojito. He said it was good and refreshing. I will have to try that next time.\n\nFor snack I got Hot Cheetos Fries. It was okay. Only if they added more cheese. I waited 20-30 mins and 3 customer got there before mine. I order way before them. That is where the 2 stars went down. The young white male employee that was making the foods doesn't know what he was doing. He was skipping order and wasn't giving it out in order. If you going order foods and it's busy. Hope you have some patient. Remember to keep your receipt and number.
