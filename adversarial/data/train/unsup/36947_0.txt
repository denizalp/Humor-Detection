Salt blast. Everything tasted great, but afterwards we had to chug down a lot of water to counter the salt. Had 2 dinner set, one beef, one pork. Both delicious. Fish tacos were well seasoned. The quesadilla was huge and welll worth the price.\n\nOverall: Excellent service, large portioned and flavourful food. Only problem is the salty aftertaste.
