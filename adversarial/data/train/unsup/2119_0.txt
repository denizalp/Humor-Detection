You can see it in their menu items and their unique and fresh sushi.\n       - AYCE Premium - With most of the premium items being sashimi, this is a nice way to get more variety and give that omakase feel at an AYCE place.\n       - Fresh - Freshest you'll get in the desert.\n       - Rice - Just like Sakana, this place has a very good fish to rice ratio that won't leave you full of carbs.\n**Options**\n       - $20.95 Lunch\n       - $25.95 Dinner\n       - $28.95 Premium Dinner (Dinner + What's on the black board)\n**Highlights** (Rest of the things ordered are in my pictures)\n       - Dynamite - The presentation on the sea shell is a nice twist to a AYCE favorite.\n       - Power Up - Deep fried eel.
