If you are coming to Vegas, definitely use Free Vegas Club passes! \n\nCheck out the website and choose the events or clubs depending on the date because each day, there might be a different deal! For instance, there might be one that offers free admission, while another one offers free drinks til midnight etc. So definitely, plan ahead (or not). \n\nChris is very responsive via text and makes sure your experience is flawless. When I told him I was looking for something to do after clubbing he immediately sent us a limo to a strip club and hooked us up with free drinks. This one time, the limo driver who was supposed to drive us back to our hotel did not show up for 30mins, so we took a taxi to our hotel. I told my concern to Chris and he even paid for my cabfare. I was very pleased and suprised by his gesture!\n\nI definitely recommend FVCP! It will make your Vegas experience more convenient and fun. \n\nIn short: free dranks, vip access and skip lines!
