I am a huge boba (bubble tea) fan. I drink boba on average 3 days per week back home in Los Angeles. I was very excited to find a boba shop in downtown CLE within walking distance from my work. \n\nMy first impression of store was that it was very neat and clean. Gave me a very hipster LA tea shop vibe. I noticed on the menu that there were only two selections for boba: black and green tea. I asked if there was a green milk tea option, and the cashier looked at me really confused as if I was speaking a foreign language. She tried to sell the \"Jasmine Blossom\" tea drink to me... but she wasn't answering my question. \"Is there a green milk tea option?\" I also asked if Jasmine Blossom had milk in it... and she strayed away from answering my question and suggested that I order a Green Matcha drink which is very creamy. At that point, I stopped trying because she clearly didn't know what I was talking about. \n\nI ordered the Jasmine Blossom with boba which was ok. It was very watered down and didn't have much flavor. The boba was very hard, and not fresh at all. I won't be coming back.
