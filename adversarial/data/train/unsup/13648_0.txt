With so many boba tea places in the valley, the competition is fierce and one bad impression can be costly. I decided to stop by here and try them out. Walking in, there's a few tables in the front and the counter with additional seating along the back in a long, narrow space. Perusing the menu, I went with my standard Thai tea latte with less ice and black boba. I requested 80% sugar but the guy said it comes on the sweet side and they don't recommend more than 50%, so I changed my order.  Price was on the higher (typical) side, it was almost $5 with tax.\n\nWhen I tried poking my straw in the cup, it was blocked by the large ice cubes. Once I tried it, it was hardly sweet, and there was way too much ice in it. After a few minutes, there was no flavor left and it tasted watered down. The boba pearls were fine, that was the only redeeming quality. Not sure if I got a bad batch, but it seems like almost everything was done wrong so I won't be back anytime soon.
