PizzaRev is the latest addition to the \"Subway\" style quick serve pizza joints popping up all over the place.  The process is the same as other similar restaurants-you go down the line choosing your crust (regular or gluten free- add $2), your sauce, cheeses, and additional toppings; then they fire it for 3 minutes.  They also offer salads, dessert pizza, beer, wine, and soft drinks from a Coke Freestyle machine.\n\nI found PizzaRev to be my least favorite of the new pizza places like it.  It was okay, but in my opinion, Blaze and Pieology are far superior for crust, pizza size, and topping selection.  The flavor of the sauce, cheese and toppings was good, however, PizzaRev's crust reminded me of a matzo or water cracker.  It was so thin, crunchy, and tasteless.  It did hold up to the topping test though, so that's a plus.  The pizza size is also noticeably smaller than Blaze, but is slightly more expensive.  I also wished there were more veggie topping choices.  \n\nNow that Blaze is open across the street, I guess we'll see if there's room for both of these places on the corner of Sunset & Stephanie, but I know what my choice will be.
