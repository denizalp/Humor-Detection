A lot of people may not know this, but when Steve Wynn is in town he always comes here for lunch. He stays in a villa right next door so if you're lucky you'll see him here with a hot little Blondie walking guide. He literally walks out his door into the restaurant.  He figured it out, \"screw the walker or the wheel chair I'll just have my own hot Blondie porn star walk me around all day.\" \n\nWhile the Wynn offers other several great restaurants the country club is a great lunch spot. \n\nIt's down the way from Stratta and if you're wearing a tank top and sandals you'll have to change as I found out. \n\nThe place is pretty cool as it's situated right on the golf course and really has that \"country club\" feel, which you would never expect to even be there unless you knew.  As always the quality at the Wynn is exceptional so you won't have to worry about that.
