Urgent care with super high prices prepared to be nickel and dimed.  \n\nThe staff was very nice but the price led me to not get my dog treated that night and wait till the morning for my vet.  \n\nMy dog had a deep cut on his leg.  They had an itemized cost sheet for everything needed for the surgery each individually priced totally over 500 dollars.  The cut was less than an inch long....  Neuter surgeries cost less than that and are way more invasive then just stitching up a cut..\n\nI took him to my vet in the morning (Island Pet Hospital) and was charged 430 dollars and they stitched his laceration and cleaned his teeth since he was due for his cleaning.   About 200 dollars of that was for the dental cleaning portion..  So essentially I was being charged just about double at St Rose clinic...\n\nBe prepared to fork out the big bucks for this clinic!
