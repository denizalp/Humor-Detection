I know this is counter to the hipsters clambering for artificial scarcity in their lives, but Little Miss Q is definitely not worth any wait much less the wait they build in. Their BBQ is over smoked, prices are high for both the meats and sides, and you have a 50\/50 chance of parking. The fatty brisket is the only thing they serve that is almost good but the 1 inch of hickory bark ruins even my favorite cut.\nFor a 3 hour lunch and $20\/person, we have a lot of choices in town.
