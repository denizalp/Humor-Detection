I'm a water girl, so this particular Cirque de Soleil show captured my heart and was sexy as hell. I've seen about six different Cirque shows over the years and many have similar elements (audience interaction, contortionists and comedic interludes), but this one was something special. And unlike other shows, I can't imagine it will ever tour due to the complex staging. \n\nThere were certainly some wow moments, especially the acrobat doing a hands free headstand on the trapeze and the cliff divers who jump from the rafters into a small pool.  But my favorite part was the acrobats launched into the water from a variety of swings. It makes you feel as if you can take flight. Just a perfect blend of artistry, comedy and engineering wizardry.
