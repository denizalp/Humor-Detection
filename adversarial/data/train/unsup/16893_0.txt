A solid average ... only because I loved how someone else's salad looked.  Had brunch ... breakfast burrito.  Small-ish ... very little of the sausage in it.  The fruit cup was a little \"aged\" - not bad .. but I had visions of the fruit having been chopped yesterday and sat in the fridge being sad all night.  Service was great.  Just not the 5 star experience I was expecting based on the reviews I had seen.   Perhaps lunch would have been a better choice than breakfast?
