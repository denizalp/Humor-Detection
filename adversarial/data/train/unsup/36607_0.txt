I am not really a big seafood fan but I have been to Big Daddy's Crabshack about 3 - 4 times, mostly for lunch and once for dinner.\n\nFor a seafood place they have lots of selection, they have something for the casual seafood fan (like me) and something for those who really love seafood (my date).\n\nI am kind of a appetizer addict - in that sometimes i;ll order a couple of appetizers and call it a night.  That being said, this place has some really tasty appetizers and recommend basically everything lol.\n\nThis place gives you good value for your money - you know your going to get high quality food at nice portions and of course the service is friendly.\n\nOnly thing that kind of bothers me, is that the lighting isn't that great, makes it feel glum - i dont know maybe its just me.\n\nSo for all you seafood lovers take a trip to Big Daddys.
