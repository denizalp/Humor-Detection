My husband, kids and I took his mother to Piedmont Social House for her birthday lunch, this past Sunday.  We had never been and wanted to check it out, as it's in a great location w\/ a small park beside it with different games to try.  The greeter was nice and let us know we could seat ourselves, inside or wait for a table outside.  We took a look around, inside, and were impressed w\/ how the bowling alley and bar was set up.  When we were seated outside, it took a while for our server to get to us and the area around us needed sweeping.  Once we got our order in, the food arrived quickly; however, some of the order was incorrect and the food was okay.  I was expecting a bit more flavor, especially in the BBQ dishes.  I think overall this establishment is a nice hang out, but not so much for a sit down meal.
