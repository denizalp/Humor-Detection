After reading several glowing reviews on Yelp, and viewing several tantalizing photos of a wide selection of classic Italian dishes, I had wanted to sample the offerings of this small restaurant along the Grand Canal Shoppes for awhile, but more than once had found it to be completely filled with diners.  At last, after attending a law conference nearby, after about a 15-minute wait Diane and I were ushered to a table for two looking onto a cavalcade of passersby.  Here we took our time sharing a late-night dinner.\n\nWe began with very garlicky large Garlic Rolls and a not too cheesy, not too saucy, and fairly thin Salsiccia Pizza, followed by a tasty bowl of Pasta e Fagioli Soup with big Cannelloni Beans.  Then, while Diane enjoyed Tortelloni Alfredo, I savored very good medallions of Veal Marsala along with first-rate Fettuccine Alfredo topped by fresh Parmigiana Cheese.\n\nIn a city filled with innumerable fine Italian restaurants, among them Trattoria Reggiano definitely holds its own.
