Meh.... I have wanted to try this spot for a long time. I'm glad I did but I won't necessarily come back. We were seated pretty quickly and the service was quick and friendly. \n\nCons: menu is very limited and the food, well the food was just okay. Nothing special. And it was kinda overpriced for what you get.
