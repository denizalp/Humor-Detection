Amazing experience! Robin was so kind and nice. This was my first time having anything waxed, so she took extra time to explain how things worked. I was so surprised by how little pain there was! She's very easy to talk to, and was even accommodating of my acne. After, she suggested to me some products to try and gave me free samples! I was so impressed with her kindness and her sheer expertise. I couldn't figure out how to get upstairs (her room is on the second floor) so I called and she walked out to meet me! Very very good experience.
