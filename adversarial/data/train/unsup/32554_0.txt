There are so many hakka places near my office. I've tried all of them. I'm not a huge fan of hakka but I try everything at least once. \n\nLike every other hakka place, they do a lunch special to attract the business lunch crowd. I've tried 2 dishes here and both were just ok. I think I had the chilli chicken and the sesame chicken. The food is just ok. It comes in a Styrofoam box with meat on top of a bed of rice...a lot of rice. You can easily finish all the meat and have lots of rice left. They don't make it very saucy and I guess that's to appease the more western customers who like to eat tidy meals.\n\nFor the price I paid, I would say I got what I paid for. Hakka food never blows me away. It's always been more of a fusion food than Chinese food to me. And I don't have any special reasons to come here instead of the other hakka places. But it's a place I wouldn't mind eating at if I'm in the area and don't crave something else.
