Any of you guys know of a good liquor sto.? I do. This is one of my old school drive through, even tho the drive up window is no more. When I was 19, I was a sommelier, in a way, working part time at a drive through, named Farmers Liquor. \n\nLets see, cigarettes were under a dollar easy. The winos, I mean Wine Connoisseurs loved tokay, ripple, brass monkey and the young gals loved strawberry hill. I guess I would have loved to have taught these people the wine 'lingo' and how to look like a pro when tasting Gallo Wines, like how to crack open the cap properly while in a brown paper bag. How to swirl the wine in the bottle to increase the surface area exposure to the air, to help it evolve. How to take a mouthful of wine and swirl it around your mouth.\n\nAnyway for these guys, it all started in the 1950s, well before my time when Red 'Pops\" Wilkinson opened a small corner liquor store where one could buy a six-pack of beer, renew a fishing license or pick up a Styrofoam cooler. A lover of all things outdoors, Red named his establishment Sportsman's Liquors.\n\nYou've come a long way Mr. Sportsman.
