The Wynn buffet is in my top 3 for Las Vegas buffets. \n\nCame for Thanksgiving dinner, got in line at 3:45 and sat down a little after 6. The longest I've ever waited in line for a buffet. \n\nFirstly, I wish they incorporated a virtual waitlist\/line like how Caesars' Bacchanal buffet is. We literally waited in a line for 2.5 hours. \n\nTypical fare you'd expect from one of the better Vegas buffets. One plus is that they have a couple vegan options available, not just vegetarian items sans dairy. Vegan tacos, spring rolls, and cookies to name a few. \n\nBeing Thanksgiving, service wasn't that great. \n\nIf I was in the north strip, I'd stop here again.
