Carmel's is simply the Shiznit!  \nThe chai tea is perfect (that is how I judge coffee joints being a non-coffee drinker) and the food is unassumingly well done.  \nMy favorite part is definitely the staff though...they always have girls at the front with so much personality and feistiness (sp?)...I love it. \n2nd favorite...the quaint neighborhood vibe of the little nest they have built.  Good for Carmel's!!!
