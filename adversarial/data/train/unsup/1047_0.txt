Dear Steve Wynn, \nIf you notice that you're short a few million this year.  Remember that you have the greediest bouncers at Tryst. Ever.\nI came in on a Thursday night.  I was pushed into the guy's line with at least an hour and a half wait at 11:00pm.  Granted, I am not a girl.  However, my friend and I were with 6 of them.  \nAfter trying to bribe the bouncer to let us in, he finally did it for $20.  Mind you, this is without the cover.  And when I slipped him a $20... he scoffed at it like I should have paid him $50 for the privilege of him being a dick to me.  I think that Vegas clubs are fun, but not with the amount of hassle and annoying cronyism that goes on.  \n- J
