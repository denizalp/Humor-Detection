I'm a salty food junk food person.   I am definitely not a cake person.   I eat good icing off a cake and leave the cake.   If the icing is yucky (ahem,  cool whip icing,  I'm looking at you)  I won't touch the entire cake.  But I break all rules when it comes to Red Velvet cake!   I eat the whole thing.  I have been on a 6 year mission to find the best RVC in Phoenix.  So,  no surprise,  I stop in this little Shop when I notice that they have red velvet cup cakes and cake pops.   This review is completely based on the RVc.   I've only gone once and won't go back.   Very cute cupcakes and cake pops.   The coffee smelled delicious.   However,  that RVC is on the lower end of the RVCs I've had in Phoenix.   The RVC was very moist.   The chocolate flavor was present and noticeable.   But the cream cheese icing was almost non existent.  I could not taste it at all.  There is a trifecta for RVC.   All three are important.  I am sure other cakes there are good.   \n\nReturn Factor: 5%
