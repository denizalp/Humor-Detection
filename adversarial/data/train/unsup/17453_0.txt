My first trip here was due to a horrible haircut at a different salon. I asked for an A-Line bob and instead got.... A duck's butt. Picture it. :(\nSo I called around and was excited to find an opening same evening with Kenzy. I now don't trust my hair to anyone else. Kenzy is a magical hair wizard and turned the duck's butt into exactly what I asked for (from the first salon).  Thank you, Kenzy for fixing the first horrid \"hair cut\" and continuing to make my hair look pretty and flattering. :)
