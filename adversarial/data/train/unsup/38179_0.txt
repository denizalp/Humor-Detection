These guys have earned my business the old fashion way. Honest, quality work, at fair rates. Sitting in their lobby right now waiting on my truck to be done. 107 today,had AC issues, they squeezed me in last minute. They could have said it was anything and I woulda happily paid....BUT, like I said they are top notch and it was a simple(and cheap) wire harness. I'll be outa here in a few minutes, with a few extra bucks left in my wallet. 6 stars if I could!
