Wow, I came here yesterday afternoon because I saw it on \"Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives\", a show I love (brilliantly simple and wholesome TV, highly celebrative and experiential of Americana, Guy Fieri is a card and a half ).  I strongly disagree with the negative reviews. \n\nThis isn't a \"dive bar.\" And even if it were, so what? I guess if reg'lar folk go there, it sucks and the yuppies have to hate it, right?  There's nothing wrong with places that serve the rank and file, a group to which I belong. It's what we need more of in Pittsburgh, but the gentrifiers want to chase people like me out, so whatever. \n\nShoot me. I liked the atmosphere. It was casual and cozy. \n\nI even overheard an Englishman chatting with the bartender.  How's that for cosmopolitan?\n\nEnough with the quarreling, I enjoyed myself here. Having found out about this place via the aforementioned show, I already knew what I wanted to order before a menu was handed to me. I was hungry, so I got The Lamb Sandwich and \"The Combo\" which includes, tabouli, grape leaves, pita bread triangles, and something called \"kibbee.\" More on kibbee later. \n\nThe Lamb Sandwich to me was like a cross between a fajita,a steak hoagie, and a gyro, and thus suited me fine. The lamb was tender, perfectly cooked, charred on the outside, and pink inside. The pita was toasty and was filled with provolone, green peppers, pickled peppers, and onions. Their doctored-up sour cream is served with everything, and contains garlic, something I can't get enough of. Vampires tend not to bother me. The fries were crispy and I think were beer-battered. Mmmmm.\n\nThose grape leaves were soooo tangy and sooo delectable. Their tabouli is the best I have ever had anywhere. Normally I can take it or leave it since most of the time when I have tabouli, it's sort of bland, but this was flavorful, fresh and had parsley, green onions, tomatoes, cracked wheat, cucumbers, lemon juice and olive oil it in it and made for a nice palate cleanser. The triangles of pita were warm. That tasty blob of souped-up sour cream went well with it all, including the kibbee. \n\nKibbee, kibbee, kibbee. Yippie for kibbee. \n\nIt may look like ehhhh...a, turd, but it's really a mini-meatloaf filled with cracked wheat, onions, cumin, green pepper, and pine nuts (!) that is...deep fried. \n\nNever before has something resembling an animal dropping tasted so good to me. That's all I will say about it. Try it. With the garlicky sour cream of course.\n\nMy date loved her Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad. \n\nI keep wanting to call this place \"Crystal's\" as opposed to \"Crystal on Penn\" because everyone was so warm and friendly. \"Crystal\" herself even greeted us and let us in. They didn't open 'til 5pm since it was a Saturday, but she let us in a little early since she could see that we were starvin' and was flattered that we were hanging around outside waiting for 'em to open. She was tickled when I mentioned how I found out about her restaurant. We felt like family as soon as we stepped in, and that alone is enough of a selling point for me. The exceptional food just puts it over the top. \n\nThanks for the gift certificate Dad. I still have $15 left on it!
