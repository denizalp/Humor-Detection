I've been waiting to try this place, waited so long since they're not open on Sundays and Mondays. Anyways decided to go pick up food after work and got a little lost at first, but that's ok. When I got there, staff was super nice and friendly, with great customer service. I had to wait like 15 minutes for my food, but it wasn't problem. Overall it was good Mexican fast food, but I wasn't impressed or amazed, it was ok. \nForgot to mention they give you free drink with Yelp check in or if you're a new customer :)
