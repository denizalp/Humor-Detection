My husband had seen a nice Montblanc wallet on his travels - so we popped into the Toronto\/Yorkville store to see if we could find the wallet.  Although we didn't find the one my husband was initially wanting - he did pick up a beautiful Montblanc wallet in black crocodile (or something like that) he uses it daily and it is an absolutely stunning and very functional wallet.\n\nI also go the Princess Grace Pen (in white) in fountain pen\n\nHusband in addition to his beautiful wallet picked up the new Montblanc pen that has both resin and Mother of Pearl Inlay - OMG it is stunning - unfortunately I can't remember the name of this pen - but it came in the most stunning box, and desk set.\n\nSure we splashed quite a bit of $$$'s in Montblanc - our salesperson was phenomenal, helpful, knowledgable - unfortunately I can't remember her name but she was a lovely Eastern European lady.  As we sipped on our complementary mineral water and espresso we browsed the beautiful pens.  I also got the most stunning Montblanc pen holder for my Princess Grace Fountain pen and some beautiful ink colours.\n\nMy pen came with a fine nib - initially I wasn't used to a fine nib and was going to exchange my nib for a medium nib - however, I am glad I kept it as I am learning to enjoy the manouverability of a fine nib.\n\nWhen signing documents for business, banking etc.  It never fails to capture a persons attention when I pull out my stunning Princess Grace Montblanc Fountain Pen ceremoniously from my Montblanc pen holder....it has a WOW factor.\n\nIf you are thinking you want a Montblanc pen but don't know if you should splurge - I say jump in the pool, and make that splurge - in the business world people do notice the Montblanc sophistication and brand\/quality calibre it holds globally.  \n\nWe do business around the world - and no matter which country I am in I get comments on my pen
