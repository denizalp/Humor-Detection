This is my 3rd Liberty Safe that I have bought.The 2nd one from this company.Wonderful safes great quality.The company brought it to my home,carefully unpacked it and bolted it to the floor.What a professional crew!They were on time and were very neat.These are the best safes that I have found.I bought a fat boy this time and a Lincoln last time.I can't recommend them strongly enough.The safe is top quality.I really got it more for theft protection than fire protection,but it is very well rated for fire protection as well.
