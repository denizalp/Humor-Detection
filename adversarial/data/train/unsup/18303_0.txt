Right away I did not care for The Gladly. I made reservations during restaurant week to ensure a spot for our first visit. When we arrived they seated us at the worst possible table right near the entrance breezeway amidst all the door traffic. I thought reservations got priority seating. Since the table was so easily overlooked ..It took forever for a server to arrive and take our drink order. \n\nThank goodness our server did rise to the occasion. We switched tables and he placed our food orders very quickly. I will say -  the scallops were to die for and the sweet corn grits were superb! High five on that one, Gladly :-) Now everything else just wasn't that great. \n\nHad the inventive cauliflower salad to start.  Not good at all. Bland as bland can be and reeked terribly of .. well.. something that it shouldn't. And my guest's bisque soup was more of a chunky mashed pur√©e. We both ordered peach cobbler for dessert and the grainy texture wasn't too bad. But the sweet cream didn't hit the spot and the dish overall needed perhaps some cinnamon or some ice cream with vanilla bean to draw out flavor. \n\nI have to add that it took an awkward gap of several minutes (millenia!)  between each course to bring in the next dish.\n\nThanks to my glass of wine and the server who really did the best he could, the meal wasn't a complete disaster. Still - it was not a good first impression from the seating, to the flow of the meal, to the meh-tasting food.
