Thai Chili is a great, reliable neighborhood spot for good Thai food. Their rewards card is exceptional-- a free lunch for every four lunches purchased! Any other place takes 10 purchases for a free meal.\n\nService is exceptional here too. The waitstaff is fast, nice and competent. The manager is ridiculously friendly. I'm kind of a b so I have hard time understanding how someone could be so pleasant all day long.\n\nI've been here enough to know what to focus on and what to avoid. Thankfully, the pad thai is great here, and I would get it every week if it was calorie-free. You can't go wrong with the curries either. I got the green curry tofu on my last visit, and it was so delicious. The lunch portion is very generous, and I was able to get two meals out of it. The spicy eggplant dish is another winner. I wouldn't get the drunken noodles again though. They weren't that flavorful, and they all stuck together.The sticky rice with mango had a similar problem; it all just globbed together. I've had better versions at other Thai places.\n\nAll in all, this is one of your best options in the area if you want delicious food from a locally owned business. Avoid those chain restaurants at Dana Park!
