Le Reve, which means  \"The Dream\" in French. I am still trying to figure out if the current show is a dream or a nightmare!\n\nI originally loved the show Le Reve, before Steve Wynn purchased the rights from Franco Dragone. Dragone is famous for producing  shows like \" O \" ( NUMBER 1 favorite on my list) , Mystere, Quidam, and La Nouba.\n\nI've watched Le Reve about 50-60 times during the time Dragone was in charge.\n\nCurrently, now the show's rights is owned by Wynn. He made plenty of changes to the show and I am not that big of a fan. I really didn't like the fact how put a lot of Salsa and Dance to the production, To me it did not make any sense at all.\n\nThere were a few changes that I liked. For instance, the Acrobatic Rotating Cube Act, I thought it was amazing how they made their entrance.\n\nThe beginning entrance was awesome as well. I loved how the entire canopy floated away right when it started. \n\nSome things were the same such as their number called \" The Tree\". The tree rotates on water while you had acrobats doing flips in the air with the tree.\n\nI wouldn't bring my kids to this show because I felt this was aimed for adults. With all the intimacy between a man and a woman and their Fountain Routine, it is too much for an 8 year old to be watching.\n\nI am still giving this a 4 star because, overall  I love the production, and the concept of the stage. I love how every seat  is a good seat. The stage is in the center. Every seat has a view of everything. There is not seat  more than  40ft away from the stage.  \n\nWhat amazes me most is the stage how it is very diverse and can transform into water, land,  huge fountains, swinging mechanism, it was just amazing. They even  had an act where there was fire on water!  Truly amazing  how a stage has so much character.\n\nI just hope Wynn makes some changes to this show and get rid of the Salsa and Dancing and keep all the features, of the first original show he had when Le Reve first opened.\n\nA lot of my friends did not like Le Reve. As for myself I am still a fan and I will watch this show again to see if Wynn made any changes to it.
