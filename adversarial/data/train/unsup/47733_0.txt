TLDR: It could be better. The building blocks for awesome flavor are definitely there, but it doesn't seem like they're getting put together properly, and right now the food is just kinda bland. \n\nI ordered the tofu rice bowl. The tofu is fried with a lovely skin on it and topped with a very nice sauce. However, beyond those, the tofu had very little flavor, and it was very moist. I would have liked to see it lightly marinated or some moisture pressed out of it. Plus there wasn't nearly enough of that awesome sauce.\n\nThe bowl was topped with steamed broccoli and carrots (neither seasoned), a very well made ramen egg (this is NOT a vegan dish unless you explicitly request it), and some very tasty pickles (I think it was a root vegetable of some sort, but I didn't ask). The rice was boring old white rice.\n\nThere were a bunch of amazing elements to this dish that I absolutely loved, but they were muted by the very bland tofu, rice, and steamed vegetables, which made for a fairly bland dish altogether. I do not recommend the tofu rice bowl, at least until it is improved.
