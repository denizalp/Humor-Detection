Excellent from start to finish. We came here based on other Yelp reviews and were not disappointed. We had a reservation and were seated immediately. \n\nService was excellent. Our server, Omar, was attentive, knew the menu well, and really took care of us. \n\nFood was delicious. The complimentary bread was great. Warm and crusty. Definitely tasted Old World.  We had the Spaghetti Carbonara and the Fettuccine Casanova. Both were very flavorful and served piping hot. Nothing I hate more than cold food. And the value is excellent. One of the most affordable dinners we've seen along the Strip.
