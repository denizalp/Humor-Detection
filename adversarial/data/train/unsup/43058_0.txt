This is a city inside of its own! The lobby is pretty, casino isn't too big (easy to cross over), several food options, nice suites, not great views, reasonable price for the grandeur, sometimes a little overwhelming, long corridors to get to room, most stuff closes early, keys kept getting deactivated, room service messed up but the staff was helpful in correcting the order quickly. \n\nWould I stay here again? I wouldn't nominate it, but would't veto either. It was way better than Westin but just not comparable to Mandarin (the only two other hotels I've stayed at before).
