I was instantly impressed when I walked through the doors and saw that the place wasn't as shady as it seems on the outside.  It is large and spacious.   And even still, we went on a Saturday afternoon, and saw it get very busy (but there was still more than enough space).  It seemed pretty clean, decent price.  However, the quality of the food is so underwhelming that the sheer quantity of the food did not improve my experience.   The chicken was greasier than normal, and the flavor just wasn't there - it was like something was missing from all of the dishes we tried (and we tried just about everything!)  The sushi was ok... wasn't a 5 star but it seemed decently put together, and more enjoyable for me than the regular food (altbough in all honesty, I can eat sushi just about anywhere and be fine).  They had a typical dessert bar with ice cream (that all the kids present insisted that theyd get to scoop! Lol).  So, all in all, nothing too fancy.  If the taste was better they would have received more stars from me.
