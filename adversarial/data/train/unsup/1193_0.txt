The best buffet I've ever had in Vegas and believe me, I've had a lot.\n\nThe thing about this place is that everyone else knows it's great too so be prepared to wait. We waited about an hour, yes, an hour for a buffet, but it's so worth it.\n\nThe inside is colors with cremes and light blues. Very calming.\n\nOnce seated I immediately ravaged my way through so many crab legs which were cut in half for me- no messy cracking.\n\nThey have dozens of different cuisines. If you don't like anything on the buffet then I'm not really sure what to tell you.\n\nThe service in true Vegas fashion was extraordinary. Out of all the buffets I've gone to this is definitely the most expensive but my gosh it's worth every penny.
