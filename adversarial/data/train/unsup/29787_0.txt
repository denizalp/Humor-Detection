Called to place order because I was in a hurry but they said they don't take orders over the phone so went in ordered, waited forever for my food while multiple people the owner knew walked in and ordered after me but then got there food before me, the owner allows his favoritism of certain customers effect the experience of other customers. The jerk chicken is all bone barely any chicken (like backbone the stuff most places disregard) and I've heard that same complaint from other people as well. The goat curry is the same way, honestly has good flavor but majorly lacking in execution, all bone, not sure where he gets his goat from but they seem malnourished, no meat, he should hit up the westside market I get great meaty goat from there. I used to frequent multiple different Jamaican restaurants when I lived in Florida and this place doesn't hold a candle to any of them. I will never be back......
