I'm back in Scottsdale and had some time for breakfast and thought I'd stop in. The wait staff was great my server was incredibly helpful and attentive. I ordered scrambled eggs, English Muffin, hash browns extra crispy with bacon - $9 and change. All o can say was it was fine... You're  US Eggs it should be more than fine! It should be awesome the best... I may give it one more shot- next time i'll go to the Denny across the street were I can get a fine breakfast.
