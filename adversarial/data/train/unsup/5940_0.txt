yelp removed my previous review saying that they thought I'd left it on the wrong businesses page, but no, this review is meant for Tapacubo, not some other business. So here it is again.\n\nI came to this bar for the two dollar beers and I saw a beer on tap that I had never tried before. I asked to have a taste of a beer I had never tried before and the bartender was extremely rude. He asked me if I was kidding for asking for a taste because the beers were only two dollars. Regardless of the price of the beer, I wanted to know whether I enjoyed it, which isn't too much to ask for. The bartender chose not to serve me after I asked for a taste and this kind of service deserves a poor review.
