I don't know what it was . . . but this place did not sit well with me . . . I mean . . . the beer was cold . . . the drinks were cheap . . . but I just could not getting the vibe here.  Maybe it was the fact that it was tucked away in a strip mall . . . or the fact that smoke smell was overwhelming . . . I'm just not sure.\n\nAnyways . . . the bartender was attentive . . . and seemed to keep everyone flowing in alcohol . . . but that was the only good thing . . . will I come back . . . possibly . . . but it would be later in the day or night . . . just to see if the vibe is different.
