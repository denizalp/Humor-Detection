The tacos here are very good.  I'm a foodie and can be very critical but overall the food here is good.  \n\nI had the chipotle cream shrimp tacos and the ingredients were very fresh.  The shrimp had tremendous flavor and wasn't overcooked!  Nothing worse than tough, over cooked shrimp...these were done right!  The portion sizes are good for someone with a hefty appetite.  (Like me)\n\nThe server I've had here a couple of times is socially awkward, she doesn't come across very friendly but I think that's just her personality.\n\nOverall a thumbs up for Fuego!
