Great price! - perfect scheme for you to leave your well earned moolah for gambling :) \n\nRooms are new, beds are super comfy, free WiFi - the other room amenities are standard hotel room templates. \n\nThe only negative thing was the weird half-glass covered showers. Doesn't do its job - water still splashes out + you'll get ball shrinkage.\n\nAnother observation - I was on the 9th floor and it was rather noisy. I don't mind the noise but for those who do, the hotel provides ear plugs in each room.
