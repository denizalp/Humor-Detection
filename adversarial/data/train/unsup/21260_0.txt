I didn't want to come here but ended up here because someone wanted buffet but didn't want to go to the Strip. The line is slow as molasses. We finally got in after waiting 40 minutes on a Monday night. \n\nThe food was terrible. No prime rib. Some well-done, dry, cheap cut of meat. Top round? The brisket looked awful. Mac-n-cheese, potato latkes, pretty much everything I had was bland.\n\nThis place is full of senior citizens. I think we were the youngest diners there. To top if off, one of the senior citizens who was sitting next to me was coughing and talking so loudly. Not that it's the restaurant's fault but it just made my dining experience more terrible. \n\nTheir desserts were weak too. The only things I was able to tolerate were some of the salad bar items. I should have gone to Sweet Tomatoes! I've been here for breakfast last year and it was decent for the price. I came here for lunch years ago and remember thinking it wasn't that great. If I ever want buffet, I will go to the Strip next time.
