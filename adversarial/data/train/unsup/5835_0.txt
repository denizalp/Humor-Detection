The staff is excellent here.  Have you ever watched Chuck?  Well the people here kinda seem like them, except with great customer service skills.\n\nBest Buy is pretty standard.  Product is in generally the same areas of each store, and the pricing is often very similar to Future Shop, imho.\n\nSo its really the people that can make the difference.  I returned an item here a few weeks ago and everyone was really personable, even that guy at the entrance who labels anything you are bringing in from outside (normally they are passive aggressive).\n\nThe service at the return counter was quick and not chatty.  Sometimes they tend to be chatty, which may be great in the check out area with its multiple tills, but when you only have one person manned at the returns section with many customers waiting, you want fast and quick not chatty and pretty (not saying th rep at the returns wasn't pretty ;) )
