Extra extra! Read all about it... because you'll have so much time waiting in line read a review! \n\nPros: \n-The long line to try this charcoal cone.... because it gives you 30 mins to reflect on your life instead of doing something productive elsewhere :D\n-your skin feels great with all the fresh air\n(In all seriousness) \n1. It was nice that they had flavours left to choose from (a big deal when you wait in line forever and there's no flavours left *ahem* #bangbangicecream (check out my fun review on them too! ) \n2. Tastes great\n3. Exciting unique selfie worthy cones\n4. Selfie room - which I DID NOT use sadly lol (yes I wanted to)\n\nCons: \n1. The long line, though exciting.... was better than the ice cream! They should make the line shorter so you don't realize how boring the ice cream is in comparison \n2. Much hype and not too many flavour choices\n3. No recycling in the area you wait (yes I know it has not that much to do with the ice cream experience) except I really needed to recycle the coffee cup I had, double espresso latte from the White Squirrel cafe around the corner to help me stay awake \n4. Green tea ice cream was not available on Canada Day\n5. The staff were overworked and not that helpful helping you choose during rush. \n\nSummary: \nOverall, it was a fun experience.\nI wish I could have one of the decorative umbrellas they keep in the front room ... \n\nToo much time to think about the taste, the act of buying ice cream should be impulsive and not so slow that the businesses reputation points melt away. I would go there again if the line was faster and I've finished trying the other Icecream  places recommended by BlogTO! :)
