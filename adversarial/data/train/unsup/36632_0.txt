We have eaten here about ten times (eat in\/take out) and the food is very consistent and great. The service has been fantastic every time. I love their Butter Chicken, it is absolutely delicious.  I would definitely recommend eating here. \n\nThe atmosphere and interior design could improve but it's a minor issue when the food is good
