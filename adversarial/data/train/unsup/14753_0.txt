These jokers just quoted me $4500 to replace a shut off valve. What a disgrace to the profession? Steer clear of these guys.. my poor wife thinks we need a second mortgage for some plumbing maintenance.  Don't worry they got her for the $500 contract on maintenance for A\/C and plumbing. Hope that helps pay for your bs commercial! It is so sad that there are organizations without any integrity!
