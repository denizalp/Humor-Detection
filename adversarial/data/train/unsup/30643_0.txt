A long time ago I remember Denny's in Hawaii being a place to go for breakfast and the food was great along with the service but now days honestly I'm not so sure.\nThe server though was great, she checked on us a lot and made sure we all were comfortable and our drinks were filled.\nThe real major problem was the time it took for the food to come out which was painfully long and then the food itself was not what I was expecting. A lot of salt in most of the food we ate. I think the mixture of us waiting for so long didn't help either.. I'm probably going to still stop at other Denny's just because of the good childhood memories.
