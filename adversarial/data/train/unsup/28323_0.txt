The food was delicious!!! The service was even better! We never had to ask for drink refills or refills on chips\/salsa. The staff is friendly and attentive. I had the shredded beef enchiladas with the hand made guacamole for our chips. The inside of the restaurant was super cute! We will definitely be back!
