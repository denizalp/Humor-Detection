So much deliciousness packed into just one restaurant .... Quality ingredients and superb preparation are the cornerstones here. The food is inventive enough to be unique, without adding cuckoo ingredients for flair or deconstructing everything. Service is friendly and helpful. The location is easily accessible, has nice parking, and is thankfully more spacious than the 16th St location.\n\nDo yourself a favor and try the queso fundido appetizer (I added in shrimp), the bean dip (I mean whaaat, since when are refried beans good?!), literally any quesa, the shrimp taco, lots of rice (I literally never eat the rice at most restaurants) and, last but not least, the horchata!
