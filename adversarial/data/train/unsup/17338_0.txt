I came to Sun Devil to get a diagnosis, since it was acting up after a collision. My friend recommended it, and these guys were beyond amazing. David Hyland, the store manager, had my car looked over and kept it over night since it was late when I took it in, and he wanted a few guys to test drive it. He sent me pics of my tires, two of which had wires showing..  He told me what I needed to fix now, and never once tried to up sell anything. They gave me rides to and from my house, and all were nothing but sweet! Never once talked down to since I know nada about cars, and David explained everything so I could understand. These guys, especially David went out of there way to check over my car, and for that reason, I will only ever come to Sun Devil! Thanks guys, and David I'm still bringing you Starbucks!:)
