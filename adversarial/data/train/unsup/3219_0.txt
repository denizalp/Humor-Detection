My wife and I had to be in the area, so decided we'd try this 40-year corned beef institution for BREAKFAST.\n\nOur advice?  Don't!\n\nUnless you miss the atmosphere of your high school lunchroom in-between lunch periods, don't.\n\nUnless you like tasteless, undercooked eggs and onions with onions that seem to have been sauteed a couple days before, don't. \n\nUnless you like your rye toast slathered in Becel, don't.\n\nUnliess you like your potato latke microwaved(!!!), soggy and devoid of potato, DON'T!\n\nWARNING TO NON-JEWS - If you must have a latke here, do not judge all latkes by this version.  I'll make one for you, or alternately, rush down to Free Times Cafe on a Sunday morning.\n\nSo, as the Yelp Rating says, Eek!  Methinks not!
