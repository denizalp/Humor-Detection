Today I ordered a pizza there, with no cheese because I'm lactose intolerant. They made it rather quickly, but there were a few concerning things about this particular establishment. \n\nThe staff began yelling in their native tongues at each other while I was waiting, which made me incredibly uncomfortable during the 10 minute wait for my pizza, which I had sadly paid for before receiving, so that escaping the unprofessional, noisy establishment without getting ripped off was impossible. Someone was also making horking noises while they were making my pizza, which freaked me out and made me wonder if they were spitting in the food? \n\nThere was only one table inside, and a bench, so it's not really a dine-in place. \n\nDespite my fears and all of the strange things they were saying, I decided to brave it and eat some of the pizza. The mushrooms weren't the freshest, and I definitely won't bother coming back to this dive-in pizza joint ever again. If you have to get some Dominoes, I recommend ordering ahead of time unless you, for whatever reason, actually enjoy listening to people screaming at each other.
