I have no idea what I ordered but it was meat broth and veggies. \n\nThe meat was supposed to be meatballs but was more of a sausage. The veggies were all good and te broth was awesome after adding it all together. \n\nThe staff was really cool, checking on me and refilling waters etc. \n\nI liked it but and still scared....\n\nPS great for a head cold!
