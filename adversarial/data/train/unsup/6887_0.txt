Great bar with outdoor patio, cheap micro brews, and an upstairs music venue that has some of the best sound I have ever heard for a room that size!  \n\nI have got the opportunity to play here 3 times now and every time was great!  The staff are super nice and professional and they give you half off drinks, and 1 dollar tall boys when you are playing!  The drinks are cheap anyway!  They have a great selection of Micro-brews that range from 3-5 bucks a bottle which is insane!  The same beers just up the road in Chicago are 8-9 bucks!  \n\nThe patio is huge and perfect for hanging out and chatting with your pals, although this night it was cold so the bar was pretty full of folks!  \n\nThe music either happens outside or upstairs and I must say, it's a perfect size intimate room for a great rock n roll show!  Keep up the good work Mike N Molly's!
