I used to like this hotel. It is quiet for the most part, easy to park, cheap rates, couch, good size closet but after this last time I will reconsider staying here again. \nIf you want to check in early, it is a $25 fee. You have to pay $50 refundable deposit. All on a credit card, no cash accepted. \n\nI was exhausted from traveling so didn't check the bed before sleeping. When I woke up and turned on the light in the morning, there were long and many black hairs on the sheets. I have blonde hair. I called front desk and they assured me housekeeping would be there in 30 minutes. I waited 6 hours to finally have housekeeping change the sheets. And they did nothing else except give me washcloths. No vacuuming or taking away the small trash.\n\nThe WiFi connection is terrible. I gave up using my kindle internet and just used my cell phone 4g. \n\nThe laundry room is not clearly marked. I had to ask a employee where it was located. The washer was filthy. The dryer had a lot of lint. \n\nThe bed was uncomfortable. No matter where I laid, could feel the spring poke me in the back. \n\nAs they say, ymmv but I don't think I will be returning to give the Mardi gras any more business. There are plenty of other nice hotels in Las Vegas.
