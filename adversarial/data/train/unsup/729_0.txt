The food was great. The service was non-existent. \n\nI had called and spoken to the hostess regrading their hours. I was not told that there was an \"in between menu\" beginning at 2:30. I was told that they served lunch beginnig at 11:30 and that dinner started at 5. Please note the website says they open at 10:30am, so this is confusing.\n\nI drove 300 miles from West Los Angeles and arrived around 3:45, an hour after they stopped serving lunch.The manager was kind enough to let us order a sandwiche off of the lunch menu, however. The \"in-between\" menu is severely limited, although I did order the burger off of that menu.\n\nWe were seated and ordered. This is when the rude, inconsiderate and bad service began. The man that delivered our food who I believe was a manager just put the plates down. He didn't say anything. He just brusquely placed them on the table. I ordered a burger and wanted condiments, but he scurried off before I could ask for mayo. \n\nI had to flag down our server which took about five minutes. Meanwhile, my food was getting cold. One of my biggest pet peeves in restaurants is when I order a burger and then am not served condiments in a timely fashion.\n\nOur server asked a busboy to bring mayo to the table. I swear that kid ran over to Whole Foods to buy a jar of Hellman's. It took several minutes to get the damn mayo!\n\nNot once during the meal did our server come over to the table to see how everything was. We were not offered drink refills. He waited until we had cleared our plates and then came over and asked, \"Is everything okay?\" \n\nWe chided him for not paying attention to the table. He tried to make up for the bad service by bringing two tiny brownies over. Too little too late.\n\nTo Honey Salt's credit the food was great. My companion had the Cubano Sandwich wich was exquisite. I had the burger which was excellent. We both had espresso which was very good.\n\nI am giving this place two stars because the service was non-existent. I don't mind paying $14 for a cheeseburger, but I want decent service to go with it.
