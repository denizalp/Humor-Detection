It was my first time a week ago, and I loved it. Service was super fast, after my friend and I ordered, we probably got our food 5-10 minutes later. Our waiter was very welcoming and friendly I mean she looked like she just loved life everyday, lol! Anyways, the food we ordered were so good, after I finished mine, I started eating my friend's food. Hahaha. We'll definitely come back!
