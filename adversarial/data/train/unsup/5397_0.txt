Just a quick update...\n\nWas just back at the Encore Beach Club last month.  Had a blast as always, but I discovered a secret hidden shaded cove!!!  OK, it's not really secret...or hidden...or a cove, but it is a spot I had never noticed before.  If you are a whitey like me and 5 minutes in the sun will turn you red, there is an awesome spot on the opposite end of the pool entrance by the back bar.   It has air, is completely covered, and contains a bar.  PERFECTION!!!\n\nAlso, had the pleasure of meeting the most awesome of hosts\/promoters in all of Vegas.  Richie P. is hilarious and fun and definitely made our day awesome!!!  \n\nCan't wait to come back to the Encore Beach Club and chill in the shade!!!
