This was some great Dim Sum! Everything was fresh, hot and delicious. Service was gracious as well as polite. We didn't have one bad dish.\nMy biggest complaint? Because we arrived so early, they seemed to only have desserts ready & those kept coming around quite readily in the beginning. They didn't seem to start bringing out the savory dishes til about 15-20 minutes after they opened.\nMy recommendations? If you arrive early, be patient & wait about 20 minutes til the dishes really start coming out. If not, then show up about 30 minutes after they open, just be prepared to wait.\nThe challenge? Their Servers are all Chinese, which is great, however with all of the noise, hearing them through the noise & their accents was a challenge.\nDefinitely a go to spot from now on!
