Sadly I couldn't find my way to the Kentucky Derby, so when the day of horse racing arrived, there was only one obvious alternative: Turf Paradise of course! I heard that Turf Paradise would be celebrating the Kentucky Derby with live horse racing, a hat contest and option for a buffet, etc, so we all put on our finest derby attire and headed up north for a day of mint juleps, gambling and horses! \n\nWell, this is no Kentucky Derby, but the spot is still pretty cool for Phoenix! It's legit horse racing and has everything from a winners circle and grand seating to betting and plenty of regulars. The crowd was classic. Imagine rowdy college'esque meets dive bar regulars. The drinks flow here and they have plenty of options for gambling. You can gamble with $2 or $10 bets, or $100+ bets. They have plenty of concession stands with typical sporting event food and they also had a BBQ section that had decent burgers etc. \n\nHere's a fair warning. This place lacks a solid flow of AC unless you're in the clubhouse section. So this means, summer heat and indoors at Turf Paradise don't bode too well, so come prepared with a fan and plenty of water. This was a fun spot to watch live horse racing, but it wasn't the best to watch the Derby since the tvs are small. The live horse races happened about every thirty minutes and were fun to watch! I always got to watch the winning horse head over to the winner's circle and watch the owners and family take a picture. \n\nSo if you're looking for a fun activity in Phoenix and you've always been curious about what horse racing is like, I highly suggest stopping by Turf Paradise!
