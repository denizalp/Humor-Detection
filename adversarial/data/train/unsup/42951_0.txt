I eat at Towne Taverne in Fort Mill twice a month and enjoy them greatly.  I decided to try the restaurant in Rock Hill today. \nFood: Fish sandwich was great. Could not order sweet potato fries as they had no sweet potatoes so got the Saratoga chips instead and they were not crisp but chewy.\nThe biggest issue was two female waitresses who chatted with the people at another table. Not professional and very annoying. \nOur server was great!
