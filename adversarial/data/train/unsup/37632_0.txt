The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 2 stars is because the ribs without the sauce are really really good and so was the corn.  He advised us that the brisket would be really good but I found it dry and unappealing.  I like my brisket moist and fatty not lean and dry.  Also they say they close at 9 but the waitress started sweeping and cleaning around us while we were eating and saying they were closing in 15 mins. If your going to close at 830 say you close at 830 don't advertise that you close at 9
