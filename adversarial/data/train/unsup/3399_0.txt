A mall is a mall is a mall. Well, not exactly.\nThere are malls and then there are MALLS.\nThis has to be classified in the group of malls that are MALLS in all caps!\nFirst and foremost is the divinely decadent opportunity to have your car parked for you. Only the rich and pampered usually have this opportunity.\nSecondly, the choice of shops\/stores is definitely upscale and offers a wide variety of choices.\nThirdly, the food court is tasteful and there are a number of alternative choices of places to eat.\nFourthly, they have a Starbucks.\nFifthly, (can you have a fifthly?) it is air-conditioned and this is Arizona.\nAt the present time, Spring 2015, the mall is undergoing a fairly major renovation and expansion. This should not impact your shopping experience, but it does add some mystery to the future of the mall.\nSixthly, they have a multiplex movie theater. \nSeventhly, Tesla motors.\nEighthly, there are a number of places to rest and relax during your visit.\nNinthly, they have free wi-fi.\nTenthly, underground parking.\nIf you are in Scottsdale and have a few hours to kill, this place is a pleasant place to spend your time (and your money, if you are so inclined).
