We recently became members here, they are running a $99\/month special for the first year for social membership. \n\nSocial membership gives you access to their pool, gym and country club and 50% off food and non alcoholic beverages at the grill. This is a great deal, look at the picture of my burger.. it's normally $13.50 but I paid $6.75!! That includes a side too. \nThey have daily specials in the evening on weekdays, like pizza night, pasta night, crab legs, prime rib and getting 50% off these specials is awesome,  not to mention, food tastes really good.\nHowever 18% service charge is applied to all food and beverages and that does not include tip. \nThey do have a full bar and every Friday is 1\/2 price wine between 4pm-8pm. \n\n\nThe gym is well equipped and has great views of the golf course and the mountains. Towels and water are available. Direct access to men's and women's locker room from the gym is a plus.\nThe Locker rooms has nice and clean showers, steam room, towels and basic toiletries like toothbrush, mouthwash, hair brush, deo, hairdryer, \nsunscreen and lotion are provided. \n\nPool is open during summer and is usually pretty quiet.
