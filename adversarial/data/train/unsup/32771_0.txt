Let's start with the real reason people go to Pubs, The Beer! While the selection of Domestic Beer on Tap is 'Decent' would still really like to see some more local beers on tap, but still, they have every type of draft to please almost anybody.\n\nSaturday nights are half priced Nacho's and their Nacho's are a good size, you'd think they MIGHT skim a few off the top and maybe go cheap on the cheese with a daring promo like half priced Nacho's, but they certainly do not, Last Saturday was my 3rd time at Woody's and I tried something different on the menu each time and was pleased with the pub fare. Pretty big menu for a pub!\n\nThe only downfall was the service, It was a little slow later on a Saturday night in which the bar was not very busy. A beer order was forgotten and we didn't see our server for about 40 minutes after we had received our food. Those Nacho's demanded some H2O!\n\nWill still definitely go back, if you're in the area on a hot summer day, the patio out back is decent, too.
