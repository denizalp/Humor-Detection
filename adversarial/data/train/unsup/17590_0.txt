I am addicted to their burrito grande and burrito ranchero. I usually order mine with shrimp. In fact I actually just ordered a shrimp burrito ranchero and it is on its way here. My mouth waters as I wait for it. Seriously amazing burritos. I have tried their veggie burrito primavera when I went last year with my ex and I can't say I liked it but the burrito grande and the burrito ranchero are out of this world.
