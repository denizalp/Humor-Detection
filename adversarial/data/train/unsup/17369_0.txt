I have not been to the new airport and I was pleasantly surprised.  Very clean with clear signs.  Definitely beats the old terminal I used to fly out of that was old, ugly, cramped, and had limited seating available at the gates.  \n\nThis place has ample seating with lots of food options while you wait for your flight.  A great upgrade from the old that's for sure!
