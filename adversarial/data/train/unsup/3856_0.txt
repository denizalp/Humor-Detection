I have been a vistek customer since 2003. They have the gear and consumables that keep my portrait\/product studio in business. \n\nThe store has large showrooms and a generous supply of floor models so you can go and see how it handles before you buy, rent, or lease.\n\nSome of the staff are on salary and some are on commission.  I have found the ones on commission are generally more helpful because they are interested in forming business relationships that last for years.  They guy I buy from will always find me the best price he can on my gear.  That's why I keep coming back.
