This place is great because it offers something different than your typical Chocolate Shoppe in Madison - real gelato. But not only that, it feels like a different place. Maybe it's the hype I give it in my mind, but there's just something appealing about knowing you're getting real gelato.\n\nThey are really good about mixing up the flavor options, and I would say they give Chocolate Shoppe a run for their money in that regard. I feel like there is something I haven't tried every time I go in here.\n\nThe downside? Price. You get what you're paying for, which is why I'm not here every day. But that can be a good thing as well...I only like buying quality, if I can help it.
