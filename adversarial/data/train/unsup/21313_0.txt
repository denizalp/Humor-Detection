Even though the wait time was too long for me,  the NV DMV office beats out that hot mess of CA DMV offices that's for sure. \n\nWhat's to like:\n\nThey have more employees on staff to handle busy flow of customers.\n\nThey are pretty efficient and organized.\nWhen you first come in the intake clerks will give you appropriate forms you need. You are given a number. Just chill and wait till your number is announced or you can watch the lighted boards to see if number is called.\n\nPlenty of room and seating. The have plenty of chairs here, and a small nook where there are vending machines to get snacks and drinks. \n\nEmployees are for the most part pretty pleasant. \n\nGood signage. I didnt have any problem searching were to go.\n\nWhat's not to like:\n\nThe volume of people that come here. Does not matter what day or what time of day you come.  I was here on a Tuesday late afternoon and it was freaking busy. \n\nThere's even a line at the \"quick\" Kiosk where you can renew your registration.\n\nThe wait. You sit and wait and wait...135 people ahead of me. It averaged out to 10 per minute being called. Which meant 1hr 45 minute wait for me. At least if one employee took a break there was another window open. \n\nThe parking lot was the worst ever! Finding a parking spot took about 10 minutes since there is only one way in, plus if you are getting ready to leave, backing out is also difficult since the cars coming in are blocking your way. Ugh.\n\nFor license renewals you have to come in because you have to take an eye test again.\nNo appointments are given for license renewals (none that I know of at least)\nYou have an option to take a new photo too. \nSince the use that photo recognition software you cannot have your eyewear on.  In the old days you had to. No biggie but I like my specs.\n\nSo two hours spent here isnt too bad. You're lucky if you are one of the few who get out of there in less than 30 minutes.
