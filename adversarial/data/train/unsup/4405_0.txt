If you don't mind a hole in the wall in the hood, then why haven't you been to this place?! It's literally a convince\/liquor\/market style store, with the room for 5 tables and a small wings or deli style set up. I'm usually the only white girl, however never treated to where I at all feel uncomfortable. The have a variety of items including (the obvious) burgers, wings, hotlinks, and catfish. The hotlink side is a Louisiana style link served on bread with mustard, ketchup, and onions. It's $2 and change and the best freakin link I've ever had. The burgers are cooked fresh and kinda remind me of five guys. I haven't had anything I don't like and wouldn't be surprised if they ultimately get a 5 star rating from me. If they had wiped down tables and a little bit cleaner of a dining area they would have!
