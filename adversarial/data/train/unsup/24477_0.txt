If i could give this place 0 stars, I would. I'm literally outside this place as I'm writing this review. I am sick, I am hungry and craving for sushi, so I google sushi place and this place popped up and it says they open until 2AM.\nMy bf called this place when he was on the way home FROM WORK and asked them if they still opened or not, the guy who was on the phone said YES, BUT WE CLOSE AT 1. My bf asked, if we get over there before 1, maybe 12.30 at the latest, would we still able to order sushi? He said YES SIR.\n\nWe drove 29 MILES and they closed on us right when we got here. My bf called, a girl answered the call and said WE ARE CLOSED. My bf said what the hell? I called not even AN HOUR AGO and the guy who answered the phone said they will close at 1. The girl said the chef and the cook were already gone. \n\nSERIOUSLY?\nLIKE SERIOUSLY???\nWHY DID YOU TELL US YOU GUYS ARE CLOSING AT 1, it's not even 1 right now and CHANGE YOUR HOURS on internet! Close at 2AM? Geez...\n\nI will NEVER come back here again. Like, ever.\nThanks for wasting our gas and time, Saketini.
