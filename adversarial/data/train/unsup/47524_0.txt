A True Treasure in the East Valley for Cigar Aficionados \n\nAre you tired of those \"smoke shops\" where the humidor seems like a second thought and is filled with overpriced stock that is past its prime?\n\nWell you're in luck!!   I was returning from my grocery expedition to the Mekong Plaza supermarket and taking Baseline instead of the 60 when I spotted this gem in a non-descriptive location.  A quick u-turn and I was inside ... and immersed in a total humidor!  \n\nOld friends greeted me and some new ones.  The woman behind the counter knew her products; what a wonderful surprise!\n\nIf you like a good CAO Toro maduro wrapped or one of my standby favorites, Rocky Patel ... whatever your taste, this is the place!!\n\nEnjoy, (and there's a smoking lounge onsite)... enjoy!
