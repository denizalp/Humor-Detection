I heard there was a bar in Monty that was ALSO a bowling alley so I had to check out this place! I love sports (is bowling a sport?) and anyone who has read my reviews knows that I heart beer, too. So, it wasn't tough to get me to agree to check out the bowling shenanigans at this place. However, upon arriving we quickly discovered that bowling was out and karaoke was...in? Yes yes, what filled the lanes were not bowling balls and pins, but people of all shapes and sizes belting out their favorite tunes. Hello! Amazing. Do I karaoke? No. Even my speaking voice is awful. But, do I enjoy hearing others bust out lyrics at the top of their lungs? Uh, does James Brown get down? Now, the beer wasn't as cheap as I heard it was, but I think it did the trick...I mean, people started sounding better and better as the night went on...AND, I started shaking my booty to the amazingly awful (oxymorons are not used enough) tunes. I'm guessing the next time I return to Notre Dame Des Quilles it will be on a bowling night so that I can show off the bowling skills that I don't have. But hey, at least I won't have to sing.
