This is not your typical Vegas hotel full of slot machines, tables, cigarette smoke, and booze! Which is great because you could have the best of both worlds.\n\nThe Trump hotel is located fairly close to the strip but not exactly walking distance to the heart of the strip but there are many cabs, Uber's, lyfts and even their own shuttle that runs until midnight completely complimentary that will get you there and back!\n\nThe hotel is absolutely stunning! As we pulled up we were kindly and warmly greeted by the bellman which isn't a thing I'm used to seeing so much anymore. He held the door and even offered to carry out bags! Now that's service!\n\nThe gorgeous lobby is decorated with such high class! Lots of marble, fresh cut flowers, gorgeous crystal chandeliers and curtains! The gal at check in was super sweet and took care of us right away.\n\nAfter checking in we headed to the elevators which is guarded by security, he checks for your key as you walk up! We entered the gorgeous wood grained elevators to our floor. Entering into our room we had a full kitchen, living room and 2 bathrooms with a master suite overlooking the fashion show mall and treasure island. The room was stunning and nothing was cheap! Except for the free water bottles which is always a plus. I loved that there was a fridge and coffee maker. Made our vacation that much sweeter where we had found a home away from home.\n\nThe shuttle service was excellent if you don't mind waiting around for it! They come every 15 minutes and take you to the Wynn and Cesar's Palace where they also take you back to Trump! Our shuttle drivers were all very nice and professional. They also were super informative! \n\nSuch a nice change to the Vegas lifestyle we are used to and it's great to see a family oriented hotel! We will definitely be back!
