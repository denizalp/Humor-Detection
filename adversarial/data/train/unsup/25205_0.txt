Wow, has this place gone downhill. From lower quality Beef, to smaller servings, to indifferent management and the list goes on. At one time this was one of my favorite places in North Las Vegas - Now I will spend my gaming dollars elsewhere. Steaks are Choice (at best) not prime. The other items are just not worth having at all. The manager was willing to make zero accommodations on any changes. Skip this entire Casino as it's in transition to a Low End Facility by Boyd Gaming. Be prepared to spend $ 100.00 per patron, a price totally out of line for what they delusionally think they are. The Atmosphere is also in need of a total overhaul - since the Dining Room is neither Classy or updated. Just an Oldie looking tired.
