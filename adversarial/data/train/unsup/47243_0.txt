had an appt. mon. from 8am to 10am which I made 6 days prior at 1015am  I called to find out where they were only to be disconnected after waiting 4 min on hold called back after 5 min was asked if I wanted them to call me when they are on the way or to call me with an eta I chose the later about 45 min later I get a call from the office telling me they cant make it if I would like to reschedule a total waste of my time I cant imagine them doing good workmanship\nafter the way I was treated
