Holy sh*t balls!! This place surprised me! Me and the hubby were looking for dinner before we went to the drive in and stumbled upon this place next to a QT. We went in and were fairly surprised by the prices. 90cents for a taco?? No way! There has to be a catch. But there wasn't! These carne asada tacos were bomb! They were nicely seasoned and the salsa that was served it was good with a nice kick to it! Totally not what we expected, the hubby ordered a burrito and even I wanted a bite! \n\nThey only reason I'm giving them 4 stars is because the staff wasn't that friendly, didn't greet us and didn't make much eye contact, weird but okay granted the service sucked, the food was good. If we're in the area and feeling like Mexican, we will be back here.
