Someone hit the nail on the head with this comment on their review.   A pretty big disconnect here between prices and service\/quality. I'd just go for margaritas & tacos around the corner instead.\n\nIt was good, the drink I had was also good don't get me wrong but for the type of place it is, I expected better service.
