We came to this Christian Brothers location this past week for an airbag fault light. Randy and his team, especially Dominic, were extremely courteous, friendly, and  accommodating. They were able to diagnose and find the the source of our issue, as well as fix the problem in a reasonable amount time. We also decided to go ahead and get an oil change. Prices seem reasonable, they are not the cheapest, but you get what pay for. This business is extremely family oriented, not only towards the customers but also the emloyees. We definitely will be returning!
