What a pleasant experience it was coming to this location. I previously haven't had good experiences at the 215\/Decatur Sally's and was told by a friend to try this one on North 5th out. When I walked in the first thing I noticed was how clean and organized the store is and was greeted by, Angie. I told her about what I was looking for and right away she led me to it and even gave suggestions which I appreciated. Product knowledge is important and Angie has it. They have a Sally's reward card where you initially spend $5 to join and then they give you a $5 credit to spend in the store and a percentage off each purchase after that. If you shop here regularly then the card will benefit you, but if you just pop in occasionally every now and then like me it might not. Some stuff is heavily marked up while other stuff is reasonably priced. I was happy to find just what I was looking for and thankful for the help I received. I'd stop in here again for sure.
