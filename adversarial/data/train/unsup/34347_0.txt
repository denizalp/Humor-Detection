I've been working in Charlotte for a few weeks now and have come here at least once each week and have NEVER been disappointed!! The Caesar salad with kale croutons, the pho (I like it better than the traditional), the fire & brimstone burger!!!, iced house made chai, and the desserts: oh my!!! I don't know what I'm going to do when I leave Charlotte and no longer have Luna's!\n\nI think they should  write a cookbook :)
