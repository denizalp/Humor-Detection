Super excited about having a Cafe Rio real close to home, so my family and I finally went on 2\/7\/16, 45 mins prior to closing time. They were out of grilled chicken and the restaurant was a bit messy. The staff was nice. There was a funny young Latino male who made my son laugh, so the staff is funny and friendly. We all ended up getting a steak burrito, enchilada style, with the lettuce and pico. Note to self, get the salad and pico on the side next time because it made our burritos soggy. Overall, the food was delicious! We shall return to Cafe Rio.
