TONY IS THE MAN!!! He was kind, patient, passionate, and most of all HE DELIVERED! This was my first time planning a bachelorette party he was open and honest about what I could expect, he had awesome suggestion and his communication was on point! I got sooo many kudos for a well planned weekend, and its all thanks to Tony! I would recommend Trenz to anyone looking to set up a fun filled Vegas weekend. He had us on tons of guest lists and the events we paid for were amazing especially the pool party crawl my girls LOVED that part of the  trip. If I have to plan anything else Vegas wise I'll be going straight to Tony!
