The Good Fork is my number one for a consistently good brunch place to bring visiting friends to. I usually have to wait, but never for too long and they will text you when your table is ready so it's nice to be able to pop into the stores nearby while waiting.\n\nPortions are good, service has always been great, and the food is amazing! Red velvet pancakes are insane, and if you don't want to go full sweet, you can get them as a side. I love their benedicts, buttt they recently took away my favorite pulled pork benny (hi Good Fork peeps please reinstate the Gordy stat). Anyways I will still come because everything else I've tried is delicious too but I will patiently wait for The Gordy.
