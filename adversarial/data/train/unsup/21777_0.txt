From the start, the service was great. Someone was there immediately when I walked in. I had my fiance and 14mo old sleeping in the truck so I brought the menu out to her and walked back in to make the order. I talked with the guy there for a minute and said I would be back in, in a few minutes to grab the food. He actually brought it out to me before I could get back in the restaurant.\n\nWhen we got home, we had noticed one of our sides was missing. I'm not a spaz like a lot of people and everyone makes mistakes. Its understandable. So I called and told the guy we didn't get one of our sides and that I lived right around the corner and would be back in a couple of minutes, to keep it warm for me. He immediately apologized and offered a free side to go with the one I was picking up (didn't ask for it). When I returned, the young man I spoke with and that took my order seen me pulling up and ran out to bring me my sides.\n\nThat's service and it was with a smile!\n\n5 minutes later I was able to eat the most delicious BBQ, in fact I am eating the leftovers from last night for lunch today. \n\nmmmMMMMmmmmmmm........\n\nI'll be back soon!!!
