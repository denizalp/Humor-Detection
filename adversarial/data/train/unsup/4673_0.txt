A signed picture of a smiling LaToya Jackson greets you as you enter. The staff is friendly, the restaurant is spacious, and more than 80 items are offered, dessert included. But the food is far from memorable. A lot of the items were bland - even my favorite, fried chicken - and those which were not were sub par even for a buffet. And don't bother with the sushi; I've come to the conclusion that if you don't have a sushi chef preparing the sushi behind a sushi counter, it's probably not worth it. The establishment will probably survive, though. It looks like it's been there forever and seems to have a loyal customer base from Sun City. The perpetual bumper-to-bumper traffic on that part of Grand Avenue on the drive back to Phoenix was a fitting conclusion for this buffet excursion.
