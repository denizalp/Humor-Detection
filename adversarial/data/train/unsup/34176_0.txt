Driest most expensive shawarma in Toronto.  I took my friend from Montreal there because I actually had a good one there once with interesting flavours.  This one was basically chicken and lettuce..no sauce.. No spice..dry.  very disappointing for an $11 shawarma \n\nThe only good thing was the chicken tasted good.  I heard the plates are way better
