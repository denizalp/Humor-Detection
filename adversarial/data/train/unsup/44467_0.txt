3 stars.  Let me start off by saying that my friend loved the food and I thought it was just Ok.  I want to be fair since I have only eaten here once hence my 3 star rating.\n\nWe started off with the Fried Green Tomato BLT and the BBQ Pork Belly.  Well, we both agreed that the pork belly in both dishes was tough and flavorless.  It wasn't even chewy or crispy.  It may have been baked yesterday and reheated.  It was like leather.  No bueno.\n\nNext we had the Shrimp N' Grits and the Fried Catfish (also came with Grits).  The shrimp was pretty good.  The catfish, oh boy.  They give you 3 huge pieces, but don't be deceived.  There was so much crunchy coating on the catfish it was ridiculous.  I wound up peeling it all off just to get the flavor of the fish.  That was a mistake.  Whatever they used as the seasoning\/marinade was so sour, but not unbearable.  Needless to say, I ate the fish and left the coating to the side.  Now for the grits.  The texture was perfect, but it had no flavor and needed salt.\n\nWe didn't even bother with dessert since I was so disappointed.\n\nLook, I would go back and try it again since the reviews are so good.  It could have been an off night for the chef (which happens).\n\nOur server was so friendly and attentive.  We weren't lacking for anything thing and I always appreciate that.  The atmosphere is great too.  We were very comfortable and weren't rushed out.\n\nOverall, it was a nice experience even though the food I chose could have been better.  But again, could just have been my choices were poor.\n\nThe couple next to us couldn't stop raving about the fried chicken.
