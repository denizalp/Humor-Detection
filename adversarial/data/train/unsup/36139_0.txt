I had high expectations based on the reviews I read on Yelp, but we were extremely frustrated and disappointed by  our experience.  The food was decent, but the service was so incredibly slow.  We inquired as to the status of our order several times and no one seemed to care.  The place was not that busy, but all we got were excuses and no offer to remedy anything.  Plates came out one or two at a time at an excruciatingly slow pace.  We sat and watched as parties that came in long after us were served promptly while we (as well as a gentleman across the way who was seated before us) sat ignored.  We finally told a waitress that we wanted to cancel the rest of our order.  She was unapologetic and did not remove the cancelled items from our bill.  Never again.
