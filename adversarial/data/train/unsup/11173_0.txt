I cannot say enough good things about the emergency room staff at Mercy Gilbert Hospital! Last Friday, March 8th, we had just arrived in Gilbert (from Henderson, NV) for our son's baseball tournament. I pointed the hospital out to my husband as we exited the freeway. Little did I know, I would be rushed there only a few minutes later! I was checking into our hotel down the street when I slipped and fell. I was in excruciating pain!! My ankle was dislocated and my leg was broken in two places! I was admitted quickly. Every single staff member I came in contact with went out of his\/her way to make sure I was given the best care, considering the circumstances. I have love in my heart for the staff, as this was the worst day of my life, and they went out of their way to make sure I was informed, reassured, cared for, comfortable, etc... One of the nurses even loaned me her personal phone charger when she heard me tell my son he couldn't use my phone because the battery was low!!! \n\nThank you to everybody who had a part in my care last week!! I had surgery on the 12th here in Henderson, and I'm on the long road to recovery. My surgeon here complimented your work in getting my ankle back into place nicely. He definitely noticed the wonderful job you all did!!
