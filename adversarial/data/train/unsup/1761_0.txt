Zero stars would be better. The therapist (Stephanie) did not listen to a single word I said, nor follow the 'chart' I filled out. She pitched 4 different products (1, i understand...not 4). Then she pitched a couples massage, then an extension of 30 min...it never stopped. Neither did she-never quit talking. The mgr, Alex, was helpful and offered a complimentary massage to 'try another therapist'. I don't want another one, i'm actually in MORE pain today than when i came in (and no, not the 'good' pain after a deep tissue). I called today to explain i was also now cancelling the freebie and wanted my $39 back. She (a different mgr) said 'well the therapist still needs to get paid, even if you weren't satisfied.'  That's not how the world works- do your job and you'll get paid-maybe even tipped! If I changed your oil, used the wrong oil AND then your car knocked...i don't think this person would 'understand i need to get paid'. Really.\nSkip this place and its ditzy front desk help who gossips in front of you.
