I just got back from Vegas for a business meeting and ended up staying at Excalibur this time. The hotel kinda sucked. It seemed like a Circus Circus to me. I guess this hotel is mainly for family's with kids. \r\n\r\nWe had dinner both nights here with the company. I would say that would have been probably the best thing about my experience here. (Once again food, my weakness =P). Anyways the first night we had dinner at Sir Galahad's. I had probably the thickness prime rib I've ever had. On the menu it said 12 oz Kings cut, but it seemed like it was 2 1\/2 pounds. I guess because we had such a big party and was buying so many drinks they decided to give all of us who ordered the Prime Rib a bigger slice. The second night we had dinner at the Regale. It was Italian food. I would also say this was a nice place. I probably took like 11 shots of Patron, so I cant really tell you much about how the food tasted. \r\n\r\nYou ask why I say 3 stars for a hotel I hated? Reason why is the restaurants are good. Even though this hotel is no Wynn or Belagio. =)
