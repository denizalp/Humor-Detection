I've been here a zillion times. The cheese crisp is really great, the chips and salsa are fantastic  (I love the hot sauce) and the Pollo con Queso Crema is tasty as usual. I've tried many items on this menu including tacos which are nice and crispy, the mexican flag is so good etc....here's why Im pissed....the prices have just skyrocketed! When I saw my bill today and there was 1.75 charge for sour cream, I about fainted. W....T....F? Seriously, its mexican food in a mexican food saturated city!! 1.75 for sour cream??? Nope, I just can't go back. Erika was our server and literally acted like we were bothering her by being there. When did this place get so pretentious? I mean....I can't even begin to tell you how disappointed I am.
