Holy shit.  Just tried to order, and right at the beginning I explained that our company would be picking up the bill.  So the cardholder wasn't present.\n\nI promptly got hung up on, but the person was very kind enough to keep the line open while she yelled at the manager, \"This fucking asshole just wasted my time.\"\n\nThank you kindly.  And fuck you, too.
