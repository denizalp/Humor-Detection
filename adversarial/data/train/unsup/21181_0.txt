I've been to Serendipity in NYC and thought it was pretty good--I even bought the packets to make my own hot chocolate at home!  But Serendipity 3's frozen hot chocolate could use some work.  It just tasted like chocolate milk from the carton that had been in the fridge.\n\nWhat I did enjoy was the carrot cake.  Yes, it's expensive but it's also enough to feed 6 people and it is actually moist and delicious without being too cloying.  The cream cheese frosting was also fantastic!  I wish I knew the recipe because it would go so well with red velvet cupcakes!\n\nSo while I'd give the carrot cake 4 or 5 stars and the frozen hot chocolate about 3, the service is a 1.  The waiter we had was so rude.  My boyfriend and I wanted to share the small 10 oz frozen hot chocolate and the waiter would not stop insisting that we order the larger one.  Even after I told him *repeatedly* that that was what we wanted, he would not let it go.  Seriously?  Funny how he didn't bother mentioning how ridiculously large the carrot cake was!  Seems like these waiters are just hungry for more tip.
