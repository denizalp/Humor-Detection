Bicycle Heaven - just like it sounds. Heaven indeed. \nCame by during July 4th weekend and had the most fun with amazing bicycles they have in this place. Bikes from 1950's to bikes for Beatles, this place have range of bikes you never imagine in your life. The owner have done such an amazing job maintaining all the historic pieces and we felt he deserve medal. It is not just a museum, it's art and history. A must see because you will find things you will enjoy here. \nMy favorite is the Bike Tree: which is the only place to see two bikes in a Tree found in rural Ohio. So werid but so cool. Note the museum is free, but place donate if you are able to support the owner and staff.
