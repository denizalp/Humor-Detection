Always a pleasant time when I go here! I've been going to this place since it was Haute Nails, the staff was always friendly and i got a good service, I honestly didn't think it could get any better! The new management upped it a notch and it definitely shows. At this location you are able to pick your color with samples placed by the door with both regular and gel polishes. Not only do they take great care of you but the techs take their time making sure you're satisfied. They do not show the prices but they're always happy to tell you, the price is not cheap but it shows in the quality service.
