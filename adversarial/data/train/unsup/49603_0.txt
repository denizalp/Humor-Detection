Been here a couple times, hostess with the long curly hair has also been so rude. The second you walk in she seems annoyed that you would dare to interrupt her quite time. I give this place 3 stars because the service itself has been great. But that first impression was almost enough to walk out, if I didn't already have my friends there waiting.
