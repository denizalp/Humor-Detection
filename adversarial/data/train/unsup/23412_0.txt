I liked the fab ambience that had mostly been achieved (but for the flat-screens playing sports :P), but this place disappointed in most other respects.  The $10 bottomless bubbles were some cheap variety, and the OJ used in mimosas was Sunny D or something in that league. \n\nThen there was the food. The pumpkin french toast sounded promising, but the bread tasted stale and hadn't really absorbed much flavor, and had been topped off with canned fruit. My sister's omelette was bland and appeared to have been microwaved.\n\nUnforch, the service didn't much compensate for the bad food or drinks either.  Nobody even came around to offer the supposed bottomless bubbles until we were done consuming whatever we could stomach.\n\nThe crowd primarily consisted of overgrown frat boys and blonde women with too much plastic surgery.  \n\nThe live music was a good touch.
