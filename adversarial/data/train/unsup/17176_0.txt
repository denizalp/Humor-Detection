This review will be brief because my visit was brief.\n\nI walked into Golden Donuts and no one was present.  After a couple minutes, a man appeared from the back.  He did not smile.  He did not ask me how he could help me.  Eventually I asked if the fritter I was seeking was apple or blueberry.  He told me it was apple.\n\nHe bagged it for me.  Then I asked if they had soft drinks.  He just pointed toward a case that was behind me.\n\nI got what I wanted and brought it to the register.  \nI paid, said thank you and left.  \n\nThe service was just... well... adequate.  This is in stark comparison to the service I have received at Bosa, Boba and Donuts and just about every other donut shop.  \n\nThe fritter, however, was PHENOMENAL.  I only intended to eat a little bite of it before my appointment.  Once I took a bite, I had to finish it.  It had a lot of cinnamon, crisp, yummy apple and it was not overly greasy.  It was sooooo good  that I wanted to go back in and buy a dozen more.  Of course, the guy was back in the back room so I decided to wait for another day!\n\nIn the words of the Terminator \"I'll be back!\"
