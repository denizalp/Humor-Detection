This was our first dining experience at VG. We were celebrating my husband's birthday and thought we would try it. I must say that although the food was very good and tastefully prepared and presented, there were some disappointing aspects to our visit. Without going into a lot of detail, when we eat at an upscale place like VG, we are fully prepared to pay their prices. No problem there. However, when we pay those prices, we don't expect to be seated next to screaming children. If we wanted to eat with screaming children, we would have gone to a fast food restaurant. People with small children need to hire a babysitter, especially on a Saturday night. If they can afford to eat at VG, they can afford to hire a babysitter. VG also needs to be aware of this issue and tactfully tell customers with small children that they cannot accommodate them. I'm sorry, this may sound heartless, but that's the way we feel.\n\nIn other areas, the food was good, no doubt about that. The ambience was a bit noisy (aside from the screaming children), no doubt due to the fact that the floors are not carpeted. I'm sure carpeting would absorb a lot of the noise. We've gone to many other restaurants at this price point and never experienced the noise level we did last night. Of course, in all fairness, it was a Saturday night. In addition, the tables are very close together causing both the staff and other patrons to unavoidably jostle my husband.\n\nOn the plus side (yes, there was a plus side), the food was very tasty and well presented. The service was adequate although we've had better service at other restaurants.\n\nAll in all, we'll have to think long and hard about returning to VG despite its \"awesome\" reputation in Summerlin.
