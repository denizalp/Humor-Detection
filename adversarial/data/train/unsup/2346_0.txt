Nothing was torn or stained, but a lot of the clothes looked worn and a little faded.  And yeah, I get that Plato's Closet sells clothes that HAVE been worn, but they're not supposed to LOOK it.  I'm kind of surprised by the previous reviewer who stated that the clothes are geared toward the 25-34 age bracket.  Um, were we in the same Plato's Closet??  Most of the stuff looked pretty cheap and teenybopperish to me.  I can see going here if you're looking for something disposable for going out on campus, but definitely not to build a professional wardrobe.
