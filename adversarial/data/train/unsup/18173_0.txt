When I think of Vegas, the first images that pop into my mind are those of blinking lights and awesome signs, and even though I have been to Vegas dozens of times and the idea of this place never even crossed my radar. When a friend suggested it, we thought it would be a cool 20 minute stop to wander the desert and take some photos in a sign graveyard. That is not what this place is! \nWe were surprised to find that admission was $18 per person and that we had to wait for a tour. The tour was an hour long and the guide literally did not stop talking. You are not allowed to be out of the guide's eyeshot. The dessert sun can be a killer as there is no shade but even though this place was the total opposite of what we expected, I really learned a lot. The tour was very informative and you still get an opportunity to take photos. \nEveryone else in my group gave this place a solid 3 stars, but to me it's a 4. They were disappointed by the strict guidelines of the tour, but I can't subtract for that because I completely understand not wanting pieces of history to get damaged. I do have to agree with them all and take away one star for the price though :( $18 is pretty steep.\nI would recommend this for older travelers, people who don't mind standing for an hour in the sun and people who enjoy history and stories.
