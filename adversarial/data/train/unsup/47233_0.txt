Decided to surprise the boyfriend and have a little date here on their second day open. It was pouring outside, and we were welcomed in to the warm little home. For their 2nd day open & a Tuesday, they looked like they were doing well. Not overwhelmingly busy, but a lot of the tables were full. The interior reminds me a bit of the ol' Lisa G's, but with more use of the space and, of course, 8 delicious beers on tap for 5 bucks a pop, including (but not limited to) Ska True Blonde & 4 Peaks Hop Knot & 8th Street Ale. They also offer some bottles as well as wines. But it's an ale house, so of course I'm coming here for some ales! I heard they have happy hour from 11am-6pm. \n\nThey have a small menu consisting of apps, sandwiches, salads, and desserts, with nothing over $10. We started with the artichoke dip (DELICIOUS!) and I tried my hand at the grilled cheese. It was good & filling. I definitely will try something different next time for a bit more variety. \n\nThy sure got their stuff together for being open only a couple of days. I will be back. It's a nice little place to have a drink & a snack with some friends.
