One of my fav spots in Vegas! Definitely a spot to visit while in Vegas. Get your alcohol, essentials and snacks here! Yall thank me later, especially if you've already made your way to the hotel convenience store.\n\nMy daily runs here consisted of $1 water and $3 Heineken or Coronas. To top it off you also buy bottles of rum, cognac, vodka, wine, scotch and whiskey.\n\nThat about sums it up for me. My fellow yelpers dropped knowledge on everything else you might want to know! Enjoy CVS in Vegas, the long lines move quick so have no worries.
