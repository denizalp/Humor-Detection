I bought a Groupon for 2 hours of cleaning with Verde Clean.  I just had Angelica over on Friday and I was very pleased with both her work and her communication.  I set up the appoint on Verde Clean's website where they had a special log in for people with the Groupon or Living Social deals to schedule appointment.  It was straight forward and the only thing I thought was a little iffy was having to input a credit card, but I understand why they asked.\n\nI got an email confirmation the day before and Angelica called an hour before the appointment to confirm.  She arrived on time and with what she needed to clean.  I gave her the list of what I would like based on if she had time and she went right to it.  She was really good about estimating her time and ended up doing just about everything I requested.  \n\nBased on this experience I would certainly contact Verde Clean again for house cleaning and would recommend them.
