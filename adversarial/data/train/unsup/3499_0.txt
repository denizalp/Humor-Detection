All the Stussy goods you could ask for, with customer service comparable to the workers at Supreme NY. Don't expect to receive a head nod or \"what's up\" when you walk in the door. Gave my cousin a hard time, unfold a shirt and they'll be following you around the store until you walk out. They're too busy admiring their fixed gear bikes and looking like their busy on their Macs.
