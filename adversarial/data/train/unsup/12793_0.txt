Back in the day, this place was the shizzle, and ushered in a whole new standard by the visionary Steve Wynn, no pun, nor offense intended. 3000+ rooms of spacious luxury with an equally massive casino. Stayed in one of the two bedroom tower suites, which was pretty clean, very spacious, and comfortable. Our room consisted of one massive suite + Another smaller suite connected which made for one larger apartment that allowed 5 men to sleep and socialize in utter comfort. Also the times have gone when all the drinks are comped for every gambling endeavor you may choose- Now you have to flirt with the bookie just to get one drink coupon, which is good for that day only. A tad cheesier than I remember- Starting to get that same disease that downtown had. I'd do it again.
