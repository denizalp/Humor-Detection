Scott is great!!  He and his trimmer did an AMAZING job on trimming 2 very BIG and very FULL Ash trees (over 30 years old and never been trimmed). I have posted before and after pictures.    \nScott explained what needed to be done very clearly.  He genuinely cares about the health of trees.  Scott is excellent with his communication, work, clean up and follow up.  I highly recommend him and will be using him again.
