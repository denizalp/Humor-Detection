Three times is not a charm, between dinner and lunches... it's ok and I'll keep chugging over here if someone is asking to go... but nothing memorable... I've been across the menu from duck to seafood to noodle dishes and curry.  \n\nIf you like hot and spicy, they will go the mile and this place will be for you!
