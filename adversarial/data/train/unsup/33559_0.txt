Four stars based on a very limited experience: I grabbed a cup of pour over coffee before going into the office. I plan to go back tomorrow morning and try some toast and one of the handmade s'mores pop tarts (!!!) but for now...\n\nI'm actually not all that crazy about the coffee I got. Has a kind of sour taste to it. It's a blueberry\/citrus deal, so that makes sense. I'm just not particularly fond of it. And weighing in at $4 for a 12 oz it'll certainly be a treat, versus daily occurrence, for me to go here. That's for the pour over; I believe regular old coffee is close to $3 (still a bit much, in my opinion). \n\nThe reasons I give 4 stars is:\n\n* cute vibe; it felt cozy but modern \n* very friendly people; the guy who took my order was really nice and everyone working there said hello or smiled at me at some point during my visit\n* good quality; even though I didn't like my coffee it seems to be quality stuff, so I am giving benefit that that's the norm for their beverages \n\nThe reason I didn't give that 5th star is price. I don't know the inner workings of the business-side of coffee shops but I can't help but think the prices are a bit over the top. \n\nStill, like I said, going here will be a treat and in that sense I am pretty pleased so far.
