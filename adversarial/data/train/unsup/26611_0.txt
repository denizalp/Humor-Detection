Went here a couple of weeks ago for dinner on a whim for takeout to try and satisfy my popcorn chicken craving. I should've called in to place my order though :\\ \n\nGot to the restaurant around 845pm, and there were 3-4 tables seated and a couple of them were waiting for food, which should've been a sign that I'd have to wait a bit for my order. Got myself the Koo Koo bites combo with rice, veggies and two small pieces of tofu, as well as a winter melon milk tea altogether for roughly $13 - about what I expected. Waited about 20min for everything to be finished which is a little longer than I would've liked though. \n\nFood was decent, not amazing but also not terrible - a nice option to have if you're craving Taiwanese fried chicken in the area. The bubble tea was decent as well, but again not really memorable.
