First off, I've seen a few people complaining about service...and I have to imagine these are people that complain about the service everywhere and are probably just a pain in the ass to deal with. I've eaten here quite a few times over the years and have had nothing but impeccable service from the man and woman who are always there, I believe they are the owners.  I've usually been thanked before my meal is through multiple times, they really appreciate the customers they have.\n\nThey do like to highlight their lamb dishes, and say that they are on special but they are pretty much always being served and they are all crazy good.\n\nIf you want to have a great meal, here is what I recommend.\n\nThe hummus with pine nuts.  Follow that up with the mousakka or lamb shank.  Get the tomato soup that everyone raves about...my buddy and I both have agreed multiple times that it's hands-down the best tomato soup we've had.\n\nIf you are still hungry after all of that....their baklava and coffee are great to end on.\n\nI find it hilarious that people will dis on this place and say they should have went to Pita Jungle instead -- have fun with that!
