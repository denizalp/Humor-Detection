Love this place! To be honest, usually pizza is not among the top options when I eat out with friends, but I'm glad we went to this place. Customized pizza, OMG, never thought about we could do this at CU, particularly after so many times of those regular pizzas. Also, I in general prefer thin crust, so this place is perfect for me. The only small problem I have with this place is because they have the oven out, so I think there was a bit of smoke, esp during the rush hour, which made my eyes somehow uncomfortable after seating inside for a while. So I may think about taking out next time.
