What is happening? Why are these characters fighting each other? And now they're in love? Ahhhh... nap time! zzzz...\n\nThe actors and Cirque Du Soleil clearly spent a lot of time and money putting together this show. The stage is amazing! The acrobats are amazing! The music is great! \n\nBUT WHAT IS GOING ON! \n\nThe story lost me faster than my organic chemistry professor. Staying awake was a stuggle, and I had slept in.\n\nIt reminds me very much of the more recent transformers movies. A story built around all the special effects and explosions they wanted to show off. In other words, not really a story. Just a bunch of stuff. \n\nAnd stuff is not very interesting.
