My first Shabu! It was fabu! (groan....)\n\nSeriously though.  I really enjoyed the experience, and the spicy miso shabu shabu was delish! I confirmed with our server that it (and the seaweed broth) were vegan, and I was good to go.  I got the vegetarian delight, and I was pretty delighted.  The soy-ponzu dipping sauce was tasty and a nice compliment. (The sesame sauce is mayo-based, so I skipped that).  The meal was light, but filling, and very fresh-tasting.... and quite a deal at only $8.95.  My only complaint is that my plate was about 1\/2 nappa cabbage, with only about 1 oz of tofu, and a few slivers of other veggies.  I love me some nappa, but I'd prefer a little more broccoli and udon noodles (OMG, the udon noodles are SO GOOD).  Maybe next time, I'll just order and extra portion of tofu and noodles??  \n\nThe point is, there will definitely be a next time.  I can't believe I haven't tried this before!\n\nI found my friend's seaweed broth to be a little bland, but they have nice containers of chopped garlic, onion, green onion, and chili sauce that you could use to flavor it up, if you're a DIY sort of broth maker.\n\nThe service was great, the ambiance was nice, I even enjoyed a little sake, which I don't usually care for.  They served our large group (10 ppl) as well as a full restaurant with grace and aplomb.  \n\nPart of our group ordered sushi and apparently, the \"spicy\" ones should say \"THESE ARE ****ING CRAZY MAD SPICY.\"  So, if you're into heat, they can bring it.\n\nSo, who wants to go get some Shabu with me? UYE?
