It's a darn shame - this place. Great atmosphere, the food was excellent - but the service was an all time nightmare.\n\nWe went later in the evening on a weekend night. They barely acknowledged us when we sat down, then they proceed to forget our salad. Followed by forgetting our pizza. Followed by forgetting our pasta. Followed by forgetting out check. Followed by forgetting to pick up our check.\n\nI couldn't believe it. Our waiter must have walked by us a dozen times throughout the night and never quite got it. \n\nFood was so good - too bad we'll never go back to enjoy it again. \n\nGet it together Forno 301, your food is too good to give service this bad.
