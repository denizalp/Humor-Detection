OK, if I call 25 minutes beforehand and request a cab at 11:40, the cab should not arrive at 12 PM. I called the company again at 11:55, freaked out, only to be told that the cab \"should arrive in 5 minutes\" by some guy who seemed exasperated by my expectation that the cab should arrive within, say, 10 minutes of the agreed upon time. No explanation, apology, nothing. \n\nI missed my flight--thanks guys.
