The food was amazing! We finally got a good Mexican restaurant down here in the Southwest! Jose our server gave us outstanding service. We ordered the steak and chicken fajitas. The steak melted in your mouth and had the most amazing flavor. Definitely recommend the fajitas. Table side guacamole was great! Overall very happy with this restaurant
