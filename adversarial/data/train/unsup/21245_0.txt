Truly disappointed.  We went twice, the first time was so good we brought friends to try it and support this local business.  Unfortunately, the service was so bad the second time that even the good sushi could not make us feel better.  The worst part was they added 18% gratuity to our bills! (We asked for one bill, but were given 7.)  We were literally forced to tip very high for subpar service.  I think this is an outrageous practice. My husband and his associates were late returning to work since it took over 15 minutes for their food order to be taken, the waiter kept vanishing and had to be hunted down whenever we needed something.  No plates were bussed, no sodas we refilled, and our order was incorrect.  The manager did not make us pay for the food we didn't order, but even though we complained about the service, added the tip to all of our bills....the sushi is really good, but based on this visit, I won't be back, or recommend to anyone that they dine in.  Take out, sure!\n\nI almost didn't post this review, but I felt so sucker punched by the addition of the tip, that I thought others should be warned.  They took off the 20% coupon and added an 18% tip for 10% service!
