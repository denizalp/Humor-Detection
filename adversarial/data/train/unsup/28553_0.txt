I love multiculturalism, and nothing spells multicultural like fusion cuisine. Rolltation is an amazing example of why it's great to be in a city like Toronto. It's home to the sushi burrito and a variety of 'Poke' Bowls. \n\nThe fillings are the real stars here, as they're fresh, plentiful and of of a seemingly endless variety. There's both traditional options (wasabi, avocado), and a little bit more ... let's say inventive (mango, cheetos, etc.).\n\nThe portions are a good size, with the poke bowls having a surprisingly good amount of sushi in them. All the variety will keep me coming back.\n\nActually, it's so good, that I can see myself incorporating this into a regular lunch spot. At least until I try all 12 of their sauce options!
