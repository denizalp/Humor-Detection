Oh and I love how Cathy from AW responds to try to add a rebuttal to my post by acting like I was ever happy.  To the contrary, I have said clearly from day 1 that I was unhappy and that they had been dishonest on all things done and said.  The problem is, they have you tied in due to the deposit, and you keep thinking, this can't get worse...let me just get past this bad situation....but it does get worse over and over, and then at that point you realize you now how deposits on flooring, low voltage, all your premium upgrades with the builder, and your earnest deposit, and your, like me...$100k+ in deposits, so you can't back out.  \n\nTo elaborate further to anyone considering buying...do you know they have \nLot premiums for anything you can think of?   If the house is on the edge of the community, it is a lot premium, if it has a square lot, it is a lot premium, corner lot;premium, if it is the middle of the community, they spin this to be good, and there is a premium, I even heard that there was a lot premium because it has a view of the strip, to find that since you can possibly see the radiating lights of a distance casino way down on our end of Las Vegas Blvd, it is considered a \"strip\" view premium.  And what we were told our premium would be($8000) for the lot we chose, and then to see the actual number get snuck into the agreement later....was a MULTITUDE of what we were initially told.\n    \n   The other thing to know is, I have talked to all my neighbors who have had equally bad experiences and they don't use Yelp and have not posted their reviews here, but I am sure if they did, it would be a 1 as well.
