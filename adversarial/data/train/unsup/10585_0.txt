The pour over coffee I ordered was not very good. I think the beans are of lower quality than I am used to and the water may have been too hot when poured. I've been brewing pour over at home for years and that's a mistake I made early in the game. It happens. The iced coffee my wife ordered was not great either. Bitter after taste isn't exactly our cup of tea. \n\nMy previous review, which I deleted for some odd reason, was pegged by the manager as narcissistic and I was labeled as a mean person hiding behind the internet. To that I will say that I understand the manager of a business wants to support her staff and that's fantastic. More power to you. I see that this business has 4.5 stars so it shouldn't be too difficult to accept that not everyone loves your product. I didnt have a good experience and I am certain that I am allowed to express my opinion because after all, Yelp is an application that is all about sharing. Don't get too upset about that and please read some of my reviews. When I like a business, I gush and give great reviews. When I don't like a business I tell the truth about it and that's something I can't apologize for.
