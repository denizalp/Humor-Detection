2.5 stars\n\n The staff was nice, and the pizza was hot when we got it but it wasn't amazingly good. I've definitely had better pizza and at around $4-5 per slice, I would prefer to go to Secret Pizza. D'Amore's thin slice pizza was ehhh, I split a pepperoni, ham and sausage slice and a supreme slice with my friend and even though we were still hungry, we did not want to get anything else from D'amore's. \n\nD'Amore's pizza didn't blow my mind away, so I will probably not be coming back.
