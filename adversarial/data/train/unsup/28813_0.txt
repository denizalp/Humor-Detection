Every time i get blood drawn or an IV, no one can seem to find a good vein which leads me to almost passing out and poking me multiple times. I had Briana, let me tell you, she was INCREDIBLE !! super quick, painless, all the above. She found a vein immediately. Out of all the times I've ever done blood work, this was hands down the best experience I've had. Thank you so much Briana ! \nAlso, I went here with no appointment on a Saturday, it was real busy but i didn't have to wait a long time. So they're really quick. Glad i chose to come to this location! Highly recommend this place!
