When I first got here, I was like, this is underwhelming. Valet was really simple. Check-in was very quick seeing as how I got in after 10pm. Took the elevator up to my room and wow, the room was HUGE, albeit plain! Felt like I was in a homey apartment. \n\nI didn't get to enjoy the amenities of the place, but I thoroughly enjoyed the spacious rooms. Not only did I enjoy the low-key-ness of the hotel, but I actually appreciated not having to walk through a casino to get to the elevators or weaving in and out of huge crowds. HUGE plus. \n\nAlthough this place was a block away from the strip, we did drive our car everywhere, and valeted our car at each hotel to avoid having to do MORE walking. Tipping the valet $1 each time is worth the savings of a taxi ride.
