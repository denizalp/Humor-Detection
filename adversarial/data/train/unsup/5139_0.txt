This is really a 3.5 rating...I wish Yelp gave us that option.\n\nCafé 6 is located at the Palms PLACE. Not Palms Hotel and Casino...but you can still access the restaurant via their Sky Tube. (just a bridge to cross over to the Palms Place.) We got a table that overlooked their pool deck. Very peaceful and serene. \n\nAPPETIZER:\nBeer Battered Rock Shrimp-strips of carrots and celery mixed in a Tabasco Ranch dressing. OH MY. This was freakin delicious!!!!! Portions was perfect for an appetizer...for small eaters like myself, this is enough to get your half-full....even if this was shared. I would totally order this as an entrée. It's THAT good.\n\nBURGERS:\nShort Rib \"Sloppy Joe\"- $15.95. Angus Beef, 100% Short Rib Pepper Joe Mix, Skinny Fries, Onion Ring, Hoagie Bun. Fried food galore. You got your skinny fries inside the burger, your big onion rings and then more fries on the side. I opted for the waffle fries. I put my remaining sloppy joe mix on top of these and mmmm.....yum!!!!!! \n\nThey need to come up with something like waffle fries with the sloppy joe mix, pour some melted cheese on it and boom! Sloppy joe cheese waffle fries. OHHH YESS!!!\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the mini burgers (3 mini sliders) of the Bacon Bleu $13.95 which consist of Angus Beef, applewood smoked bacon, bleu cheese, lettuce, tomato, red onion, housemade ketchup, Brioche Bun. He really enjoyed his. He liked Café 6 more than I did actually....and he's not really a fan of burgers either. \n\nSo why 3 stars? As much as these burgers were delicious, it didn't really give me the \"WOW at first bite.\" The appetizer rocked more than my burger. We went on a Sunday evening...peak dinner hours but there were only about 4-5 other tables. Hopefully this place can survive.
