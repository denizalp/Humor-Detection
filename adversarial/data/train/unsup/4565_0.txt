I like the vibe at this Ace Hardware. It still retains that neighborhood hardware store feel that you don't get from neighboring behemoth stores Lowe's and Home Depot. They pack in a good selection of outdoor, home, and gardening items. We came in here primarily because they had a sale on lump charcoal (They carry Cowboy lump charcoal here) and a 25% off coupon from a mailer. In addition to the lump charcoal they had a wide selection of wood pellets, BBQ accessories, and charcoal briquettes. One of the employees asked if I needed any help with anything, and check out was speedy with no problems.
