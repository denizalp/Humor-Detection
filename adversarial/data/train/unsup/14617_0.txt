This place is a joke, fake armed security guards act like their government or state police even though this is not a government facility. They don't know the law it's always a hassle trying to get into the facility. Most of them wouldn't know what to do if a real incident was to happen they would hesitate and panic in an instant. They are all wash out and can't make it as a Real law-enforcement office.
