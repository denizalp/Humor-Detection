Great TexMex\/Southwestern food located in the Arizona center! Chips&Salsa, table side guac, margaritas, white chocolate pecan \"tamales\" and superb service made our last meal here in Phoenix a memorable one! \n\nSERVICE was excellent from everyone here. The hostess, server, and manager were great. In general, we felt everyone in AZ was friendly and this place was no exception. I had a few questions after seeing their menu and they were happy to answer them. My first two questions came after reading their sign at the front door:\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/6Wc5DPXGudcNi2XK7QfQtA?userid=QhYJx2jQdPuSq3fGe3aGcA#5bkxBk1xbLz1lfpCt1slkA\n\nWHAT?!? LIMIT 2 MARGARITAS?! I never heard of this!! Our server explained that each margarita order is actually 2 glasses full, each glass has 2oz of alcohol so they limit you to 2 orders = 4 glasses = 8oz of tequila. I guess it's true, 1 tequila, 2 tequila, 3 tequila, floor. Recommend!\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/6Wc5DPXGudcNi2XK7QfQtA?userid=QhYJx2jQdPuSq3fGe3aGcA#9CoBAf2lHDm-VuDInPyyqA\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/6Wc5DPXGudcNi2XK7QfQtA?userid=QhYJx2jQdPuSq3fGe3aGcA#0EvNrLfD3apsqZt0tNaaBQ\n\nCHIPS and SALSA! This is not your ordinary chips and salsa! Like everyone else says, these are great! The salsa is awesome by itself and the 4 different types of chips - wonton, sweet potato,  blue&white corn tortilla (some of which were dusted with some magic sweet\/salty\/spicy rub) just hit the spot. Awesomely recommend.\n\nTABLESIDE GUACAMOLE! Holy guacamole! They explain all the ingredients that go into their guacamole to make sure everyone is ok with them and then proceed to make the freshest and best guac...take notes because this stuff is good! \nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/6Wc5DPXGudcNi2XK7QfQtA?userid=QhYJx2jQdPuSq3fGe3aGcA#iye-PBk09GNJJhpwsGFq5w\n\nThe dinner entrees were just okay. Nothing special going on there. But by this time you are wasted from the the two margaritas so it doesn't really matter. \n\nCHECK-IN on YELP, get free dessert! The white chocolate pecan tamales that arrived at our table were great, and this banana burrito was the free check-in offer!! \nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/6Wc5DPXGudcNi2XK7QfQtA?userid=QhYJx2jQdPuSq3fGe3aGcA#APw9-23ZffmGQj9u4lAv6A\n\nI'm not gonna argue whether this place is authentic or not. I'm no expert. However, this place has stood the test of time, as we've visited this place multiple times over the past 10+yrs whenever we are in Phoenix because we like it.
