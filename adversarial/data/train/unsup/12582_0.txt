*sigh* I really don't like to be negative, but being this was \"The Phoenician\" I was expecting better than what was given. It wasn't \"all that\". From the cheap looking wicker partition around the whirlpool to the employees who sat around in the bathroom area shooting the breeze. I guess hiding from their boss or something...\n\nI got a massage and a hair\/scalp treatment...Now, I really, really, really wanted to like the lady and it started out great. She gave me good tips on how to stretch my body at home to open up my chest area. Kudos to her for that! \n\nThen, it went downhill...I am a brown lady, as you can tell from my pic:-) Now, I know not very many brown people come to The Phoenician, as a whole, but damn...Can you act like we aren't brand new to you?! I have a LOT of hair I know, and when it's not flat ironed it's Diana Ross huge and thick. BUT, how many times do you have to tell me my hair is thick? How many times do you have to tell me how many bottles of product you are using? How many times do you have to tell me you aren't going to be able to do the full service because it is taking so long putting the oil on my hair? How many times are you going to tell me I have a lot of hair? How many times are you going to tell me my hair is \"drinking up\" the product? Finally, I said, \"Lady, I know I have a lot of hair...It's my hair!\" We discussed how the few brown people that do come to the spa do not get this service, and that's because normally no one would want someone who doesn't know anything about their hair texture touch their hair...and this is why! I could go on and on about the complaining and usuage of product I had to listen to the ENTIRE time, but I won't.\n\nI am torn between a 2 and a 3 star review, but I'll give it a 2.5\/3 star
