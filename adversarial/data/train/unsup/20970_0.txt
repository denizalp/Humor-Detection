I must have poor taste when it comes to Mexican food based on the review below because I think Big Burrito is pretty damn tasty. Their carne asada fries are bomb and I'll come back for them time and time again.\n\nCarne asada fries consist of carne, cheese and french fries. No sour cream, no guacamole, no bullshit - just meat, cheese and deep fried potato - fuck yes.\n\nMy boyfriend has gotten the rolled tacos (guac on the side) and he's also gotten the taco plate. Both of them have gone over well.\n\nWhen you have a hankering for inexpensive mexican food and you're in the neighborhood, Big Burrito is a good choice. :)
