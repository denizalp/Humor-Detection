Best tiki bar ever lol\nI loved this place.\nI bought 4 mugs lol. with a drink they were $30 each. A little expensive but totally worth it, i think.\nThe bartender was awesome, the entire staff is super nice\n\nTheres plenty of space at the bar and all around the venue.\n\nDrinks start around $9\n\nIf you love tiki and want some amazing mugs you MUST stop here
