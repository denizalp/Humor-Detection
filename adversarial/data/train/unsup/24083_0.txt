i first must preface my review with this fact...\ni live 35 miles away from their current location and i am more than happy to make the drive just to have their shaved snow cream in my belly as often as possible.\nwould i like them to be closer?\nsure!\nbut living in the northwest part of town, i've come to accept the fact that i have to go the distance in order to partake in the good things that vegas has to offer.\nfrost bites shavery is definitely one of those good things and i would drive to hell and back to get my fix.\n=)\n\nshaved snow (snow cream, fluff, shaved ice, whatever you wanna call it, it's like nothing you've had before) originates from my home country, taiwan, but i've never been there so have no basis for comparison of authenticity when it comes to this tasty treat.\nbut i have tried a few places here in vegas and los angeles and, by far, frost bites shavery has everyone licked.\nit definitely helps to be passionate about what you do and the guys at frost bites have put their all into creating what i would consider the absolute best shaved snow i've ever had.\nthere's nothing better.\n\ni've tried a few of their flavors (black sesame, mango, strawberry, vanilla and green tea).\ni absolutely love all of them but my favorite has got to be the black sesame...hands down.\nthe fact that they only use 4 ingredients and everything is fresh, meaning no artificial flavors, is a huge plus in my book.\nmost shaved snow places (not naming any bear names) use powders or some sort of artificial ingredient.\n\nthey've only been open a month and already have a pretty decent following.\nmost of us have to drive a good 20-30 miles to get there. \nthere isn't a single place in town that's better or more worth the drive.\nif you haven't had a chance to try it, you're really missing out so get in your car (or whatever mode of transportation you use) and get your butt down to boulder highway, just south of lake mead parkway in the smith's shopping center, for your snow cream fix.\nyou won't regret it!
