I received a gel manicure from Lovely Nails in mid-December. I came in on a weekday afternoon and had about a 15 minute wait - completely worth it for the quality service I received. All of the nail technicians were extremely friendly and did an exceptional job! My manicure took about 40-45 minutes and looked fantastic! My nail technician worked very quickly and cautiously. My nails were perfect! \n\nThe salon was very clean and has a calm ambience. I used to go to Anna's Nails, but will definitely be switching to Lovely Nails as my regular salon!
