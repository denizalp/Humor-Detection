This place is a Phoenix original! Although  it used to be called The Spaghetti Company, things change. But, it is basically the same.\nBecause, the owner got divorced he lost this location to his wife, who had it join the Chain of Spaghetti Factory.\nAt first with all the changes, it suffered and was not as good as the Company was. \nBut, they have ironed it out a bit and now it is better.\n\nThe food is good. Not authentic Italian, but for the price it is a fantastic deal.\nNothing to complain about at all.  You get a lot of food for a very low price.\nIt is decorated really great. Very old fashioned Victorian style.\nServers are friendly and do the best they can, because this place is always packed full.\n\nYou get soup or salad, bread and butter, a meal , and dessert. All for less than $10.00.\nThe menu has a lot to choose from as well.\nIt is a great place to take children, because the whole family can go out and it does not break the bank. \nBathrooms are clean, and lots of parking, additional in the back.
