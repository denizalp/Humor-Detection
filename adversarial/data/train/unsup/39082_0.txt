Arrived at 12:30. Waited in line for about 45min. Well worth the wait. Visiting from California and yelped this place. We decided to try everything. Meat by the pound. Ordered sliced brisket, pulled pork, 1 massive beef rib, 4 pork ribs, and 3 sides. Tried the Jalape√±o grits, coleslaw, and potato salad. Everything was fantastic! Took home a lot of leftovers. $80 out the door.
