Prepare yourself for a long drive to Cool Hand of a Girl if you live anywhere near the downtown core, by which I mean Michigan. ;-) Only kidding, although the Junction is not close.\n\nCool Hand of a Girl, though, is absolutely worth the drive. The specials rocked and the regular menu, although not as fancy pants, looked delish, as well. I had the \"Scramble\" which was scrambled eggs with a cranberry\/pecan\/chevre mixture lovingly wrapped inside. It was served with potatoes (meh) and a fantastic coleslaw-type salad that had pumpkin seeds and beets (yum!). \n\nThe staff was *very* friendly and the java was excellent. \n\nNote: CHofAG is cash only.
