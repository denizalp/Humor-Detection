Nauseous, after the 2nd bite of the chicken curry. Something with the chicken just didn't taste right....almost raw but didn't look raw. Neither did any of the sushi. I just wasted my money on all you can eat when you don't want to eat the rest of the food you ordered. Need to rethink eating at an \"all you eat sushi\".. I did like ordering from an ipad.
