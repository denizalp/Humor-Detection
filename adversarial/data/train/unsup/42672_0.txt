Hopped in for a late lunch\/early dinner on father's day afetr my son's time with his dad. Was delighted to have a great server Chantelle. Very professional, polite and attentive hostess i.must say. Well versed with kid's deviating choices and know to share young one's excitement  for their dessert treats.. Im definitely coming back also for some more soccer :)
