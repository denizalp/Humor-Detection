I don't think me and my fianc√© have been to this location, but we went to the tempe market place and walked through all the stores, and I wound up buying quite a bit for my family for Christmas from here! There is a ton of cool stuff to go through. You really need to take your time in order to cover everything. We still have two small jam jars that we have yet to eat from when we discovered this place. I'm really hoping I'll be able to get back in this year!
