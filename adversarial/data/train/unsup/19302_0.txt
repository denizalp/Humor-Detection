I've always wanted to come here. So when we saved up for our next dose of pricey seafood, we made sure this was the place!\n\nCrispy friend onion rings $3.95, giant onion rings that are bigger than your palm. Love them! (and I usually don't like onion rings)\n\nThe oysters were so amazing, so fresh. No idea what we had... but we had fun! There were no more tables so we sat at the bar, where the waiter opened the oysters in front of us. It's a very small place, cottage-like. Cozy and loved that we came here on a winter night. \n\nGlad we came!
