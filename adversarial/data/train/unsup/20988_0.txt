We stumbled onto Poke Express on our way to Island Sushi.  And since Island Sushi only had bar seating left, something the mister doesn't like, we luckily ended up at Poke Express, and things in the world are much better for it.\n\nPoke Express is not the kind of place to take a girl\/boy you're trying to wine and dine, it's not the kind of place you go to have a chatty dinner with a girlfriend you haven't seen for a while.  It's a minimally-decorated, brightly-lit, take-out counter, no tablecloths and paper napkins kind of place.  But if you are looking for some little-fuss and much-quality Hawaiian poke with a lot of authenticity and warmth, then this is the place.\n\nWe had the Hawaiian Ahi Poke and Deluxe Fried Noodles and were satisfied with both.  Hawaiian Poke was very flavorful and had large pieces of very fresh fish: only $7.95 for half a pound.  Deluxe Fried Noodles was stir-fried saimin (Hawaiian egg noodle that tastes a tad like ramen) with spam, BBQ pork, and fish cake.  There could have been a little more meat and less noodle but it was still delicious.  I recommend putting a little Sriracha hot sauce on both, it adds a little bit of heat and a lot of favor.\n\nI was already a fan, when I spotted their sweet treats on our way out.  I tried the banana bread, wow, what a familiar memory of terrific sweetness.  It is like the Vietnamese banana bread, but lighter in texture and sweeter in taste.  It is definitely my new favorite breakfast snack.
