Ate here on a weekday with family. There were few groups eating, otherwise, it wasn't busy and our group of 8 was seated right away. The dining room was bright, open, and clean. There's plenty of tables to accommodate larger groups. \n\nService was good, everyone was polite. Ordering and receiving our food\/drinks was timely, and our drinks were kept full. We were checked on regularly and empty plates were cleared. \n\nIt was president's day (a holiday), so we're unable to order from their regular lunch specialty and had to order from their regular menu. \n\nSo, I was hesitant to come here after reading several Yelp reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered their BBQ chicken which came with some (red) fried rice. The chicken was very tender and came off the bone easily. The sweet dipping sauce it came with was a nice compliment. I didn't really taste any specific flavor from the fried rice (it was probably overpowered by everything else), but it wasn't oily or greasy at all. Some other things I tried... BBQ spareribs- also tender with a good amount of meat and nicely flavored. Phad Thai- yumMy! Subtle sweet peanut flavor with nice chewy texture. Panang curry- cuts of boneless chicken and potato in a curry soup\/sauce. Good flavor and the chicken was tender. \n\nOverall, I liked the food. Nice flavors, Nothing too overpowering or salty. Not too oily either.
