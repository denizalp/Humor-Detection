I enjoyed the service and food very much! Personally, I drink A LOT of ice water and I never found myself having to wave the waitress down to give me some water haha. Also through out the dinner she came by very often to check up on us and even chatted us up. Plus a point for when I asked for a picture she suggested to go to the lounge to take the picture minus a point for not really know how to take pictures LOL \n\nWe order the Appetizer of the day which was kobe beef, it was 3 slices of thinly sliced kobe beef and the stone was seasoned with salt. I must say the kobe beef was the high point of our dinner. We also order the mussels in blue cheese my gosh  it was quite a big serving compared most places. IT WAS SO DELICIOUS. I'm not a big fan of blue cheese but I just kept eating. They give you a lot of other choices for sauces too and the waitress seemed to recommend their beer or blue cheese most. \n\nWe were kind of stuffed with the mussels at this point but for the main course we order the seafood platter and the surf and turf. For my ex seafood platter that comes with TIGER SHRIMPS, SEA SCALLOPS, CUTTLEFISH. The lemon got burnt before my boyfriend even began \"cooking\" and it just had this weird smell. Everything was so bland. It was really disappointing . For my surf and turf the lobster tail was way over cooked, I was pretty peeved about that and the sirloin was just sirloin hahaha nothing much to say about it typical piece of meat lightly seasoned with salt. \n\nWe  concluded the appetizer was DEFINITELY the hit for our night! We will be coming back again I am looking forward to trying the fish combination and many more appetizers. But it's not a good sign when I just want to order appetizers and not the main meal.
