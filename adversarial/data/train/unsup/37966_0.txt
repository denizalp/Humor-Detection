Went to Mitchell's with another couple for Valentine's Day. We were all disappointed.  First the place was not busy (yes on Valentines Day!) then they had a limited menu.  My friend has a shell food allergy and is catholic.  He could choose only one thing - the salmon which was acceptable. I too was limited with my allergies.  My husband asked to have the special for one and they \"couldn't accomodate.\" The 2 salads they offered were a caesar and a boring house salad, which was all ice berg lettuce.  (On other nights, they have really good salads) Why not offer those for Valentine's Day? The food tasted OK. Mashed potatoes were awesome. My husband asked for no asparagus but roasted veggies.  He received the asparagus and a side of steamed veggies. Desserts were fine except due to my allergies I could only get the boring creme brûlée.  I am so sick of Creme Brûlée at restaurants as my only choice that I usually do not have dessert.  Service was slow and inconsistent. we were not the only table with issues.  The table beside us a child ordered pasta with alfreaedo sauce.  He received his pasta plain! YUCH!  This restaurant previously was one we would go to when at the Waterfront but after the last 2 trips, I see why they are not busy.  I am rethinking booking this restaurant for Christmas Eve.
