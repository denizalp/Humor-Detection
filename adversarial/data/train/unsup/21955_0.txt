Went here on 12\/07\/10 with some friends. All in all there were 5 of us crammed into one table in the glass smokey room. \n\nPositives:\nMy tortilla soup ($2.50\/cup) was off the chain.\nOpen really late.\nMy friend Jen's horrific Thai skewers were taken off the bill.\n\nNegatives: \n-Thai skewers were simply what looked like boiled ripped up chicken covered in Mae Ploy sauce, on 4 skewers, served with peanut butter. Ew. \n-Everybody was crazy old. The waitress said the people who come in are usually 65+\n-Waitress stopped refilling our waters after one refill.\n-Really random (bad) music.\n\nWe were there for 3 hours chatting it up, but I don't think I'd go back unless I was with friends. Their soup was good so yeah, 2 stars.
