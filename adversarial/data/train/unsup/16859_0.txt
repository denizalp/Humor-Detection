This place has been my go to spot for Indian food in Vegas for as long as I have lived on the west side of the strip.No matter what I have ordered,it has been top notch.\n\nOur default dishes (not all in one sitting though):\nVeggie Pakora\nChicken Makhani (butter chicken) Nice and thick creamy consistency. I cannot stand watered down chicken curry\nRogan Josh (lamb curry) Great sauce and loaded with lamb. \nChicken Korma \nSaag Paneer I am not a fan of this dish in general but I do like their version. I goes very well with the garlic naan. \nTandoori Chicken. I know it sounds stupid but I love the pickled onions that come with the chicken. Oh and the chicken is good too!\nGarlic Naan. Always fresh!\nNot to mention the complimentary  papadum served with mint chutney and tamarind sauce.\n\nI have dined at most of the Indian Restaurants in the Valley and crown this place the Champion of Indian food in Las Vegas. \n\nEat with Confidence\n\n-P
