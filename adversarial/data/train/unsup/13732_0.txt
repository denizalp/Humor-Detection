Don't come to this pharmacy!!! There are 2 ladies who work here who are totally incompetent and rude!! You are better off at the Ft Apache or Rainbow location.  \nOne of them has an accent and you cannot understand her and she pretends she can't hear you on the phone....all the time! This location is horrible as far as customer service is concerned! They need to find jobs elsewhere that does not deal with people.  \nManagement - hope you pay attention to this as you will lose customers!
