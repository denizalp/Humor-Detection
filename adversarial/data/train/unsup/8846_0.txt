Why a 3 you ask? \n\nWell the food is really quite good as long as you don't go to Panda Express or PF Changs' expecting authentic home-cooked Chinese food. The noodles here are fresh and you can see them making the noodles by hand in the front window all day long. As you would expect in a place like this... the noodle dishes come out lightening quick and the food is above average. \n\nThe downside is the high (even for vegas standards) prices. What more would you expect for a restaurant situated in Caesars (smack dab in the middle of the strip). The decorations and ambiance is quite different than most Chinese places as it is quite bright and feels spacious. \n\nSo when you are rolling big in Vegas... or a getting comped... or really in the mood for some authentic Chinese food... make your way into Beijing Noodle No. 9!
