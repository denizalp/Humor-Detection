They're open again! I was so sad when I saw the Nestle Tollhouse was closed before I got to try it, but they're open, with new management! \nI got the six cookie and drink combo for $8.99 (came to $10.16 with tax).\nThe cookies are orgasmic. There, I said it. \nHoly cow they're good. And the girls behind the counter are so sweet.\nWhen I inquired about the cookie cake slice combo ($3.99 -comes with coffee, milk, or soft drink) the owner graciously offered to make one for me as there were none available. It would take forty minutes. I was tempted,  I had more shopping to do. \nI declined because I was hungrier than that. I wanted six cookies\nJust like their logo says: big enough to share, but are you? \n-No. They're too delicious. \nTry the snickerdoodle and triple chocolate. \nDrooool.
