Their signature cake is notable for its thorough mediocrity. I purchased one on Valentine's Day for a dinner party and was embarrassed to serve it. They either used frozen cake or don't put custard in it anymore, or they are seriously slipping and knowingly serving shit when they know it's a holiday crowd.\n\nOn top of that the cake wasn't even fresh. The layers were not even visible, they just had some abstract substance between them - tasteless and colorless. If you want a cake that looks and tastes like what a burnt almond torte should be, go to Moio's or some other place. \n\nI never call to complain or send back food, but when I let them know about my dissatisfaction they were dismissive and rude.
