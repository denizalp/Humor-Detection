First time trying Gaati, was highly recommended by both my friend and by another friend of my wifes. We ordered pad thai, yellow curry, and stuffed chicken wing. Yellow curry was ok but super light in the chicken and loaded with undercooked potatoes and carrots. Pad thai was pretty bad, lacked flavors, lacked peanuts, no limes, and no sauces, but worst of all seemed very old like leftovers, was one gelatonous cubular mass in the container solid as a whole yet composed of very mushy noodles. I had to cut it like lasagna to plate for my family. Stuffed chicken wings were ok, Ive had better at siri thai for much less, and siri thai isnt exactly the standard of excellence for thai in henderson either, readers may remember siri was famously caught last year by the health dept recycling rice off of bussed dirty dishes from the dining room. I would go 2 stars but pad thai is the one dish that better be good at a thai place, and their prices are just as high as pin kaew at no where near the quality. Too bad pin kaew is scary with old half rotten seafood as well, the search for decent thai in henderson goes on.
