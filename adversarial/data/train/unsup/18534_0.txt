This place was the ROTD (Review of the Day) today - 7\/16\/14.  I saw the pictures and the other stellar reviews that made me crave Thai food all day long. I had to go and check out this place. No matter what.\n\nSo we made it for early dinner. Checked-in via Yelp before looking at the menu. Pops out a FREE Thai iced tea offer! #winning. Unfortunately, that was the only highlight of this dining experience.\n\nWe ordered 2 appetizers: an order of crispy tofu & an order of fish cake. This is sort of our standard test for Thai joints: how well they do their apps. Based on those 2: their grade would be C-. The tofu was not crispy at all and accompanied by an unappetizing sauce. The fish cake (tod mun in other places) was a bigger letdown - these were definitely store bought and not freshly made - sized like a dollar coin with a tough texture and was also paired with same sauce that came with the tofu.\n\nWe ordered the Tom Ka soup with chicken - we were worried that the server did not asked the spice level of any of our dishes so kinda expecting some Thai heat. This soup came in with a wimpy Level 1. For 10 bucks, definitely below the standards of the other Thai restaurants within the 10 mile radius.\n\nFor entrees, we had the Pad Thai (can't go wrong with that) - it was OK but again not mind blowing as the other reviewers were cheering about. The other entree was the Panang curry with tofu. This one was so soupy as the Tom Ka that when I  mixed it with the white rice, it was a BIG mess.\n\nSadly, the service was NO better than the food. We were the only ones in the place and I asked for everything. Can I have some plates please (after the apps were served)? Can I have some utensils please (only 1 fork for 3 people)? Can I get some water please? You get the drift...\n\nVery disappointing meal. I guess I was expecting a lot given the rave reviews. Bottom-line, I was duped.
