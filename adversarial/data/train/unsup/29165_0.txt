I went to the Rio on a Saturday night. There was a 10 minute wait. The ambiance was loud but we were seated in the bar area right off the casino. The seating area was very nice. I ordered the All American burger. My friends ordered the prime rib and ribeye. My burger came out fully customized, 6 inches tall. It was delicious. Judging by the lack of conversation and the quickly cleaned plates, the steaks were pretty delicious too. The portions were generous. The prices were pretty fair, especially for LV. \n\nWhy not a 5 starts? Our server was missing... a lot. I was sincerely surprised when I got a refill on my Pepsi. The noise I can forgive. But forgetting you have patrons... no bueno. \n\nI still recommend this place as a great place to eat off the strip.
