After wiping the scent of dead strippers and hobo urine off my shoes, I've gather the intestinal fortitude to write about this nasty little corner of Vegas. \n\nBefore I continue, I would like to add that this place may be better during the night... when you can't tell that the buildings are falling apart or that the place just smells like urinal cakes.\n\nDon 't get me wrong, there are some worthwhile things to see. Vegas Vic is down there (the neon cowboy, +1 star for him alone). His arm doesn't move anymore, but he is still chillin' on the side of the building. The Golden Nugget and the Fitzgerald Casinos are on Fremont Street also. There are tons of street vendors and cheap food. However, once you step inside the casinos and smell the scent of stale beer and cigar smoke that has been soaking into the stalagmites hanging from the ceiling... you might think twice about eating at these establishments.
