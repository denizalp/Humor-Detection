Absolute Flood Response claimed that I did not give them a check for my insurance deductible.   My insurance agent called me up and told me that Absolute Flood Response did not include my payment in their bill to AllState Insurance.   Wow.   I have the Payment Form and a copy of my check from my bank to prove it.
