Yum!! This place has some awesome flavours. What's even better... Half of them were dairy-free!\nTheir vegan ice cream was actually really creamy... A lot of vegan ice creams I've tried have a kind of icy texture, but not here! My dairy-loving friend tried some and gave it the thumbs up.  I had a scoop of black sesame and a scoop of pear. They were both so awesome, packed with strong flavours. I will definitely be returning!
