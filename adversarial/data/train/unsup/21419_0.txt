Tried the express drive-through wash. There is the basic package ($5.99) which is your standard wash, rinse, and dry, and the special package for $9.99. I got the special wash which includes:\n\nCleaning towel\nAir freshener\nRainEx surface and glass\nTriple foam conditioner\nDouble wheel cleaner\nDouble foaming soaps\nDouble spot free rinse\nOptional tire shine\n\nI actually just got new tires so I opted out of the tire shine. The drive through was easy. You pay with cash or credit at a kiosk, then drive to the entrance which is manned by someone who will give you the air freshener and towel before your car enters the wash cycle. Your car will be guided automatically through the drying area as well as the wash and rinse which is nice since other automated washes I've been to have a timed dry that you drive your car through. \n\nThe wash comes with free vacuum and there are several stations you can park your car at. The hoses are quite noisy but have a lot of suction power! \n\nOverall I think the wash did a good job at removing most of the dirt and bird poop on my car. There were a few hard caked on bits leftover but those were easily removed with the free damp towel. Compared to other automated washes this Cobblestone provides a good value for your money.
