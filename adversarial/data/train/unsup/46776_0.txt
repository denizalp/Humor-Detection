I love Burrito Boyz! It's always so yummy. The large is huge, so I usually take home half for a later meal.\n\nThe place is small, so don't bet on a sit-down experience. But if the weather's nice, take it to go. \n\nI've had the chicken burrito and the beans and cheese burrito. Both so good. Whenever I'm in the neighbourhood, I stop here.
