I was referred here when my beloved pup was diagnosed with osteosarcoma in her upper left leg.  \n\nThe entire staff, from Dr Arthur to the vet techs to the front desk workers, was the most knowledgeable, professional, caring and compassionate that I have ever encountered.  Azzie had a round of palliative radiation, which let her live comfortably for several months beyond her diagnosis, and when the time came to say goodbye, they helped her slip away with grace and dignity, and they were beyond supportive to me.\n\nI highly recommend them - they are the best at what they do.
