1. If you want a cold beer.  Don't come....\n\n2. If you want good service.  You apparently need to let them get established.\n\n3.  If you want mediocre food that's over priced.  You're here....look no more\n\n4.  If you want anything beside 3 beers or  hard alcohol.  Don't sit upstairs.....\n\nWe waited with our name on the list for upstairs balcony.  They didn't even care where we were.  It was apparently self sit.  2 hours later...  Our waiter said he can get us hard alcohol but he would need to walk down the stairs and was tired cause he had been walking them since 10am.  We got our own drinks.  Then the beer was warm.  I got mud shark wheat beer and it was sour from being so warm.  They have been open a week.  How is it bad???  Cause they didn't properly setup anything before opening.  It is so mismanaged its sad.  We are really excited about this place.  Horrible service and beer.  They are craft beer and food.  Our hostess acknowledged that they gave us a bad experience and said they would buy a round of drinks for the four of us.  Nobody did and we were so tired of the place we left and went to San tan brewery.  A place that has good food and is managed properly.  The place has a good atmosphere but nobody knows what they are doing.
