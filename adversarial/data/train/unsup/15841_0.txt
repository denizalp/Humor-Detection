I don't know what happened to this place. This was the first time I have ever eaten RSB and been let down.\n\nOrdered Duo plate with 1 side and bread plus a drink. Opted for the short ribs and brisket with cheesy mac and cheese as the side.\n\n- The meat lacked any flavor and was completely missing that \"Wow\" factor we experienced on  each previous visits. Plus the meat was actually lukewarm, like it had been sitting out for a bit.  The short ribs were still good, but the brisket was very disappointing. \n- Plus it seems like the portion sizes have gotten smaller. We both looked at our plates and said at the same time, \"That's it?\". Hmmmm.\n- Personal pet peeve of mine: Dropped 4 singles into the toke jar and never even received an acknowledgement. I work for tips and thank EVERYBODY who tokes. It is just rude not to.\n\nI really hope I just caught them on an off day, but now I am going to start exploring other options when craving good BBQ. This was just a very underwhelming experience.\n\n2 stars.\n\nI have experienced better.
