I stopped in on my way home around 9:30pm and got two slices of pepperoni pizza, and it was delicious.  This is what a pizza place should be-- no gimmicks, no complications, just tasty, perfectly greasy, amazing, hot pizza.  YUM.  Crust is great, cheese is great, they don't use that sweet tomato sauce that I hate, and they don't skimp on the pepperoni.  Will definitely be back.
