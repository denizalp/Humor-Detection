Nice little find \n\nThe Garden Pizza is a small strip mall restaurant, that has a casual and informal vibe. The restaurant has open seating, no booths so you will get a chance to meet new people.\n\nThe pizza is really very good, fresh ingredients, great sauce and crispy crust, and when they say large, they mean large.  Have to bring some home and it was just as good the next day.\n\nI recommend Garden Pizza when you want to sit around the table with family and friends and talk while enjoying good pizza . I look forward to visiting again and trying other items off the menu.
