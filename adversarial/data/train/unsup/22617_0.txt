I had to bring my husband back here after I visited with the other Elites for their Sneak Peak night. I knew he would love the Foosball, ping pong, and shuffleboard, but most importantly he would love the Mortal Kombat 2 on the og arcade upstairs. \n\nWhen we went the change machine wasn't working, and as an FYI the arcade games are $.50. We went downstairs to get some change and to grab a drink and something to eat since I couldn't stop talking about how good the chicken and waffles are and how he should try the chicken and waffles.\n\nSomething else to keep in mind is that the bar closest to the front door has a full menu, while the bar in the back does not. The bartender said that is what they are doing for the first month they are open, so it shouldn't be too much longer. \n\nI got the OMB Hornet's Nest for $4 on draft and the chicken and waffles appetizer for $7. They have it as a meal, but it comes with 2 sides, and just seemed like a lot of food, and I don't think waffles reheat.... Anyways my husband ordered a lager (can't remember which) his was $5, and a burger (because of course he didn't get the chicken and waffles) which was $10\/$11 I think.\n\nMy food came out first and was delicious. I subbed the moonshine apple butter for the maple honey mustard and was very glad I did. The waffle was perfect and so was the chicken. I definitely ate all of it, and again was glad I only got the appetizer. My husband said his burger was also really good and that he was surprised at how good my chicken and waffles were (although I said they were). We ended up getting quarters and going up to battle each other in Mortal Kombat, where I ended up losing 2-1. We then played Ninja Turtles and were promptly out of quarters, so we had to say goodbye and until we meet again. \n\nBy the way ping pong is free.
