Whole Foods Market - Henderson, NV\n\nWhole Paycheck??  Well, that really depends on what you get.  I agree, Whole Foods does cost more than your typical grocery store.  But when it comes to quality, Whole Foods is 2nd to none.  This Whole Foods is spacious and the employees are always helpful.  I rarely do my weekly grocery shopping at a Whole Foods.  If I'm at one, it's usually for their Hot Bar or deli.  The Hot Bar at this Whole Foods is a lot larger than the Summerlin location.  Prices for ready to eat chicken breast, turkey breast, and salmon isn't too bad and based on weight. Taste wise, everything is fresh and delicious.  A pound of lightly seasoned chicken breast is around $12, while their fresh salmons cost $24 per pound.  In my opinion, this is a steal.  In my opinion, their salmon taste better than most of the steakhouses on the strip at 1\/3 of the price. Overall, I prefer this Whole Foods over the locations closer to my home.  Good Job, Whole Foods!!  I will be back.
