The food was great and the beer selection was outstanding.  However it is a bit pricy for the area.   The wait staff is still in a break-in process, but doing well.  Admittedly, it was hard to get past the beer, any place with Dogfish Head 90 minute IPA on tap is awesome in my book.  That being said, and since I was asked....\n- The Black and Blue French Fries, absolutely AWESOME!\n- \"Cheeseburger on a Pizza?\" - killer pizza, the onions and cheese really set it off.
