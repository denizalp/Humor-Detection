I wasn't able to have Integrity fix my garage door because my management company hired somebody else.  However, they responded to my Thumbtack request immediately with a very reasonable quote.  I spoke with Mike Canfield on the phone, and he correctly diagnosed my problem after only a few minutes of discussion.  I felt very comfortable with his knowledge and expertise, and wish Integrity could have done the job for me.
