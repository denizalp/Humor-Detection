Is it weird I love everything about Revitasize even though I've only been there once and had one cold pressed juice? Said cold pressed juice is their super greens and it was fantastic. There's spinach, ginger, lemon, cayenne in it just to make a few ingredients. Sounds healthy, but it sure wasn't the tastiest thing (that cayenne packed a punch). I mean if it's healthy there's gotta be a catch, right?\n\nThere's a clean and simplistic look about the place, which perfectly compliments their concept. \n\nThere's plenty of juice options here that I would love to try, although I believe you'd need a subscription for their entire juice menu (goes for as little as $100 for 10 juices). \n\nI would love to come back to try their desserts or their salads. They all look delectable. They're vegan too so that's a huge plus!
