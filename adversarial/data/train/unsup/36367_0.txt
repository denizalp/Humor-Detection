I haven't been to a Bay location for a while.  My friend mentioned to me that the third floor was worth visiting.  \n\nThey have quite a selection of fancy brands.  And \"The Room\" is up there - if you're in the market for some $700+ shoes, this might be the place to go.  The 3rd floor rivals a Holt Renfrew shopping experience.\n\nSince I wasn't really in the market for anything, and didn't need help, it didn't really bother me that no one actually greeted me.  I'd say if you're looking for some cool stuff and don't want to be bugged this might be the place you've been dreaming of.
