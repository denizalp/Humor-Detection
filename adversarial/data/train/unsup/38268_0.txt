This is our go-to restaurant. It's great. i don't give five stars unless we're talking a very high-level of great. But as far as Thai goes here in Vegas, this place is every bit as good as Lotus Of Siam, and on many things better. Their menu is just slightly more limited but also much less expensive. Anything with their Chu-Chee curry is off the charts. The Penang curry is similarly perfect. Of course the industry foodies go here and the wine geeks ooze from the place for good reason. \n\nThe oysters are always crisp and the chili-lime-garlic-cilantro touch is the bomb. On rare occasion their fantastic shrimp cakes are slightly over-fried but they still almost get swallowed whole. I will confess, that the superb selection of Rieslings and such are not always my thing , but they cover the bases with beers and the Singha is always consistently nice and cold.\n\nBut the real reason to come to Chada is the Tom Yum Koong lemongrass and shrimp soup. It can cure the common cold or get your head straight. Just writing about it makes me get in my car and go get some.\n\nThis is simply a great restaurant.
