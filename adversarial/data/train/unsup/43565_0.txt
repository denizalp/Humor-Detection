One of my most favorite dining experiences was at Diego Pops in Old Town. The atmosphere is perfect for a quick and light dinner before going out! I would recommend trying their guava coconut served in a baby coconut. It reminded me of the Caribbean islands! We started with street corn queso and guacamole (both were amazing!). I was feeling veggie that night, so I opted for the bean and cheese burrito which was fantastic, and the other girls mentioned that their tacos were equally as yummy. \nA definite must go-to if you're in Old Town for dinner & drinks!
