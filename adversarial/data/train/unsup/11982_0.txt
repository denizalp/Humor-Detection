So I just waited 22 minutes at the bar to have my beer refilled.  3 girls behind the bar and nobody even looked at it.  I will admit one was on the well for the servers but even she made eye contact but never asked if I wanted another.  Hot ass behind the bar with no proper training.  It's what you come to expect from these places... \n\nUpdate:   Finally got the beer.  This girl charged .50 more for the same beer.  So my change was $1.50 and she asked if i wanted my change???  I said just put it on the bar and she got an attitude.  YOU ALWAYS GIVE THEIR CHANGE BACK!  The guest will leave you what they want.  I always tip a dollar a beer btw...  I would fire that skimmer girl so fast.  Management needs to get on their game.  I will abandon this place like a smelly girl...\n\nUpdate:  after watching these girls for two hours it is apparent there is no structure or assigned space.  It's a horse shoe bar for Christ sake and there's three of you....  One on the well, one on one side and the last on the other side.  Don't let the beers go empty.  Why?  REVENUE!  Another 19 minutes waiting for a beer with three hot girls running in circles behind a 20 foot bar.  Sad!
