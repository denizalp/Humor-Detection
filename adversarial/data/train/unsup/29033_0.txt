The Worst food I've ever had! Very disappointed for throwing away my $30 and to top it off I tipped at the register, not knowing they don't even bring you water. I gave the two stars because of the pizza only thing warm on this buffet. The soda machine was not working I had to tell my waiter twice. The dessert was good but the person serving it was rude very unhappy and unfriendly. Overall very disappointed Never again.
