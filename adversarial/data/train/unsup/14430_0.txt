Apparently Nellos has been around for quite some time in Ahwatukee and now l know why! This was my first time there and l liked the menu. Appetizers, pizzas, pastas, desserts.... there are many pizza joints but few have lasagnas, pastas etc. on their menu.  It was quite busy as we entered the restaurant around 5pm om a Sunday night.  It got even busier as time went on.  We ordered a garden salad big enough for two ($5). I then got a deep dish vegetarian pizza ($9), Ron ordered a thin sausage pepperoni pizza ($10× $1.25×$1.25).  Food came very quickly! Salad was served within 7mns, pizza dishes landed on our table within 14 mins.  Nellos was very busy and we were very pleasantly surprised by their quick food service.  Now l know why Nello is busy, successful and here to stay, they are GOOD!\nMy veggie deep dish pizza was loaded with fresh produce and Ron's pepperoni sausage pizza was super tasty as well.  From this point on, l will drive the extra mile to Nellos!
