The customer service at this place is absolutely horrendous. I had an appointment with them a few months ago and although I arrived on time for my appointment and I filled out all of my paperwork online ahead of time, I STILL had to wait close to two hours to see the doctor. Fast forward to now, I have been trying to contact someone in their medical records department for days. They have ONE number for ALL of their locations which is absolutely ridiculous and most definitely geared towards their having minimal to no patient interaction. When I call the number and press the option to be connected to the medical records department, I get a voicemail recording every time. I have left messages, sent emails, and no one has called me back. I asked the switchboard operator if I could go into the office where I had my appointment and request the records directly from them and she said if it has been more than a week since my appointment, they no longer have the records at their location. I have an appointment with another doctor scheduled for tomorrow and I need to bring my records to that appointment but clearly, that is not happening. Now I have to cancel my appointment and reschedule all due to their inefficiency. If you can avoid this place, please do.
