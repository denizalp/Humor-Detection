We are an HOA located in Phoenix, Arizona and used Dolphin Pools to remodel our fifty year old, 45,000 gallon swimming pool.  This included new electrical for lights, a commercial salt system, all new plumbing, including dual drain installation, and pool resurfacing.   We also had our large pool deck refinished. The remodeling brought our pool up to new County regulations. \n\nWe could not be happier with the service we received from Dolphin Pools.  The start-up began as promised and the job took less time than we had expected.  The various crews used by Dolphin were very professional, friendly and accommodating to our needs.  Any communications directed to Dolphin was immediately responded to.  We had no negative issues or any problems with the project.
