My first experience buying something from mor furniture was a very pleasant one! Tim was awesome! He was friendly and professional and seemed knowledgeable  about the products.  Mor was able to offer me a very good deal on a bedroom set and this was a very positive buying experience. I would definitely recommend Mor and also i recommend asking for tim!
