I was curious to try out the Ice cream at this place. Didn't go in with much expectations but left completely won over. I am not very familiar with this style of ice cream so first I went with an all time childhood favorite of mine: strawberries and cream. Let me tell you, this was a seriously delicious ice cream. Plus they make right in front of you. I went back this week and tried another favorite of mine: matcha ice cream. Another hit. \nPlus: Good flavours, they also have a vegan option\nCons: takes a couple of minutes to make so hopefully you're not in a rush. Also a bit pricey but totally worth it for a dessert splurge. Limited choice of flavours. \n\nConclusion: treat yo' self
