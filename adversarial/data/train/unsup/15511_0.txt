If you like Bundt cakes or cakes, this is the place. Stopped by to pick up a couple of cupcake sized to try.  Staff was extremely helpful and they had a sample tray of the flavor of the month.  The cake is very soft and moist and very tasty.  My only thought is that at $4.29 for one cupcake the cupcakes are expensive.
