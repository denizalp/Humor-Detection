I am almost hesitant to post a review because right now this is a hidden gem. If you go early on a weekday you will likely only see a handful of people. We are told that on the weekends there are as many as 300 hikers.\n\nWe discovered the trailhead while in a bike ride. The rangers\/docents are very friendly and informative. This is a fairly easy 5 mile loop. A good portion of the hike is in a dry riverbed so basically you are walking on lose sand and gravel. The petroglyphs are just past the last dry waterfall but it can be a bit of an adventure to get up. I didn't have proper Rick shoes on and found it pretty slick. Worth the climb. I understand you can go to the side at the previous fall and avoid this climb and will explore that on our next trip. Go early, take water, wear proper footwear, be careful and enjoy.
