Really good ice cream, super adorable\/old school\/nostalgic\/fun\/cute shop. \nHi, I'm an ice cream snob. And as such, I'm required to know where to find the best ice cream. Churn is toward the top of my list in the Phoenix area so far, bc of their unique flavors that don't sound ridiculous\/terrible AND they've got a decently creamy, buttery consistency (though I wish it were creamier and velvetier!). The shop itself literally makes me feel like a fat kid in a candy store, partly bc of all the retro vibes, and bc they also sell candy...and other goodies\/novelty toys. For a tiny shop, you sure can spend a crap load of money here. My toddlers go nuts over this place.\n\nEmployees (for the most part), are peppy and sweet and they genuinely seem happy to give out samples.  The most memorable flavors I've had are: \n- butter pecan\n- chocolate\n- Vietnamese coffee\n- cookies and mint\n- carrot cake\n\nIt's ALL been good and it tastes like they use high quality ingredients. On top of the classic cone options, they even have a fun pretzel cone that's pretty unique and yummy. \n\nThere's a couple tables and chairs out front (and a shared dining area in the back with the neighboring restaurant). But beware: during their peak times (i.e. after dinner\/Fri-Sat nights) the line can get pretty freaking long and limited seating can get ugly since the shop is small.
