This is a fast food chain? I've never heard of it...Good for me!\n\nI was staying at a hotel nearby, and I had a very important social function in the evening, which means I can't eat anything that would compromise my face thinning regiment. Plus I didn't have enough time for a restaurant lunch, so I popped in for a quick bite.\n\nI came here once before, looked at the menu..and walked out. I know Mexican food doesn't mean things in a pita, but that's the only selection here. There were a few things on the menu, but nearly no photos. How am I supposed to order? \nImagine trying to order from Taco Bell with no photos of the food, nobody would know what they were getting!!\nI got a spicy chipotle chicken with these brown beans, because the Women assembling it behind the counter said it was softer when I ask what the difference was comparing to the black bean. She seemed annoyed.\nI got the mild sauce, it was green..and too spicy to be called mild. I wanted the small size burrito, and supposedly that's what she gave me, but the thing was enormous! I sat down to eat with the two other people here..both MCAT candidates. \nWhat a depressing atmosphere.\n\nI wasn't treated very well by the two staff members here, they were nonchalant. You can't expect much from this place, but I wasn't happy. It's like customer service you see in that movie 'Clerks.' It took me much too long to finish the burrito, usually this would be a good thing, but it's not this time. Small means small.
