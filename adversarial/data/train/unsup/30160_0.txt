Last time I have been to Fanexpo was about 3-4 years ago, but went this year and loved it.\n\nBasically, if you are going to celebrate you Fandom, whatever it is, feel welcome here. Everyone is friendly and helpful. Daily there is food, usually Pizza and sushi, But Gotham grill is cool to check out too. The various events are occurring around the clock, so always look for something going on.\n\nOn Thursdays-Fridays, it is usually more relaxed with more ability to walk around and check out the various events that are going on.\n\nOn Saturdays people can get a bit pushy, but nothing bad. But EVERYONE is there. Great time to go cause you see loads of cosplay.\n\nOn Sunday, again, more relaxed.\n\nDefinitely a \"GOOD AS IT GETS\"!!! Go if you can, its fun!
