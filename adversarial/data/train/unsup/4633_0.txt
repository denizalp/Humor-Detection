Dear liver, \n\nThis is the hardest letter I've ever had to write. Almost as hard as it was to choose between the amazing selection at The Wren House.\n\nThe charismatic Julia puts to shame all other \"beeristas\" I have encountered.\n\nPeople say Romeo + Juliet is the greatest tragedy in modern literature. I say YOU not paying a visit to Wren House is a greater tragedy.
