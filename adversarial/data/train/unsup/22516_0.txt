Poached juicy chicken? Yes please!! I've always been a huge fan of Hainan Chicken Rice and when I found out there was a place off strip that specializes in it, I bookmarked it and flew out to try. Thank goodness for airline perks!\n\nChicken is organic free range; it's the American version of the chickens that are found in Asia called \"Tu-Gi\" - ground\/dirt chickens since they run around all day on dirt.\n\nThe chicken was poached perfectly. Juicy. Tender. Melt in my mouth. The rice was soooooo flavorful! Perfectly al dente. I'll be dreaming about this for awhile. \n\nSauces are all made in house. Dip the chicken in the soy, add a dollop of ginger scallion and do a dab of the sambal sauce. Eat. Repeat. \n\nBroth. Get the broth. Hands down that broth is amazeballs. I wish I could get the broth Fedex-Ed to me next time I get sick. It tasted like hearty yummy chicken. \n\nCornish hen salad was delicious! Served with half a hen that's fried so that the skin had all sorts of delicious crispy heavenly goodness. It comes with a wedge of lemon and a twist on the classic salt and pepper that included ground Szechuan peppercorns! The salad was chock full of autumn goodies: pomegranate seeds, avocado, julienned persimmons, cucumbers, grapes, cranberries, sunflower seeds, and green mix. \n\nSolid five stars. It is now on my regular Vegas restaurant rotations along with Lotus of Siam.
