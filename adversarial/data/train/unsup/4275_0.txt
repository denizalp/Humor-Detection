Pecan Grove is THE place for pie in Chandler. We've been here once for brunch and been back at least four times since to pick up a pie to go. Yes, I'll admit it, we're addicted to their pies.\n\nThe restaurant: this is homecooking away from home, plain and simple. The food is good, and by all the empty plates, people are enjoying their meals. The prices are more Scottsdale than Chandler (a bit steep), but the quality and the care is there. When we went, they had just opened a couple weeks previously, and were still going through some growing pains, but aside from an overabundance of staff mulling about, there's nothing much to gripe over, and we'll assume the owners will figure out their staffing issues soon enough.\n\nThe pies: did we mention the pies are to die for? You may ask, how good can pie really be? Well, forget store-bought pie, forget Marie Calendars, forget... well, forget the rest of them. Stop in at Pecan Grove and grab a slice. There are two kinds of apple pie, and I recommend them both: traditional with crust on the bottom and top, and then French apple with the cinnamon crumbles on top. I don't know which is better, only that I don't like going two weeks without a slice of one or the other. They're that good. The pecan pie was also incredible, and if I could stop ordering among those three, there is an intensely beautiful lemon merengue I'd love to try, but haven't gotten to, just yet. Curses, apple pies!\n\nFinally, to top it all off, I had one of the best cappuccinos of recent memory here, and with my slice of apple pie, it was a moment of true bliss.\n\nSpeaking of which, if your table's bill reaches $35, you get a free pie of your choice to go. Let me tell you about the apple pie........
