Oh Gallagher's, you are the every-man bar... you have beer, fried food, sometimes trivia  or karaoke, and you're A-OK.\n\nThere's a Gallagher's in every town.  It's not called Gallagher's in every town, of course, but there's always that one, casual, sports-ish bar that locals like, where friends meet up, and you can be comfortable in whatever. Bars like these rely on consistently good service, friendly prices, and a laid-back crowd to keep their patrons happy.  Gallagher's succeeds on all these fronts and doesn't pretend to be anything else. \n\nIf you go to Gallagher's expecting cold beers, decent bar food, friendly servers, and a relaxed vibe - you'll have a great time.  Take my advice and leave the drama, attitude, and Ed Hardy wardrobe at home.
