Love this place.  Feels like a home and not an apartment.  I love to listen and watch my movies fairly loud and even sing karaoke with my fianc√© and friends.  My previous apartment did not allow for us to do that.  Now living in a home with no attached walls and no one living above us gives us the ultimate privacy.  We have had several get togethers and watched movies and listen to music at loud volumes and no complaints.  I don't hear my neighbors and they don't hear us.  No more listening to my neighbor's footsteps above us.  The backyard feature is awesome too.  Can BBQ in the privacy of your own backyard etc.  The management is super friendly and they really make you feel welcome.  We live in the three bedroom and it really feels roomy.  We looked at other luxury apartments like Chandler Camden but you have to pay a lot more money for less square footage and only two bedrooms.  It was a no brainer to get more actual livable square footage and an extra room for three hundreds less per month.  If you want the ultimate privacy, feel of living in your own home, and friendly management staff, then this is the place for you.  I highly recommend this place.
