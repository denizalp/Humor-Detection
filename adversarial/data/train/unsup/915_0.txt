Great buffet for the blind and tasteless. Went here based on the reviews and I'm sorry to say it home town buffet\/ Golden Corral have better food then here.\nNo variety, no flavor, and the service no refills on the drinks come on it's not even busy at 4 pm plus why is the food cold? Rated one of the best buffets? What year? Not this one! Or even the next. This place is like Kmart going down hill but was it ever even good?\nLook around everyone is 55+ they don't even have taste buds left.
