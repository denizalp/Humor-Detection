While staying in Vegas, we were told this was a good Chinese Restaurant.\nHowever, this was not the case. The service was very slow. I even had to get up to get the bill.  They only had about 4 tables going in the whole place.\n The food was high priced for a very low key place.  THe worst part though, it was not very good at all.\nMy girlfriend really loves Asian food, so she was really disappointed.\nBut, hey what can you do. We did not read the reviews before we went.\n This is why you should always check with Yelp!
