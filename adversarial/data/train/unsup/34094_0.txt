Honestly it's ridiculous that the hours changed. I was at this location on Friday 2\/2\/18 at 10:45 AM and there was NO SIGN ANYWHERE that they were changing their hours. I went to go get lunch for 7 people today and they were closed. I now have to rearrange my entire plan. Very poor planning. Will not be visiting this location again.
