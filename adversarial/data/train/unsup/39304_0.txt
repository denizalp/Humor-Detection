Our first time trying this place and they were severely under staffed, but Kenlee was a ROCK STAR! Not only did she bartend, but she covered a 1\/3 of the restaurant as well! This poor girl worked her tail off and did an amazing job!! The food was on point for Taco Tues and I highly recommend the lobster queso!!
