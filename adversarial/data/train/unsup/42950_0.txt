My husband and I had our wedding reception here last Friday and we were both extremely happy with the level of hospitality Marisela and her team provided. From the moment I started talking to Marisela up until the day of our wedding Marisela made sure we had everything we wanted and needed to make the day perfect. The DJ, decorations, food and bar service were above our expectations and our guests raved about how wonderful everything was. If you want to have an amazing and stress free wedding reception I highly recommend Marisela and the team at Hacienda Gardens for your big day!
