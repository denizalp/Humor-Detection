TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!  AVOID THIS RESTAURANT!!!\n\nThe restaurant was at less than 50% occupancy!\n\nOrdered:\n\nAppetizers:\n - edamame\n - green beans\n\nSushi: (Didn't get a chance to order any more)\n - spicy tuna roll\n - spicy yellowtail roll\n - California roll\n\nPregnant Wife's Dinner:\n - chicken breast\n - white rice\n\n\nThe edamame & green beans tasted great and were delivered within 10 minutes.\n\nThe Sushi took 45 minutes to make and was average at best. I have bought better sushi at Costco. \n\nWe waited for 75 to receive the chicken, but finally we had enough, paid and left.\n\n\nDO NOT GO HERE!
