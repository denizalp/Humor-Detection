We have stayed at Treasure Island a couple of times now and had really good experiences! We usually go during the off-season months so the price has been fair for the Vegas strip. The rooms have always been clean and the views from the rooms are also good. They have a decent size pool with quite a few chairs for relaxing. We spent time lounging by the pool with a drink from the bar & found it very relaxing!\n\nI probably wouldn't eat at their buffet only because we have found better options but they do have a Cirque show at the hotel. We really enjoyed Mystere and would stay at TI for convenience! Their check-in & check-out has also been convenient for us so we'll keep this hotel at the top of our list to return to!
