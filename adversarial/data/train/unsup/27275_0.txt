I am on vacation here in Phoenix and I was so happy when I came across Nekter. I'm from Texas and eating well is important for me, I looked on trip advisor before vacation and was disappointed when it didn't show there was a Nekter here, but there is one! Hooray!\nThe toxin flush is my go to green drink. I love to get a juice when I'm feeling tired or my nutrition has been off.\nNekter always has the friendliest customer service too. Its a great place to meet a friend and share an acai bowl too!
