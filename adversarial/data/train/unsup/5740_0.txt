Note: CASH ONLY! No DINE-IN.\n\nSo my dear old pop has been curious about my Yelp journey. \n\n\"You need to find a place that has the best hoagie,\" he tells me yesterday. \n\nHe mentions The Real McCoy Sandwich Shop in Sahs Syde. He grew up in the neighborhood when it was \"real\" and was a frequent Real McCoy customer as a young man. \n\nHim and a lifelong pal of his were there earlier in the week. \"They still have the best damn hoagie arahnd,\" he exultantly declared. Both Dad and his bud allegedly scarfed down their grinders on a park bench to boot. That's street.\n\n\"Let's go this evening. I called. They're open until 11PM! And they haven't been reviewed on Yelp yet!\" I was excited.\n\n\"Ya just got that Meatball's Pizza! I ain't drivin' dahn there on a Friday night! All the riff-raffs 'n amateurs will be aht.\"\n\nOy. Vey. \n\nSo today, after trying Vinnie's Pretzels in Brookline,  my Mockingbird (or Black Canary if yer a DC fan) and I (Hawkeye or Green Arrow? Hmmm...) gunned towards South Side and found this legendary joint. They still have the vintage sign up in the front of the business above the door.\n\nThere's no place to sit down. You'll just find a counter and a playable pinball machine. \n\nWe got two whole hoagies; The Original and The Steak.\n\nThe bread comes from a world beyond. I forget which bakery my dad says they get it from, but it was thin-crusted, not toasted, yet held all the components without getting too soggy. \n\nThe meat on both was plentiful; no skimping here, and each sandwich got the works, including peppers that boogied down like drunken dervishes with our tongues. \n\nTHIS what I like to see in South Side; a good, old-school restaurant with inexpensive, quality food. Let's hope it defies gentrification and sticks around for another half-century.\n\nHow fun it was to eat these heros in a car, parked on a side street with a cool ladyfriend, and Sirius' Liquid Metal Station blaring? Yuppies and hipsters were crossing the street to avoid us! Hah!\n\nAnd they have Schneider's Iced Tea, the greatest of its kind. Bonus points for that. What better drink to wash down these god-like torpedoes of carbohydrate, plant, and protein with? \n\nIgnore Nakama for a change. Jeez. Hasn't it been Yelped 40 ways from Thursday already? \n\nThe Real McCoy brings all Subways to whimpering submission. They are just as cheap, the service is a step above, they wrap the zeps in deli paper (always an indicator of a good hoagie), and they have great hours (look them up on Facebook). GO OR I'LL STEAL YER SUSHI AND FEED IT TO MY CATS!
