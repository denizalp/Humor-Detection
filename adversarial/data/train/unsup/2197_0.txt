looks can be decieving. I was taking in by the beauty and loction. My kid goes to private school next door. Once through the door you can see the lack of quality in craftsmanship and appliances( all old) Small fridge, old washer\/dryer, & micro. Wouldnt mind if I wasnt paying almost $1500 for an APARTMENT (3 bed). Were on second round of new owners and MMGt and holy crap some of the women up front have the worst attitude. YIKES! They pay more attention to getting you in then taking care of whos here. So sad. It used to be a fun place, with occasional activities and a news letter. Not so much anymore, could be in part to that they have temporary housing so it seems people move often or are just getting tossed alot. I just feel like im not getting any bang for my buck, nothing special, nothing over the top. There seems to be more animals then people here and yes theres poop. I cant let little kids out to play for fear of crappy grass. It could be so much more. We are headed out after lease is up.
