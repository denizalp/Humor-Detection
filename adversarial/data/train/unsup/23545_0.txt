Yummi Banh Mi delivers! I'm a Yummi Bahn Mi fan! I'm a banh mi fan in general. I make banh mi at home. I eat banh mi whenever I see it.\n\nI couldn't find a reason to knock off a star if I tried. The flavors are great, the portions are abundant and the freshness make for a clean and tasty bahn mi. \n\nI've only had their BBQ pork and lemongrass pork on my several visits...so that's all I can really review. Every time I've had them...I wished they were something I could eat daily. The service is quick and friendly...and the prices rival other food trucks.\n\nTry: bringing a friend\n\nAvoid: missing out on this great food truck
