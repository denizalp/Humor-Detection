Great place to eat! Like most reviews here, its like a Subway (but better) and your food gets rolled in a pita (white or wheat). Try the Dagwood Pita (Black Forrest Ham, Turkey and Prime Rib) its a-m-a-z-i-n-g. I have tried quite a few different pitas from this place and none of them disappoint.....every pita is great.\nThe restaurant is always clean, staff friendly, and I have yet to wait more than 1-2 minutes to place\/pay for my order (they are fast!).\nIf I had one gripe.....and its minor.....the pitas are maybe $1 more than they should be. If they lowered their prices $1 across the board, I bet they would get more business.
