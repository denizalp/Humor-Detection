There are quite a few landmarks in Las Vegas, but few are as famous as this half-scale replica of the Paris Eiffel Tower. Great for photos from the ground but also great for photos from the air. There's just something about being 460 feet up in the air and looking down on the lights of the Strip!\n\nSurprisingly inexpensive at only $19 for adults in the evening hours. I've heard that there are discount tickets available, but it didn't occur to me to look until after.\n\nVery very cool and well worth it!
