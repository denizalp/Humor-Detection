I don't have to wait long. It's a great place to park, good deal, the free water. The only thing that I don't like was that one of their drivers felt entitled to a tip. Probably all of them do. I don't like that feeling. One held my bags and looked at both of my outstretched hands, then slowly gave my bags back and said sarcastically: \"Thank you, very much appreciated.\" :\/
