My first car wash didn't go so well.  The general manager, Mike had me come back for a complimentary wash. They did a much better job but they do need to spray and wipe the windshield since there was a dead bug left again. I will continue to come here with my new car to avoid scratches that you get from Cobblestone!\n\nWe had lunch at the newly remodeled cafe today and it was busy! Food was great. Brenda, manager quickly replaced my bbq sandwich bun that came out soggy.
