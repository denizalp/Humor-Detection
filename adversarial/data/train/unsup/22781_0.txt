Old City Soda, how do I love thee, let me count the ways... can I give 6 stars?\n\nI'm not sure how we ever got along before Old City Soda. When you walk into this cocktail bar and modern soda shop, you're hooked. The d√©cor is totally spacious, super inviting and really chic. It's going to be a fast neighborhood staple. I can tell. I already want to bring all of my friends and come back for drinks. If you have little ones, then I'm sure you'll adore this place, too. It's really hard to be a place this generationally welcoming but still so hip and cool.\n\nWhat I adore about Old City Libations is that if you're hanging with friends but don't want to drink, your friends can have a kick-ass creative cocktail and you can have a delicious soda from the tap with no judgment. I freaking love their sodas like Oprah loves giving away cars. The Cinnamon and the Lemon are by far my favorites...all of the sodas have perfectly distinct flavors. Everything is so affordable. So be careful, because that could be deadly. : )\n\nRight now, they have small bites in the form of eccentric pretzels and dips. Per their head pretzel wizard, I tried the maple bacon pretzels with raspberry gourmet dipping sauce. It completely worked. Oh, and the staff RULES. These are some of the nicest people I've ever met. They care about your experience there, and it shows. As I'm typing this, I'm daydreaming about that Cinnamon soda. I may have to go back soon and grab a 6-pack for my fridge...
