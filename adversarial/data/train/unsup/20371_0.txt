I will say that the decor of the restaurant and the patio is adorable, but the food left me with a lot to be desired. I ordered the Hawaiian breakfast with kahlua pig and rice and hubby ordered the breakfast quesadilla. Hubby liked his food but I didn't think mine tasted that great and it tasted really sweet like they added maple syrup or something. I just couldn't eat it all so I asked for a box but never ate the leftovers. Prices were above average. For two entrees, we spent over $25. I'm not sure I will be back.
