Like Paulius N., I never really put much thought into getting to the Taphouse. I've been ignoring it and I'm not sure why. I'd like to be there again though, like right now. \n\nAn impressive place on ALL levels. \n\nThey have a ridiculous assortment of craft brews on tap. As a beer lover, I was very excited and wanted to slap myself for overlooking this place for so long. \n\nI stopped in yesterday morning with some friends. Originally, I was only here for some Bloody Mary's but since Ohio has antiquated liquor laws (no liquor until 11 am)  we opted for the beer. I shared some biscuits and gravy with mah girl Louise. Wow, quite delicious. I loved the fried egg on top and thought it really added to the dish. The rest of the brunch offerings looked amazing. I'm going to have to come back ASAP for that breakfast pizza. \n\nFoolishly, I didn't look at the dinner menu but I hear it's also noteworthy. \n\nService was super friendly, attentive, and fast. \n\nAmbiance? One of the coolest looking places around. Exposed brick and a solid concrete bar -- kickass really. \n\nSo for the third time, I'll mention that I cannot WAIT to return.
