Majesteas has a unique look and good vibe that my husband and I love, ever since we discovered it a few years ago. It's tastefully put together, and for a small space it doesn't feel cramped nor cluttered. The owners and staff are always friendly and attentive, and happy to share their knowledge about teas. We have tried about a dozen of their teas and blends, and they have all been great. Our favourites are the Iron Goddess, Nilgiri, Rooibos Provence, and Goji Goodness, so far.
