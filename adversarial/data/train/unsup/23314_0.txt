You would NEVER guess how big this place is from the small storefront space.  My foodie Italian brother-in-law is a fan so we had to try it out.  Unfortunately our ordering was limited to a happy hour menu as we arrived too early for dinner (heads up on that).  Its a nice place, again unexpected for the space.  I really liked the slow roasted pork belly and the boneless short ribs - not a fan of the \"kitchen board\". We will be back for a full meal in the near future.
