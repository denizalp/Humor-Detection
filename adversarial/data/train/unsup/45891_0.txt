I am always on the lookout for new Mexican spots to try out as it's my favorite cuisine.  Had visitors in town and so we decided to give it a try.  We arrived at 5 on a Friday and we just beat the rush.  After ordering a happy hour margarita at the bar we were seated.  Many people arrived after us and you could tell there was a long wait.  \nChips and salsa were great.  A nice little kick to the salsa.  The menu is really nice but a little confusing the way they have it put together-I kept missing items!  I'd think I knew what I wanted to order and then bam, an item I'd somehow not seen would pop up and I'd want to change.  I ended up with the Tomatillo Enchiladas which were delicious.  Everyone in our party of 7 were quite pleased!  We had just received our bill when the mariachi band showed up.  They found a spot right next to our table and we were able to enjoy a couple songs which the kids LOVED.  \nAlso you can take home their amazing and fresh tortillas for a decent price.  I'm going to remember that little factoid!\nWe are very pleased we tried this location-the music, fun decor and ambiance added to our night and we will definitely return.
