I did not stay at this hotel, but I will give them props for one thing...close access to cheap food and drinks.  This place houses the just okay, extremely skinny, foot long hot dogs.  They also have 2 flavors (lime & strawberry) of $1 frozen margaritas.  I heard the bartender say that they had bottle necks for $1 as well.  Considering that I don't drink, none of the sipping options were for me, but I appreciate having cheap eats from an establishment.  Also a Ben & Jerry's that had 2 for 1 cone coupons flooding the strip, along with a huge assortment of cheap souvenirs shirts, hats and more.
