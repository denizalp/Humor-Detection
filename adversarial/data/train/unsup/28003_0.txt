Don't use this business on busy dates. \n\nI ordered flowers for Valentines to my girlfriend's workplace. Even though they claimed delivery was guaranteed at business hours they intentionally delivered the flowers after 8pm to the neighbour's address. I had to just tell my girlfriend I ordered flowers. The flowers never showed up and I was charged full rate for them. No refund was offered even though I asked for it, instead they offered to resend flowers after I complained several times. \n\nThis business clearly can't cope with orders on time sensitive dates, even though they guarantee their delivery times. \n\nI ended up paying close to $100 for nothing.
