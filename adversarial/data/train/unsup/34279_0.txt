We dropped in for a late night (10pm) dinner on a Monday and really enjoyed Red8. Dumplings and spring rolls were good. The Singapore noodles and Mongolian beef were excellent. As with all Wynn restaurants, there is a good if not great wine list. The decor was real nice with some tables looking out to the casino floor.\n\nTip: The corner 6 top has a $300 minimum.
