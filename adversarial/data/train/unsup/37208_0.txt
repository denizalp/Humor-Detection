On our last trip out to Vegas we stopped by Guy Fieri's which is at the Quad and we left full & happy! I myself ordered the Drunk Fish Tacos wich were so good I never wanted it to end, I shared them with my man and he approved wholeheartedly. The tilapia mixed perfectly with everything and it was just an amazing dish. My man ordered the Fireball Whiskey Wings and said that they were a great balance of spice when you use the blue-sabi sauce. For drinks the winner was the Lemon Drop.... Not! It was delicious, not too strong and the taste was on point although it did pack a kick. I would recommend dining here to anyone hitting the strip, it was a great experience
