I've been here twice, and I like what I've seen.\n\nGood burgers, nice, funny staff, their lounge area is excellent to just sit back, and people watch (not to mention that great fire pit of theirs), live music....  All of that is well and good, but that's not my favorite part.\n\n\"What is it then\", you ask?\n\nDrinks served in coconuts carved to look like monkeys.\n\nFor $12 mere dollars, you can get an amazing coconut carved to look like a monkey.  Not to mention that there are various types of banana liqueur drinks served for said amazing beverage holder.\n\nThe first time I went there, they were sold out, and that made me sad.  Last night?  I was getting that monkey, by gum.\n\nSo in I went, ordered it, and walked out to a surprised patio full of friends and unrelated patrons.\n\n\"I drink out of coconuts now\", I said after a mighty sip of banana booze.  \"Coconuts are cool\".\n\nAnd you even get to take the coconut home, which means that I get to be cool any time I feel like it.  They'll have to pry this drink amazement out of my cold, dead hands before they can take it away from me.\n\nAnd this is why I love the various bars of Fremont Street.
