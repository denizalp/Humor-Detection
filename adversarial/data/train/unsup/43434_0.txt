Jon is amazing. He worked on the areas I was having issues with more extensively than any other masseuse...versus just spending a little time on all of them through a full body massage. My jaw was bothering me, my neck and shoulders and he figured out that my IT band was what was causing some athletic issues. His strong pressure was right on - intense, but good!
