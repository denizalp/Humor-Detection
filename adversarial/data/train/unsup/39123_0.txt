Love this place and yea, we are foodies, eating in a non foodie world here. We will try anything, love fancy, love holes in the wall, and like local, local local. Yea, this place isn't anything special on the fancy side or foodie side nor is it a hole in the wall. Just your average brunch\/lunch place in atmosphere and surroundings. Locally franchised. HOWEVER, having tried EVERY, and I swear, EVERY brunch spot in South Charlotte, from the Terrace Cafe's of the world, to Skillet's (now Broken Egg), to New South (next door to Le Peep), to Vine American Kitchen, 131 Main, Flying Biscuit, Big View (YUCK!) etc. etc. etc. this one actually has the highest rating for us next to Terrace Cafe. The skillets are yummo, our eggs are always perfectly cooked as ordered, the kids menu sufficient and pleasing with coloring and games to boot, and the service is ALWAYS good. They are consistent, have a very large and diverse menu, something for everyone. The crab cake benedict is a tad heavy on the breadcrumbs and less on the crab side but hey, this isn't your froo froo brunch spot, so have realistic expectations when you go and order accordingly. My other half got the corned beef hash skillet on his first visit here with us and blurted out \"FINALLY\"! He had finally found a spot in South Charlotte with the salty NJ diner type hash he had been seeking, not fried potatoes some places actually call \"hash\". This is a favorite spot of ours, make it one of yours too!
