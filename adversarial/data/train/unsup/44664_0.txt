The place is what you expect on the inside for design.  A Cave Creek version of fake rustic.  The service was a 5 out of 10 because she was slow and didn't know the menu items.  Philly cheesesteack was tiny and didn't have a lot of meat or cheese.  All of the serving sizes were very small considering the lunch pricing.  With all of the other great options in that part of the city, they will never see me again and I don't recommend that you waste your time or money there.
