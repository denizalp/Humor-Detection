***UPDATE REVIEW***\n\nSo after all the fiasco of having a bad taste in my mouth (like drinking a glass of CLR - which I've never done actually nor do I recommend trying) about PH Towers Westgate, I have turned over a new leaf about them.\n\nI ended up speaking with the Resort Manager and as advised I would be compensated some way on my next trip there. Well, they definitely kept to their word. As I was greeted by the Resort Manager himself and they upgraded my reservations to the PENTHOUSE SUITE!!! The Penthouse is amazing and perfect for large groups(even though I was only by myself for a work trip). \n\nI was truly pleased to see the Resort Manager kept to his word and provided excellent customer service retention as well as professionalism, in which I can respect. \n\nWith this turn around experience, I would like to highly recommend this hotel for their location, price, and value. Although the front desk employees are a hit or miss (some are really great and some should probably be working at McDonalds)
