Joey's is a good place to hang-out for drinks and have overpriced meals.\n\nThe patio upstairs is perfect in the summer! There are lots of seatings, and the place could get crazy busy during peak lunch hours.\n\nEven if you come during busy hours, service level doesn't change, servers are always friendly, and food's always been consistent.\n\nI love their lobster grilled cheese. It's the food I always get! \n\nUnfortunately they no longer sell Blueberry Mojitos :(\n\nReview 70 of 100
