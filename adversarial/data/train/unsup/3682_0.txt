My new favourite local brewery (shhh, don't tell the others)!\n\nI've heard that the brewery is having their soft launch this Friday, but they've been open for a few weeks now. If you have trouble finding it you're not alone - look for the teal roof on the building at the end of the street heading away from Inglewood and you can't go wrong.\n\nWe headed here on a Friday evening and there were NINE beers on tap. You can get a flight of 4 x 5oz beers for $6 and then once you know what you like, get a 12oz 'pantleg' (get it?!) for $3.50 or a 18oz pint for $5. Which is probably the best deal in town. Plus once you've picked your favourite(s) then growlers are only $6 (32oz, refill) or $12 (64oz, refill).\n\nMore importantly, the staff here are super lovely and excited about their beer. Plans for food are in the works but for now there's just some packets of chips for $1 so eat before you go so you won't have to leave!
