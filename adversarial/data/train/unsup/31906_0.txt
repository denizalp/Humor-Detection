Dinner: I had the \"meat & 2\" which comes with a daily meat special or chefs choice. Special was pot roast, with good seasoning and it was very tender. My side picks were squash casserole and Brussel slaw (like southern coleslaw but less tangy and a little drier; uses Brussels sprouts instead of cabbage). The Brussel slaw was nice to try, made well and something creative on the menu but not sure I'll crave it. Squash was very good - creamy but not so much that you lose the veggies in the cheese and breading. I would get that again. My fianc√© had the pulled BBQ chicken sandwich with Brussel slaw and a side salad. Side salad is a generous portion. I tried a bite of her sandwich and it was pretty good. I would probably venture other places in Charlotte for BBQ but this isn't a bad sandwich. She requested extra BBQ sauce and that seemed to enhance the flavor a little bit. Drink selection was good and you can't go wrong with the oatmeal creme pies for dessert! One is big enough to share unless you are planning to fill up on dessert. \nService was great. Easy parking in the garage (attached). Decor\/ambiance in the dining room was nice. We'll be back to eat on the front patio and try the bar area too! The only thing I could find as constructive criticism: the side dining area could have used dimmer lights for evening service.
