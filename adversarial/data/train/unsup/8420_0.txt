This was one of the first places I visited when I moved to Phoenix.  I can't believe I forgot to review them.  This place is beautiful, calming and inspiring.  If you're an artist, bring a sketch book or tablet.  You won't be disappointed.  \n\nFor $5 you can buy some fish food and feed the Koi.  Don't give them that left over french fry you found in your pocket.
