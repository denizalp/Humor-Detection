The wait was long on Wednesday night, we were sitting down looking at empty tables for 10 minutes before we were seated. Total wait time was 20 minutes though.\n\nThe bread they brought to the table was cold and hard and the butter was in individual packages equally cold. The food was good when we got it. I loved the LUAU SALAD. It was so delicious and plentiful. 14.95 is kinda high for a salad but it was worth it.
