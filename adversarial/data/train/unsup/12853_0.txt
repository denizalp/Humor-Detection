Make Em Say Uhh!!! Uhhh!!! Yah, Ya, Yah, Ya!!!  --Master P.\n\nMaster Pizza has probably been around for much longer than the aforementioned No Limit Soldier, but you know what? Master Pizza made me say Yah, not Nah, Na, Nah, Na.\n\nBetter than average pizza dough, flavorful sauce, greasy cheese and quality toppings (ie. thick chunks of bulk sausage w\/ fennel seeds), not the typical unsavory grayish slices.\n\nA 50% off coupon from an entertainment book brought me to Master Pizza recently. Located in an unassuming plaza on Mayfield Rd, just across from WalMart, expectations weren't the highest. I've never been here, never heard about it, but decided to give it a shot. And I'm glad I did. \n\nAlthough we didn't eat in, they do have a small dining area. We chose to take the pie home. Sinfully greasy, I was presently surprised at how great this pie was! It's definitely in the running for my top 5 pizza joint's on the East Side list which I'll be compiling shortly.
