Came here twice over the last few years to get my cracked screen repaired on my 6plus. I also recently came here to fix my battery. \nTurn around time was under 2 hours.\nParking is never a problem and the waiting room is available for use if you feel like waiting. \nIt's out of the way for me to come to this part of town but it's worth the drive.\nThank you!
