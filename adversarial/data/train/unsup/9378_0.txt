My first visit to Modern Burger was yesterday, after treating Mom and myself to happy hour at Marcella's next door.  Before we had apps at Marcella's, we checked out MB's menu, and after spying their list of ice cream sandwiches, I knew what I wanted for dessert!\n\nOut of the three ice cream sandwich options (Oatmeal & raisin\/Granny Smith ice cream, Peanut butter\/Chocolate ice cream, and Chocolate chip\/Tahitian vanilla bean), I chose Granny Smith.  I was able to have the MB rep procure a fresher one \"from the bin\" in the restaurant (for all I know, he just paused for a moment and turned around!).  Whatever.  All I know is that the 2nd ice cream sandwich didn't look as old and compacted as the one he initially offered to me.  The sandwich was so tasty!  Not too sweet, and it was certainly refreshing on a warm, Phoenix spring day!  I liked it so much, I stopped by tonight, two minutes past 6p (MB's closing time), to get another.  (Truthfully, I'd wanted to try their sliders, as well, but it was too late to order those, but ice cream sandwiches she could sell me, the rep said.)  And so I bought.
