My second visit to Kaka definitely made up for the unfortunate dining experience I had during my first visit. service this time around was MUCH better, some orders took a while to come out but nothing atrocious like the first time. My favourite was probably Chef Frank's roll... and the desserts were extremely tasty, especially the green tea creme brulee and the dark chocolate custard-- make sure to leave some room for dessert!
