Wow. I ate so much I think I exploded right after I was finished. We had a 7 or 8 or 9 or 10 course meal prepared for us by the chef which included special ribs, a massive sushi platter, some pork belly sandwich things, killer hand rolls, and many other dishes that were just spectacular. \n\nThe decor in here is great and the set up is high end for sure. Make sure you bring your wallet filled with cash because this is not your typical run of the mill sushi joint.  However if you want impress a hot date or splurge a little bit I would recommend coming here.\n\nThe servers were great and were extremely attentive to us. They did not forget a thing and also laughed at all our jokes which is always a big bonus in my books!
