My family's go to restaurant in the city for a quick bite to eat is Boston Pizza. This one is the one we generally avoid if we're in a rush. It's hit and miss, as it is with most chains in the city but this one seems to miss more than others. Service can either be lightning fast or you can be sitting around for 20 minutes waiting for a bill. It's 50\/50. \n\nFood is the same as every other location. Nothing fancy. Never had an issue with the food though, it  just can take forever to get there. \n\nMy biggest beef is the unprofessional hostesses that they have. Last time I was there, we were waiting for a table to clear and a group of young teens walked in looking for a table. The table was cleared, and although we had been waiting 10 minutes as opposed to their 2, they got seated first. When we asked the hostess why, she said \"but like... they're the waiters friend! we need to sit them first\" and we walked out to the Vietnamese place a few doors down. We called the manager to talk to them about this, but never got a response. \n\nHaven't been back. I guess that was our final straw with this location. We used to go eat there before seeing a movie at west hills, but I think we'll be sticking with the moxies by the movie theater from now on.
