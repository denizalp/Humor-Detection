There are some burgers that focus on the best possible meat. There are others that focus on having a great bun, or interesting ingredients. Some places, like Relish, seem to understand how important balance is, and really push to make sure it's a perfect bite. The pastrami burger was the one I chose and was not disappointed.The meat was a nice, juicy and when combined with the fresh toppings it made for surprisingly light taste. The service was friendly and the menu was simple. It looks and feels like a small town dinner. If your feeling like leaving the diet behind Lenny's is the place. Burger up.
