Who ever wrote the comment that said these people were Gansters......  Please move out of my state.  These are business people and their culture is a very big part of the desert southwest.  Thanks to all the staff at this place as you are VERY NICE FOLKS. I will return to buy your carne, salsa, guacamole, and what ever else you offer. Its businesses like this that make Arizona a great place to live!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nThank You!!!!!!!!
