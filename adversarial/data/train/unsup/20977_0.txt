I used to come to this place every other week. Loved it! They finally convinced me to upgrade to gel manicures. They explained the benefits and such.. sounded awesome. \n\nLet's just say the gel mani didn't live up to the hype. When I went to get the polish removed, they filed my nails down rather than soaking them. My nails have been brittle and weak for about a month. Lots of chipping, peeling and breaking.\n\nThey also claim to fix gel manis if you get any chipping within the first week. Their idea of fixing is filing the chip off.\n\nI am kind of afraid to come back here. Sad, because this was my go to spot.
