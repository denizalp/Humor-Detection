Here is a list of things I love about Morcilla:\n\n1. The food. This is a good thing to love at a restaurant. Morcilla offers some of my favorite things, including beautiful beets, exceptional ribs, perfectly cooked seafood, and all the charcuterie including spreadable salami and a surprise star, the Cecina. This cured beef upstaged a lot of the pork (as we all know, the finest meat to cure) with it's roasted pepper conserva. Plus it all looks damn good, in addition to being tasty.\n\n2. The bar program. I could drink the Piel de Sapo for the rest of my life, and the other cocktails I tried were nearly as good. Toss in some great sangria, the best sherry selection I may have ever seen, and the awesome and insane cider pour thingy (technical term) happening at the front of the bar, and there's nothing not to love.\n\n3. The service. We almost always sit at the bar, and there's very few places where that's a better call. The bartenders know their biz, make great recommendations, and are just generally pleasant people to be around.\n\nThat's it. That's all you need to get me in here.
