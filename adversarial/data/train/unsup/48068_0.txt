This charming flower shop is perfect! I showed the owner a picture of some floral arrangements I'd seen and wanted for my event- she superseded my expectations. Not only were the arrangements lovely, the customer service was excellent and the prices were reasonable. Beautiful flowers and service...I'd highly recommend this shop to anyone to suit their floral needs.
