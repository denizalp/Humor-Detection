Oh what a night!\n\nWe rolled out of \"KA\" at the MGM, and began walking the restaurants to see which menu spoke to us. My girlfriend and I decided that a lobster pot pie from Michael Mina was a MUST.\n\nThe hostess informed us that the restaurant was full, but we could sit in the bar with dinner service. This was really our lucky night... as that's where the coolest bartender (Tim) is stationed!\n\nWe nabbed the best table, where we were able to see the action in the bar, as well as watch the bustle of the casino. SWEET! Fortunately, our dinner matched our view.\n\nAppetizer:\n\n- Charcuterie tasting plate for 2: an Atkins designed plate of tasty meats, mustard and tiny addicting pickles. There were also the most heavenly pieces of toasted warm bread to use... which were out of this world.\n\nDinner:\n\n- Maine Lobster Pot Pie: This is the show stopper people! I wasn't sure what to expect, but when they wheeled out the \"Shrek-sized\" pot, I almost fell off my chair! This is almost a deconstructed pot pie, as they slice off the top, lay it on the plate then pile the ingredients on top. The lobster tail is in the shell, sliced into pieces. They artfully reassemble it on the plate with the tasty veggies. Worth every penny of the $90.00 price tag. It was practically the meal AND the entertainment!\n\n- Bacon Wrapped Scallops: cooked to perfection, and delish. The apple strings on top make the dish. They held their own to the lobster, but just weren't as cool on the presentation.\n\nAnd if all of this sweet chow wasn't enough? Our prince of a bartender was making himself busy, bringing us his recommended concoctions. Their signature \"Cable Car\" martini was one the the best cocktails I've ever experienced. Seriously, it had carmelized sugar around the ring!!\n\nIf you're at the MGM, don't skip this dining experience. And do skip the fussy dining room in favor of the tall bar table, to the left of the entrance overlooking the casino.
