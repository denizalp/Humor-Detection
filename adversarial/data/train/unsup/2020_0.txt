Formerly Known as Belz Outlet Mall, The Premium Outlets-South is what I Consider to be A Major Tourist Hotspot for Shopping...\n\nSince the Name Change, they have Added a lot more Shops..and I believe there are 3 Food Courts! \n\nJust a Word of Caution, Beware of those Center Kiosks that Try to lure You into Buying those Deep Sea Lotions, the Compact Steamer, or that Purple Jewelry Cleaner ( which does work, lol). They will Do Anything to Make you stop and buy something from them! \n\nParking can be a Huge Problem, but with some Patience...You can find one!  \nAnd, if You don't like what they have in their Food Court, across the Parking Lots are a Bevy of Eateries like Panda Express, Raising Cane's, Five Brother's Burgers & Fries, IHOP! \n\nYou Will Love what this Mall has to Offer...I Never got Disappointed whenever I go there!!\n\nDefinite Must for Locals & Tourists Alike! :)
