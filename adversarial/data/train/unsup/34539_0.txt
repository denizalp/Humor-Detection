This airline needs to be shutdown\/ under new management. Their infrastructure, including their plane hardware, plane software, and customer services is in severe need of an upgrade. I had a domestic flight from Las Vegas to Oakland that had a scheduled departure of 2:20 pm. Now delays are often commonplace in an airport due to a multitude of reasons, but this was something else. Due to an error with the lighting in the cabin, we were forced to offboard the plane TWICE before the crew determined that there was no option but to obtain another flight. This flight was scheduled to take off at 6:30... FOUR HOURS after our plane was supposed to have taken off. No reimbursements were made whatsoever, only promises that the next flight will work as expected. I want my money and time back. \n\nYou truly do get what you pay for... Allegiant ropes you into buying their tickets by advertising low prices, and then surprises you with required charges for seats, any luggage you want to bring thats larger than a backpack, and the usual airline add-on insurance scams. \n\nI am NEVER flying allegiant again.
