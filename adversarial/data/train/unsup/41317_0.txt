The atmosphere here is relaxed, people are smiling, charming local art hanging on the walls and decent amount of sitting space inside. It has big freaking windows for the natural light. In the summer you can go in the back and sit under the trees, near the garden. The parents can bring their kiddies as there is a playroom inside. In the summer months the kids can play in the open space in the back.\n\nThe people working here are friendly and professionals. They try new recipes regularly. Vegan every Tuesdays is delicious. \n\nI tried the chicken burrito with the pumpkin soup, the last time, which was the special of the day. The meal was lovely and filling and I am sure I had a smile on my face while I devoured it.\n\nHighly recommended anytime.
