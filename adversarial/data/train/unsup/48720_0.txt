Being my first visit to any restaurant in Lachine this was my daughter's choice as it was close by to her new home.  We opted to sit inside as we did not want to be bothered by bugs outside - however many patrons seemed happy to sit in the sun.  This is a simple, casual spot for basic Italian food.  We were promptly seated at a nice table and offered a complimentary bruchetta on toast.  The house red wine was tasty and went well with our pasta dishes.  I ordered the manicotti which was pretty good but found the tomato sauce to be a bit runny.  The crusty rolls were tasty but the butter was frozen and not allowed to soften before serving.   Desserts were good.  Service throughout was attentive.  Also, the bathroom was nice and clean.  Pasta Andrea was o.k. and I will probably visit again if in the area but will try some other establishments first.
