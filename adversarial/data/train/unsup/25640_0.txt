This is by far the worst tims I've ever been to. The cashier took over 5 minutes to figure out how to add cheddar cheese and bacon to an order. Then I waited for 10 minutes for an item, with 2 employees right in front of me who wouldn't ask if I was still missing anything. Worst customer service. \n\nAlso the bathroom was disgusting. Skipping this tims next time!
