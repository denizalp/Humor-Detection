Sometimes you wander around on Yelp and you stumble across hidden gems in your own neighborhood, this is the case with me and Pho MaiLan.  If not for Yelp, I would never know about it even though it's just half a block from my favorite Trader Joe's.\n\nI see a lot of potential in Pho MaiLan, mostly due of their Bun Bo Hue, the Vietnamese spicy beef noodle soup, the less known cousin of Pho but definitely the more fitting noodle soup for cold weather.  It's made with a richer beef broth with a subtle hint of lemongrass flavor, a more hearty rice vermicelli, and filling proteins such as beef shank, pork hock, beef tendon & pork blood.  It's a favorite among Vietnamese but difficult to make well, and thus I haven't had a very good bowl since moving to Vegas from Orange County.  Pho MaiLan's version is very tasty without being too fatty, something that I've rarely found in Vegas.  I'm giving it a three stars only because tonight's bowl was missing a couple of things to be authentic: there was no pork blood; also, banana blossom and shredded cabbage should be served as the accompanying veggies but they ran out of banana blossom this evening.  \n\nMy fiance had Pho, it was good, not the best Pho broth in Vegas but it had a good amount of meat and the beef's quality was very good.  We also had egg rolls for appetizers.  The egg rolls were good; however, I was disappointed because I read from Yelp that the restaurant had Banh Beo (floating rice cakes with shrimp) but they also ran out of that tonight.  \n\nOn a positive note, the service is great, the waitresses were very friendly and attentive.  The restaurant's atmosphere is cheery and clean (all the sauce bottles seem to be filled and cleaned often).\n\nThe Bun Bo is still the best one in Vegas so far for me, but I'm looking forward to a more complete version next time.
