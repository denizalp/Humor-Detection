I've stayed on the strip and downtown. The Platinum is by far, the best deal. You're not that far off the strip but what you get for the money is well worth being a few blocks off the strip. \n\nThe rooms are gorgeous and have a nice full sized kitchen, with a living room and a bedroom. Very, very nice.\n\nAnd we didn't hear anyone else. No all night parties like you hear at the strip hotels. It was magnificent.\n\nThere are two convenience stores next door for getting groceries and such. That was nice.\n\nOnly downside is, you can't get a cab REALLY quick. It takes anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes for one to come after the staff starts the process of getting you one. But there's never a line to get them, either. Ha! It was a small price to pay for having an affordable and REALLY nice place to stay while in Vegas.
