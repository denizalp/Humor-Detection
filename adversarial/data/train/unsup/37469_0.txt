Pluses:  Service, priced well for what they are attempting (attempting being the key word) clean, fun atmosphere.\n\nMinuses: I had the burger with A1.  It was smothered in A1 overpowering.  Made the bun super soggy.  Burgers are well done,  no other option.  Only American cheese no other cheese choice.  Really?  Fries were unevenly cooked.  Some were still white others crispy-very inconsistent.
