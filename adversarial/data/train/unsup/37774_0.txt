Noting special. Good but I wouldn't say great. I went around lunch time and there was no line and the food came out fairly fast. Servers were nice. I feel like for the size of this place they could use more restrooms. I wanted to wash my hands before eating and there's only 2 private restrooms both occupied so there was a bit of a wait just to use the sink. I ordered the #2 fish taco with the cabbage on top, carne asada enchilada, brown rice, and black beans.  The enchilada has an option of a spicy sauce  on top and they are not joking when they say spicy! It had a good little kick to it. I heard a lot of great things about this place from a few people  and I was finally in the area to check it out. Food was good but I was expecting it to be a little more tasty for all the hype. I wouldn't go out of my way to go back there but If I'm in the area and in the mood I'll probably check it out again.
