Tiny place, with only 8-10 tables, but service is friendly and the food is good.  Tried both the savory and sweet crepes and wasn't disappointed.  They make their crepes a little thicker then I'm usually used to, but with the sweet crepes, they roll them up and drizzle lots of nutella (if that strikes your fancy), on them and are tasty.  But I think the savory turkey crepe was my favorite.  It was flavorful, not crazy big, but satisfying and yummy.
