What can one say about this atrocious airport? It's perhaps the most backward in the entire nation. It's like a big city airport that has been put through the dryer and shrunk. Everything is so small and narrow. The ticket counters, security area, concourses, walkways, bathrooms. Everything is on a tiny itty bitty scale. There is barely any room for people to move around with their carryons. At one point, there was a line of people waiting to pass down the isle around the concessions because a kiosk jetted out leaving only enough room for one person at a time to pass. It was a joke. The bathrooms each have only 2 urinals and 2 stalls a piece. I realize the airport isn't the busiest, but it's busy enough it warrants a larger facility. I also found signs for gates to be lacking. I had to call the airline to find out where my gate was. I found no one working at the gates anywhere and there were no signs. And if your flight is delayed due to mechanical or weather issues, you will find few concessions--other than tiny kiosks--to patronize.\n\nBut perhaps what warrants Cleveland's one-star rating more than anything, is the utter horrible rude employees. One doesn't get that kind of sick treatment even on the east coast. Each TSA agent is at least 300 lbs, and none of them make any eye contact so it's difficult to figure out who they are talking to, then they get extremely impatient and angry if you do not follow their alleged orders. What a complete joke of an airport.
