The food here is not bad but the service is HORRIBLE.  The lady behind the counter was rude beyond rude, she was yelling at people and not listening to anything anyone was saying.  The people in front of us asked for a specific item and she totally ignored her.  Then came our turn and I ordered a chicken bowl with no rice but I got rice anyway.  We wanted a side of chicken curry to go and she kept insisting on giving me a combo plate.\n\nI finally had to raise my voice and tell her very sternly I ONLY WANT A SIDE, NO COMB.  She was very annoyed.\n\nThis is the rudest service I've ever had and unfortunately it does not look like management reads reviews as I've not seen any responses to other reviews so nothing will change here.\n\nI do not recommend this place unless you have patience to deal with them because you will not be treated respectfully here.  I wish you the best of you choose to go here.
