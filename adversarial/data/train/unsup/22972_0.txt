It's probably needless to write a review for 4 star Jjanga. The large crowd last night entices me to limit any further exposure, but having eaten my body weight in sushi over multiple visits, I have to throw my 2 chopsticks in.\nBest service of any sushi restaurant in town! The hosts and staff go out of their way to accommodate with a smile and great attitude. There is a sushi section and teppanyaki\/hibachi section.\nAtmosphere: High Energy club-like vibe\nALL YOU CAN EAT. This is the only way we do sushi...why limit yourself to a la carte when you can unlock the entire menu for $25.95 (dinner 3pm-2am) or $20.95 (lunch 11:30-3pm)\nGet a carafe of GRAPEFRUIT INFUSED SAKE to share, you might even want 2. Refreshing, cold with citrus accents and the perfect way to start your night or compliment your sushi.\nSushi: our friend said it best when describing the freshness...\"I know it's fresh when you can't tell the kind of fish, it just melts in your mouth.\" That is how good Jjanga's sushi is.\nFAVORITES: Something Special: calamari tempura, crab wrapped in cucumber topped with eel sauce. Light and doesn't fill you up with rice.\nAsk for RAYU sauce...sesame, chili infused oil...dip everything in it...especially the Garlic Tuna. You're welcome.\nThe Cheese Croquettes are a must try. Crispy warm fried cheese topped with a creamy sauce. Don't knock it til you try it...it surprised us.\nSomething Wrong 69: A roll where one side starts with salmon and ends on tuna with shrimp tempura on both ends.\nDid I mention the RAYU sauce? Love that stuff.\nOysters: fresh and perfect for shooting. (Limit one per AYCE guest)\nScreaming Orgasm: delicious but needed more sauce. (Limit one per AYCE guest)\nBulgogi : this is the only sushi place that I know who has sizzling Bulgogi on a fajita plate...awesome!\nTo finish your meal, you have to leave room for the Chocolate Malted Crunch Ice Cream. They freakin have Thrifty's ice cream for dessert!\nThis is now our sushi place. I'd appreciate it if you didn't come here on Saturday nights :)
