Fresh & tasty!\n\nI've passed by this place far too many times so I decided to finally try it & glad I did. You walk in & it was great to see a grandpa figure sitting down & watching over the operation. He was a very cute old Jewish man and had a kind smile which already made me like this place. I also have to say right away it was spotless. Exceptionally clean & everything was in place. \nI decided to order a chicken kabab which came in a very delicious soft pita, filled with moist chicken, houmos, tomatoes, cucumbers, cabbage and tahini sauce. It was fresh and very filling. It is on the pricier side for a pita sandwich but in all honestly you can taste the quality items so I would definitely come back. \nIt's a very casual environment with good service and fresh food. Simple & tasty!
