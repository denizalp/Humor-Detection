We found this place not busy at 6:30 on a Friday evening so good for us to get a seat but one wonders their busy time - maybe later for drinking. \n\nThe guacamole appetizer was the best part of the meal as the fish tacos below par.  \n\nThere is no pretense here about being upscale.  It seems set up to be a neighborhood bar mainly for drinking with the food to have something to do between drinks.
