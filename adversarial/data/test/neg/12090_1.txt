I do not normally drink wine but I wanted to bring my girlfriend to try something new.  Deb was very helpful and suggested that I try a flight as a sampler of different white wines. As she poured each sample she described  them with great detail so I would know what to expect.  It was a pleasant surprise to find that there are some wines that I like.  We actually ended up buying a bottle of the riesling. Thank you Deb for the great service and all of your help with everything.
