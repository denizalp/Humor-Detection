I've been going to Skullz for a couple years now and my stylists is easily one of the best I've ever gone to.  Every time I leave my hair is in awesome shape and has been thinned out the right amount (I have super thick hair).  It never grows back weirdly (like it has after visits to inferior salons).  Also, no one ever pushes product on you; they tell you about what they put in your hair and make recommendations based on your hair type, but you never feel pressure to buy it (like in other salons).  I've bought more products at this salon than any other because they work so well.  I've never regretted buying any product or getting any hair cut here!  \nThe vibe of the place is awesome as well; it's a great layout and there's none of that usual overpowering hair salon chemical smell that you find in other places.
