Friday  we went over to the circus pile mostly to laugh at the fact it is low payment.  Then we seen a sign that said all you can eat prime rib for 10.99.  We thought we would give it a try and this deal starts at 2pm to 2am.  Service was real bad but a few slabs of great beef later the slow service did'nt matter.  A great meal for under 15 dollars in vegas.
