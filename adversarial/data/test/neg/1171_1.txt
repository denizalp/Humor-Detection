This location is absolutely terrible. My boyfriend and I went on a Wednesday afternoon and we still had to wait about an hour for a table. The food was a complete disappointment.  Our server was the nicest part of the entire experience. Overall, I do not recommend it. I suggest going to maggianos instead.
