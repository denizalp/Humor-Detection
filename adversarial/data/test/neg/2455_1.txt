I'm from the East coast, we have a ton of places here that try so very hard to be In-N-Out and just don't do the job.  This isn't my first time at one, but it definitely has been a while.\n\nThis location is in the Linq Promenade.  It's terribly busy.  That's why I gave it 3 Stars.  Just sheer busyness makes it a bit annoying.  The food as always is top notch.  The burgers are delicious and the fries are as always very good.\n\nGetting a seat is a bit of a chore.  Also, once you order, however long it took you to get to the register, double that time waiting for your food.  It is what it is, but honestly it's a good bargain for the Strip and a tasty meal.
