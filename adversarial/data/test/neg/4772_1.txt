A cute ice cream shop by Yonge and Wellesley. It's pretty similar to Cool N2, but I prefer the flavours at this place over N2 'cause it's a little more unique. \n\nIt has a small eating area (can fit around 10 people?) and a pretty wall decorated with flowers and a swing chair (definitely the highlight for me lol). \n\nThe ice cream was smooth, creamy, and flavourful! It wasn't too sweet either so that's a plus. I ordered Black Rice which tasted just like the Chinese Glutinous  (did I spell that wrong? I think I did..) Rice dessert and my friend ordered tiramisu, which I found a bit too strong to my liking. \n\nAfter tax it came to $7 which I found quite expensive and there wasn't really anything special about it either, besides being instagrammable. Service was just meh. \n\nI don't think I'll be back in the future unless they create an interesting flavour that I'd really want to try though lol.
