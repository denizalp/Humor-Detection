We took our pooch here for a week long boarding after getting a bad vibe at the place we usually go. It was all pretty last minute, they were able to get his evaluation in on the weekend before we leave and book him for boarding during the Labor Day weekend coming up with out problem.\nThe place looks a bit old and run down and is in a shady part of town but the back is well fenced and they have cameras everywhere.\nWell the camera part didn't work to our advantage as well as we had hoped, it was very hard to find our dog most of the time. Especially at night, we have no idea where or how he slept. We even called to ask which room he's sleeping in and they couldn't tell me because sometimes it changes. So our vacation wasn't as relaxing as we had hoped, we worried about him a lot.\nTheir hours are also difficult for us, we had a hard time arranging our drop off and pick up times, we did it but not to our liking.\nWhen we did pick him up he seemed okay, but he wasn't as happy as when we pick him up from our other care facility. After getting him home we noticed a long scrape on our dogs nose, they never said anything to us about it. It's healed now. His haircut we requested wasn't as short as we would've liked but other than that looked good. A few hours later we also realized that our dog had gone hoarse, I would assume from barking. This has never happened to him before or since, it took a good 2 weeks for it to come back completely.\nThe staff was friendly and appeared caring and enjoyed what they do. If I was in a pinch again I'd probably take him back, but otherwise I doubt we'll use Just Like Home on a regular basis.
