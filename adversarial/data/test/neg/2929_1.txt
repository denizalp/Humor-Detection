I recommend users avoid using Executive Moving and Storage at all costs. This was a terrible experience and we are still paying the price. We used this company in April of 2016 to move from California to Maryland. The experience was horrific. \n\nCoordinating the delivery was a disaster. We agreed on an initial time frame which a was required to reserve the elevator in the building. At the last minute they had to delay the delivery because previous clients delivery ran long. The building was unable to accomodate the new time at the last minute. But the moving company and driver was unwilling to change delivery time. They were going to show up regardless of whether or not the building would allow the move in at that time. They argued that they were only late because of other clients and could not delay even further. They were completely unwilling to accomodate me and I ended up having to spend all day finding a solution to accomodate them. \n\nThis company will extort you. They may seem cheap at the initial estimate, but they will add on multiple charges upon delivery. There is no uniformity on what the charges are for or how much. I was told 3 separate prices from multiple employees for the cost of switching from an 18 wheeler to a smaller delivery vehicle due to our narrow streets. The price ranged from $200 to $700. Nobody was in charge and so the final price was told to me when the driver showed up to deliver our items. They refused to unload any of the materials until all of the money was paid in cash. They also refused to show any documentation or contract language explaining how they decided what the fee would be. Furthermore, they threatened to charge an overnight fee if the money was not paid immediately and thus the movers would be able to start unloading. I was unable to get anybody from Executive Moving and Storage offices on the phone to confirm any of this. Similarly, they charged you an additional fee if there is an elevator and if the door is a certain distance away from the truck. All of these fees were also different from what was initially explained to me by the salesperson. But I had to pay what the driver was insisting it was because they were refusing to unload and were not willing to wait for me to get somebody on the phone to confirm. \n\nMost of the items were moved without damage. Though two of the dining table chairs were bent beyond repair. They also took apart all the furniture at delivery but left zero instructions for the new drivers on how to put it all together. They did not put the furniture back together because they claimed they didn't know how to and it would take all night. The leaf of the dining table no longer works because they broke it while taking it apart. \n\nIt is not worth the lower price they quote you. You can't trust them. You will lose money and years off of your life.
