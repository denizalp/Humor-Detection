I walked by this place on the Lakeshore a million times, as I went for falafels next door. A newspaper review had me go into this tiny storefront, and I left with an armload of chocolate. \n\nThe store may be tiny, but it is stocked wall to wall with delicious cocoa treats, (I believe all made fresh on the premises). I picked up a sampling of delicious truffles and a brownie for my wife. On the ride home, the smell of the brownie drove me crazy, inviting me to take a tiny nibble. One thing led to another, and that brownie did not make it home!\n\nApparently their ice cream is delicious too, I haven't tried it yet, but with flavours like \"Brandied fig goat cheese ice cream\" I just may have to this summer.\n\n*UPDATE* They moved down the street to a bigger location, same side, just further East.
