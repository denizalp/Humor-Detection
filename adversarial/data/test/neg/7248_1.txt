Doesn't even deserve one star.  Restaurant is nice enough inside but no amount of ambiance can save the absolutely dismal food. \n\nVeal parmigiana sandwich was so soggy the meat slipped out of the breading on the first bite. Meatballs cold in the centre with almost no sauce. Pizza was bland and boring and the crust is way too thin... Here's a hint guys, when the crust literally shatters when you try to pick up a slice, somethings wrong. \n\nThe service was good but the food tooooooooooooook foooooooorever.  \n\nI want to like this local restaurant, but there are much better options nearby... Don't waste your money.
