Great location... That'st about it! \n\nCentrally located on the strip, great view of the High Roller Wheel and once outside of the hotel great nightlife atmosphere. Very close to Starbucks and a variety of food choices. \n\nThe hotel itself is old! We were up on the 16th floor which only had 1 functioning elevator and we weren't sure it was going to work each time we got on! \nThe carpets in the hallway are filthy, no ventilation in the bathroom. The beds were ok.\nI will say that the housekeeping staff was very friendly and did a great job in cleaning the rooms.\n\nUpon arrival we were informed only one free Wifi code was given which could only be used by one person on the same device for the entire stay. Not to mention the connection was horrible. \nWe had to pay to print out our boarding passes at check-out.
