While my first experience was great, this one left a few things to be desired. I had a pedicure, eyebrow wax and an aromatherapy massage. Instead of using the pedicure chair (with the foot spa jets) they put a plastic bowl with lukewarm water in the basin and told me to soak my feet. The water wasn't even halfway full so it barely covered my feet.  While the woman that did the pedicure was pleasant enough, she didnt turn on the back massager on the chair nor did she inquire about the temperature of the water. \nThe massage was great. The only thing that could have been better was the temperature of the room.  While the table was heated, it was cold whenever she lifted the blanket.
