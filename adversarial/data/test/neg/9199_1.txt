This place is old school and I love it.  Do not change.  The escargot and stone crab were delicious.  The tray they give you with greens, beets, olives, and eggs is a treat in itself.  Had the lamb, Veal saltimbocco  and Veal francese were top notch.  The service was exquisite.  This will be on my list every time I go to Vegas now.
