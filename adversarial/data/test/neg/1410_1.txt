One of my favorite Mexican restaurants! Kind people, fast service and great food. I ask my husband on any occasion (date night or birthdays) to go to Frank and Finas. We went here on our first date 7 years ago. The chicken enchilada Souzas are amazing and so are the crab enchiladas. Highly recommend this place!
