The ice cream here is great, if you like soft serve. The blizzard is a staple and they always have a new variety to try. Believe it or not, they also serve fast food here, like burgers and dogs, which are pretty subpar. Just like how normal fast food places have weak dessert options, DQ has great dessert but weak food options. Stick with the dessert-y stuff and should be fine!
