Actual rating: 3.5\n\nService: friendly, it used to be so much nicer when Russell was there.  He made you feel like family. \n\nPrice: $$- $$$, the prices increased \n\nOrdered: jamb bong\n\nSpecialty: jam bong seafood\n\nQuality of food: good\n\nRevisit: yes\n\nParking: free parking\n     Finding space: easy\n\nCleanliness: okay\n\nOverall: there jam bong is pretty good.  The soup flavor might be a little spicy but has a good kick to it.  The seafood jam bong is much better than the beef jam bong.  Didn't touch the beef at all after one bite I could tell it wasnt good quality.  We always visit this restaurant on every vegas visit which is quite often.  It's a good place to eat. \n\nIt used to be much friendlier when Russell was there but after expanding the restaurant it's never the same service.\n\n\nIf you thought it was helpful, please hit those buttons [helpful, funny, cool or send me a compliment ]  Thank you and happy eating!
