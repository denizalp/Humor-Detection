If I could give less then a star, i would. Let me start out by saying I downloaded this app specifically to write this review. That should be pretty descriptive of my experience at gentle dental( formerly southwest) which I'm also sure they had to change their name, because of the large amount of complaints they receive. They will take your money, and say you need things you don't, and tell you they're doing a courtesy for you. A courtesy? Yes it was very sweet of them to take advantage of a situation. I had a crown done by them, it fell out two months later, and when you call to complain from what another dentist is telling you that's \"their opinion\". IT IS NOT AN OPINION WHEN YOU HAVE HEARD IT FROM TWO OTHER DENTIST. The staff is rude, and vastly unprofessional, the front desk girl in the general dentistry always seems like she has just taken a full bottle of prescription medicine. Her eyes are low and she's incompetent, loosing my paperwork, and having me sit in the waiting room for hours. The location itself is trash, and their patients tend to be people who don't have the money to pay for things they need at a good dentistry so they come here, and get taken advantage of. The main problem is the general dentistry. The orthodontist should really be somewhere else. They are the shinning star of that gross establishment. I was also yelled at by an employee over the phone, and told that I could come in for more work??? Why would I want to get butchered some more? You can see all the other reviews and know that I'm not exaggerating when I say they are the worst dentist in Arizona. They need to be shut down. I hope that the next person who considers going here reads this review, and saves themselves months of headaches.
