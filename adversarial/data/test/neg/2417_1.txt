I'm writing this review in hopes that it motivates the owner to do the right thing. \n\nI had 2 needs. First, get the rollers replaced on our sliding glass door. Second, replace our screen door with something heavy duty with pet proof mesh. \n\nThe first job was taken care of promptly and the tech's were very prompt and pleasant. However this is the end of the positive. When they completed the sliding door job they handed me the invoice which covered the cost of the sliding door repair and 1\/2 down for the new screen door. The tech said it would take two weeks.\n\nSkip ahead, it has been 4 weeks and no phone call. I finally get someone to answer the phone after leaving messages at both #'s on the invoice. The gal says that they'd forgotten to call me to schedule the install. We get it schedule and then the waiting game. First install date was missed, second attempt I have no phone call, I call the office, get  Tony he tells me that the driver got a flat, but has been trying to call me. Somehow, they had the wrong #, as they had no trouble reaching me to come out for the sliding door repair. I tell Tony to reschedule, as I could not wait for the tech. Tech shows up anyhow, as I'm leaving. I wait as he hustles to bring in the door. It does not even fit. He says it will be cut down to fit and he'd be back in 2 days. That is the last time I've heard from anyone. \n\nI've called the company and left 4 messages. I don't even get the courtesy of a return call. We're on to 9 weeks for a simple job that was to take 2 weeks.\n\nI've stated on the message that I want to cancel the order and just refund my down payment. Again, I do not get the courtesy of a return call nor do I get my down payment refunded.\n\nSorry but this is pathetic. Horrible customer service. Theft of keeping my down payment and not delivering on the product\/service that I was promised. \n\nSorry but I cannot give a recommendation for this business, under these circumstances.
