I had lunch on Friday, July 8 2011. They changed the menu. Horrors of horrors.  The salad that was perfect , farmers , was a soggy mess with too much dressing.  The bread, which was perfect,is now a tasteless brown bread. They are re branding to health food, why? Why not french style. Perfect fresh food cooked well? The salad was filled with tiny grains of quoina, if you like to have a million tiny grains stuck in your teeth this is the salad for you. Also, raw green beans.....WTF?\nThe manager was nice but fox is on a downslide. Probably getting ready to go public. Too bad another chain with mediocre food.
