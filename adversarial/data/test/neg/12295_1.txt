Very authentic food with great prices. I had the chilaquiles with green sauce with both meat and fried egg on the side. The meat was thought to my taste but the chilaquiles with green sauce tasty as ever. My fianc√© has the huevos con carne with chorizo which was awesome. The hitch ate that I had was on point and not to sweet.
