This place is now my favorite pizza joint in the area. It was DELICIOUS!!! We got the extra large one topping with 20 wings for 24.99 deal for delivery. Got pepperoni and the wings sloppy. The delivery driver was super nice. The food came hot. I'm super picky about my wings and LOVED their wings. And the pizza was sooooo good. I can't recommend this place enough.
