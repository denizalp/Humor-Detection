Tonight was our first time at La Locanda.  We were able to grab one of their last reservations for Valentine's day.  Location is great.  They are in Old Town where Sugar Shack used to be.\n\nI arrived a few minutes early, but was still seated.  The booth they gave us was very uncomfortable, so I requested a table.  The server had no issues moving us, and the table was substantially better.\n\nDrink service was quick.  I ordered a Vodka and soda.  It was in my hand in 3 minutes.\n\nMy wife started with Lobster Bisque, I had the Power Salad.  Both were fantastic.  We would absolutely order again.\n\nFor our mains, my wife ordered the pumpkin ravioli and I ordered the Black Linguine Frutti di Mar.  The ravioli was a bit sugary for my liking, but the fried sage was a great touch.  My linguine was good, but there was no shrimp and no lobster.  I double checked the menu, it was supposed to be included.\n\nFor dessert, we shared the tiramisu.  It was good, and I'd recommend sharing.  All of the portions are large.\n\nOverall, the service was great. There were just mistakes made in the kitchen.  I'm sure we will give them another try.
