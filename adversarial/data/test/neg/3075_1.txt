Probably the best meal I had during my drunken Memorial Weekend. We wanted to eat at their Buffet, but the line was 1.5hrs long and our flight was sooner.... but we weren't disappointed!\n\nWait was ok for Sunday Brunch. Their prime rib wrap was deeeelicious. Their free bread, also a good filler for you hungover drunks. Their homestyle chicken soup looked very hearty too. Service was attentive, kept my water filled.
