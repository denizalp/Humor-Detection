I wish there was a lower rating than one star. It's 2 days before Christmas and this outfit definitely should be expecting lumps of coal from Santa. Omar the man that made the service call was cordial enough but that is the only nice thing I can write. \n\nI explained my problem about an intermittent issue I'd been experiencing with my  garage opener. I was give a barrage of improbable scenarios as to what the problem was; any where from a new board to a stripped worm screw. Ultimately he wanted to up sell me a new opener with a belt drive. Had I not been just been dealt rash of BS, I probably would have opted for the new opener but after having had my suspicions aroused, I pulled out my phone to compare prices. The cost he quoted for the opener was over double of what I found online. I realize everyone deserves a profit but I felt like they were trying to rob me. I asked to pay for the service charge then and there and told him that I was sorry I called his company.  \n\nI would have preferred to thrown $83 (cost of the service call) to the wind. I'm confident that it would have made better use of my money.\n\nCall Lowes or Home Depot when you have a problem. They don't have repair guys but they do have installers. That is no different than Overhead Door. Just resign yourself to getting a new unit when you have an issue.\n\nMerry Christmas!
