My first impression:  \n\nThe dining area was \"Smallish\"--maybe 25' x 35'--but not cramped due to good table configuration.  They are located in a corner suite so the place is filled with ample natural light during the day.  The restaurant was well decorated, presentable and most importantly--clean.  The server and a man who I think is the owner were light-hearted and personable. \n\nThe hummus was perfect and I believe a touch better than Haji Baba's.  I liked the addition of the tomato garnish rather than Haji's olive with pit.  I'd love to add an heirloom tomato slice to it when they're in season.\n\nI ordered a gyro wrap which I think could be decked out with a few more toppings.  I did however order mine without pickles.  Nevertheless, it was very tasty on account of the melding of the delicious meat with the perfectly warmed and toasted-in-certain-spots pita.  \n\nThe gyro wrap didn't come with any sides.  The gyro plate that my wife ordered did come with a delicious white rice with a light dusting of some red spice or sauce that was delicious.  Next time I'll be getting the gyro plate with a pita so I can load up my own gyro with rice and some hummus.  A little Sriracha sauce would've gone nicely but I didn't want it to get in the way of my first tasting.  I don't know if they have Sriracha available as I didn't ask.\n\nI'll be hitting Sahara up regularly.  I feel like I'm in store for an even better experience once I start delving into the more involved dishes.
