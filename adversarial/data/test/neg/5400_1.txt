Came to Los Cucos to try this new place and really liked it. The grand opening is this Friday and they will have live mariachi.\n\nThe food was really good, loved the handmade tortillas, they were really good. The house salsas are good but I needed an extra kick so they have habanero salsa upon request. I tried the lunch special and was stuffed. I will definitely comeback.
