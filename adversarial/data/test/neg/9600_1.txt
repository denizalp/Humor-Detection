Having your A\/C go out in the middle of a summer's night with little ones in the house can be very stressful. Jason helped ease my mind when I spoke with him first thing in the morning. He got me scheduled for early afternoon, but I was delightfully surprised when he called later that morning to let me know that one of his service workers finished an installation early and was able to be at our home before noon (when it really starts to heat up). Vance came to the rescue with an assurance that he will find out what's going on and a friendly smile.  Fortunately, it was a minor repair (yay!) and the cost was very reasonably priced. Vance had cold A\/C blowing in our home again in no time. He was kind of enough to stick around and answer some questions I had about our unit and how to properly maintain it. I will absolutely contact Wheeler Air Conditioning again for A\/C service. If you live in the Chandler\/Gilbert area, I highly recommend that you contact them for your A\/C needs!
