Pretty shittastic.\n\nYou're trapped past airport security, so your options are limited. Choose elsewhere. Food was overpriced (as may be expected) but bland. I ordered the fish tacos (Which I was assured by both the menu and the server were excellent.) which were just battered cod on a cheap tortilla.  The accompanying fries were unseasoned, limp, and underdone. After finally hailing the server, the fries were replaced with a warm batch that was just as flavorless but drenched in oil.\n\nWe sat for about 45 minutes watching the waitstaff ignore diners and waiting patrons alike; and by the end took some joy at diners walking away after waiting at an unattended hostess stand after waiting ~5 minutes.\n\nTim Horton's is just down the terminal. Go and get Tim Bits for a fraction of the price and triple the satisfaction.
