My husband & I just treated ourselves to AZ Kabob after a long day at work. We decided we weren't hungry enough for any entree, and went with some sandwiches. My husband ordered the Beef Shawrma and I grabbed the beef kabob sandwich.\n\nEach sandwich was served with a small side salad, a yogurt sauce, and a salad dressing. The yogurt sauce almost tzatziki like, but not. It was still good. \n\nThe beef on each was cooked perfectly and thoroughly. Flavoring was wonderful, yet not over powering. The sauce was the perfect compliment to each of the sandwiches (we decided to split the sandwiches in half).\n\nMy husband enjoyed the salad dressing sauce, while I decide to stick with the yogurt sauce for the salad. It was fresh & crisp.\n\nFinally, we splurged ourselves for some dessert. The saffron ice cream had a shockingly pleasant taste. Something that catches the palette off guard. Almost a mixture between something cleansing and refreshing, yet flowery. I don't know how else to explain it, other than GO TRY IT.\n\nWe will be back!!
