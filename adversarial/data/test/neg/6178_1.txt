My friends and I stopped in to Priceless Too after work last Friday, I can say I am glad we did. Janelle and Rhonda are H-O-T!!!!!!!! Boy was there a show in that place! Drinks are heavy and reasonable....good selection of beer too. See you girls next Friday ;)\nRhonda works at the sister bar a few shifts a week Primetime and suggested we come see her at this spot soooo glad we did! In love with the girls here.
