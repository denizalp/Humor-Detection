A wonderful view during the night time, and it's free!\nWalking to this display, you get to experience the boulevard as well - real fun going into other casinos and observing.\nThe schedule is about 15-20 minutes per display, so be ready for the crowds. The street level is one of the best spots, if you get a spot near the waters. I recommend the Bellagio stairs for the view, bit of a distance on the side but a good view. Love the extra boom from the splash of the waters falling back onto the pond at the end, pretty neat.\nThis is definitely one of the free attractions to visit in Vegas, real beautiful sight along with the Vegas night lights. Bring a camera for some memories!
