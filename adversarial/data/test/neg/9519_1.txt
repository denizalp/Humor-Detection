So tasty. I had the double burger with Swiss cheese. Fries with seasoning salt and their own thousand island based dipping sauce. Definitely will be a frequent stop when passing through the area for work. A local friend recommended it, and it did not disappoint. The baseball memorabilia didn't hurt either!
