Dr. Martin is the best!! I have had some pretty extensive dental work done previously at an office in North Scottsdale.Needless to say, I dreaded going to the dentist and having cavities filled\/work done. Dr. Martin and his staff have completely changed my mindset, I look forward to my appointments! It is hard to find a dentist that is as honest, gentle, and truly talented as Dr. Martin is! I would recommend him to everyone I know. His staff is beyond friendly and kind! I look forward to many more great experiences and I feel so lucky that I have found such a great dentist and dental office!
