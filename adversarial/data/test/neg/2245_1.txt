Finally my family and I tried this place. We had bulgogi enchilada, bulgogi fries, and chicken wings. All was super delicious. The staff was friendly too. \nThe only downside was the place is not in the best area and is small with few tables. Like another said It's what you call a \"hole in the wall\" but it is worth trying.
