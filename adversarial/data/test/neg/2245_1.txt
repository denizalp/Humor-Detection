I love dunkin donuts so I am biased. This location is new with nice indoor seating area. There is no drive thru here which is annoying sometimes and the parking lot can be hard to get in and out of. It gets very busy in the morning so a 5-10 min wait should be expected. \n\nI recommend getting a refillable mug so you get a discount on refills!
