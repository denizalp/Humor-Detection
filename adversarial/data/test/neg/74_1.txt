Breakfast buffet was surprisingly good. They don't have a very big selection like some other buffets but, from what they do have, it is very good. We happen to come at a time when they're switching from breakfast to lunch so we had a small taste of lunch as well and from little we tried, it was good too. Will definitely come back for dinner buffet (another day cause we're FULL haha). One more thing, service was great thanks to Will, friendly staff. I hope they don't change.
