Got a spray membership and had tanned\/worked here in the past. When I signed up the girl did not inform me that the \"dark\" option is $10 more a month or $4 upgrade. She told me to use my maiden name for my membership since I was already in their system and she will have management change it. It's been months and no change. Multiple consultants have \"sent an email.\" I would rate more stars if I was properly informed about my membership
