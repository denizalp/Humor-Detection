Went to 21+ night last night, beer and wine are $5-$6 but don't come expecting to get drunk, lines are ridiculous. Watch the demonstrations and it's super fun to be there without all the kids. Kind of ran out of steam after 3 hours, couldn't really drink more, saw everything, wish there were a few more attractions. Overall it was a really good time.
