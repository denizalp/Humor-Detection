Nothing like turning off a potential customer by being snarky with them on the phone. I called to make an appointment & the person who answered wasn't very interested in setting me up for an early Saturday appointment to get my hair done for my wedding or the other 2 girls who might be with me. Additionally, she added \"good luck with that\" when I said I needed it done at 9am. It wasn't what she said, it was how she said it. Seems they're open at Saturday at 9am, but I was told 10am was their earliest time. \n\nThis place was recommended to me by my family & I was taken aback that I wasn't treated just a bit nicer when trying to book. Everyone has bad days & I get that, but if you're representing a business, customer service in all phases should be important to you.
