When you see 99 reviews with that kind of star rating you figure this place would be off the chain.  When k first walked in it smelled a little funny. I ordered a two item meat combo with brisket and spicy sausage. Brisket was very moist but full of a lot of fat pieces. Need to do some trimming. The sausage was ok not spicy at all and I didn't like that they cut it up into little pieces so when I went to eat they were kind of dried up. They had two kinds of BBQ sauce. One sweet one spicy. When I started to eat I could not tell the difference.  The sweet tea was good. The little piece of cornbread was not so good. I also got a Mac and cheese. When you go to a BBQ Mac and cheese needs to be stepped up. This tasted like store bought brand.
