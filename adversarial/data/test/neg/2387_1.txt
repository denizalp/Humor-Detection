I have had many massages in my life and the one I had from Suzette was the best I have had in years. Spa itself was beautiful- loved the relaxation room and the social lounge. I think I would prefer the beginning rituals if I was alone as opposed to with the spa attendant, but I imagine that is only because as a first timer, I got the guided tour. The only thing that will keep me from coming on a regular basis is the price- I will just have to keep my eye out for deals. Full price might be ok a couple of times a year.
