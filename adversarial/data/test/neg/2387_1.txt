We have been seeing Dr. St. Jacques since 1998. He has taken good care of all three of my kiddos. We have been fortunate that we've not had a lot of health issues over the years so the vast majority of our visits have been well check visits. When I was a nervous young mom, Dr. St. Jacques was a wonderful resource for me and I appreciate his calm nature. He's always been that way and even in my craziest moments (like when my youngest broke her ankle) he kept his cool and helped me through it all.
