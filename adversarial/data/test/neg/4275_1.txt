After driving past this joint for years and never stopping in,  I finally saw it on tv on diners drive ins and dives with Guy Fieri. I figured,  if he ate there and lived,  it must not be so bad! \n\nStaff is super friendly and helpful, they realize it's confusing of you've never been there before.\n\nThe pork is outstanding,  my favorite.  The jade chicken comes in at a close second!\n\nFun place to eat and break the norm, unless fusion food is your norm!\n\nGo give then a try,  you'll be surprised!
