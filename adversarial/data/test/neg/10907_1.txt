I recently bought a Vespa from these folk, they are SO NICE! I was feeling a bit sheepish cause I wasn't ready for a heavy bike yet, I kind thought I'd feel silly all the way through.. but not at all though.\nThe sales guy was super knowledgeable and super cool and helpful, the owner came out and said hello, there was a dog there lol.\nThey delivered my bike for me cause I still need to get my license and That guy was super nice and helpful too, walked me through my entire bike!\nThanks guys!
