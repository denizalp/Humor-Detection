Hot Matcha Milk Tea was $4.50 after tax ($4.00 before tax) and was served in a beautiful takeout cup that almost looked like one of Starbucks' plastic versions of their takeout cups, save that this one wasn't plastic. What I mean is that it almost looked plastic, it was so nice. It also came with a cardboard hot beverage holder (this one's a plus for service, cuz there are places that don't give you a hot beverage holder for hot beverages, and for a person with sensitive hands, like me, that gets a tad bothersome). It tasted, in my friend's words, like green tea ice cream melted down and heated up. This was at 70% sugar. I could tell that they had used enough matcha powder (which some places really don't), and it looked lovely and milky. It was also a beautiful green color.
