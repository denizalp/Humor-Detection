I really liked this place. My boyfriend brought me where after a recommendation from a friend, while it took us about half an hr to get here, the food was definately worth it. When I walked in I was like really?? This place is going to serve me good food? The place is super divvy (from my perspective), it seemed really dark however the picture on here shows it super bright. We came in here the evening before a long weekend so maybe they were just winding down. The neighbourhood around the corner makes me slightly nervous as well. \nI ordered the maki-n-cheese rolls and I didnt find then dry at all, they have a sliver of jalepeno down the centre which was great. The smoked ketchup was also amazing. My boyfriend ordere the quesadilla which he inhaleddddd. I'd say he liked it. \nThe bill was pretty cheap I'd say about 20 bucks, but there are some things to mention - cash only (make sure you bring some with you because when we went the ATM was out of cash), they have no \"brand name\" pop (she stated it was too much money) and it was flat in my opnion, thirdly they charge you a dollar extra for side sauces i.e. sour cream cost us an extra $1. \nOverall the waitresses were nice and the food was good - I crave those mac and cheese rolls every now and again, but since it's not close by I won't be rushing back anytime soon.
