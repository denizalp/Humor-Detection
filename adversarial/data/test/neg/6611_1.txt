OMG..... I will definitely be back!!!!!   I had the pepperoni pizza.  The crust was perfect.  The sauce and cheese was delicious.   \n\nThen, I had the garlic knots.  They were fantastic.  They were bite size and the garlic oil sauce was out of this world.  \n\nFinally, I had what the Yelpers were talking about - The Double Cheesesteak.  Wow!!!!!    Everything about it was delicious - The roll, the meat, the mushrooms, the onions, the cheese.  \n\nIf you don't try this place, you are crazy.......\n\nSee the pictures.  :)
