Ordered 2 water inlets, 1 arrived clearly used and when I hooked the hose on I quickly realized it was the wrong inlet so I returned them.\n\nI was charged $13 to return them and then get an email saying they wouldn't accept my return because the item was \"used\" (as I received it) and \"installed\" (by attaching hose?).\n\nWould never use again or recommend to anyone.\n\nVery poor customer service as they jumped to conclusions without calling or asking questions. Customer Service turned Keyboard Warrior.
