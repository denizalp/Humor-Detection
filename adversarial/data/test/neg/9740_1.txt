This place is actually pretty good.  I also came here with no expectations, and was pleasantly surprised.  The service was reasonably good, the food was good.  The service was prompt (which is necessary for lunch service).  I was really happy with this.  This place is super close to my parents house, and I have no idea when it opened, but yay!  I'd come back for sure.
