Got my dog groomed here a few weeks ago. When I dropped my golden off for a bath and a brush they said it would be 2-3 hours. I didn't hear from them so I called after about 3 hours. She told me that he was ready and I could come pick him up. Yay! So I drive out there and walk in. She then tells me that she made a mistake and he hadn't even begun his bath yet. After 3 hours. So I ask her when he is going to be done and she says that they were getting ready to bathe him. She then tells me I can just pay now and then I don't have to pay when I pick him up. I had an APPOINTMENT at 1 that I had made the week prior and it took them 6 hours to bathe and dry my dog. I did not have him trimmed at all or his anal glands done and it was $50. When I came to pick him up the first time AND the second time I noticed that there were no dogs in their little play room as well which struck me as odd because that's one of the reasons a lot of people bring their dogs here. The front desk staff was rude and just no customer service skills at all. I won't be bringing my dog back or recommending this place to any of my friends.
