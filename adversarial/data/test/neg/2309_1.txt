The sushi is fresh but I would skip the pork bone soup. Maybe it was their off day but my bowl of soup came half full like they ran out of broth and although the meat was tender, the whole thing was lacking flavours. We had the spider roll which was good and the Korean chirashi and I ordered take out, also good. Would return again if I am in the neighbourhood for fish only.
