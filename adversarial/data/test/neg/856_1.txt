It's very hard to find a good Nail Spa that you know is clean, uses high quality products and does quality work.  I found that at La Vie.  I've been going to them since I moved to Mesa in 2016.  The staff is great and my nails have never been healthier or looked better.  \nI look forward to my visits.  The staff is friendly and they greet every customer walking through the door with a smile.  I've never felt rushed or unhappy about the services I've had done in the two years I've been going there.\nI'm so pleased with the services that when they moved to new location, 45 minutes out of my way, I followed them.  I think its really worth the drive knowing the quality of service I get at each and every appointment.  \nIf you're looking for a great nail spa, give them a try.  You won't be disappointed! After all, don't we all enjoy a day of pampering?
