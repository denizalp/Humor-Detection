Great customer service from Andrew. Helps us find the best deals and quality products every time I visit. I live  on mill and southern right next to pet club and I pass two other Pet club on my way to work every single day but I still always go to priest and Elliot. My fur babies are spoiled and I'm extremely picky as I work in customer service too. I do hope they get a rescue in to the store soon though , because that's fun.
