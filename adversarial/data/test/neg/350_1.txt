The food is pretty decent, but over priced.  Given that this is pretty much the only authentic Korean place in Pittsburgh, I guess they can do that.  You do get a fair amount of food, I always have leftovers.  Service is friendly and quick, and the food hits the spot when you're craving Korean cuisine.
