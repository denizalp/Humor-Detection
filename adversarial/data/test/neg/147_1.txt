Cute. Ordered the medium sized tiramisu and black sesame shaved ice. I personally prefer the black sesame because the toppings that they put in there were great. Mochi, black sesame ice cream, sesame seeds, yum! The tiramisu came with a block of tiramisu. Both were very milky.\n\nImo the medium size is enough even for two people. It was also affordable. Cashier person was friendly! Tiny tiny place tho so good luck if you wanna sit down somewhere.\n\nA coworker said men don't go here, but I went anyways.
