Worst experience with rental car company in all of my travels.\n\nDuring my rental my vehicle was broken into. Once I noticed the damage to the vehicle I spent 5 hours trying to get a hold of anyone at the Las Vegas Ace location. I am not exaggerating it was 5 HOURS! The corporate office tried to get a hold of the managers all morning to no avail. Therefore, I had to leave a note for the customer service rep to inform this branch of the incident and fix the car.  Because of this I had to Uber to my business meeting.\n\nAt drop off I was told I was emailed a receipt, to my surprise, I wasn't. Now I had to call the 18778223872 number and get 2 different numbers to call to get a receipt for my rental. Felt like groundhogs day all over again.\n\nI have never been so disappointed in the quality of customer service in a business. Nor have I ever wrote a review this long about a company and their horrendous customer service. If you are traveling here, I implore you to explore other options, this place is a mis-managed mess of a business.
