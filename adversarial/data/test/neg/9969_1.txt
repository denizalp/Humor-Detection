I've had 2 surgeries with the clinic.  While the physicians are good, the office staff is the worst I'm encountered in 30 years.  you can't get them to call you back even tho they have an answering system.  they mess up the schedule and don't tell you.  they leave the stitches in too long then have to go dig them out.  I'll not go back.
