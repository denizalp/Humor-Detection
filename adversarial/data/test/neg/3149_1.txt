One of my least favorable experiences i have had here.   I got a steak ordered it medium and got a rare steak.  I tried to eat it, sent it back just asking if they could put it on a for another minute.  All they did was burn the outside.  Great now i have a burnt steak thats raw in the middle.  I just didnt eat it or complain further.  When i asked for my check with a full uneatin steak there were no questions and my waitress decided to sit at the POS station playing grab ass with some guy who worked there kissing her neck and whispering in her ear while i sat there waiting to pay for my uneaten raw piece of meat.  It'll be awhile before i return.  Cauliflower app is good.
