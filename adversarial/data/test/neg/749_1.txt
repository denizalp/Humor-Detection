Alright, I'm not normally in need of a self serve auto wash\/detail place, but this was EXACTLY what I needed and when I needed it. Had to clean up the remnants of getting sick in the car. I went to two other places and was about to spend  $45 on the other side of town. Glad I didn't..\n\nDrove here and got straight into a bay. Was able to do everything I needed to in 7 minutes and paid $4. If you like washing your own car, this is the spot for you. They even have a vending machine that sells towels and wipes if you need one; and I love the sink with the towel wringer.
