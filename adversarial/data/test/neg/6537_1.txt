The store itself is very cute, nicely decorated....thats about the only thing that impressed me about this place. In my opinion Cupcakes are not being perserved properly or something, VERY dry cupcakes! do not try the mexican chocolate cupcake! tasted like dirt..they need to rethink their prices too..deliver perfection at $3.00 a pop
