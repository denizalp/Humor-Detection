More like 3.5 stars because of the anticipation for the chicken and waffles.\n\nWe ate lunch here with no wait. The service was A+ (waiter was attentive and manager stopped by to check on us a couple of times). The ambiance is nice in there.\n\nWe had the Fried Green Tomato BLT, Deviled Eggs, and Chicken and Waffles.\n\nThe star of the meal was the Fried Green Tomato BLT. The pimento cheese, smoked pork belly, and frisee lettuce was so good on top of the fried green tomato.\n\nThe Deviled Eggs were okay, but pretty standard. I was really excited for the cheddar waffle, but it barely had any cheese taste and was a bit soggy. The fried chicken had decent seasoning on it, but was a little bland and not crispy. The hot sauce and bourbon syrup were really good though.
