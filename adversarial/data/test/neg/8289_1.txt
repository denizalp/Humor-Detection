Came in during Pittsburgh Craft Beer Week. I was surprised that it wasn't busier. \n\nPositives :\nGreat beer selection \nCreative menu\n\nNegatives:\nSmall portions\nNegative attitude of the staff \nSmall bar area \n\nDuring the hour and a half I was there, one of the waitresses had 3 separate meltdowns... All related to the fact that she rang in a drink wrong and mistake caused drafts instead of flights to be poured. \n\nFurther, I was deciding between 2 different drafts and chose a beer due to the menu saying that it was on special. When I got my check, it was showing full price. I showed it to the bartender (who, in her defense, was the nicest person we saw last night) and she got her manager. The manager acted like I was the one who made the mistake and acted annoyed that I brought it up to her. She, instead of giving me the sale price on the 3 beers I drank since her beer list stated it incorrectly, gave me an discount of $3.50.  I still was overcharged but didn't have the energy to fight it. \n\nIt's a shame that they don't want to bring in more customers because it has potential..
