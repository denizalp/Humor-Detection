I ate here everyday and my health improved... I need to start cooking myself in Davis now that Inrealize how bad the food is in Davis, Ca.\n\nCarmel Salted Pudding and Warm Peanut Butter Cup were amazing desserts.  I only ate the AB Burger with a side salad.  Feel great, want to visit downtown Phoenix again.
