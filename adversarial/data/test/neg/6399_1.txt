Jim's background speaks for itself.  Vince did a very good job with the install.  My home was wired for a security system but I had never installed one.  The system is easy to operate which is important to me since I am not very good with electronics.  My wife is at ease now that we have the proper protection when we are home or out of town.  It is nice to know we can arm and disarm the system from our smart phone and we can set extra codes for family and know who comes and goes from our home.  The nicest part is the cost was less than all the competitors.  I did not want to by a cheep system and I like the Jim backs his product personally.  Thanks JPG.
