Oh yes. My favorite place for poke everything. The only thing is that to get to the ordering area you have to go to everyone who's already eating on the Hawaiian restaurant. \n\nAfter that, I decided to also learn how to do all their different types of poke. Mine don't comes out as theirs but it holds me until I can go there and eat 1# of their Salmon poke.\n\nDefinitely worth the price.
