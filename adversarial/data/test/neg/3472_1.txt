Decor is really off. A lot of pretty nice pieces...that don't go together.\n\nWine is ok, we had wine on tap.\n\nFood is excellent. We had the lamb sliders, grilled cheese sandwich, fries, salad, and some chocolate dessert. Decent prices.\n\nService is EXCELLENT, we had an older gentleman..I wish I remembered his name.
