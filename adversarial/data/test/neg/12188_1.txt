Good neo-Asian food and service\n\nStopped in when we were nearby, hungry, and saw Tott's has a great rating on Yelp!.  Nice restaurant with a good pace of customers and very pleasant staff.  Dessert options were a step above the norm at a small diner like this, which is useful when you have little ones like my wife and I.\n\nFood is good, but not great to my tastes.  The Hot Korean is semi-spicy and would do better with bamboo versus the carrots and more chili pepper.  My wife had the Pepper Chicken (name?) and thought it was tasty enough, but some pieces were warm while others were cool.  Dumplings are not meaty and are more veggie... and the sauce is a sweet vinegar thing that doesn't give much appreciable flavor.  Our daughters thought the Terriyaki Chicken was too dry to finish.\n\nPumpkin Roll was yummy.  Almond Cookie Cheesecake was left half-eaten as my wife said it tasted more like orange mixed with cheesecake.  I took a bite and have to agree.
