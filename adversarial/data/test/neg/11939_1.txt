PROS: All-you-can-eat Friday fish fry for $14 per person\nCONS: Busy, some wait time expected\n\nWe came here for the all-you-can-eat fish fry, which was quite good. The fish was crispy on the outside and nice and flaky in the inside. The initial order comes with 2 sides, after which they will keep bringing you more fried fish until you can't eat anymore. They have specials everyday, and I would love to come back to check out another one of their specials.
