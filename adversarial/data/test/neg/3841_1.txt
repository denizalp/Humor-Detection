Had dinner on Tuesday.  Even before we went in you could smell the liquid smoke from the ribs and briskets.  Very good flavour but so strong that I could only eat one of each.  As the night wore on, the smell became increasingly annoying and clung to clothes.\n\nOther food was quite good, especially for the price.  Not a huge selection but decent.  Staff was good and seemed to know the regulars.
