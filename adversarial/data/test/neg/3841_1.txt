Last week my girlfriend and I visited Rebozo's on College with a hankering for some Taco's. We arrived around 4ish and the restaurant was empty, which is no big deal because my stomach and I where in no mood to be waiting in a line. So we sat down and where quickly greeted and given menus by our server who also happened to be the cook and owner. The man's name escapes me but he was attentive and all around awesome considering he was filling all the positions at the time.\n\nNow on to the food, one overall theme of this review is that everything was very very fresh. We started with an order of Guacamole and corn chips, both of which where plentiful and tasty. The salsa that came with the mild and the spicy where AMAZING. The spicy was really hot and packed with flavour, but that's kind of my style. And the mild salsa had a good kick and would definitely be a hit with anyone who doesn't like things too hot. If the restaurant sold it, I would have bought it then and there. As a definition of how good it was we had to get refills throughout the meal.\n\nFor main's she ordered a Chicken Tostada and I went with the Tacos. Now with the Taco's you get three in a serving. Something I really appreciated was that they have no problem letting you mix and match different types of Taco's for your order. So I got the Chorizo (Mexican sausage), Pollo (Chicken in tomato sauce and green sweet peppers), and Res (Shredded beef marinated in spices).\nThe food came out rather quickly and we where soon stuffing our faces. The Tacos where amazing, all three. The standouts where the Chorizo and Res. All of which where very flavorful and fresh, both the filling and the tortillas. The Tostada was also quite good according to my girlfriend, I also stole a bite to see for myself and it was indeed! \n\nA few bites and a few heaping dollops of Salsa later the meal was finished and I mean there was nothing left. We decided not to go for dessert as we where both quite full by this point. Instead I opted for a Jarrito, a Mexican soda. The Jarrito was amazing and I bought another for the road.\n\nThe pricing was very reasonable, $10 for the Taco's, $5 for the Tostada, $8 for the Guac (like I said there was alot), and $2.50 for the Jarrito. All and all a very awesome experience and I can't wait to go back for more.
