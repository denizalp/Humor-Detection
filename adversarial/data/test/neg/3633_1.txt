A very trendy grocery store in the Bayview Village Mall. It prides itself on great pastries as well as fresh produce. They have many interesting and lesser known brands of food that are quite good. (At least the view I tried were good.) \n\nI only wish it was not so expensive... but the cupcakes becon me...
