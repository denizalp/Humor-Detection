This is by far the best shop on the Southwest side of town. Have been there about a dozen times and always satisfied with the results.  Sam and Scott both do great work so you can't go wrong with either of them. Best is to make an appointment because they do get pretty crowded. I'm just glad I don't have to drive across town to get a good cut!
