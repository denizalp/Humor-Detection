The Crepe Bar must be doing something right, since it was crowded.  The food was acceptable, but not exceptional.  The crepes ordered (Maple Butter and Tiramisu) were crepes with topping on top, not wrapped within as one normally does for a crepe.  We waited 20 minutes or so for the crepes to come out, and the presentation of the crepes seemed rushed--toppings were just sort of dumped on top of the folded crepe, like it was prepared by someone in a rush.  I suspect they did not have a kitchen floorspace or staff adequate to meet demand.  \n\nThe staff was friendly and considerate and the decor was pleasant.  \n\nWhile not terrible, it was not really worth the wait or the price.  I doubt I will go back.
