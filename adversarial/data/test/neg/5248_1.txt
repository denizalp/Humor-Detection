Love it!  Beautifully decorated with lots of eye-candy.  Had the quinoa salad topped with grilled salmon and a side of asparagus (giant farm to table variety) that was superb.  Nice wine selection reasonably priced.  Also, the waiter could not have been nicer and efficient.  It has been a while since we were last there and it never fails to deliver a great experience.  Can't wait for the weather to warm up to eat outside on the patio.  I highly recommend Honey Salt!!!
