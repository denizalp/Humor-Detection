I got a large Americano to go from this place. Price is about right, coffee was good. Better than Bucks, but to me, everything there is burnt. \n\nI didn't order food, but many things looked good and the pastries looked great. The service was good, a bit slow. But you know, they used espresso machines where you didn't just push buttons and stuff came out. So, that happens. \n\nMy only complaint was that inside the cafe it was hot. I'm sure the air hadn't kicked in yet. \n\nI'll head back.
