I love this resort.  It's perfect when you have kids. They have kid activities in the morning M-F, a playground, arcade, 1 lazy river, 3 pools, 3 jacuzzis  \n\nIt's a little far from the strip, but if you have a car it's not such a big deal, they made the freeway entrance\/exit close enough so you can just hop on the freeway and exit a few miles down the strip (about 5mins drive).\n\nThey don't have a 24hour restaurant, shops etc., so it's ideal to bring your own grub. There's a Food4Less across the street.\n\nOverally, this place is pretty awesome!  Very practical if you're staying in Vegas for more than 2 days.
