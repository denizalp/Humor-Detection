We stopped on Thursday night and it was fairly busy but the female worker was incredibly helpful and kind.  My daughter has celiac and gets very sick from gluten even cross contamination.  The cold stone worker checked the ingredients of the flavor my daughter selected and got a new container of ice cream and new stainless steel plate to mix her ice cream on. Awesome customer service!! And great ice cream as always!!
