I wanted to like this place, especially since it's a favorite of our friends, but  ... \"to each their own.\" Prices and portions are reasonable but I've had better HK style food.  The egg on the baked pork chop rice was almost raw, like it was just cracked on top.  Pork chop was very fatty and I really hate when they give you a center cut pork chop that is dry! Noodles were salty and really lacked any flavor at all.  Service is lacking, but normal for Asian restaurants and those who don't speak the language.
