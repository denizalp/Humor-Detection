Made reservations for a Thursday and we were seated promptly.  BYOB so we enjoyed our wine with the meal, $5 corkage charge.  Calamari and eggplant were our appetizers and were both excellent!  Lamb and veal dishes were both very good.  My daughter ordered spaghetti and meatballs which were also very good but the price of $17.95 for this is high.  Would return for another meal and I would recommend you trying this restaurant.
