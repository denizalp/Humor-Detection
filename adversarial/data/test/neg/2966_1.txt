My new favorite Vegas eatery! The charred brussel sprouts were like high dollar crack. I loved the veggie empanadas and the chicken meatballs with pesto. And best of all was the s'mores skillet! It's a great place for small plates so you can try everything. The service was top-notch. We will be back!
