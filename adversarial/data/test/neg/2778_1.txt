The food was fine but the service sucked. Sat outside, Sunday afternoon, beautiful day, only two other tables outside... Our whole meal we watched and listened to a server from the restaurant talk to a table sat near us. She stood there for at least 45 mins in 2 different 'visits.' Not only were they not trying to talk quietly, but the girl sitting at the table had the most loud and obnoxious laugh I've ever heard in my life... it was like something from a Seinfeld episode. Once we got our food, we were virtually ignored, while a waitress stood 3 feet from us talking to her friends and we had no water and dirty plates in front of us for about 20 minutes. I know we weren't at her table, but she could've at least noticed and told the guy who was supposed to be waiting on us that we needed some attention. Sadly people nowadays don't notice anything and stay in their own little world of \"that's not my table\/problem.\" They make a really good Mojito here but the service is definitely lacking. Had to go inside to ask for our check, and our server was chatting at the hostess station. This is the first time I have ever seen my husband give a really really bad tip, even though well-deserved. Wake up people!!
