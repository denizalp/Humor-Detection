Came to Salt Lounge prior to seeing a movie at i-Pic and had some time to kill. It has an awesome lounge area with tons of TV's to watch sports as well as some interesting speciality cocktails. Service was a little on the slow side and the area where we sat at the bar was dirty and the bartender never seemed to notice or care and clean it up!
