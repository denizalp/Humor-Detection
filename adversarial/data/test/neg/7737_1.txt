I love this pool. It's really pretty. Very roomy so even though it was crowded, it didn't feel cramped. Drinks are ridiculous expensive. Luckily, I only paid for one. But honestly, drinks on the strip are so overpriced wherever you go.\n\nGuy at the door, James, was great. Not like the assholes you usually have to deal with at these places.\n\nAll in all, if you're looking for a fun day club in Vegas, I'd highly recommend this one. We all had a blast.
