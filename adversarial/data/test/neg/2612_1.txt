Unique to this part of town.  A little oasis that is great for Friday evening happy hour.  Friendly customers and wait staff.  Its cozy and funky.  Grab a beer or cocktail and order up a cool starter.  Pretty clever business that I bet is busy all day as a coffeebar, winebar  and solid dinner establishment.
