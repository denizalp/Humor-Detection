I work uptown nearby and come here fairly frequently (usually before 11:45 since it is pretty busy for lunchtime). I can say I've never had a problem here - the staff and management are very friendly and courteous, and my food usually arrives in good time. I've never gotten a bad meal at this location here either - can't say it's ever blown my mind, but it's always been satisfying, which is par for franchises. Great location and great lunch spot if you're in the area.
