I love Alberto's. Every dish I have had there has been amazing: the caesar salad (especially the dressing) is great, the pizza is fantastic and authentic (the prosciutto pizza is especially tasty), and the gorgonzola gnocchi might be the best thing I have had at any restaurant. Ever. Also you are always greeted personally by Alberto who is a continual source of great stories. If I lived anywhere close to Cave Creek I would be there every day.
