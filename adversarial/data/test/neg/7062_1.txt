So far we are really happy with our entire experience. We bought a groupon- which I'm always hesitant to do because I've never had a good experience with services booked through groupon. However, I took a chance because of the good reviews. Michel was super easy to reach and it was easy to find a time that fit my schedule. They arrived right on time and walked us through each space with a black light to identify problem areas from our pets. We knew we would be paying extra beyond the groupon for additional rooms and pet stains. The price quoted up front was very reasonable. They were informative about our options yet there was no up selling at all. After completing each room, Michel asked us to walk through and verify that we were happy with the service provided. All in all- super happy. I will certainly update if anything changes but I don't anticipate that happening....
