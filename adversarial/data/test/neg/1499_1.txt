Worst experience with a veterinary office we've ever had. Quoted $339 for front declaw (was told on the phone that I wouldn't owe a balance at pre op appointment), came in for pre op appointment and found out we'd need to pay an additional $209 for bloodwork and shots. Decided against the surgery and still had to pay $87 for the office visit. Very disappointed and will continue our search for a great vet office on the west side of Cleveland.
