What has happened to Dave's? A favorite stop when on campus but today it was terrible, tables outside (the only place to sit) were discusting, bird crap all over. Employees making no attempt to clean even when there was no customers. Certainly unsanitary, probably against many health department regs. No supervision, really a disappointment for a place at ASU!
