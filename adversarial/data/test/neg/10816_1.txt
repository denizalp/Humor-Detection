Had to make a special stop on my road trip to DC here. Love their sandwiches, my top  2 are the corn beef and the Sirloin steak (my#1 favorite, the vinegar of the slaw goes perfect with the steak and fries). I wish i could of stayed long enough to have wings and beer. Big menu with something for everybody. Oh and if you can't handle the sight of the Steelers, don't even bother coming here, because it is all decked out in Steelers garb. Oh and they also have really good cheese fries here.
