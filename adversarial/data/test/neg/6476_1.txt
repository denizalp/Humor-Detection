My boyfriend and I randomly picked this spot for our night before our half marathon.  The atmosphere was so fun.  I love the couch idea and eating on a couch.  WE ordered some cocktails and they were delicious and light.  We also like the charred okra, cornbread, and artichoke pasta.  I was not a fan of the cauliflower mashed potatoes. But there was no line to get in so that was great.  Especially it being a sat night in vegas!
