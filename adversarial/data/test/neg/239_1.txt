I have been wanting to get here for ages and today was close by. Wandered in with my hungry teenager for early dinner.\n\nThis is such a friendly little shop. Quick service rather than table service. We were walked through the menu, ordered, and the food was brought over to our table. They even checked in at our table to make sure everything was good.\n\nEverything we had was ready fast and was delicious:\nThree tacos, two chicken and one steak\nChips and guacamole\nFanta Orange (in bottles!)\nJarrito Mandarito\n\nA clean and cozy spot. We will definitely return. All in I give it five stars because if the decent price point, attentive service at a quick service and tasty food.
