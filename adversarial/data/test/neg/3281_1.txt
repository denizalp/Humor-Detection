I have had two services here and I'm delighted! First was an amazing haircut from Matt and an blonde highlight from Kassie.  \n\nThis salon is super hip, chic, low key and fun.  All of the staff is super knowledgeable about hair!!  The best part is they all communicate and provide best practice and advice for their clients which is great!   \n\nThe building is urban with a nice courtyard and nice lobby.  They sell Bumble and Bumble products... Need I say more :). \n\nIf you go, make sure you say Nikki C sent me ;)\n\nEnjoy your best color and haircut EVER!!!\n\nNikki
