I've been saving my appetite the entire day and really wanted to eat at the Rio's Carnival World Buffet or Seafood Buffet, but my friends were low on funds and down on their luck.  So I jumped on the hate-wagon and as we walked with sorrow and cursed the world, we came across the All-American Bar & Grill.  Hey, we're Americans, lets cheer up with some good ol' American eats!  \n\nSo I placed our name on the wait list and waited for about 30 minutes.  It felt fast because I went to gamble and made my lunch money.  Score!  Anyways, they called us and as we were walking to our table, we passed the kitchen which is smack dead in the middle and along the kitchen hall were slabs of butchered meat hanging behind a glass window.  Pretty awesome view and you can see the cooking action too.\n\nOff to the gnitty gritty.  I ordered their burger (forgot the name, but it had sausages and jalapenos) and it was hugemongous.  In fact, everything we ordered were ginormous portions.  How can a little 135 lb guy like me devour a meal made for linebackers?  Don't ask questions you don't want the answers to!  The fries that came with my burger were mixed with criss-cut, curly, and regular fries.  We also started off with 50 wings (about $20) and it was very meaty, had the right amount of crisp, perfectly fried and if you add a drizzle of their ranch and hot sauce on top, you'd forget how much money you've blown at the craps table.  I also picked on my friend's 20 oz ribeye and it was very tender, perfectly grilled and charred.  Then I went to my other friend and tried her shrimp linguini and that blew me out of the water.  Shrimp was succulent and divine.  Then I invaded my last friend's pork chops and holy crap that was good too, but the piece I ate was slightly overcooked.\n\nOverall, our server was kind of slow because it was a full house, but we received our food in 15 minutes and the wings are one of the best I've had and for $10, my burger was huge...a great meal!  You can't go wrong here since they serve giant American sized portions, which confirms the stereotype, but lets not get into that.  I'll definitely be back on my next Vegas visit to the Rio.
