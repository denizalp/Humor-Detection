I was looking for a hair salon close to my work and a colleague recommended this place that is literally a 3 mins walk. I booked the appointment last minute and they were able to squeeze me in. The receptionist was polite and super cute. The hair cut was amazing, it turned out exactly how I wanted it. I showed her a picture on pinterst and that is exactly how it turned out. My hair was layered very nicely! I recommend BECCA!
