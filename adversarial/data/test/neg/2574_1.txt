Traveling from USA on our last day on vacation our rental got broken into, 2 windows smashed. Lisa and her team made it a very simple and quick transition to exchange our car and get us on our way. Especially considering she had to work with USA hertz paperwork and transfer it to Canadian hertz paperwork. Would recommend. \n\n\nOnly downside was we had to pay for parking to get into and out of the international airport.
