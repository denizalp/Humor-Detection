My car died last Saturday and I had to have it towed. My friend spoke very highly of I AM Mechanics and said he had a lot of repairs done there in the past. I called and spoke with Noe on the phone. He was very nice and made me feel at ease about having my car towed there. They were closed the next day on Sunday but they got to my car right away on Monday morning! In fact, they fixed the starter in my car that same day and I had my car back by 5:30pm. I was very impressed. When I went to pick up my car, I got to meet Noe in person. He seems like a very genuine man and so far, my car is running perfectly once again. I will certainly take my car to them in the future. Thanks guys!!  -Kari
