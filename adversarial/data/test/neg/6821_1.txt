Extremely clean, spacious and well equipped private gym. Robert with his extensive experience in bodybuilding and nutrition has made a great getaway with this gym. Was referred by a local (I am fairly new here) and couldn't be happier with the support, environment and resources. 24-hour access, kitchen, shower and an awesome environment to train at. Looking forward to starting group or one-on-one training one of these days. Thanks Robert for setting this up so well!
