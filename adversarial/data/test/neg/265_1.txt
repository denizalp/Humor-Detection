Kitschy and groovy! Hubbie and I loved the old vegas diner feel. The cocktail waitresses were even wearing black gowns! Def. for cool people that don't take themselves too seriously! \nIt really is out there, by Riviera and has it's own parking lot and famous for being in several shows movies like Casino etc. Open 24 hours which is great and has a lounge\/bar.\n\nI know my mom would def. not appreciate it as it is old, not pretty and who knows if they ever dust those fake flower trees hanging over us. The couple we dined with were healthy\/picky eaters so the huge portions might've been a turn off. \n\nBut we'll be back! and next time we will SHARE!\ncorned beef hash was delish, fresh baked blueberry muffin was great, the seafood omelette was good but not too much seafood, kids meals are huge too (maybe share or skip it completely) Sampler huge. Even the salad my friend got was huge and came with fruit too. Mimosas were great! \nThey take a postcard pic, then try to sell you a bigger copy for $15.
