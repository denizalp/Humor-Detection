They have ads on wechat for weeks, so we decided to give it a try.  We arrived at 5:00pm Saturday afternoon. It was quite empty, we were greeted by a man who looks like a manager. Very casually seated us and brought us the menu and tea. The tea was not even hot. We wanted to order 5 items, but 2 were sold out at 5:00pm Saturday afternoon. So we ended ordering 3 items only, the traditional bao with pork, not impressive at all, the same level as I can make at home, very strong smell of yeast, same skill as mine. 2nd item is Jing jiang meat with wraps, too sweet, presentation is good. Fish with chilli, we told the manager we wanted less spicy, he said ok, but it ended up with covered all chilli and hua jiao, we had to spend 10 mins to get rid of the chilli first.  The waitress brought us the food looked very angry. Over all, nice decoration, mediocre food, little pricy, bad service or no service.  Will not go back.
