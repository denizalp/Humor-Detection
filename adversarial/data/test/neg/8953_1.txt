I love eating at this resturant, the cilantro jalapeno hummus is one of my favorite starters! I usually order a salad with 2x the meat and have plenty for lunch and dinner that night. I just tried one of their featured items for lunch today and it was very tasty- Chicken del carbon.  My only complaint about the Scottsdale location is the waitstaff, they are all plesant but I find them to be slow on service (refilling drinks, clearing plates etc) the Glendale location has a much friendlier outgoing staff. Overall a great place to get healthy yummy food!
