This morning I stop to get an oil filter, Raul didn't even say hi, and while looking for it on the computer answered a call, I thought another customer but no, it was somebody he knew and started talking about his personal life, on how sick he is been, and coughing on front of me, he kept on going and never said excuse me or call someone else to help me, I stood there for more than 2 minutes waiting and he never say anything to me but continue talking on the phone, worse customer service ever...
