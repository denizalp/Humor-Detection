What a disappointment. It should NEVER take 30 mins for 2 cold sandwiches and a cannoli... EVER! Especially when we were 1 of 3 customers! We've been to many Italian delis in the Chicago area and never experienced something like that. Then to over hear the manager scolding two of his employees in the front of store. No thank you. Never coming back.
