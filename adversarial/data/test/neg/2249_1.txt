It's been a while that I've never been to a nail salon. This definitely awesome!!!! The place is really clean, the staff is really friendly and accommodating!!!! They did a good job on my nails. Finally i found the right one for me. I will definitely comeback and invite my friends here. Really worth it!!!!
