This place should be in Cincinnati.  They have quick and yummy Indian food.  The place is big and inviting with glass windows that allow you to observe them making the naan bread in the huge clay pots.\n\nI got the Chicken Tikka Marsala, an order of samosas, Naan, and a mango lassi.  The Marsala was nicely favored and not at all spicy.  There are 3 samosas that come in an order.  They were fresh and paired well with the cilantro sauce that came with it.  I live for a mango lassi's especially on hot days.  But this one I could have done without.  \n\nOverall this is a good place to stop if you are craving inexpensive, yummy, and quick Indian food.
