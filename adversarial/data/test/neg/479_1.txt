My husband Yelp this place and figure it has good reviews, why not try it out. Well, I order the Meat Molcajete. I know this place is know for sea food, but wanted to try out the Meat Molcajete. My advice to everyone is, DO NOT order the Meat Molcajete. On the menu it stated it comes with chorizo, but it was hot dogs. The menu did not mention anything about intestines (tripas), but my Meat Molcajete came with it. Also, when asked for a plate, I was given a disposable plate. Did not enjoy my meal. On a positive note, their micheladas were good.
