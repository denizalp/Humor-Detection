I ate there 3 times in the last 10 days.\n\nI was waited on by Megan, Nate (as opposed to Nathan), and another gentleman whose name I wish I remembered. The last place I had service that great was at Galatoires's Baton Rouge location. \n\nI thought my first waitperson was exceptionally great, but then I had the same experience 3 times with 3 different waitstaff. Pleasant, friendly, efficient, discreet. I was beyond pleased. No annoying interruptions to ask me how my food tastes (fishing for compliments that add nothing to the dining experience) or to ask if I am done with a clearly finished plate.\n\nThe food there is great, too. I recommend the chicken pesto flatbread and the beet salad. They had a special gelato, cherry cheesecake, that I hope becomes a permanent menu item.
