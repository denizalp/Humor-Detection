I spotted this place on a bike ride & decided to try it out:) I didn't look up what time they opened & showed up about half hour before they opened up:) The owner noticed me & my friend outside & opened early! We couldn't decide on a pizza to share so we each ordered a baby extra small:) The ingredients were fresh & bountiful. I hope this hole in the wall stays a Litchfield Park Staple.
