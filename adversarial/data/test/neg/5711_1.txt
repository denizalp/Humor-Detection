I have been here a few times now and every time there is usually a 15 minute (or longer wait). This place is popular! Once the wait was so long (and I was so hangry) that we had to go somewhere else for brunch. That isn't the usual since most of the time we've been seated within 15 minutes. \n\nThe location is great and there is plenty of parking. They have a nice patio but no permanent overhang - just a few umbrellas. This isn't very beneficial when it's raining (no one can sit outside) or when it's too sunny (not enough shade). This can be overlooked since most folks don't want to sit outside during the summer, but otherwise it's something they could improve on. \n\nThe menu consists of regular breakfast fare - pancakes, omelets, biscuits and gravy, etc. The prices are pretty inexpensive, especially for the amount of food you get. Most items come with hash browns and the option of toast or pancakes. I'm a sucker for pancakes and they are really fluffy here.  \n\nMy first experience here I ordered pancakes with scrambled eggs and bacon. I requested my pancakes to be blueberry and they were delicious. The next time I ordered biscuits and gravy with over-medium eggs. The gravy is fantastic here. (My husband has ordered chicken fried steak several times and he can attest how good the gravy is.) A third visit I ordered an omelet. As for toppings, you can order your omelet with all the toppings you want. (I chose ham, mushrooms, and cheese but the options are pretty limitless.) In addition to the regular menu, every week they have a special. One visit my husband ordered the special - which was southwestern biscuits and gravy. This time the gravy was spicy with jalapenos. It was different but I much prefer their regular gravy.  As for drinks, they have pretty good coffee. \n\nOverall, this is a great breakfast spot that I have shared with both family and friends. If you are in the neighborhood or up for an adventure, I'd definitely recommend checking it out.
