As a local I wanted to check it out and relax pool side with a drink but as I got closer to the area the music blaring everywhere was absolutely obnoxious. I'm not in my 20's so I didn't care for it at all. I wish they'd play something more palatable for all ages, since this isn't a casino strip club pool scene. Until then i'll forget this pool exists.
