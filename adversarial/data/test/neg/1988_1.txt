Four of us stopped by for dinner on Wednesday evening. We looked at the beverage menu and liked that there only local craft beers available. The beers were offered on a special menu that isn't available on-line, so I really don't remember what we ordered. I tried a raspberry flavored beer that was refreshing and excellent.\n\n We ordered the Mediterranean Short Ribs as an appetizer for the table -it was listed in the menu for $10, but was being offered as a $5 special tonight.. Our dinner order was two of the Saigon Subs ($12.50 for \"roasted chicken breast, simmered in a hoisin peanut sauce with melted provolone, matchstick carrots, cucumber and chopped cilantro. served on a toasted baguette with chili garlic mayonnaise and sweet soy sauce\"), one Pacific Rim Noodle Bowl ($13 for \"an asian inspired noodle soup; with chicken, prawns and steamed vegetables simmered in a flavorful broth. served with your choice of shanghai or rice noodles\"), and for me, a Shanghai Noodle Bowl ($14.50 for pan-seared chicken or prawns and fresh cut veggies, saut√©ed in a spicy szechuan sauce over steamed shanghai noodles. garnished with chopped cashews and fresh pea shoots\"). \n\nIt took s while for any of the food to come out, and when the entrees started appearing before the ribs appetizer, we figured something was not right. Our waitress apologized and said she didn't turn I the ribs order, so we cancelled it.\n\nThe food was very good, my friend that ordered the Pacific Rim Noodle Soup loved it, and we were all impressed at the mammoth size of the serving. Every square inch of the Saigon Subs were inhaled. They were served with a choice of two sides, and sides of fries, mango pasta salad, a Caesar salad and roast vegetables also disappeared.  My Shanghai Noodle Bowl was very good- six nicely cooked shrimp tossed with noodles, veggies, cashews in a savory sauce.\n\nThe atmosphere was fun, maybe a little loud with televisions showing sports all over the room. The service was good, except for the missing appetizer. Our server checked on us a lot, refilled our beverages, and was nice and friendly.
