Im not the biggest fan of asian style noodles, but the noodles and broth here are closer to what ive tasted to dishes made for me from people that are from japan or lived there than any other ramen spot in town. The layout and atmosphere is closest to what its like in Japan according to my friends from Japan. \n\nMonta has the best fried rice, and the best gyoza of any style asian\/japanese restaurant in town PERIOD. My only complain is the meat they put on top of the ramen bowls is small.
