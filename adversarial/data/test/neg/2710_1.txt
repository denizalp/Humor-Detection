This is a decent but unspectacular ice cream shop with slightly too high prices for ice cream that's not very distinguishable from what you'll find at the grocery store in most flavors or quality.  There are better options nearby like Sweet Moses and Churned, albeit more expensive.  If you just want a cheaper quick fix I guess this place makes sense.
