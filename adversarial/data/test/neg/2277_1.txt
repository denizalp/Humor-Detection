I originally just popped into their clearance store and spoke with Dennis.  I told him I wanted a new mattress but was really intimidated by the process. He talked me through what kind of sleeper I was, what I did\/didn't like about my current mattress ect.  He showed me some different options and when I realized they didn't really have many kings at the clearance center he got me the prices of a couple mattresses.  He then told me that it would be best if I went to their actual store because I could sample all the various kinds and decide for myself (giving up his commission, which he didn't mention but I realized).\n\nWhen I went to the actual store Dennis had called Melissa (store manager) and told her what I was looking at.  She was great.  She showed me the different options in all brands and didn't seem to mind my two toddlers running around.  She was even great when I said I wanted to sleep on it.  She was great about explaining all of the \"small print\" so I feel like I really understand what I pruchased.  So far we're super happy with the choice and experience!
