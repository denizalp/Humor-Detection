AMAZING BEER!  They brew it right on sight.  I love their Headhunter IPA.  I highly suggest you get their sampler on your first visit.  It offers 12 different 4oz samples of their own beers.\n\nAs other yelpers stated this used to be the old Danny Boy's Farmers Market, and the owners did a wonderful job of remembering that they were there first.  In fact they still sell a crafted root beer from the original recipe from Danny Boy's.\n\nThe food is pretty good - the wings especially.  They are offered in two varieties.  Smoked (highly suggest), and then the regular deep fried variety.  They have a great selection of sauces to choose from, too.  The sandwiches are not exactly what I consider to be home runs, but it's not for lack of effort.  Fat Head's seems to be following the \"hyper sandwich\" formula by offering more than just burgers, or to use their nomenclature \"Headwiches\".  They have one called the Parma Karma that is loaded with perogies, brats,and bangers among other things.  \n\nIt's not that I'm against that type of sandwich, but when you visit a place like this often it tends to get too much.  I do recommend their buffalo calamari.  Their take on this has roasted red peppers, blue cheese, and buffalo wing sauce.  Really yummy.\n\nSeating should never really be an issue as the place is huge, and they can certainly entertain large groups.  If you're looking to sit at the bar it's a different story as these seats fill up the quickest.  There's also outdoor seating for the summer time,
