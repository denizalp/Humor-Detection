I'm always surprised at the smaller restaurants in Vegas hotels... Crush was amazing from start to finish. If you can, call or use a reservation app to get on the list a day or two in advance so you won't be disappointed. Also, the back seating area is private and a bit more quiet. The front seat in the area is open air and louder. Both are awesome depending on what you're feeling. Good wine list with a variety of choices from small to big... bottles and prices! ;-)
