I'm not sure how long this place has been open but it's new to me so I was pretty excited to try it.  I tend to like a light soup for lunch and it seems that I'm always in search of a great place.  \nWe came here just before noon on a Friday and the place was pretty full, but we had no trouble getting a seat.  Sat down and noticed the water was already waiting on the tables for us.  In fact, the water was waiting on every table.  I'm not sure how much I like that idea.  Not only was it room temperature, it kind of makes you think about people walking by your table before you get there and sneezing.  That being said, I drank mine during the meal and reached over to the next empty table and stole theirs.  I would have preferred if someone would have refilled mine but they seemed pretty busy and not quite used to the crowds.\nWe ordered the Coconut Prawns as an appetizer and it came pretty quick.  I enjoyed it, but I don't know if I enjoyed it $3.00 per prawn.  \nI had the Satay Chicken Pho, well that's what I ordered anyway.  What showed up was beef.  I hope.  The meat was raw. (I know, I know, which is how they serve beef Pho)  I just don't think I've ever had chicken served that way.  I ate it, thinking it looked like beef, hoping that it was.  It was ok for flavor.  Nothing I will rush back for, but good enough to try again.\nMy wife had a beef vermicelli bowl and she said that once the flavors all mixed together it was pretty good.\nThis place was ok.  It did not knock my socks off but I'm sure in the Ultra-competitive downtown market they will either improve or be replaced.
