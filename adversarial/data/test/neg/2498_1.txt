I work downtown and occasionally visit this location.  Sara, the cashier was OUTSTANDING! She instantly knew exactly what I liked to eat and drink and it completely threw me off, in a good way of course!  Everyone there is always pleasant however, Sara is one of the best.  Keep her around.. she's definitely one in a million!
