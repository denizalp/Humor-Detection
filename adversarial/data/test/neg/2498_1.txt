What thai is it? It's THAI TIME!!! Thai food is amongst my favorites of cuisines. A bite of any of the dish at Banh Thai will have you tasting the exoticness of Thailand right here in North Carolina. How much better can it get?! Our waitress was very friendly, and the service was great. The only thing I would change is the lack of variety on the menu. There aren't a whole lot of options when it comes to the curry dishes. They are each delicious nonetheless! :)
