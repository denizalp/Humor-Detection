Husband uses Avis and never usually has problems... except at this location. His preferred status doesn't mean crap because a car is never preassigned and ready. To make things worse, the workers are so unfriendly. No smiles. No customer service skills. They are abrupt with customers and seem like they hate their jobs. Thinking it's time for us to switch back to Budget.
