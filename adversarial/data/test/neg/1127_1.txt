From OC. First time here. Friday night. Surprised to see live Hawaiian music and hula. Was tempted to dance when the guitarist asked if there were any other hula dancers out there but didn't want to embarrass myself since I'm so rusty.  Ordered the roast pork loco moco. The serving size was huge!  I couldn't finish it so I doggie bagged it. 3 girls from a local halau did a nice hula auana. Made me want to do hula again. Anyways this is a great place to eat with friendly people and a friendly atmosphere.
