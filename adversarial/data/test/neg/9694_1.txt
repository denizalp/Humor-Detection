I was prom dress shopping with my sister-in-law and mother-in-law. After walking up and down the mall, we decided to take a quick break at Caketini. I was drawn in because they had a chalk sign that said \"coconut cr√®me tea\" and I'm a sucker for anything coconut. I asked the employee about the tea and she explained it was a specific blend of coconut tea that can be served hot or iced. I asked which was more popular and went with her suggestion - iced tea. While she brewed my tea, we gazed longingly into the display case, trying to figure out which cupcake or cake pop looked the best. Being the coconut fanatic I am, I went with the coconut cake pop. It was delicious! Really, it was the perfect size - two bites of delicious coconut and chocolate. My sister-in-law also got a cake pop, but I can't remember the flavor. Mine was just so good that I blocked out everything else. While we were enjoying the cake pops, the employee brought me my iced coconut tea. It was good but not amazing or overly sweet. Overall, I'd definitely stop by and try another cake pop.
