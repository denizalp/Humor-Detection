Best gym in Vegas! People move here from around the world to train here(Me being one of them I moved from San Diego to be at this gym) \n\n1. Syndicate MMA's head coach John Wood is the only person in NV to take a complete amateur all the way to UFC. \n\n2. Casey's BJJ classes are very unique because unlike other gyms Syndicate MMA gives you a curriculum so you know EXACTLY what you're learning and will need to learn to advance. Not to mention the OTHER BJJ Coach is Tom Lawlor who is a college wrestler BJJ Black Belt and fought top 10 in the UFC. You get to train with him as part of your membership even as a BEGINNER!\n\n3. Coach Walker and Grindle and very technical and fun kickboxing coaches and have classes separated for you from Beginner to advanced so no matter your skill level they get you in the right classs\n\n4. This is the most important! SYNDICATE MMA IS LIKE A FAMILY! They have BBQs, open houses and holiday events for you to bring your friends and family to! The team hangs out together outside of the gym and everyone is super friendly and welcoming! \n\nAsk for Chelsea or Mary at the front desk! They're super helpful and will show you everything you need in this amazing 15,000sq ft facility!!\n\n** oh I almost forgot if you have kids the coaches are Coach Roxanne who is currently Top10 in the UFC and wrote the book Happy Warrior! Coach Rick who is not only a former UFC fighter but also a school teacher! Jessy Jess who is Top 10in the UFC and Coach Walker who is not only a pro fighter but also a FATHER and his son Brody(10) is in class ... so you're kids get awesome attention from some of the best martial artists on the planet who are also VERY good with kids who are super helpful and who care  **
