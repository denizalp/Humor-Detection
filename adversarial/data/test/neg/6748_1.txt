I went to Diamond Jim's based on the reviews here on Yelp and was not disappointed. I've gone twice in the last few months to sell some gold pieces that didn't fit, were broken or had missing matches. The first time the owner's son helped me and I ended up leaving with over $500 for what I thought was a small amount of mismatched pieces of gold! Last week I went back again with a couple rings and a thin chain and was helped by the owner, Jim. Left with almost $300.  I went back because they are extremely friendly, knowledgeable and fair. You can sell gold anywhere but I know there are plenty of places that likely aren't paying as fair a price or are as honest as the people at Diamond Jim's. I haven't purchased anything there, but from what I've seen they have a lot of unique jewelry you wouldn't find at a chain jeweler.
