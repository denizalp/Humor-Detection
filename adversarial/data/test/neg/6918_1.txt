So i'm eating my left overs and as i was chewing , i felt something cracking and felt like a piece of glass!!  I spit it out and that white little thing was in my food!!!!!! I was lucky it didnt swallow it . Be careful next time prepping the food , cuz you might have a suit filed against you if you're not careful again!
