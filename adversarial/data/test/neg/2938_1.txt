Had an ok Dinner with friends at this restaurant. The focaccia bread was dry and not flavourful. The waitress brought another serving which was not as dry. My garlic pawn pasta had good garlic flavour, the pasta was nice but I'm sure I was served shrimp not pawns. We all expected more from a restaurant with Jamie's name on and associated with it.
