So I think I was expecting a lot more since it was 4 stars with 200+ reviews.  \n\nFirst, don't forget to check into mobile Yelp, they will give you 10% off of your bill!\n\nThe service was excellent, they were super friendly and seemed to love where they worked.  \n\nThe atmosphere was nothing amazing.  If it had not been cold, we might have sat outside, but then we would have had to deal with the squawking birds from the Perch (not a good place to go, see my review of that place). \n\nThe food was good but not great.  They do have a nice wide variety of breakfast options.  They have something I always want but never see, a pick your own combo plate!  I was so excited because they had \"Hawaiian French Toast,\" but I did not want to order an entire order.  On the combo you can choose 1 slice.  I also went with scrambled eggs, hash browns (extra crispy), and ham.  For 2 eggs, the serving seemed a little light.  The hash browns, despite being extra crispy, were a little greasy, and the ham steak was good but way too thin.  \n\nWill I come back?  Probably will, since there are not a ton of breakfast spots near my parents home when I come to visit.   Next time I may enjoy it more since I don't have the over hyped 4 stars in my mind.
