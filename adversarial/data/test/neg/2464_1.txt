This place is AWESOME!\n\nWhile in LV had my car window smashed in and my GPS stolen.\nHotel security recommended Safelite AutoGlass.  \n\nCalled them at 11:30 am and asked about their Mobile service, but they couldn't come to the hotel until 5:00 pm.  Asked if I could drive the car over and get an earlier appointment. They gave me a 1:00 pm appointment!\nThey quoted me a price over the phone which was very reasonable.\n\nThey are located in North LV and since I didn't have my GPS anymore, I used my iPhone to navigate my way over.\n\nGot there a little early and parked in the back of the warehouse building.  \nA service technician came out a few minutes later and asked if he could be of help.  From that point on, the service was super.\n\nDirected to the front office where they have a nice clean waiting room and very friendly receptionist.  Waiting room has TV, magazines, newspapers, etc..  They also have very clean restrooms!\n\nI was in and out of there in only 30 minutes!  They vacuum all the broken glass fragments, clean all the windows, and even give you a free can of glass cleaner!!   They also offered free drinks (non-alcoholic) too!  Amazing place.\n\n I was extremely impressed with their service!!  \n\nRick Daniel was the service technician who serviced the car, and he is the type of guy you like to have as your next door neighbor and best friend.  He is really super!!!\n\nHighly, highly, recommended!!
