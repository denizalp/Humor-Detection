I popped in for breakfast this past Wednesday morning.  Their cash registers were having technical issues and could take cash only, which was not a problem, but I thought I should note the technical hiccup.  I ordered a vanilla latte, which was delicious, and toast and jam.  Though the staff were very friendly, it took a good 15 minutes to get my toast and jam, and then when it arrived, it didn't come with the raspberry jam I thought the board said was included.  Instead, I got two packets of Smucker's jam.....which I could have at any chain dining establishment.  However, I didn't say anything because I had already waited long enough.  The bread (wheat) was good though the edges were a bit burnt.  The bakery itself is gorgeous--impeccable decor and VERY comfortable\/cozy.  I would eat here again just for the atmosphere and location.
