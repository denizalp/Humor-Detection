First time here and over all I liked this place. I came in for Happy Hour. It's clean, the Bartenders we're friendly and made sure I never had to wait for a fresh refill. \n\nThe Bar has video slot machines which were Tight with a capital T and even though I sadly kept loosing money, I still was happily consuming tasty drinks and Chips and Salsa at happy hour prices.\n\nThe House Margarita tasted (Tony the Tiger) GRRRREight, so was the Modelo Dark Draft served in a large chilled glass with a lime slice that I swilled down with great lewd gusto.\n\nThe Chips and Bean dip was decent, but what really shined was the red and green Salsas. The best I think I've had in Las Vegas since being a San Diego transplant many years ago...so I ate all that was put in front of me and even asked for some to go.\n\nI ordered a large Albondigas soup to go as well with all the trimmings which are generally sliced Limes, Spanish Rice, chopped onions and Cilantro and crushed red pepper, all Muy importante preparaciones for an anticipated hangover the next day. Si Si Senor!\n\nWhat I actually got, I discovered to my dismay after Greedily opening the bag while hungover the next day and looking for my cure...was a large Fideo Soup instead and more Bean dip rather than Spanish Rice \/\/\/sigh x@#&%!! at least the chopped Onions and Cilantro and limes were there, but Sheesh! Hay Carumba! Vas Ist Das! Mein Gotte In Himmel !!! Oh thank Heaven they sell Alka Seltzer at 7\/11...
