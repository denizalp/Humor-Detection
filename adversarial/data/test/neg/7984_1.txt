Small local gym in the Southwest side of Las Vegas for people who would rather not wait for amusement part-like waits at major gyms such as LVAC. I've been told by every LVAC subscriber that I've met that the only flaw which is the major flaw of that gym it is overcrowded beyond fire safety capacity limits.\n\nYou won't have that same issue here at Edge. At least not during the evening time (5pm - 7pm). There is even an Olympic rack for deadlifts and powercleans. \n\nOnly flaw in that this is a small gym is that there is only one bench press. But apparently, I'm not waiting like most people at LVAC.
