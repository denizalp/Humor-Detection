Are you fucking kidding me?\n\nI made the mistake of walking in here spontaneously with a visiting friend. Service was disorganized, indifferent and at some point a waitress actually gestured for me to come up to the front desk in order to speak to her because she was engrossed in a conversation with the other wait staff. This was the tip of the iceberg. \n\nThe chicken I was received in my curry appeared to be precooked and a strange spongey textured but pink\/gray appearance. Upon showing it to the waitress, she apologized and also remarked that all of their meat looks like that. Please take my word for this: I eat some grimy, awesomely cheap food and absolutely love it. Meat quality is not a sticking point for me. I don't even need to know what it used to be in its past life, but it has to at least look and taste like meat.\n\nThe beef I was given was similar in texture but passable. The service was, again, slow and unprofessional but maybe they're working out the kinks. Most importantly, of the 3 dishes we ordered, and the original replaced curry, none would have been particularly satisfactory for a home cook working off some FoodNetwork.ca recipe of the week, much less a restaurant in such a prime location. They seem to have put more effort into the decor than the food, as the Thai cuisine seems almost an afterthought. \n\nPre-cooked, texturally unappealing ...meat?... inconsistent vegetable prep, mediocre spicing, and poor service.
