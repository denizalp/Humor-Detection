Well, what to say about Taberna...  I gave them another shot after not being impressed the first time I was there.  I first went right after they opened and had hoped they'd gotten it together since then.  First, the highlights, our server was excellent; personable and attentive, and my dinner was delicious.  I had the carnitas, which was slow roasted and then flash fried, so it had a great crunchy texture on the outside and was juicy and delicious on the inside.  Absolutely spot on.  The carnitas was, however, my 3rd choice, as they were out of the first two things that I wanted.  Not impressive for a Friday night when a restaurant should be on it's 'A' game. I was also served a dirty plate; that's a rookie mistake.  The restaurant did make up for it, though, with free guacamole and a round of drinks.  A free margarita is enough to make me happy.  If Taberna continues to work out the kinks with their menu (and has all their dishes available), this could be a place that I'd be happy to go to all the time.
