Dr. Troupe and the team at Polished Dental do absolutely outstanding work all around. I used to prefer getting shots over going to the dentist -- after my experience at Polished Dental, I feel in charge of my dental care and cared for.\n\nI'm new to the area and needed emergency care -- I was able to see Dr. Troupe that afternoon. The front desk offered me tea \/ coffee, took care of all my insurance questions, and signed me up quickly\/easily for a cleaning appointment the following week. At my cleaning, the hygienist was gentle and thorough and was genuinely interested in getting to know me as a patient. My entire experience was easy and inviting -- it is such a friendly environment. \n\nFinally, Dr. Troupe is extremely bright, thoughtful, diligent, and, like the rest of the team, warm. After my emergency care and my cleaning, he patiently explained to me in detail what was happening with each one of my teeth and outlined for me a new regimen for my dental care. He took the time to sit and talk with me, and he followed up every appointment with a summary email. Unlike so many other experiences at the doctor, Dr. Troupe actually cares about my dental health. I am so grateful! HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
