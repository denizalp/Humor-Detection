I've seen the mixed reviews.  Let me start by saying this really isn't your typical Chinese restaurant.  This would be considered to be Chinese food, Hawaii style.  All of us who grew-up on Chinese food from Hawaii will step in and feel at home.  Most of the best places were hole-in-the-wall-hard-to-find but had the best food. Please don't judge this place too harshly because it really does cater to us relocated Hawaii locals. \n\nEverything that I have ordered here brings me back to the Chinese restaurants back home.  They have specialties here that others in Vegas don't have.  Cold ginger chicken, cake noodles, crispy gau gee...I'm in HEAVEN!  My hubby's favorites are the honey walnut shrimp & the lemon chicken.  Both are very yummy!\n\nIt may not be much to look at and it may not be the \"best\", but for me this place definitely brings me home, just for a bit.
