Yummy, I loved Sunsational's iced coffee. The owner made the reasonably priced treat for me and included just the right amount of half n' half and sugar. Sunsational actually makes the coffee fresh for their iced coffee so it's just the right strength and ultra fresh. In addition to great coffee beverages, Sunsational has a wide selection of baked goodies, free wi-fi, and a laid back desert vibe. Head on over to Sunsational Coffee and you just might get a pleasant Surprise!
