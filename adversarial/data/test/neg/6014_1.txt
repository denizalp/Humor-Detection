Being amongst the funemployed, the matinee deals at local cinemas are somewhat of a regular occurrence for me.  Today, my movie crew graced the not so Regal Phillips Place \"Stadium\" 10.\nOkay, it is a quaint little theater for those that had a few cabernet sauvignons at Dean and Deluca and wanted to stroll down to see one of maybe five or six movies that have semi-recently come out.  But for those of us that want the latest in movie experiences, they come up amazingly short.  \nFor starters, the matinees are $7.50 compared to $5.00 at most other, better appointed theaters.  You have your standard overpriced soda, popcorn, and candy deals.  Those are expected.\nBy definition, it IS stadium seating in the theaters.  Meaning that the row behind you is higher and so on and so forth.  But you have four or five seats divided by a huge railing.  The seats are the old 80's style flip downs at best and leave much to be desired in the form of comfort.  \nWe found ourselves abandoning the traditional \"midway up the steps is your best seat\" since we were then sitting above the top of the screen.  I have been in better home theaters...
