I wish there was a way to give Campechano 6 stars - the service, food, and people were that amazing.\n\nWe were a party of six adults and three newborn babies.  We had an early reservation and the staff went out of their way to accommodate us and assist us with our strollers.  I know that it's tough when you have to serve a party with that many babies, but the staff were extremely helpful and very nice.\n\nThe ceviche and gaucomole with chips were top notch.  The Campechano and Pollo al Pastor tacos were wonderfully spicy and extremely delicious.  The serving sizes are generous, and the food is well balanced in flavour and spice.\n\nMy husband ordered the red sangria and even though he is not a big drinker, was tempted to order another - it was that delicious.
