Bloor West Village, where Dr. Generosity is located, is a neighborhood that's dominated by young families.  And \"Dr. G\" (as locals call the restaurant) caters to its dominant demographic -- kiddie menus, Bumbos, high chairs are readily available.\n\nThe food is primarily comfort food.  Starting with brunch, you get generous portions with solid, consistent quality.  The varieties of egg benedicts are popular.  The dinner is hearty, usually some tasty specials for most evenings.  My favourite is the Liver and Onions plate with a side of sweet potatoes.\n\nIt is a crowded restaurant.  Expect a long line-up for weekend brunches.  Dinner is the same way, but they do take reservations.  Unfortunately, my last visit came with a 30-minute wait despite a reservation made 3-days in advance.  There's no waiting area except the bar up front, which is usually crowded.\n\nOverall, it's a comfortable and warm place to dine with your family.  If you bring a first date, be prepared to have an uncomfortable conversation about your appetite for kids in your future.
