Use to be one of our favorite places to get a fast meal when they first opened, not no more.  These folks forgot how to cook good Chinese food with all the worker changes over the years.  Thinking of eating here, DON\"T, go up the street to China-A-Go-Go or down the street to Albertson shopping center-food is way better.  These Mexican cooks are not trained the right way.
