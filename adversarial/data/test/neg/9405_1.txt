Food was good and place has potential, but unfortunately we had a bad experience. Waitress spilled margaritas on us, and my friend got a little wet.  No problem, except they didn't even offer to discount our ticket or offer free drinks, which is kind of expected in this industry after you spill drinks on your customers.   Also, waitress was MIA a few times throughout our meal despite being only customers in the restaurant.
