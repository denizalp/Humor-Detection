Koo Koo Chicken is a small restaurant in a strip mall at Creditview and Eglinton. They specialize in Taiwanese style fried chicken. Taking pride in the freshness of their dishes, they give you notice that the wait time for your food can be as long as 20 minutes in order to prepare the chicken in the freshest way possible. \n\nThey have a variety of combos centred around their signature fried chicken, and they also tackle many other aspects of Taiwanese cuisine. For my first visit, I ordered combo #1, which includes fried chicken steak (literally a basketful), a basket of fries, and a medium drink. No, not the boring old can of pop or bottle of water, but traditional Taiwanese style drinks. I went with the original milk tea with tapioca. For $9.95, a basketful of chicken and fries and a milk tea? Great value. \n\nOn to the quality of the food - the drinks came first, after about 5 minutes. The milk tea here is absolutely superb. I haven't had anything like it since I went to Asia earlier this year. Next came the fries - they were thinly cut, similar to McDonalds' but more firm and less salty. Also great. After another 5 minutes, the chicken came. The quantity was overwhelming, but in a good way. The quality, as we soon found out, was just as remarkable. It was a unique blend of spices and seasonings that keeps you interested throughout the meal. \n\nOne thing I liked about the tables was that each one had a set of 6 types of seasonings, along with the typical sauces (ketchup, etc.). Seaweed flakes, curry chicken seasoning, lemon chicken seasoning, black pepper, plum seasoning, and a shaker simply marked \"spicy\" - Koo Koo has something for everybody. Of course, I had to try every single one. I'd have to go with the seaweed as my favourite, while plum definitely gets the award for most interesting. \n\nI gotta admit, while I loved the experience, the while look of the restaurant was a little off-putting. It was very clean, but the decor just didn't make sense to me. Between the patterned carpet, yellow walls, and the corny, totally irrelevant stickers on the walls, the design of the restaurant left a little more to be desired. One of the walls read, I kid you not, \"I miss you because I never miss you.\" You can't make this up!\n\nOverall, I'm so glad to have Koo Koo Chicken in Mississauga. There are few Taiwanese restaurant options in the city, which is vastly disproportionate to the quality of their food. I look forward to trying the other Taiwanese dishes at Koo Koo in my future visits.
