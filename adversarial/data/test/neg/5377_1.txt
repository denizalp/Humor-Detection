We came here for a friends birthday and had HORRIBLE service for only 7 people!!! They put us at an awful table when we had made early reservations. Then, they ignored some people in the party and didn't take their drink orders. Then he forgot to bring or order a drink for 1 person in party and the drink finally came 30 minutes later. Next, they didn't order a dinner for 1 member of party so all food arrived but hers. When they finally brought it the waiter accidentally spilled water all over one person putting the food down and didn't even apologize!! He gave us attitude when we asked for more napkins!!! Horrible service don't bother coming here!! Rude manager Ian too. Didn't even help.
