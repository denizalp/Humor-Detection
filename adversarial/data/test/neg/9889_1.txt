Island Style serves up affordable, delicious bibimbap and banchan with attentive and sweet service. This pocket gem can be hard to find and I was finally notified of its existence when my co-workers suggested it for lunch.\n\nMy favorite parts of a Korean meal are the complimentary banchan plates and hot tea and this place delivered. The standard kimchi, sprouts, and pickled cucumbers tasted sour and \"fresh\". Surprises included tasty diced franks saut√©ed with onions; boiled peanuts; steamed broccoli; and salty, dried tiny fish. But don't expect all of this in one meal. Every visit yielded different banchan plates and that's totally fine in my book. \n\nThe signature bibimbap was executed very well. It's served hot and the medley of diced vegetables, sliced steak, steamed rice, and a fried egg came out perfectly like Kim Yuna landing a triple lutz. The serving size is ridiculously generous and I NEVER finished.  It's served two ways: regular bowl ($8.95) and hot spot ($9.95). I personally liked the regular bowl better because the hot pot can turn the rice super crispy and that those little suckers will get stuck in your molars. But the hot pot is fanciful and the sizzling caused me to oohh and ahhh. Definitely, a dish if you desperately want attention from others.
