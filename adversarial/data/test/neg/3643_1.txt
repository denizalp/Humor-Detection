TOTALLY SATISFIED from the food to the service! The food is hot, fresh and delicious. The restaurant is clean and organized.  And the people are kind, friendly and genuinely interested in making your dining experience a good one.\n\nHad the hamburger steak extra gravy over rice and the chicken saimen..  highly recommended! Super comforting and YUMMY!!!
