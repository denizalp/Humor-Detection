I found this cute little niche spot for lunch when I was working nearby. I was excited to have a variety of vegetarian and vegan options. I also like the relaxed atmosphere and artsy vibe. You order at the counter, and find a seat. I sat on the patio, as it was a sunny and balmy 68Â° . The machiatto coffee was really good with coconut milk .\nI ordered the Roasted Veggie wrap which comes out warm and with the tortilla grilled on the outside. When the plate was first put in front of me, I was a little surprised that it didn't come with a small side of hummus or salsa that typically accompanies wraps, and also missing was any side at all. No chips, grapes, fries, not even a pickle spear. Nothing at all. So it was a wrap on a big empty plate. I did ask for something for a sauce, and they were accommodating, and brought me some balsamic vinaigrette, and some vegan cheese they call Pleezsh. I will give them the wrap is delicious! The Pleezsh actually was the icing in the cake. It enhanced everything so much more. I will definitely be back when I'm in the area. However, I do think it is a bit spendy especially considering that there are no sides, and think that should be considered on their wrap or sandwich plates in the future. But, overall nice vibes, friendly staff, and great food!
