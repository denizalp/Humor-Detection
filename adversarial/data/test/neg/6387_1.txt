I've been visiting this salon for over a year for sugaring; it's one of the few places in Pittsburgh that offers this wonderful alternative to wax.  It's such a lovely little salon, just down the way from the insanely busy part of Murray Ave on a more quiet stretch.  I've seen two estheticians since I started coming here.   One has since moved to a different salon, so now I see Laura.  She is very skilled at her job, easy to talk to, and quick.  All are quite important qualities in an esthetician, and the last is especially appreciated for reasons that anyone who has ever had a sugaring (or waxing, for that matter) can understand.  The salon itself is tastefully done, always clean, bright, and the staff are friendly.  I live on the complete opposite side of town, and I find that this is worth the trip.
