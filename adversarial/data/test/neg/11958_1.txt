I really appreciate the fact that they only carry products they believe in and would feed their own pets. I enjoy learning about veterinary nutrition and enjoy the friendly staff every time I visit. These guys also support a lot of local rescue organizations which makes me feel even better when I spend a small fortune there. Go in, ask questions, if they don't know, they'll find out!
