I was a little lost when I first got there. Parking was easy but thankfully there was a security guard that took me right to the office. As soon as I walked in I checked in. I was unsure my insurance would cover the visit and that wasn't cleared until after my pap. Which I didn't find to be a problem I had a feeling my temporary insurance didn't cover much. When I went in there was a student that did the exam, not the most comfortable and I was not aware he would be putting the speculum in. He had not put it in right and it was incredibly uncomfortable having him move it around. Schlotterer was very nice but that was it. I didn't get much explained and it was my first time at that office. I didn't have a bad experience but I also didn't have the best.
