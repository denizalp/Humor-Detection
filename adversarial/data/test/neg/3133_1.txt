Rich is incredibly knowledgeable and genuine. I just moved into a new house and had him over to look at plumbing issues. He fixed everything great and didn't leave a mess. Pricing was very fair and I can tell he takes pride in his work. If you're looking for the BEST plumbing service then your search is over. This is the guy!
