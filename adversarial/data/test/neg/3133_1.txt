This was me and my boyfriends first time riding on the gate way clipper, I have lived in Pittsburgh all my life and I learned new stuff I hadn't known and everyone was very nice, I just think the pictures that they wanted for $35 weren't that nice with the dinner plan we had, I wanted pictures as a keepsake considering it was our first time but they didn't turn out as nice as I had hoped
