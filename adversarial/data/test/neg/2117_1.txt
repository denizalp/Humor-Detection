Good finish after a rocky start - our steaks were all way overcooked.  Our server had our orders re-made beautifully and then comped our wine, salads and dessert without being asked.  The manager on duty was very nice and concerned and we ended up having a great time.  The hit of the evening was the pineapple upside down cake with handmade coconut ice-cream - OMG!
