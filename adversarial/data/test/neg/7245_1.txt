My first review on yelp! and in-n-out is definitely worthy of it.\n\ni was stoked to hear that a new in-n-out formed on trop and fort apache, an in-n-out less than 10 min drive from my house! (other in-n-outs i would have to drive no less than 15 min). so i decided to check this new location out yesterday. it was my first time eating in-n-out this year since i was in philly attending school. I had my fair share of descent quality fast food restaurants in philly (five guys, 500 degrees) but none of them come close to in-n-out status...whenever i would go to a fast food restaurant in philly, the in-n-out song would always play in my head...\"in-n-out...IN-N-OOOUUUTTT! thats what a hammmburgers allll about!!\" thats how much i missed it...\n\nanyways, this is what i usually get: double-double, animal style (chopped and grilled onions) with extra lettuce and tomatoes (no extra charge), fries, and a coke. if im in the mood for it, i ask for animal style fries (chopped\/grilled onion and their \"special sauce\" added to the fries) and a strawberry milkshake. i also usually ask for extra spread (their packaged \"special sauce\") and chili peppers (if you like some spice to your meal). their buns are always perfectly toasted, their meat patties are always flavorful and juicy, their vegetables are always fresh and tasty, and their special sauce is to DIE for...and the fact that around $5 will get you a meal makes me think...why even think about going to another fast food joint?\n\nif you're the type who can't read long posting like this, ill try to make it as simple as possible:\n- ask me what my favorite movie of all time? I DONT KNOW\n- my favorite song of all time? NO CLUE\n- my favorite fast food joint of all time? EASY. IN-N-OUT\n\nthats what a hamburgers all about
