I called ten other bakers and this is the only place that said YES to a same day deliver. I need this for an early mother day girl to my friend in AZ. Not only did they say yes they where so helpfull and nice on the phone. They didn't change me astronomical prices either. Big points in my book. And to top it all off my girlfriend loved the little cakes. 5 stars all the way.
