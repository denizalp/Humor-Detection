This place has excellent food and drinks. Which is why it's a shame I won't be coming back. The last two times I dined with you I witnessed managers yelling at employees. A female manager jad gathered servers in the kitchen and started yelling and cursing about something. My children even remarked about the \"bad words\" she used. Normally I would brush this off as maybe a bad day but it was the second time I noticed this. My previous visit an older gentlemen yelled about dirty tables. I think asking for help will get you further rhan berating employees. Your servers are most likely hard working and under paid as it is. I refuse to support an establishment that treats employees that way. It's unfortunate.  I feel horrible for your staff.  There are better ways to communicate issues and more effective means of dealing with problems besides yelling and cursing.
