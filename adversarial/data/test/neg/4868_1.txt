Too bad there is jot an option for negative stars, or rather a falling star.  Steve's earned it today.  Lots of us having lunch together.  The results was the same....... Lunch sucked.  White chicken and bean chicken sorely lacked chicken.  Chicken was fresh from the deep freezer, lacking taste and texture. The bison burger was again a freezer bound burger, but took enough time to cook it , that it seemed as though they slit the animals throat themselves.  The fish tacos lacked zest.  But the beer was wet.   The Long wait did not make this meal taste any better in anticipation, but reinforced that we were glad we got this place out of the way..... Buyer beware.
