Planned to go to the Buffet at the Wynn for Sunday brunch, but being poor planners, we came late and the line was horrendously long. Luckily, spotted Red 8 and decided to give it a try. So glad we did! Yelp reviews weren't very promising, but the food was really good.\n\nThe restaurant itself is very nice, obviously Chinese themed. Menu has dim sum, noodles, and other traditional dishes. Service was great and we had a good time. Give it a go if you're considering eating here!
