Michael's. Is. Amazing.\n\nIf you ever get the chance, eat here. It's in the Barbary Coast (of all places!) but don't let that fool you. \n\nThe service is amazing. The food is amazing. Right now, I literally can not think of another word to describe this place. \n\nIt is probably the best restaurant I've ever eaten at. I know that it's really expensive. But I wouldn't know exactly how expensive. Because when they give you the menus, the women's menus don't have prices on them. I know. It sounds so old-school and sexist. But I'm actually really glad I don't know. \n\nThe service is impeccable. The setting is small and intimate. And the food. The food is to be savored. Each and every bite.\n\nDinner is an event. It takes several hours. Last I checked, they only took reservations at 2 times in the evening... I think it was 6pm and 9pm or something like that, anyway. And you MUST make a reservation. \n\nIt's totally worth every single penny you spend here. \n\n(Even if you're not a fan of fish, try the dover sole. *droool* So. Tasty.)
