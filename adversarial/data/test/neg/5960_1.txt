Absolutely love this shelter and it's staff. Would highly recommend it. We adopted our first dog about 2 years ago from AAWL it was love. We recently went back and adopted our second dog from them. The staff here goes above and beyond. We tried looking at other shelters in the area and none even come close in comparison to AAWL. AAWL's facility is so clean and nice. Again, if you're looking to adopt for the first time or if you've adopted in the past, AAWL is the place to go.
