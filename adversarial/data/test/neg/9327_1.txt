The range is small, but got some quality guns.  Plenty of space to sit or stand and watch through the class door range.  My guns never jammed (unlike other places I went to), and they did not rush me to finish shooting.  The instructors are great and gave me some basic info on how to operate the gun since I knew what I was doing already.  Be prepared to wait alittle before you can shoot.
