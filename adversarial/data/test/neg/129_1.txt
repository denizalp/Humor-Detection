Helpful staff and very comforting doctors and dental assistants. Best dental care I've had in years! \n\nI needed three root canals. Never having had a root canal, I naturally had a lot of questions about the procedure. The endodontist was very patient and answered all my questions and addressed all my concerns. And the staff helped me set up a payment plan that worked for us. \n\nThank you for your amazing service and taking care of me!
