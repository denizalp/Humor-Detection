I had a nice time at this very popular bar\/restaurant. \n\nI went on a Tuesday night at around 5 and it wasn't too busy up on the patio, we asked if we can sit at one of the long tables and the servers told us yes, but it was bar service only, no problem, a few minutes later we were told to move because a party of 6 were coming in. Now I did see some reservation signs on some tables but ours didn't have one, I didn't particularly enjoy moving, especially since the only seating left was at the bar, but we obliged and moved. \n\nThe space is awesome, I loved the beach picnic in the middle of the city vibe, complete with a food truck, wooden picnic tables, muskoka chairs and big yellow umbrellas. I can see why people choose to come here for an after-work drink to shake off the stressors of the day. \n\nI ordered a pint of the Pilsner and enjoyed it, it had a citrusy flavour to it and was quite good. I also ordered the cod po boy which was also pretty good. The bun wasn't great but the fish was fried nicely and had good flavour. We also got some fries and they were really good but for $7 and a pretty small portion, I'd probably skip it. \n\nThe bartenders were decently nice, I found they all had that sort of hipster attitude but I wasn't really bothered by it, everything came quickly and it was easy to pay and get their attention when needed. After about an hour or so, this place really filled up, while sitting at the bar, there were people crowded all around us trying to order drinks so I'd probably suggest trying to get a chair at one of the picnic tables if you don't want people in your personal space! \n\nOverall I'd come back for the ambiance. Drinks and food are a bit over-priced for what you get and I wasn't really blown away by it. I saw some people with the cocktails, there were some blue drinks in a mason jar and a pink watermelon looking drink that looked great but the prices for cocktails were around $15 or so, so I didn't really think it was worth it. Maybe next time though, if I just go for a drink. For the location and popularity, I can see why the prices are what they are, very typical Toronto prices, so don't expect any differently! \n\nGreat place for some drinks on a patio if you can get a seat!
