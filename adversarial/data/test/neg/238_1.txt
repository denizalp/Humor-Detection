The food was delicious and the ambiance was amazing the live entertainment was so nice especially because I was celebrating my birthday, however the service was a little slow we were there for 3 hrs and waited almost an 1 1\/2 to get our food. I think if our waiter would have come to our table just once to update us on our meal or apologize for the wait it would have made a difference especially when we saw others that were seated after us get their meals first.
