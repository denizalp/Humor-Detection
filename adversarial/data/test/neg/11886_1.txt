Got my first brow consultation here with Meghan and she was super nice and friendly.  She took the time to tell me what changes she was going to make, and if you need help with learning how to fill in brows, she shows you how. By the end, my brows, which I thought were sparse, actually looked fuller than before. There was literally no hair out of place. It was kind of expensive, but considering the quality of service, it was worth it. \n\nI just wish that it was closer to home because it was a 2hr commute.
