I come here all the time!!! They have this amazing crepes and hot chocolate. I personally recommend the breakfast burrito with the 'first time' crepe!! Amazing. And the people there are so nice and friendly you just want to keep coming there. They are not open on Mondays so don't bother to go there, just be patient and wait for Tuesday :)\nAnd they close around 2 every day that they are open.
