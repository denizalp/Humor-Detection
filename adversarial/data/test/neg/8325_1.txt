I stayed at this hotel on a whim due to a very last minute business trip. Although I was not looking forward to August heat in Arizona, the staff at the Renaissance made my stay incredibly enjoyable. From the valets offering me a cold bottle of water upon every arrival and departure, to the accommodating front desk\/room service staff, everything I could want or need was taken care of. It was clean, beautifully decorated, and without a doubt, my new go-to hotel in the area!
