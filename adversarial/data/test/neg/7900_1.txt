It doesn't get much better than giving hotel 5 stars and this one earned it. From the time I pulled up until leaving, it was great. Upon check in, I was given a room early which I know isn't always easy if everyone shows up at 12 pm. As an SPG club member, I was allowed access to the club floor with gorgeous views of Toronto and a fabulous breakfast. The workout facility\/pool are AMAZING. It was cold out but i swam in the heated indoor\/outdoor pool while using their lap lane. I also had a nice lunch salad at the restaurant, it was about $25 but this is par for the course at any hotels in the area. The beds were comfortable and the rooms were very nice, I would certainly stay again!
