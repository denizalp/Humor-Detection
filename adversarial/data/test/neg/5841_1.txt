I was looking to have something made for my brother and sister-in-law using the shards from their wedding glass.  Many other glass artists told me that they weren't able to do anything with it and I wasn't happy with the gaudy designs from any online companies. \n\nA friend recommended this place to me. They were able to design a custom piece in which them melted down some of the shards for the body and then used the glass shards to fill a hollow base.  Yhe price was on par with what I wanted to spend. I was very happy with my experience and the product..\n\nI have not taken any of their classes yet, but I'd be interested in doing so. The projects that I saw from the classes looked interesting.
