First time here, ordered the Chocolate Azteca latte I believe, I got the big size... OMG sooooo good!!! It was just what I was craving. You could taste the strong coffee, but it was wonderfully hidden under a creamy, milky, chocolaty cover that you just enjoyed it, the Grandota (big) was a bit much for me since I am not a regular coffee drinker and it filled me up because there's so much, so next time I'ma get the OG (medium), but if you are a regular coffee drinker, go all out.
