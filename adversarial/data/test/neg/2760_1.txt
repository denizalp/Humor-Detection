J Crimi Eyewear is definitely the best spot in town for tremendous service and chic eyewear. I have been buying my glasses from J Crimi since his store opened. I would not dare purchase glasses anywhere else. I have had a couple pairs of glasses break due to my own negligence and Jim has always been great about getting them repaired for me and he always does it with a hug and a smile. I could not be happier about the service I have received from Jim. \n\nWhenever someone tells me they need new glasses I will always refer them to J Crimi Eyewear because I know they will not be disappointed by the service or selection.\n\n Big shout out to Jim and owning the best place to get phenomenal eyewear.
