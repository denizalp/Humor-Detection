I booked through them a friday night at Marquee and my hotel reservations at cosmo. I spent more hours trying to validate that they were a legit company than I needed to but as you know.. its easy to get ripped off by these things. After a lot of time talking directly with Jeremy and Jeff and figuring out prices and changing number of people in the bachelor party, I took a gamble and decided to go with them. My step dad paid for everything via credit card which we were also worried about.. (which ended up being more than fine) and because of a mix up on either my step dads end or VIP's, they booked the wrong night... Saturday instead of Friday night. \n\nSo we get down to Vegas Friday night and I call them around 9pm to see whats going on... and then we all realized the mix up. I was pretty upset with them and thought.. wow these guys really messed up... So this was 48 hours from being a 1 star. But they came through as amazingly as one could ask. Within 20 minutes we had a limo downstairs waiting for us all to go to Excess and back.. they paid for everything... entry, limo rides, etc.. and the next day we did marquee as planned. They did a phenomenal job recovering from a simple mis hap that can happen to anyone and I know for a fact they did not make money on us. \n\nSome other comments are saying they charge double ... blah blah... thats BS. I tried to go through directly to the hotel and the prices were maybe $100 cheaper at best and you still dont get all the extras they offer... walking in to the table... sapphire bus trip.. etc etc. \n\nI promise I will use them from now on for every bachelor party I throw. Best decision I made. These guys rock! Jeremy and Jeff kicked ass down there and trust them when they say they are not ripping you off.. they are not a scam... and they are going to make sure you have a kick ass time down there...
