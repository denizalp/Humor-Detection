This was our last dinner on our vacation in Montreal. From the relaxed atmosphere, to the friendly staff, to the yummy amusebouche, we felt welcome from the start.  We did the 8 course \"choosing is missing out on the rest\"  prix fix menu.   Every course was great. But, the lamb and scallops were really perfect. The staff was fun and casual. The owner even took shots with us! We went to some good spots while in Montreal (Joe Beef, Toque)...this one was well above for overall experience and a bargain for what you get. Thanks to the staff and owner.
