Dick's Last resort is HILARIOUS!!! My family and I were staying at the Excalibur Hotel and concierge gave us a \"fast pass\" to pass the long line. When we were seated, the waiter place a long sheet of paper on our table, threw our silverware and straws, then demanded what we wanted to drink. They were dicks! Lol get it?? That's what was so cool about it. Their name of the restaurant says it all. However, if you want the service without them being a dick, they will provide that too. The hats they make by hand are hilarious too!!!!
