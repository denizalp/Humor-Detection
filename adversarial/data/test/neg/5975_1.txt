This is a great little cafe! Such a hidden gem:) they have lovely coffee and treats to pair.. The flavour of everything was fab! In a sea of chains in this area you'd be a total fool to go anywhere but here!! Great staff, they're very friendly and professional. For dT the price is very fair and reasonable for the quality of the products and portions.
