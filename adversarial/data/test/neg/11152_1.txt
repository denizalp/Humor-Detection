Definitely will go to HatClub again! \n\nCalled prior to my trip there since I wanted to make sure they had what I needed. Chris answered and was very friendly! He definitely knew what I was looking for and was able to help answer my questions.\n\nWhen I stopped by to buy the hat I needed they were very friendly. Not to mention I walked in there probably 2-5 minutes before they closed and they still were very good about it.
