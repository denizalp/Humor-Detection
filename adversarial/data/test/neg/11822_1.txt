In the busy area of Yonge & Eglinton, South St. Burger is located on a busy intersection. We arrived just after 1pm on Saturday and the place was bustling.  They have your standard burgers, you can get a small or regular size burger.  Fries are New York Fries (yum!), small, medium & large.  They have oodles of toppings to choose from.  They even have milkshakes - mocha as a flavour!!\n\nThe burgers were delish and fries were perfectly done.  I love the california spice they offer.\n\nPrice wise, South St is a premium burger which is trying to compete with Smoke's, Hero and the others a like.\n\nI really liked this location, there was ample seating to enjoy our meal.  \n\nI will definitely be back for my burger fix.
