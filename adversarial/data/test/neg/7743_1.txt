Currently living here and I am so happy with the apartment and the maintenance!!!  I have minor complaints, but wouldn't give it any less than 5 stars.  They keep the grounds so clean and beautiful.  It's a quiet community and our 2-bedroom has great layout, very cozy - not a small cozy, but a perfect layout!  It's conveniently located next to... everything!  My complaint would be the size of the closets in the smaller 2-bedroom (which I live in) and the insects, which is a major complaint to someone like me who suffers from entomophobia, but it's not because the complex is dirty or not well-maintained, but because the bugs out here in Vegas are serious and they are capable of making their way into your apartment, UNFORTUNATELY!!  Especially in the summer time!  The staff is very accommodating having the exterminator come and spray the inside and outside of your home weekly.  I would definitely recommend this place to a friend and even a family member!  I'm proud to call this place home.
