I report only the facts. This is regarding my experience at the location at 2428 N Scottsdale Rd on 12-6-17. It does not represent any other Midas location. Took my vehicle here for a oil change and tire rotation. Simple right? Nope. Since shops like this are often accused of not performing services that are paid for, I marked each of my tires with a black Sharpie before dropping off the vehicle, indicating what tire was where. LF for left front, LR for left rear, RF for right front, RR for right rear. After an hour, my vehicle was finished. I confirmed with the employee that the oil change and tire rotation were done. I went to the vehicle and looked for the markings on the tires. Sure enough, the tires were in the same location as they were when I arrived. No rotation done. I asked the Asst Manager, John, to take a look. He saw the markings and told the Manager, James. James goes out to the service bays where 4 employees were standing around eating and I hear him asking who did the service on my vehicle. Next thing I hear is James saying, \"It wasn't done and you guys are out here eating peppers. I want this done now.\" James walks over to me and says the mechanic \"forgot\" to do the rotation. I asked how it was possible to forget when all that had to be done was an oil change and rotation. James said he did not know but they would take care of it. I then told James that it makes me wonder what else was not done properly and it lowers the level of confidence and trust I have in the work that was or wasn't done. I asked if the right oil filter was put in (I had to pay $10.00 extra because my vehicle only takes the higher priced filter is what I was told). James said everything else was done right. I told James that had I not marked the tires, I would have driven off and never known they weren't rotated and that charging me for a service that wasn't performed constitutes fraud. James then says, \"It really isn't a big deal if you skip one tire rotation\". WHAT?? I asked James if he was really going to cover up what happened by now saying the rotation is not needed and it's no big deal. James said it wouldn't harm the vehicle to miss a rotation. I asked him if, since it had been 7,500 miles since the last rotation, and would most likely be 7,500 until the next rotation, would it be good for the tires or the vehicle to not be rotated for 15,000 miles. James said, \"it wouldn't be good for the vehicle but it wouldn't really be bad either.\" (The car gets finished and they park it near me and James). I told James I would have been happy to leave and not say anything about this experience to anyone or to leave reviews about it had he simply apologized and not said anything else, however, due to his shady way of covering for what happened by telling me the rotation wasn't really needed, even though I had paid for it, made me want to report him and his business so others would not be taken advantage of. James then told me I should leave. He said I was wrong for questioning whether the correct filter was installed and I was wrong for thinking anything else may not have been done correctly. Really?? I paid for a tire rotation that I was told was done, but it wasn't, and you are offended that I ask if all else I paid for was actually done?? I asked James for the name and phone number of his boss. He wrote down a name, Matt, and an email address. He said Matt is the owner and I could not call him. Said I had to send an email. I told James I would be doing that and James again told me I should leave. I emailed Matt at 11:30am and provided a few details and my phone number. Matt finally called me back at 5:10pm. I will not go into details here, as I plan to pursue this issue further, but Matt was less than caring about what had happened. He apologized for the \"service error\", but he would not elaborate or say anything except, \"I apologize for the service error today.\" I asked him if he wanted to apologize for how James handled the situation, telling me the rotation wasn't really needed or how he conducted himself. Matt said, \"I'm not going to discuss James with you.\" I asked 2 more times and for a total of 3 times he said, \"I'm not going to discuss James with you.\" At that point I told Matt that due to his poor handling of this serious situation, I would need to leave reviews online about my experience and it won't be positive. Matt said, \"that's fine, I look forward to reading them.\" He then hung up. I have presented only facts here of what happened today at the 2428 N Scottsdale location. I do not claim that all Midas locations would act the same and your experience may be different from mine. Buyer should beware and protect themselves from paying for services that are not actually performed, which may result in repairs being needed down the road that would otherwise not be needed if paid for services were done at the time they were paid for. There are more details that I am unable to provide at this time.
