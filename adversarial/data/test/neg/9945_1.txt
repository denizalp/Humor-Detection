The food in this place is really, really good. I would give it 5 stars if it hadn't been for the service. Don't get me wrong, everyone from the staff was extremely nice and helpful, the host especially was super awesome and attentive, the problem is, they need more staff. We had to wait a long time just to get water served, and a long time for our food. The food was great (had the summerlicious menu, with the flan and chicken shining as the biggest stars) and everyone in the staff was working super hard, but there were just too many customers for the number of staff. Maybe we just went during the wrong day or something. The decor is gorgeous, and we loved the ambiance in general. Hope to come back and taste their regular fare too!
