Came to celebrate a coworker's Birthday. We had a reservation so they were able to quickly accommodate our medium sized group. At a quick glance, their lunch menu was reasonably priced.\n\nFour people in my party ordered the fajitas which was a sight to see when they came out. They literally lit the skillet on fire and flames were jumping! After a bit the fire went out and we were served. \n\nI had the flautas which I usually enjoy at other Mexican restaurants. I ordered it in a crispy flour tortilla with grilled vegetables instead of beans and rice. I was surprised that my order was really good! Although they had large servings, I took home my leftovers and had them for lunch the next day. \n\nThe reason why I can't give them the full 5 stars is, as I don't speak Spanish, some of the waiters spoke really fast English and I could not understand them. Additionally, I felt like attitude was given from one person serving us, who I think may have been a manager. Not cool. \n\nOverall, I would probably eat there again if someone I knew wanted to go. I'm not the biggest fan of Mexican food, but I would definitely like to try other items on their menu.
