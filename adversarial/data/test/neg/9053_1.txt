I received a gel mani and pedi yesterday, after purchasing a Groupon with Carol. I was greeted with a warm welcome and cup of coffee promptly upon entering the salon. Carol was on time, knowledgeable about the salon products and one of the friendliest nail professionals I've ever met. My nails look amazing, and the attention to detail is beyond impressive. I'm looking forward to going back in the future. Great experience!
