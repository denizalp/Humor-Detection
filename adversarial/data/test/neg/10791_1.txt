We're from LA, more specifically....I'm born and raised in ELA. Sooooo....I guess you could say that I kinda Mexican cuisine snob.\n\nWith that being said....I was blown away with the flavor and originality of all the items we tasted.  Chicago style fries...A Must....chorizo taco...bomb....torta....good enough to make my Abuelita tear up with joy....RIP. \n\nDefinitely a must visit...and it's very friendly here too! In short...BOMB
