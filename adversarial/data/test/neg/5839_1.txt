Howlers is quickly becoming one of my favorite dive bars (dive bar in a good way , not all dive bars are good in the Burgh) but this one is and they have live music 5 nights a week.  Live music skews towards punk rock but they have hip hop,  R & B, country, and indie bands that play here.  \n\nThe sound is pretty damn spot on great for a smallish room..the Ben Dumm band played last Sat.  Check out the sound with the video I posted .  they're awesome--Speed metal meets 50s pop.  \n\nHowlers has one night with live band karoki which is awesome. I think it's Fridays. \nAlso, $2 PBRs and $2.50 miller high life!  Lastly one should note that they don't take any Ass pennies....;-).  What sitcom is that from?\n\nFind the sign and know the show and maybe the bartender will give you a free shot.  I doubt it but you never know, ask nicely.  Rock on!
