Horrible customer service. I have been to a lot of real estate agencies, but this place is the worst ever. The receptionist lady Gina was so rude to us because we had complicated conditions to rent a house. She had no effort to try to help us at all and didn't smile a bit. When you come in, you'll see the first person, that is her. \nSince they didn't run my credit so I was supposed to get my application fee back. She didn't even contact me until I contacted her. She told me to stop by to get my money back, so I went, she just threw all the paperwork and my application fee towards me. That is it. Nobody gave that attitude to me at real estate agency because you know what? The money is huge once you sell the house. \nWe are so disappointed that I couldn't even talk to her manager, but I don't care anymore. As long as they have her, I will not recommend this place forever. Do you even want to buy or rent a house with this customer service? What if you have some problems after you buy a house? I bet she might help you throwing the stuff you might need to you with no words. That was a huge waste of our time. Happily we got a place to live at the other place and that agency was way much better than here.
