This restaurant has been there for many years. Food good, freshly made,  and reasonably priced, with good sized helpings. Great fallafel...Decor a bit old and dark and could do with a remake. I have patronized the place many times. Unfortunately the wait staff seem to be getting more surly each time.....pity...as it makes for a less than pleasant experience.....
