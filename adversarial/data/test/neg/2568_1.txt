A very nice place, but a bit packed.  I enjoyed my shooting time and loved that I could shoot a full auto weapon.  The instructor was nice and fixed my jam on the brand new MP5 multiple times for me.  Was patient and the store has a great ambiance and nice people.\n\nTidbit - members get a free rental of a automatic rifle and 2 clips of ammo
