We came here based on rave reviews from the Food Network and many celebrities that have been here. Well, they must have been given special treatment none of which we were availed to upon our trip for brunch. We were starving so anything probably would have tasted good. There was a bit of a line on Sunday, March 6 around 11am, but it moved pretty quickly. We were seated and our server Steven came over right away. He took our drink orders and told us a bit about the menu (only because I asked) and then ran off. This was the most that we saw of him for the rest of our time there. My friend got the signature dish chicken and waffles. The chicken was marginal. We have had better. The \"bacon\" waffles were a joke. Of the 4 waffles only 1 had a piece of bacon running through the middle of it. They were so tough! We were given a tiny container of syrup for four giant waffles and since we didn't see Steven again, we couldn't ask for more! I ordered the basic breakfast which consisted of two eggs, bacon, a biscuit, fruit, and seasoned potatoes. There was nothing special about any of it and I was especially shocked at the size of the pieces of bacon. There were only two pieces of bacon and not two full pieces, two half pieces, so really one piece of bacon. Really?! The biscuit was hard as a rock, in fact it could have been. There were no condiments on my plate for it either. Steven NEVER checked back with us to see how our food was, so I had to flag him down to get something to put on it. (And in the end decided I didn't want to risk breaking a tooth on it anyway) The one and only refill I got on my coffee came from the busser Roger (from Thailand according to his name tag) who was working his butt off! I even had my empty coffee cup sitting on the edge of the table for 10-15 minutes and Steven walked by 3 times (at the end of our meal) and brought the check over and never refilled it!! Wow, really?! The coffee was terrible anyway so we just grabbed our check and left. Thank you to Roger though for being the one bright spot at Hash House. Don't go to this place. It is way overrated! They obviously feel like they can just pump out huge plates of food and people will be wowed and overlook everything else. Sad.
