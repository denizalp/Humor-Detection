I've had a few bad experiences here in terms of service and reservations, but tonight was great. Made my reservation with the NoWait app and had no issues. Food was great, drinks were great, waiter was the best (Can't remember name - possibly Joseph??). Totally redeemed itself. Will likely be back, via the NoWait app.
