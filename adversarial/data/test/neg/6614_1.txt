I've been here twice before and I believe I went to a small, soft spoken lady. I believe her name is Rita. Today was my third visit and I went to an older lady but I didn't catch her name. I don't know why but I had a bad feeling as soon as she started threading my eyebrows. I tried to groom them myself a while ago but I failed, so one of the inner corners looks a little wacky. It looks fine after she fixed it, but overall, my brows look thinner than before. I thought they looked good when I glanced at them in the shop. But the more I stare at them, the worse they look. She spent a long time threading and I could feel her plucking extra hairs. Also, my brows now look quite uneven. Now I have to grow them out for a couple months so they can be threaded to how they used to look. Needless to say I am not very satisfied with my visit and I will not be returning.
