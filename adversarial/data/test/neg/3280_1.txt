Typical chain type bar. Less than average food quality. Although it appears scratch made, the taste resembles frozen, pre-made. On the higher price range of the same frozen bar food you can get anywhere else. $10.00 for Potato Skins, Really?\nSome items are scratch made but the quality leaves a lot to be desired. Pizza crust has no flavor, seems pre-made\/mass produced, Burgers are average and not seasoned. No testing of the Entree's as I had no desire to go any farther.\n\nHost UFC Fights yet they are never prepared for the crowds. Understaffed is an understatement. Takes 10-15 minutes to get a drink. Food took close to 30 minutes on both occasions. Untrained staff operating sound system. Continuously turning sound off and turning music on. Only a $5 Cover Charge for UFC fights is the cheapest in Vegas next to Buffalo Wild Wings and that is about the only Positive that stands out. They let the place get way over capacity to where you cannot walk through the place to get to the restrooms.
