This is a local chain spot that's not a bad spot for lunch if it's close to your work or you're just nearby.  Nothing here to go out of the way for, but they do have a few decent items:\n\nMexican Chicken Philly wrap - usually this is a sandwich, but we always have them make it a wrap.  Chicken, jalapenos, onions, and melted cheese is a great combo.  Get it with the criss cut fries.\n\nSpaghetti and meatballs - Decent, sauce was good and you get a very hearty portion.\n\nPizza - usually we get it with pepperoni or sausage or both.  It's not bad, but sometimes they make it really oily and you'll have to soak some of that oil off.  (I know some people love that extra oil)\n\nChicken fingers - Nothing special, but decent pieces of chicken fingers\n\nChicken wings - Nothing special on the flavor, but large pieces of chicken wings\n\nService is pretty good, the ladies there are always very accommodating.
