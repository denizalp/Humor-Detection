This location used to be good a long time ago, but the food quality has gone downhill over the past 2-3 years and the staff is unpleasant.  Sometimes it smells of rotten lettuce, so I question the freshness of the produce in the salad bar.  The scones and fresh squeezed juice are probably the only good thing left here.
