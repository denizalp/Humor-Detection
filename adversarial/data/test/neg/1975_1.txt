Hoping for a unique Arizona experience, we stopped in to Indian Village, Carefree for lunch. At $26 for tacos for three people, it wasn't at all the \"little local joint\" atmosphere we were expecting. Staff was straight faced, minus any warm and fuzzy. Food, albeit just standard fare, came out quickly. Seven tables inside the dining area needed attention and there was no temperature control. It was freezing cold inside. There was an outdoor patio with additional tables but we probably won't go back to see if it was any cleaner.
