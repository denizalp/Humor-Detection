Sleek atmosphere with a good floor plan make this a relaxing joint to head to for a nice dinner in Marda Loop.  I've had the burger here that is jim dandy; and the bison meatloaf, which isn't bad--but the service can be hit and miss.  The gal we had recently was clearly a bit uncomfortable being on the floor, despite her obvious enthusiasm to please.
