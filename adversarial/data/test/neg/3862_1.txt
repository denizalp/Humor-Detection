I'm originally from California and I get Poke at least once a week and this place makes me never want to return. No one was in front of me in the line and it took me 20 minutes to make a basic order.\n\nI was not greeted upon entering the establishment for at least 5 minutes.  They noticed I was there and looked at me and continued whatever they were doing, not even a \"hello\" or \"be with you in a minute\".\n\nThe person that was taking my order was so painfully slow, I began breathing slow just watching her!\n\nThere was another customer that came in 10 minutes after I did and another employee helped her and she ended up paying for her food first before me! That's how painstakingly slow it was. I didn't catch the employee's name that was helping me because she didn't have a name tag. \n\nMy rating:\n\nFood: average, selection was basic. Needs more veggie toppings (ie cilantro, etc). They should also include a fountain dispenser instead of just bottled beverages.\nService: poor\n\nP.s. I also filled out a comment card saying the same thing.
