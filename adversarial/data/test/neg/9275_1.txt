This is an alternative to tacos el gordo. Since this location is much closer to me. The location is in a pretty nice area with many other food choices but I always come to this area for tacos! The ordering system might be confusing at first but so is all the other taco shops in town. \n\nI always tend to order the same thing: al pastor tacos, elite and a michelada! They're all so good. I used to get other tacos but I prefer to stick with my usuals because they never fail me!\n\nI highly recommend this place if you're in the area or craving some tacos but can't get to tacos el gordo!
