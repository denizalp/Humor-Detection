Well, Juan and his employee just left our garage with a set of beautiful new cabinets that match the older ones that were installed years prior.  The cabinets are a perfect match and our garage went from messy to neat in a few short hours. Juan provided an excellent quote, showed up on time, and installed our cabinets.  The attention to detail that he and Jose paid to our cabinets was impressive. My husband and I felt as if we were dealing with a true craftsman.  They even cleaned the garage afterward.  Thank you Juan, we love our new storage options!
