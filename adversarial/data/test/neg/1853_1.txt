The burgers here are great and have an awesome and interesting selection. The sweet potato tater tots are delicious, and the decor of this place is great. The downside is the service was awful, the server I had had an attitude and the alcohol selection left a lot to be desired. Oh well will give it another shot later on when I get a chance, but won't be drinking here.
