I'm not sure why people would give this place a bad review. This place is clean, quiet, and staff is courteous. The only way I'll stay in any other hotel is if they paid me. I'm not hating on other places but I got my money worth. It wasn't overly priced, no roaches, no crack heads, no problems. I was very comfortable there. And I'm a local.
