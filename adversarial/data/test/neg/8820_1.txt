If I could give this place more stars I would it's hands down my favorite bar in Charlotte and the only one I'm regularly at.  Thursday night is the best night it's reggae night, they have a Dj outside in their back area which is definitely the highlight of the bar it's a huge open area with multiple fire pits ping pong tables corn hole and 2 additional bars from the one inside. All the bartenders are amazing but Aleisha is my favorite (hopefully I'm spelling her name right) she always takes care of my boyfriend and I and makes some damn good drinks. The drinks are super cheap compared to other bars in the city but the pours are generous. Any night is a good night to come here but the weekends are a little more busy than I like but they handle the volume amazingly. They also have a great menu and serve food until 2 am anything after 145 is made to go I think, and they have a vegetarian option too! Easy parking on the side of the building and on the streets.
