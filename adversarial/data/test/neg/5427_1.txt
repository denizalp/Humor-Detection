I feel like it's so hard to find a place like this in Pittsburgh... but then again I have explored too much so maybe I'm not looking hard enough. Regardless, I was so happy to stumble upon this place before our workout class at Steel Revolution downstairs. \n\nWe were in a bit of a rush so we ordered a couple shots. It took about 10 minutes to make since there was only one worker, but they were the cutest shots I've ever seen! The both came with an apple on top. I forgot which one we ordered, but mine had ginger and I could actually taste the freshness of it! Highly recommend these shots for a little boost to your day. They also have smoothies and acai bowls with a lot of variety\/options.\n\nI'd love to come back here :) Only reason for -1 star is because of the space. For a \"cafe\" type place, this place is way too small!
