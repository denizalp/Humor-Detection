THE BEST STREET CORN YOU WILL EVER EAT. Yes, all caps called for on that one. Everything my partner and I ordered was exceptional. The freshly muddled strawberry margaritas, the little delicious chip things that I can't remember the name of but CAN remember the taste of, the fabulous assortment of tacos. I will 100% go back to Canteen next time I'm in Madison.
