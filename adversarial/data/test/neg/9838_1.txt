Deciding to sell our house, we shopped around for new carpeting before we listed our home on the market. Travis and Lisa were so friendly and helpful...set up an appointment for a quote the next day with Gomez. Wanted to match the older carpet and Gomez brought to our home a variety of samples to choose from....we decided on the color \"Rice Cake\" which looked so fresh and clean.  He took measurements and Travis provided us a quote via email the next morning. Very affordable and they list everything on the itemized pricing on the estimate, so there are not any hidden fees, etc. Didn't bother to call anyone else for another estimate because they were so clear cut and the price was right. Set up the install the next week and had to change the original date because of furniture issues and they were very accommodating. Eddie called 10 minutes before arrival time and the guys set up and knocked it out in 4 hours. They even moved our bulky furniture out to the curb for donation AND removed our extra carpet we obtained from our neighbor that sat in the lower level of the house(because we thought we could use it for the install but hated the color and quality). The awesome part is that they donate the usable carpet to local pet shelters, so the dogs have something soft to sleep on! Travis and Eddie both called to make sure everything was the going the way we wanted. Very professional, friendly, hassle-free, straight-forward pricing....they know how to run a business right and we highly recommend them for excellent service, product, and affordability!  A+
