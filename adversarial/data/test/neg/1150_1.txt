We would like to thank Chopper and his staff for solving our auto problem. Did they have to go as far as they did to solve our unhappiness, no, but they did. Our thanks to Calli, Chris in customer  service and the support of management. Chopper, great staff and we will be back so I could buy our 4th vehicle, a new Ram. The DeMundas
