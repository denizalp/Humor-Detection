The staff is very friendly (except one guy in the serving area), and that's where the stars come from. As to food, you have much better choices in Vegas. I think only the BBQ, the pasta, and the desserts are good. Sushi and hot seafood are land mines, don't bother your time. The rest is average or below.\n\nQuite disappointed actually and won't go again. I did not expect land mines on Vegas Strip, especially priced like this one.
