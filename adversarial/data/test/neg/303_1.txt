Stayed 1 night last month and it wasn't bad. I like the pool table and the bar\/lounge area. I think the kitchen\/food could an upgrade. We got free breakfast and it was, (for lack of a better word) lousy! I'm so happy we didn't have to pay. There was very limited items to choose from. As for lunch and dinner, from what the menu said, you order food and it's \"cooked\" off site and then delivered to the hotel. Probably better off going somewhere else, especially for breakfast. Head over to first watch, they have the best breakfast and it's not far at all!
