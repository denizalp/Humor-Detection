We moved got Carpet Monkeys to clear our carpets when we moved out of our rental place. We have kids and pets so despite  our best efforts we gave the carpets a fair bit of punishment. They did a great job at cleaning the carpets however where the  company really  excelled was in the customer service area when the property manager said they still had an issue with some problem areas. Rick came back and personally cleaned those areas himself when the property manager threatened to withhold our security deposit. He also refused to accept any money from me when I offered to compensate him for the additional effort. Carpets can be tricky so it was great to know that Rick has the integrity to stand behind his work even if it costs him personal time and money to do so. A class act.
