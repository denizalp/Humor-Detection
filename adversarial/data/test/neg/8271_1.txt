I was in Fountain Hills looking for some good wine and food.  Walked in not knowing what to expect. Bartender gave me a menu of wines and food and asked if I had questions. He then informed me that many of the wines were made in house, which sparked some good conversation. They are very well educated in their wines and their wines tasted great.  I was very happy with finding this place so far.  As I looked at the menu, i was intrigued by the interesting dishes. I ordered the Salmon, and it was incredible. Perfeclty cooked, flavors have to be experienced to describe. I highly recomend this dish. I met the Chef Nick and he seems very passionate about his food.  He was a pleasure to talk to and he enjoyed meeting other patrons. Also met the owner who shared good stories.  Overall one of the best wine bars I have been to! Wine bar may be too limiting. One of the best restaurants i have been to.
