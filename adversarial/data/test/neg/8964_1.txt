My friends and I wanted just a bit of something before dinner because we had an early lunch so we decided to try this place. We ordered a side of Mac and cheese and two Cesar salads. Food was really good, but $9 for a Mac a cheese I was expecting a bigger portion. Salads were also very small, thank God we were not very hungry! I've been told they change menus so maybe next time I'll try something different and change my review. Service was not bad, although it was not very busy so they could of been faster. I did love the decoration and vintage style of this restaurant. I would try it again.
