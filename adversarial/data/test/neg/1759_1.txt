I don't shop at Walmart but decided to go to Walmart for work related items - I went in at about 1120 and the store was not crowded at all but the items I needed were locked up in a case (blades for our grind saw) and proceeded to press the help button..pressed it once and waited, nothing! Pressed it again and again nothing! I look over to my left and there are 5 workers (including a manager or supervisor) standing in front of sporting goods talking and laughing so i proceed to press the help button 3 more times and nothing! I'm not gonna chase anyone down, that's why you have these stupid ass buttons! I waited for 20 minutes just to see what would happen and nothing! I'm on the clock for work and don't have the time or patience for this bullshit! Walmart has always sucked but it's got worse and now they not only lost my business personally but for work also!!
