I had never professionally whitened before, but one of my coworkers recommended the place. I quit smoking a few years ago and have always wanted to go back to start over again with my teeth. The staff was awesome, very honest, and helped me come up with a plan to get my teeth to the level I want. First session was awesome, sat in the chair and listened to music, staff gave pillows, blankets, you can tell they really care about their guests! At the end of the session, my teeth looked like they did before smoking. They were a nice healthy white and made me look cleaner and as if I never smoked before. We came up with a plan for future visits to reverse smoker teeth but I'm really happy I found this place and I can't thank them enough for giving me a new beginning.
