Chino Bandido is not the restaraunt to go to if you are looking for a healthy meal or excellent tableside service.  However, the staff is always polite and offering samples of their diverse menu is the norm.    The food is Chinese and Mexican (it goes together better than you'd think) and while the options are limited in some ways (A Chinese place without Chow Mein?) for the most part the food is very good, albeit a little greasy.  \n\nAny of the entree items can be had by itself, placed in a quesadilla, or wrapped as a buritto.   Beans and various  kinds of fried rice are offered with the main combo and the range of diversity means that you can probably find something you like, regardless of the mood you're in.  \n\nIf you are looking for a place that is a little different, and aren't particularly concerned about fine dining, this is the place to go.  It can get a little crowded during the lunch and dinner rushes though as it is quite popular.
