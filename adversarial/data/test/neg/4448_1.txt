My go-to place with the most amazing pizzas and pastas. We always come back for the burrata pizza which is absolutely creamy and the tomato sauce is perfection. Also, you can never get enough of the bigoli. The egg yolk pasta with the sauce makes it that much more better of an experience. For dessert, try the deconstructed tiramisu, which is decadent but not too sweet, which I love.\nIf you're going for brunch on the weekend, the carbonara with the raw egg yolk was finished to the last drop! The crespelles are a favourite with the citrus zest and creamy filling. \nOverall, one of the best restaurants in town, no wonder it's one of the top in Canada!
