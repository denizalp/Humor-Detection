California burrito was pretty good! I ended up here so I didn't have to go out of my way for Roberto's. \n\nYou can tell the ingredients were fresh in my burrito, and everything in it was delicious. \n\nThe price is reasonable and I would eat here again. \n\nThe owner works at the joint and is a pretty cool dude. He put his money where his mouth is and told me if I didn't like it he'd refund me 100%.\n\nKeep the money, Ben. You earned it with that burrito.
