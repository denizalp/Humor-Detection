The steak was tender and full of flavor. The cheese plate was tart, tangy, and affordable. The wine was delicious. Even the bread was amazing!\n\nThe service was second-to-none. I'll happily recommend Vintner Grill to my friends and will be returning as soon as possible! It's well worth the drive from Henderson.
