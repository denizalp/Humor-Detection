Was there on May 22 for dinner. Ordered a basic hamburger and Greek salad which sells for $13. The burger was small and dry, likely over cooked and the salad was small and seemed to be sitting with the dressing on the salad for a bit too long lacking freshness.\n\nBeen going to the place for many years as it is close to home, always a hit or miss.
