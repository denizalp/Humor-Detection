I'm very unhappy with the service I received here.\nAbout a week ago I took in my wedding band that I have had since May to be cleaned and inspected in order to maintain my diamond guarantee. They give me my ring back and all looks well when I leave, though I did not do a thorough investigation. A few hours later I realized that some of the diamonds had gone missing. I drove the 30 minutes back to Jared and the first thing they say when I mention the missing diamonds after having just left they say it could have happened after I left. Regardless the inspection is to make sure the diamonds and prongs and holding the diamonds securely in place. They agree to check in the ring cleaning machine and end up not only finding my FOUR missing diamonds but someone else's diamond as well. They then said they would put the diamonds back in but it would take a few days, which was fine. A few days later I go back to pick up my ring and after closely inspecting the ring I noticed a white residue left between all of the diamonds and the metal clearly had been melted and not fixed in the process. After pointing it out to them they tried to claim that it was just because the black diamonds had not been recoated in black rhodium, so they took it back to replate it and bring it back with the black very sloppily painted on (black drippings on side of ring, etc.) top of the residue! After arguing about it i decided to go to another location where they were able to buff some out but they also tried to blame it on the quality of the diamonds rather than a mistake that they made... Never once did I receive any sort of apology for any of these things but they continually tried to argue with me about things that they had done to the ring in the process... Very upset and still expecting some sort of apology for the treatment I received especially considering I am now stuck with a ring that is not even close to how I bought it just 3 months ago.\n\nUpdate: a manager called me after contacting customer service and has agreed to replace my entire ring.
