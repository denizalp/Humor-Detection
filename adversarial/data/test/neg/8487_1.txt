I'm surprised by the low rating for the MGM Grand Buffet. Sure, it's insanely overpriced, like every other place in Vegas, but the food was good and there was a large selection of items. \n\nIn particular, I was impressed with the assortment of meats. From the carving table you could chose turkey breast (moist and delicious!), prime rib (amazing!) and tri-tip (decent but not my favorite). There was also made to order steaks and crab legs for the seafood lovers. \n\nIn the middle sections, there were a variety of side dishes. My personal favorites were the mac and cheese (very cheesy and so much better than any other buffet mac and cheese that I've ever tasted) and roasted potatoes. \n\nThe salad bar was small for a buffet but I guess paying the higher prices, you'd want to fill up on other things anyway. \n\nMy friends all gushed about the dessert bar but seeing as my sweet tooth is barely existent, it didn't entice me. There were quite a few choices for those that do like desserts though.\n\nThankfully, my friend and I received a $75 food credit for staying at the MGM and that pretty much covered the Friday dinner buffet. If I were to come back on my own dime, I would definitely try the lunch buffet, which is almost half the price.
