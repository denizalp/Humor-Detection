Here for lunch on a Tuesday at noon. No waiting to be seated. We checked on line before we came but the collection of tacos that were on line are no longer being served at the restaurant. Two tries in getting a lemon drop martin didn't result in a satisfactory drink. (One was deducted from the bill)My signature drink was a 10ounce glass that was one half ice. I had a chilaquilies and my dining partner a bowl of chili. She liked her chili, mine was like a breakfast burrito surrounded by corn chips with an avocado slice. Most of my chips were soggy and some were actually cold like they'd just been defrosted. The fresh slice of avocado was good. We were hoping for a \"oh wow\" moment that didn't happen. Total bill is $65. That's Vegas for you
