The experience of eating blind is great fun, albeit  a little messy. It's something I recommend anyone interested try. However, it's probably not worth the return visits.\n\nMost people I talk to complain about the food. I understand that as a restaurant food is most important. But in my opinion, you don't come to. O.Noir for the food, you come for the experience. As far as the food goes, \"Fine\" is the best word I can think of. Wasn't bad, but wasn't great. When you can't see, there's a comfortability in predictable food. Especially stuff that's not too gross to eat with your hands\n\nMy favourite part of the dinner is being brought in making a chain with all the diners' hands. As well as being oriented to find the cups and cutlery. My friends and I were laughing at each other when we first tried to eat. Everyone went in expecting to use their cutlery, but most of us used our hands. It was funny how loud we would talk even when we knew everyone was at the same table. While we consciously understand that people are there, it's hard for our bodies to figure that out. \n\nHowever, as a restaurant that specializes in dining without the sense of sight, O.Noir does very little to play with your other senses. With a heightened sense of touch, you can really feel the cheap furniture and place settings. One dollar plastic placemats and old banquet chairs don't feel great to use at a restaurant that charges $50 a person (and probably saves tons of cash on their electric bill). The room was very loud as well. I don't blame the restaurant for people talking loudly (I was guilty), but if there's a way to soundproof better, they should consider it. \n\nOverall, it was a fun experience I'll always remember, but probably not one I'll visit here again.
