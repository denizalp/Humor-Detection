Came here for brunch after the Men's Hockey Team dominated for the gold medal.  Half in the bag at 8am i met some friends here before the Raptors game (wicked day eh?).  Decided to get a mimosa and eggs benny.  Didn't drink the mimosa but the benny was wicked!  Loved the fruit salad you got with it.  This was my first Cora expereince and it was A-OK
