Ordered takoyaki (octopus), gyoza and chicken karaage appetizers as well as spicy tuna rice bowl, miso and Nishikawa Black Ramen and 2 kinds of sake.   Great service (even though our waitress admitted it was her second day on the job) and excellent value.  Am giving it 4 stars only because the broth did not have the depth of flavor I have experienced at \"authentic\" Ramen houses in HI and CA but certainly among the best I've had in AZ.  Recommended!
