Came in to purchase gas and a car wash only to find my car battery died. Called AAA and while I was waiting the attendant Thomas came out to see if he could help me. AAA guy Kalub was helpful and professional. Thomas came out to check on me again and chat tip the merits of batteries with Kalub. Both nice guys and helpful! Car is clean and battery jumped!
