Order sausage and mash, cottage pie and Irish stew. The sausage and mash drowned in gravy and was a soup. Seriously!  The sausage was tasty but the potato broke down and floated in the gravy soup like icebergs. There were no peas either. Need peas with sausage and mash. \n\nThe Irish stew was too spicy fort wife but the cottage pie was a success for my son. Still it wasn't traditional.
