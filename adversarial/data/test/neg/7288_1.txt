I'm so excited about this restaurant! There are a few places to get kebab in the area (surprisingly) but Ararat 17 is on a different level. \n\nThis is a little gem in beside Harris Teeter that you can easily miss while driving by. Don't make that mistake!\n\nThe food is authentic and expertly prepared. If you want to know what stuffed grape leaves made by an Armenian grandma taste like, order them here\n\nMy party had lula kebab, grape leaves, chicken kebab, steak sandwich, grape leaves, hummus, and falafel. All of it was delicious. And finally, tabouli the way it's supposed to be prepared! \n\nDessert was also excellent. We had baklava and their version of a napolean which was so light and delicious I could've eaten two. \n\nService was professional and flawless. \n\nEntrees run from about $16.95 to the mid-$20's and each dinner comes with 3 sides. Here is my only critique. There is no vegetable option for the sides. That seems a bit strange. It's a choice of fries, mashed, rice balls, rice, hummus, or cole slaw. I'm sorry, cole slaw doesn't count. I would LOVE to see a seasonal  daily vegetable offered. Otherwise, I'd have given Ararat 5 stars. \n\n*try the pomegranate wine from Armenia. It's delicious!
