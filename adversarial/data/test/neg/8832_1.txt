Came here for the first time today, never been... so I figured I'd give it a try. Ordered a breakfast power sandwich(ham, eggs, and cheese on multi grain), no cheese and a coffee. It came out with cheese, risking being uncomfortable for the next few hours from eating the dairy(lactose intolerant) I ate it anyways. Ate it cause I don't like sending food back, am fearful of what may happen to it after sending it back.  Sandwich was good but nothing special. Checked my receipt, cashier did not put on the ticket \"no cheese\", so definitely not the kitchen's fault. Nothing special or spectacular here, but an alternative to paradise bakery.
