This store has slowly stopped carrying some products I regularly buy.    When I encounter the cashiers, it's a \"hit or miss\"...some are personable some not.   While shopping there regularly, I notice some employees are very watchful of customers that it can sometimes be annoying.     Also, the elderly customers tend to slow the express line, that I think the store would benefit from having a self-scan checkout.   Regardless, the store is well organized, clean, and looks nice.\n\nI would like to add that it is a bonus this store is starting to carry specialty foods  I normally purchase from Loblaws.\n\nI am adding to this review:  Some of the new cashiers are unprofessional and sometimes do not give the customer their undivided attention.  I'm glad there are other Sobeys stores nearby to go to....also glad that a Loblaws will be opening at Yonge-Eglinton.
