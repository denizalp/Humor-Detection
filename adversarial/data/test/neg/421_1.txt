Went here for the first time and asked Bernie if he could alter a dress for me for the next day which I knew was a long shot due to such short notice but not only did he accept the challenge he did it with a smile and never made me feel like I was being a burden. The next day I picked up the dress did not even try it on and it fit perfectly that night I will continue to come to Bernie and refer all of my friends and family!
