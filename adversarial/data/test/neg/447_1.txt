This is outstanding Vietnamese food. Fresh, flavorful and served with great pride. I have never been disappointed.  Until today. I picked up a pair of Fresh Spring Rolls -- my favorite menu item. Upon return home, neither of them contained any basil or mint. Nothing but shredded lettuce, shrimp and noodles. Quite bland without those herbs. I called to inform them and was offered a replacement, but was unable to return. They even called me back to apologize and said to request extra basil and mint the next time.  (Perhaps they should simply stick to the list of ingredients on the menu, and I wouldn't have to request them.  Just saying.) I do appreciate their apology and the manager's call back. I will continue to visit, but I'll check my take-out order before leaving. Nevertheless, their Pho broth is delicious and the Fresh Spring Rolls are usually a knockout!  Everyone is entitled to one mistake and I give them the benefit of the doubt. If you're looking for healthy, tasty and fresh and authentic Vietnamese food served with a smile, you MUST try out ME's! I personally look forward to returning and adding that 5th star to my review.
