We first heard about Teharu from our oldest daughter after she had lunch here with a few of her friends. We are originally from Hawaii and have been living in Arizona for 10yrs now and we love to eat sushi. Its been 2yrs now that we have been going here for our sushi fix. But that is the only reason we do go here. If other sushi places we go to were closer we would go there instead. The service is not so great not sure why they haven't fixed it. The food that is served is okay, wish it was better quality.
