This used to be better, but is a solid 4 star place that I can routinely go after years and years, and still get too much wings, ok fries, and beer.  a dive bar that I like, and would go back to.  I'm a fan, as they say.  ask for 'em wet if you like 'em wet.\n\ngood for groups, but not too big because they are not that big.  also, entrance at rear.
