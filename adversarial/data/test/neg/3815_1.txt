I recently purchased a Groupon from Trifecta Massage. It was extremely difficult to find because it was actually located inside of a salon so there was no signage outside however the massage itself was good. I actually prefer massages where the massage therapist is polite, but not chatty. I desperately needed to just relax in peace and quiet and it was just that. She was able to work through a lot of my tension, knots\/ trigger points which I desperately needed. Thank you!
