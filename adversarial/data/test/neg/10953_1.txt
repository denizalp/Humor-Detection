Went here after the GPS had me going in circles while trying to find a friend's house (wound up being a five minute walk away!). The soy latt√© was delicious, even though I normally hate soy milk because of the cereal taste. I liked how everyone in the place seemed more than willing to clean up after themselves and the cheerful baristas. Would love to come back and try their vegan Wednesdays.
