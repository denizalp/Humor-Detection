For an ayce place, that charges $29.99 for their dinner menu, a bunch of things were wrong:\n- Service was SLOW, you would lose your appetite waiting for your food to arrive\n- Orders kept getting forgotten \n- They were sold out of many items but didn't tell us at the time of order \n- Food quality was average- skip the wontons, they're more like chips with hardly any filling\n\nOverall, there are places that do ayce Asian fare much better. Skip this one.
