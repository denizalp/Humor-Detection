One night for dinner, my bf's mom took us out to eat here.  The food was not bad, but nothing to really rave about. I had a New England Clam Chowder, which just tasted like soup I could make out of a can. However, my bf's mom had a linguine pasta with oysters that looked really good. This place wasn't great, but it didn't suck either.\n\n+ pros:\n+ seafood was fresh, which was surprising since we were in the middle of the desert. \n\n- cons:\n- there was a fly in my water. i don't know how the waiter didn't notice it when he poured my water.\n- restaurant is situated right in the middle of a casino.. not like most casino restaurants where they're usually enclosed so you aren't bothered with the chaos going on. but this restaurant was literally placed in the middle of the casino, and you're pretty much eating right next to all the slot machines and a huge walkway. sucks because when i was trying to eat, there were people smoking in the casino almost right next to us... not so pleasant.
