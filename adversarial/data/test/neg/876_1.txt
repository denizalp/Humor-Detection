Pricey but worth every penny. Our waitress was super knowledgeable and guided us well throughout our ordering. My husband and I enjoyed the whole experience and left satiated and satisfied. We were underwhelmed with the sushi roll we ordered - don't come here for amazing sushi. Come here to try out menu items you can't eat anywhere else. If it looks quirky, order it.
