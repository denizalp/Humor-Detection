I took my wife out for a fantastic fine meal. The prices are typical for the fine dining scene; $125 for a 7 course chief's tasting. Then add another $75 each for wine parings. \n\nThe atmosphere was great; upscale with nice tables overlooking the river and the Peace Bridge. Every course was unique and amazing; everything was prepared so nicely and tasted delicious. My favorite was the Wild Mushroom Risotto, and the Quail Breast. What I really liked was the service. I discreetly told the server I had $400 to spend that night, and to just surprise us with courses and wines. I told him no shell fish for me and anything goes but pickles for the wife, and bam! They made it all work. We got 7 half glasses of wine; something for every course, and they brought the bottles to our table each time so we could take pictures of the stuff I liked, and help our self to more if we liked a particular wine.\n\nThe dessert was by far the best thing I have ever had in my life. 7 different chocolates with each a different texture. I'd easily shell out $40 just to have that dessert again; wow was it good.\n\nI really enjoyed it and I will be back, however not more than once a year as the prices are pretty steep. I don't think they were unreasonable for fine dining, but if I compare to Taste (near Hotel Arts) they are more down to earth semi-casual dining, and the dishes there were half the price and the same amazing delicious taste and unique experiences. \n\nSo anyway if you have $400 to spend on a great night out and you want upscale dining I highly recommend it here, if you want the same food but more casual check out Taste.
