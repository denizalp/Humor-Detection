Solid place for burgers! Excellent service. Minimal wait time (even when busy!) Can ask for your burger to be cooked a certain way (rare, medium rare, medium etc) but not always going to get that. Burgers are \"heavy\" meaning you'll leave with a I'm full beyond no other and a rock sitting in your stomach but damn it's delicious. Use this as your cheat meal for the MONTH!
