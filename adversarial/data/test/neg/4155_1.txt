I had the loaded baked potato with pulled pork and it was so freaking good! Every bite was delicious and the stuffing was portioned correctly on top of the potato. It wasn't too much of one thing or the other. The ladies at the restaurant were amazing as well. Very accommodating and friendly. I loved the vibes they brought as soon as I entered through the door. :D
