A group of us went for the first time on a slow Monday night.  And once again we followed other Yelpers advise and ordered certain high ranking dishes.  So... you gotta try the sliders!!!  They are out of this world good!  I don't know what they season the meat with but it is delicious! All of us were impressed with the sliders!  The patatas bravas ( potatoes and chorizo )  was also a big hit with our group! We also tried the sushito peppers..don't be scared...try them!  They are not too spicy and I hate blue cheese, but this doesn't have that strong odor or flavor of blue cheese - super yummy.  \nThe pierogi pizza was - meh.  We've had different other potato pizzas that were better.\nThe server we had was very accommodating and friendly ( good Midwest guy !)  It has dim lighting there, but we didn't think it was too dark to read the menu etc...\nThe bathrooms might throw you for a loop when you see everybody and there brother washing hands in the same area! heeheehee - just FYI.\nThe reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the price.  I have seen others mention the same thing.  Since we all went to East 4th street we know that the restaurants are higher end so we don't mind paying - but it doesn't seem like you get enough bang for your buck.  Great food, but just not enough for what you pay.\nSo hopefully the owners take note of the comments and add another slider to the plate. : )
