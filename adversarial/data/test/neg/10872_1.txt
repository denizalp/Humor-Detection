We had a wonderful time that was ruined by poor management. The comedians were hilarious, so I'm sorry to write a negative review. Had some food, which was totally fine. Got the bill, paid, and on the way out, the manager stopped us and asked if there was something wrong with the service. Confused, we said no, and the manager asked to know why we hadn't tipped. We were there with a large group and the menu said that groups of 6 or more would be charged a 15% gratuity. Apparently, this is no longer applied automatically and we simply missed it on the bill. Calling us out for a simple mistake is a terrible management move and the manager ensured that we never go back. Sadly for their business, we would have returned had the manager not been so rude. It was extremely embarrassing and a complete accident. We were accosted in front of a group of people, and had this been dealt with with more tact, I would not be writing this review.
