Great food and decent service. Now the food carried its weight for the four stars but the design feels like a coffee shop, service shouldn't be expected (drinks), and the price is just ridiculous for what I get. That is why I lowered this place to a 3 star review. Don't worry I probably won't return, because there is so many great restaurants in this city.
