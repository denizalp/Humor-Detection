I've been meaning to try out this place for so long in LA but never got the chance to. On Friday before my flight, the day of the grand opening I knew this was a chance for me to indulge in all egg bacon goodness as much as I could. I ordered the sausage egg and cheese...and added bacon and avacado. \n\nIt was one of the best things I've ever eaten. After everyone raving about this place, I did not expect for it to be THAT good. \n\nThose who are complaining about the price- what do you expect? It's VEGAS. \nIt was worth the wait and the price. I will definitely be back again!\n\nIt was egg-cellent ;)
