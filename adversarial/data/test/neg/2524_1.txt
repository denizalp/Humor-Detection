Tried this place b\/c we heard that it is somewhat historical.  Definitely not fancy, decently priced ice cream parlor.  Nothing special.\n\n*Decor = had it's own charm.  nothing fancy.\n*Service = it took a while for the waitress to come but it's all good.  They were having fun mingling with their high school friends at the counter :)\n*Ice cream = it's good.  I mean it's definitely not Ghirardelli but it's descent.  \n\nWould I go there again.  Well, just for Sugar Bowl - NO.  If I'm out of Blue Bell ice cream at home and for some reason I'm in Scottsdale, SURE.
