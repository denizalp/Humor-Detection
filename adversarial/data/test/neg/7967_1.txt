I joined Dahn Yoga-Tempe Center in April 2012.  Since that time, I have more flexibility and have learned postures to relieve my back spasms.  I try to attend on Wednesday when we focus on Tai Chi, and have learned the inner-peace of meditation.  The instructors are very knowledgeable and accomplished in the art of Dahn Yoga and Tai Chi.  They make it fun and personally rewarding.
