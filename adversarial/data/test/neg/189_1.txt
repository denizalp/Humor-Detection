Just a tip. I guess the take out or curbside service  is not the fastest way to get your food you ordered online. I've waited almost 10 minutes so far...I really don't like posting but I like this place just wish I wasn't waiting this long for a order I made 45 minutes ago online only to wait more in my car...update.. someone just came out to ask me if I was supposed to come in for a \" hand grab\" not curbside? Really? You couldn't have brought my food with you? Aww man! They gave me a different creamy dressing  not the vinaigrette.  that I love?..  had to add my own at home. aww. I still love their Italian chopped salad!!!!
