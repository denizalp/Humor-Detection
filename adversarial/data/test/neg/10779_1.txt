East Sahara HLE location But its all about a corporate image I am really upset with my rental experience with Hertz this was my first time renting from you. I started with a 3rd party paying 131.75 then was told I would only pay 41.88 at time of pick up. I rented the car for my family who was visiting from Florida BAM another 58.40 REALLY i didn't even drive it there was only one driver the whole time I was just the person who rented it.. Next I was given a piece of crap Yaris 2013 with extreme body damage from bumper loose to dents and scratches all over.. Is this the image that your company always has... If so I will never give Hertz another try.. The only decent service I received was from the person who checked me out (Don) cant tell who is who no name tags ... he was nice as i complained how I felt like i was ripped off he agreed that he was surprised at the damage on the rental I was given... Just utterly disappointed and feeling ripped off by your corporation right now.\n. I would of gone somewhere else but there was no refund from the 3rd party agent..
