They are scam artists that I found them when I got a FREE trial offer of tooth whiting products after doing a pop-up survey when I went to the Costco.com web site. After answering some questions I was offered several free trial offers. \n\nBut NO! they sent an email saying I was automatically enrolled in the cleaning system at a cost \n$94.31 each month. When you call to cancel, they hang up on you each time. I tried 3 times with each number that I am sure goes to the same phone seeing at they have the same address of both companies. They are my guess one in the same company.\nSpark Whitening \n7565 Commercial Way, Unit E\nHenderson, NV 89011\n1-866-711-2831\nhttps:\/\/www.sparkwhitening.com\nFirst Class Whitening \n7565 Commercial Way, Unit E\nHenderson, NV 89011\n1-877-530-9637\nhttps:\/\/www.firstclasswhitening.com\n\nI tried co cancel on their web site, and you are unable to unless, you send back the free trial offer at your own cost for shipping, or pay according to their web site:\n\nOur lowest price! - Only $28.71!\n\nClick the Easy Cancel button and you'll be able to keep hundreds of dollars of teeth whitening products for only $28.71.
