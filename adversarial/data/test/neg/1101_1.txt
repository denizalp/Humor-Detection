Came to check this place out on Sunday night even though there were mixed reviews about this place because we were planning to watch the O Show afterwards. Honestly, this place is not worth your money or your time. There is a limited selection of food that is dry and tastes mediocre. Their crab legs are not seasoned and completely dry. Towards the end of our meal, found a cockroach crawling on top of the fruit window. Had the sushi staff come out and kill it, but so completely gross. The best thing about this place was probably only the cocktail shrimp and its prime location at Bellagio. If you want to waste your money and be unfilled even after eating, check this place out!
