Great service and beautiful space - always a cappuccino and a smile when I arrive. My nails are expensive but worth it - they look perfect every time. My hair is always in good hands. It's calm and serene in there - the sun streams in and the music plays quietly while I look at beautiful fashion coffee table books while my dye sets in.
