I took a bad fall on my shoulder and my doctor prescribed PT for it.  I didn't want to go, because I've been for other reasons to different PT offices and didn't feel like it was any benefit to me.  This office and Cody proved me wrong!  My shoulder feels better than ever.  Every person on their staff was friendly, polite and efficient.  They work together as a team, so I never waited around for help, instructions, or assistance.  Scheduling appointments was easy, and parking is plentiful.  The office was always very clean and the staff cleaned the equipment\/beds after every use.  I would recommend them to all my family & friends!
