I purchased two drinks. Both of them were not blended to a smoothie. There were chunks of banana and mango in each one. Not small enough to fit through a straw. I paid the price for a healthy smoothie to receive good quality. This unfortunately was a waste of money because I didn't have a spoon to eat the remaining 6oz. of fruit.
