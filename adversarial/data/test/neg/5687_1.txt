I really love this store. Great prices and the furniture is very nice. I purchased a gorgeous counter top table with four chairs. Easy to put together. I like the fact that they offer same day pick up. The young man at the pick up station made sure our table was secure in our car and was courteous. I will be back for more pieces.
