This is a love story. My wife and I have been coming to this restaurant for 5 or so years, and now we have a hard time getting burgers anywhere else in the country. My wife and I met long-distance (I lived in Phoenix, she lived in Henderson) and whenever I came to town, the first thing we ate was Pitstop.\n\nFood is legit! But first, let me tell your about the place. Pitstop (for our family) feels like an extension of home. The place is always clean, music (and now Flat Screens) are on, decorated with all kinds of Baseball swag, very comfortable. We are ALWAYS greeted, welcomed, seated as quickly as possible and we always feel as though someone is keeping an eye out just to make sure things are going the way we wanted. It has gotten to the point that Jodi (hope I spelled her name right) knows our drink orders as soon as we walk in the door and has a good guess what we might be ordering that night! Mind you, we aren't affluent people by any means, just regular peeps. She takes the time to strike up a conversation to see how you've been and what you've been up to, offers suggestions about new things they're trying in the kitchen and offers a level of sincerity about helping you. You only get service like this from people who care. The entire crew works as a team to serve the entire restaurant, and it makes you feel as though everyone is there to help you.\n\nOkay I'm rambling, let's get to business. I come for burgers and onion rings, so I can't give a first hand account about the rest of the menu. But if you're a carnivore like me, you're in for exactly what you want. Dial up the amount of meat you want from a delicious and juicy 1\/4lb Dam Burger all the way up to the 1lb monster burger. I've tackled the monster before.. It's massive, grab some napkins. Add on your favorite toppings and make it just the way you want (green chiles is a must for me though I wish they were more spicy). Fries are good but onion rings are my fave here.. Big, golden, crispy and hot.\n\nMy regular order which has been consistently juicy, flavorful and filling\n\nDouble Pit Burger Combo w\/ Onion Rings\nAdd Bacon\nAdd Green Chile\nAdd Pepper Jack Cheese\n\nIf you've driven past Pitstop Burger in the past, you've done yourself a disservice. My wife and I can get a burger anywhere, but there is only one burger spot that we are willing to drive 20miles to get to.. \n\nOur meeting point, our history, our friends, our Pitstop Burger.
