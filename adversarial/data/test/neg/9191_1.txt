I met Stuart for the first time... he fired up his torch and melted down some marshmallows for his signature latte. It tastes so smooth and amazing I had to get the rainbow latte after just to upload to Instagram. I sat up at the coffee bar and wiggled to the amazing music and shared a lot of laughs with Stuart and Angie. Both amazing coffee artists. Love to see passion in the fields!  See you both soon
