Big flavors and big portions! My girlfriends and I loved it here so much we dined here twice in our 4 day trip! You can not go without ordering the Baja Ceviche - it's to die for, and this coming from someone who rarely eats seafood! The guacamole is decadent and the chicken poblano enchiladas were fantastic, especially with some of their salsa verde.
