This place is probably the best kept secret in Scottsdale.  The food is fresh and amazing.  The service is great and personable.  Sitting on the patio is a must especially in the fall.  A little pricy, but worth every cent.  After our dinner, we found out that our server was one of the owners.  He gave us a tour of the kitchen and introduced us to the chef.  Very cool experience and I wouldn't hesitate to dine here again.
