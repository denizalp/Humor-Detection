Scramble is a great breakfast and brunch joint, and I'm glad to see that it's doing well. I give it a 4.5 out of 5.\n\nI've only tried a handful of dishes from this place but they've always been quite good. The star of the show, in my opinion, is the brizza - a biscuit-dough breakfast pizza that I've been in love with since my first visit.\n\nMy first dining experience I ordered the Toluca brizza and it was incredibly good, although I will warn that the jalapeno cream cheese and the chorizo have a definite bite to them, so gringos beware! I've also had the Gouda brizza, and it was smoky and yummy, but I much prefer the Chicago, with a side of their awesome, stick-to-your-ribs sausage gravy as a dipping side.\n\nButtermilk biscuits and gravy are a meal unto themselves. The mushroom and bacon omelette is just dead-on, with garlic-sauteed mushrooms and chunks of thick-cut bacon.\n\nI'll admit that I haven't tried their lunch menu, but if that quality is as high as \n\nI had been here once before, when the location was still a Le Pepe, and was surprised by the change in decor: It's very modern and trendy. If you've ever watched Restaurant: Impossible on Food Network, it's got a very up-to-date vibe like a lot of their remodels do. Seating is comfortable but I will admit that the steel-tube chairs can pinch a bit, and that's probably the only reason I don't mark this as a 5 because breakfast\\lunch places are the kinds of place where you stuff yourself and then linger for 20 minutes afterward, drinking soda or coffee and chatting.\n\nI hope Scramble keeps doing well, because they deserve it. It's an excellent breakfast\\brunch joint, and we need more of it!
