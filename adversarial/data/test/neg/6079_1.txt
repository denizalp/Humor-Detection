Well wasn't this a hidden Gem. \nWe come to Vegas twice a year and how the hell have we missed y'all \n\nFrom the minute we walked in the door the staff treated us like royalty \n\nWine amazing \nFood courses perfect portioned \nTimed perfectly \nTastes invigorate the palate and enhances the dining experience \n\nPer my husband watching the ceiling move was worth the price of dinner lol
