I went for the first time this last Friday.  The staff was friendly.  The food was great.  We ordered cocktails and appetizers.  The main course reminded me of a Mongolian grill.  You pick out rice or noodles, veggies, proteins, and sauces then they cook it on a large grill.  Dessert was good too.  I think the prices are competitive for other upscale joints in Summerlin.  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was because the service was so slow.  We waited a very long time before the waiter came to our table and the overall progression was slow especially since the place wasn't filled or busy at all.  We arrived around 8:30 and it was 10:30 before we received our check just to give you an idea.
