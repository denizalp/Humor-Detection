Came here on a Friday night.  This is a kid friendly place, for those with children. Although there was a screaming 1 yr old that made things a bit unbearable for a short time, but that's not the fault of the restaurant.  We got a table in a dark corner of the restaurant.  Had a nice waiter who was knowledgeable and friendly.  I had the Michelada, which is like a Bloody Mary with beer.  Be sure to give this a really good stir before you pour the entire beer in, otherwise it will be very salty and spicy.  Its different, I'd order it again.  For the main, I got the Puerco en Salsa Verde.  It was excellent.  Very flavorful and off the beaten path from most Mexican restaurants.  My bf had the La Parrilla skillet.  He thought it was good, but didn't think it was that anything special.  This place is close, so I would come here again.  Give it another go.
