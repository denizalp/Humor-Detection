I ordered the fiesta burger and was surprised at how dry it was even with the guac on it. The patty its self was just dry and not seasoned very well. My friend had the chesse burger with bacon and could not finish even a 1\/4 of it due to the dryness. I was also a little concerned at the lack of cleaniness about the sides bar. I witness the guy replenishing the bar but putting the old ketchup on top of the new ketchup. The problem with this is that the old ketchup had lettuce and pepper pieces in it.  However the onion rings were great as well as the fried Zucchini. Prehaps my friend and I visted them on an off night.
