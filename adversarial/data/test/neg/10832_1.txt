Popped in for a bite before a concert. Seated ourselves on the rooftop patio but had to move as the tables were apparently reserved but they hadn't put signage up yet. Waitress was really friendly and great to deal with. Big rock Trad was a touch skunky but Velvet Fog was great. I had chicken fingers which were great but the fries were a touch soggy; my friend had Buffalo wrap which was massive!\nSeemed to be communication problems between patio staff and kitchen however as the shipping sauce I requested was incorrect (waitress fixed it ASAP) and the table next to us had a heck of a wait for their food (was over 25 minutes from order to when we left and they still didn't have their meals).\nOverall, would probably come back.\nTotal cost was $70~ (including tip) for two meals plus 4 beers.
