First time here, but will be back. The waitstaff was friendly, helpful and fast. The food arrived quickly and was well prepared. For two people we shared the Margherita pizza and the Organic Spinach and Tuna salad. The food was good. The pizza crust was really light and easy to chew. I forgot to ask for the vinaigrette on the side. I think they put a bit too much on for my taste.
