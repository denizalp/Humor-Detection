I normally would not write a review for this restaurant but my family received such good service i thought i should post it.  Food wise this place is still a 3  .... but the service we received was a 5. \n \nYesterday, my family and i went there around noon.  It was busy, like normal.  The food was average at best.  Except for the hummus, which was quite good.  Our server, Tim was on his game.   It was obvious he has worked in the industry for a while.  He was friendly, fast and efficient.  He didn't miss a beat, even when a drink was spilled----that's what happens when kids are involved.   The service was impeccable.  We eat at a lot of \"high end\" restaurants and the service  is always good but this  was hands down the best we have seen in years.
