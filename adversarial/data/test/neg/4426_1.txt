Meh, this place was very underwhelming. Heard about Pizza Libretto for years. Was excited one opened up on the Danforth. Went on a Friday night, got in right away which was really nice and scored a wickedly geat seat in the window, facing the street. I will give the seating a 4 out 5 as it is a perfect people watching seat.\nOrdered calamari stafold followed by pizza. The calamari was cooked well but the sauces they served with them did not compliment the calamari at all. In fact, I found they made the squid taste bad. I could not figure out why they served those sauces with the calamari as they made the dish taste really bad. Simple lemon is always best with calamari or even a litely spiced sauce. The pizza arrived. I knew that the crust was going to be very thin. I was prepared. I guess it is not my thing. Thin crust pizza. I didn't care for it. It tasted fine, the buffalo mozzarella was soft, fresh and tasty. It was all around good but the thin crust was such a turn off for me. The price for a pizza is quite steep, $15 and to me, just not worth it.\nWould I go again? Probably not as you will find me at the Danforth Pizza House, with Angelo, diving into some delist old school pizza!
