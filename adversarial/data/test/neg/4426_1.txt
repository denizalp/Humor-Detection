Pampas isn't quite what the other high-end Brazilian Steak Buffet restaurants are, but it's still a very good choice.  \n\nThe Groupon for the Rodizio dinner is the way to go.  Incredible offer!  For $90, you get the radizio surf and turf dinner for two, unlimited beer, wine, sangria and caiparinas and a dessert.  It really made it a much better deal than the higher end Brazilian places.  \n\nThe place itself is nice, the service was very good, salad bar was good.  \n\nI'd recommend Pampas, especially with the Groupon special.
