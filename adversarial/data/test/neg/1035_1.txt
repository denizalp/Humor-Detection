Excellent selection of quality kids toys for all ages. Not plastic junky stuff, but educational options and nice brands. The staff wasn't as helpful as I have had at other shops. My biggest disappointment was that I had my three kids with me and the staff seemed a bit annoyed, which bothered me. I bought four gifts which I was very happy with though and I'd go back again.
