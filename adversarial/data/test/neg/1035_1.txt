My husband and I tried out The Carlton for PGH Restaurant Week, and we had a great experience! The restaurant itself is located in the BNY Mellon building. It has its own parking garage, and parking is comped for restaurant guests! Score!\nWe chose The Carlton for restaurant week specially because the $35 menu was surf AND turf! We both had the tomato crab bisque as our first choice and it was to die for!! As someone who loves tomato bisque and crab bisque, it was truly the best combo! For the surf options, my husband had the tomato pesto salmon and I had the grouper with lobster remoulade. The salmon was absolutely delicious, but the grouper was an absolute let down! The \"lobster remoulade\" was really one small bite of lobster in what tasted like sour cream. And my fish was SO small. Honestly 3 bites max. \nHowever, we both got the prime rib and it was excellent. That was definitely the best part of the meal. When I made the reservation on Open Table, I made a note that our anniversary was coming up. I totally forgot that I did that, but the waitress brought out a fully size cookie sundae with a candle and \"happy anniversary\" written on. She also boxed up our desserts from the pre fixed menu to go. I thought that was a really nice gesture. The service was fantastic. Our water glasses were never empty (always a huge bonus) and the staff were all incredibly nice. \nI gave 4 stars for 2 main reasons: the food was great, but the portions were small. My fish was so tiny and it was served with about 3 bites of potatoes. Second, all the food was served room temp. The fact that my prime rib wasn't hot meant that it was cooking while sitting and I hate that! \nAll in all, I would return to The Carlton and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a nice evening out!
