NOT a happy customer today. Almost bit the dust in the DISGUSTING bathroom. My 3 year old had to go so I held her above the toilet because it was so nasty she didn't want to sit on it. Then almost slipped and fell in the big soapy water spot on the floor. That's on top of the pushy waitress. I have me and 2 kids to figure out food for after I took my daughter to the restroom. Not going to happen as soon as I sit down. And NO it was not busy. No need to keep rushing me. IF I ever come again will make sure not to sit in her section. Food was decent as usual.
