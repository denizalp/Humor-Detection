This place used to be so awesome but the last year or so it has steadily gone down hill. It seems as though most of the servers are still here, as well as some of the \"cooks.\" If you ask for anything special like you would at a normal sushi resturant they have a bad attitude. If there is a dish that is supposed to be warm and u ask for a fresh one they grab it off the conveyor belt. The last few times they have produced so much of the food that way it can last for two or three hours... it's sushi and it's supposed to be fresh...
