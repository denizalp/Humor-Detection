Have tried them three times since the store opened; I made two other attempts and found them closed during lunch hour???? Anyway... yes they will fulfill a craving, but so will making them at home and this is how these donairs taste. The meats consistency is sloppy at best as it's just bits of ground beef, the sauce ok... As said will fulfil a craving if you have not had one in a few years, otherwise go online, find a recipe and tweak it until you found something you like.... This is what the owner did.
