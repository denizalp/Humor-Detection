Set the stage:\nPre-Valentine's Say GNO. (Girl's night out for those of you who are not acronym savvy)\n\n5 attractive ladies stroll in after getting their Happy Dog Hot-Dog on lookin' for something sweet to end the evening.\n\nAs we enter, the bright lights shine and the chocolates shimmer.  Okay, maybe they don't shimmer but my eyes were dancing with chocolates and candies and cookies and brownies and... and.... and....\n\nEach of us ordered a lovely Sundae and rounded the corner to sit at a cute round table with quaint heart-shaped backed chairs.  Our lovely ice-cream makers brought out our concoctions and salivating, we dug in.  \n\nOh, Sweet, Heaven.\n\nThe service was great, the order-takers patient, and the cute young boy behind the counter so enraptured by our beauty and wit brought us complementary popcorn.\n\nFor all your late-night and not-so-late night soda, sweets, or ice cream excursions...head on down to Sweet Moses and get your Sweet on.
