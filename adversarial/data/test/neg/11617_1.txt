This place is great.   My husband and I came here yesterday for dinner while our girls were at an event nearby.   We sat at the chefs table.  We were given friendly efficient service.  Food was excellent.  We were given some free pretzel rolls with cheese dip on the house because they had extra orders.  Atmosphere was fantastic.  We will definitely return!
