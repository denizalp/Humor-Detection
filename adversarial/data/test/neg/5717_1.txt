I have seen this place a few times and wanted to give it a try.  I am glad I did.  First I have had a \"few\" Cheesesteaks in my day while I lived in Philly for 8 years. I also ate at the places namesake, Genos in South Philly.  No not as good, sorry Gilbert Genos, but without the Philly bread you had no shot.  On the good side, the bread was decent and their Genos steak was made CORRECTLY with cheese whiz. If you have never had a real Philly then do yourself the favor and get it wit whiz, wit back there means onions and whiz well, I am sure you know what that is.  \n\nThe manager there was very friendly and attentive and when he found out I had lived in Philly he was very interested in my opinions.  I did give him the suggestion for gravy fries a staple at diners all over that area. \n\nThe place was clean, the food was delivered quickly and happily the place was busy for a Thursday lunch.\n\nI will defiantly be back....oh and other Philly fanatics, yes they have Tastykakes for sale.
