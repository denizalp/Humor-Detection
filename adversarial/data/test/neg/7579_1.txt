Absolutely amazing little place. Food was wonderful. Mini muffins were delectable. Bacon was an it undercooked as I like it crispy but everyone's different. Biscuits and gravy were amazing. Scrambled eggs were good. Coffee was good. Maggie my waitress was very attentive and always made sure my coffee cup was full. Will absolutely be coming back.
