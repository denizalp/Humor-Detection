Are you kidding me?? They call this a \"thrift\" store but I don't see thrift store prices!! I can't STAND stores like these that take advantage of their customers but act like they actually care!! Why would you want to buy a used, raggedy shirt with holes & missing tags for $5-$10 when you can get a BRAND NEW shirt at numerous other stores for LESS?! It makes no sense!! Not only that but it takes an entire DAY to go through all their clothing since they are a total MESS! Guess they've never heard of COLOR CODING! After shopping there for the first time yesterday (thinking that everything was 50% off) then realizing at the checkout only \"YELLOW TAG\" items are 50% off, I didn't have a SINGLE item in my cart that was on sale. I had 8 items that totaled $86!!! I said \"EXCUSE ME??\" Needless to say I put all of those items back & I will definitely not be returning!! R-I-P-O-F-F !
