This place is awesome !! They made our anniversary\/ Valentine's Day perfect and magical.  We were seated right away and greeted and told happy Anniversery. Shown to our table which was on the patio and so romantic.  Offered water right away with choice of bottled or house water with hint of cucumber. Given our menus. Our waiter Chris cane to table and explained every item on menu. Also told us the reason for changing menu is so chef can use freshest ingredients. First course we both had \nManila Clam Chowder.   Which was beyond excellent. \n               Had a little bit of spice which made it, to my        taste buds anyway. The best I have ever had. Next-\n\nWintersalad.  -  salad was fantastic also. \n\nTempura King Tiger Prawn - sweet and spicy \n\nChilean Sea Bass- melted in your mouth \n\nAnniversery Dessert-  Strawberry Cheesecake \n\nEveryone was attentive. Soft music. Candlelight. Roses on each table. \n\nBill came. And yes it was high. But it was worth it. We could not afford to eat here more then once a year. But if you have a special occasion coming up. This place can't be beat. My husband and I go to a special restaurant every year for our anniversary and this was by far the best.  Thank you for a memorable night staff of Cafe Monarch !!!!
