We were organizing for OCA Greater Phoenix non-profit event in January 2014 and needed a company to print our program book with high quality and a reasonable price.   We worked with International Minute Press and the owner, Jim did an absolutely amazing job.  Besides the high quality work, the service was personable and caring.  We were behind in submitting our materials to Jim and didn't have all of the final layout after the deadline.   Jim and one of his associates, Tim, were so willing to help and so accommodating.   We had a final change at 6am the morning of the printing and we called and Jim actually picked up the phone  at 6am and helped us.   In addition, he was able to get our rush order done in 4 hours.  WOW that's service.   \n\nThank you Jim and Tim for all your help!
