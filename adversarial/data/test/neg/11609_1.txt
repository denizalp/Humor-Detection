I love the halo halo with the whole works mix inside. Red Ribbon was not being cheap in giving the proper portion of a \"true\" halo halo should taste. I would normally order 2 halo halo at jolibee because the amount of ice I would pay so that's $10 instead of $5. \n\nNow, I also ordered pancit luglug and again this place surpass the competition next to them jolibee. It's done in proper portion meat and pieces of eggs and again not being cheap like competition next door jolibee. I do not like writing bad comments on yelp about any company. But when credit is due then I would. \n\nInconvenience: Now I will just have to park and go inside as oppose to drive thru that jolibee. So Red Ribbon get the ribbon for quality of food.
