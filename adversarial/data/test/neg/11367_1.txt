INCREDIBLE customer service! ..where the management is not afraid to speak with customers...and almost all of the telephone crew in reservations are OUTSTANDING! They have great specials, be sure to look at their packages when reserving a room! The only issue is that many of their vendors are a little rude...I was offended by a vendor who stated \"I am busy right now, you will have to ask someone else\" and a manager of a restaurant whom argued with me, until he figured out he was interrupting me while I was speaking and had no clue what he was talking about. But these issues were with the Grand Canal Shoppes. The Canyon ranch gives superb service, just make sure you have a  thorough understanding of the services and packages...if you are getting a certificate for services, you can NOT use them on a  package....:(
