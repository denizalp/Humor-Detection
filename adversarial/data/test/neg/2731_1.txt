I've been a life-long customer of TD Bank which then became TD Canada Trust with a merge decades ago.\n\nTeller service at this branch often experiences huge lineups throughout the day so plan your visit with some thought about having to to queue as much as 30 minutes or more to get up the a Customer Service Rep for counter service.  Still, staff are pleasant and efficient; they totally understand your wait frustration so please don't take it out on them!\n\nIf you must meet with a financial products specialist, you can book a future appointment or just walk in and wait in the seating area.\n\nI prefer online banking.  Sometimes I have must use one of four Green Machine self-serve banking ATMs at the Scarborough Town Centre branch.  My time is valuable!\n\nBank hours are quite broad so that's a plus!
