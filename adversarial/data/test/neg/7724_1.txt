My fiance and I had a romantic evening here for Valentine's weekend and I loved every moment of our experience. The mood, the customer service, the cocktails and the food! Nicole D. was our sever and she recommended sooo many delicious things! We had the sweet potato cannelloni- so phenominal and unique, and the chicken scallopini (again- amaze!!!) Such a lovely night and we can't wait to come back!!!!
