I purchased a Group On deal for Babylon and thought that I would give this Hookah bar a chance as I had passed it so many times.\n\nWasn't really impressed at all. The decor is awful, there is no atmosphere to the place, service was very poor given that there was only 8 people in the whole place.\n\nFood was okay, but nothing special. The kitchen is incredibly clean, you can see into when you head to the bathrooms. Shisha was good, but no special blends or anything out of the ordinary to set them apart.\n\nA DJ started up around 9 pm and was much too loud, it was like you were at the club, plus he wasn't that good either.\n\nFor what it is worth, if you are in the mood for some shisha, travel the extra 15 minutes to get to Narah in Marda Loop.
