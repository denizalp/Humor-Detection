Top Hat Tuxedo at The Waterworks Mall\" has wonderful selection, a courteous and professional staff, and excellent service. I have used them for several events from proms  to weddings, and they exceed my expectations every time. They have a huge inventory of stock and they set my husband up with a beautiful tux on very short notice. Thier prices, service and selection can't be beat. Also, the store at the Pittsburgh Mills is not associated with them so don't go to the wrong one!
