I was looking for a new restaurant to go to when I came across  Los Olivos reviews. I have eaten here many times over the years and I will admit that a few times I didn't absolutely love my meal but these people who give out one star and two star reviews like they are God Almighty just makes me sick. \nLos Olivos serves authentic Sonoran\/Arizonan Mexican Food and does a great job at it. I love this place. Yelpers please remember especially if you are reviewing a small business that there are real people you are reviewing. Lets change the culture of Yelp by remembering what our mothers told us a long time ago. If you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything at all.
