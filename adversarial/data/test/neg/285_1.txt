Well I have to say that despite the negative\/neutral reviews, I still wanted and needed to check this place out.  I do not like the comparision to Hooters since this place personalize the visit by the gowns and clinic theme\n\nThe food, service, atmosphere is awesome and truly highly recommend this place.
