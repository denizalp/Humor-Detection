Super slow and people always complaining on how long they been waiting, went there today and all I hear was people complaining on how long it takes just to get there drinks and it was even that busy and they had like 6 workers or even more anyways waited 40 min for my drink and people that was there before me was still waiting after I got mine. There were couple people who got there way later then all of us but got there drinks within 5 minutes ??? This place is all hype , drinks are average and too sweet, use to come here three times a week with my gf but I'm going to have to find another spot.
