I love this place! I discovered it with a friend during a yelp shopping crawl, and have been back several times since. They have beautifully boxed chocolates, which I got for a  relative, for christmas. They also have a huge selection of chocolate by the pound! \nI recommend the cypress tress, almond bark, and peppermint bark for starters, though it all looks good!\nThe chocolate is mostly made by the owners, and they really know their stuff. Really sweet too. \nYou can find it in the tivoli village shopping center, across the street from charming charlies... I think..
