Solid place for hand pulled noodles. Not a large menu to choose from, you can get the beef noodle soup, dry noodles with a pork sauce, vegetable noodle soup, and they have a choice of one more on the weekends. This place seems to get packed quick even on a weekday!\n\nI like how you can choose from a variety of noodle sizes ranging from super thin to extremely wide based on your preference. They also have a few options for appetizers\/sides. The service is quick and the servers are very nice. The noodles are cooked just right and the broth doesn't taste like it's full of msg. The large left me super full, I think next time the small would hit the spot and I'm a pretty big eater.
