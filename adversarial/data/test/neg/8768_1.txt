My friend and I share the same auto policy and this made things a bit more challenging\/complicated than the average policy. For this reason, we ultimately went with a direct carrier that was a better match for our special needs. Still, I felt is was important to take the time to write a review to let others know how impressed we were with Nicole at Chauncy Insurance. From the beginning she was immediately available to help us (no voicemail or waiting for a call back). She took the time to explain various policies, laws and procedures. She was prompt in finding us the top carriers with the best quotes in addition to explaining the benefit of other options if wanted\/needed. As a meticulous shopper, I can be demanding and high maintenance and loaded with tons of questions. Nicole was amazingly patient throughout the process, took her time to explain things and knowing we were on a time crunch, she even made herself available after hours via email or her personal cell phone if I had any addition questions or concerns. Thank you Nicole and I'm hoping we can work together in the future!
