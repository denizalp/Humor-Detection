What a beautiful location! Outside seating is so relaxing it makes you want to spend the day there. The menu is innovative and modern. Many vegetarian and gluten free options. My husband had the Cuban which he said was the best sandwich he has ever had. I had the butternut squash enchiladas which were rich and flavorful. Even my side salad was exceptional! Can't wait to come back and try more of the menu.
