My husband and I come in here on occasion after going to the gym. I usually just order a tall plain coffee just pike or blonde nothing complicated. At every other location I go to, they pour it right there and hand it to me. At this location Kevin is always behind the counter, the last two times we've come in the rest of our order is ready and I've had to ask Kevin for my coffee. It would be nice if the service was consistent no matter what location you go to. I will not be coming back to this one.
