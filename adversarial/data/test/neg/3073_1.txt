Oh my gosh, it is an absolute treat to take the family here.  The Italian ice is the best I've ever had.  The employees are very helpful and polite.  The go to is always the Bing cherry Joe latte, so many cherry prices.  Out of this world flavor.  My family loves coming to joes.  We will continue coming here.
