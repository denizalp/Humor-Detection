Another great place to drop of your clothes.  I popped in here and gave them a try.  I dropped off two dress shirts.  The lady behind the counter had me set to come back after 3pm the next day.  I like how they are very organized with computer and reciept printouts.  This way there is no arguement on how many pieces you left or if they misplace anything.  The pricing here is very decent compare to the other places around the area.  I guess this a hidden gem for us workers.  I came back and my shirts were both pressed and nothing damaged.  I took a look around and it looks like they have all the equipment to do all the cleaning and pressing themselves.  \n\nSide note, place might be hard to find.  It is in the same plaza as Walgreens, facing Tropicana and they do alterations on site as well.
