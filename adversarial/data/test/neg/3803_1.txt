Terrible, barely responsive customer service.Â \nI ordered my son's graduation package through Herff Jones. We didn't have any other options as I wanted grad announcements with our school symbol\/seals on them. I placed my original order for the announcements, custom name cards, cap & gown, Class of 2018 logo items, etc. and paid the expedited S&H. I received my order in 2 weeks and discovered that I spelled my son's middle name incorrectly on the announcement name cards; yes I owned that mistake. I reordered online just the name cards with the correct spelling hoping to get them by early May to send out the invites and paid $10.99 for rush shipping. I emailed the contact info on the website to get an ETA on the order as it does not indicate anywhere on the site delivery times. I got crickets. I decided to just trust the process that the name cards would be delivered to our address as it said in their FAQs. About 2 weeks later we get a text that our order was ready to be picked up. Um ok, what did I pay shipping for? I sent my son to pick up the order and he returns with a duplicate of our original order that had the namecards with the incorrect spelling. I called the business and left a message, texted the number, messaged them on Yelp...nothing. Middle of the following week. At this time we needed to get the announcements and invitations in the mail. Fine. I mailed the announcements with the name cards with the incorrect spelling hoping no one will notice. I get an email and message from their \"Secretary,\" stating that they will mail out the correct name cards. I replied that I had to send out the announcements to ensure timely delivery, so mailing out the cards would not help my situation. At that point I requested a refund for the name cards and the S&H which per their website said that they would be shipped to my address; however we had to drive 20+ miles to pick up. She replied back that she can refund only the name cards and the S&H could not be refunded because the S&H charges apply to shipment of the cap\/gown\/tassel.. WTH? I had to explain, AGAIN, that I already paid the S&H in my initial order for the cap\/gown\/tassel. I requested again a full refund with S&H included and my phone number for her to help me understand how this was good customer service. Again crickets. She replied back with \"This will be refunded.\" That's it. No apology was ever given, and no information as to when this refund would be posted. I had to follow up again for that ETA, and again guess what? Crickets. I put my trust that this company would make things right and send the correct name cards in my reorder. Thank GOD I didn't order anything else, like a class ring from these people.\n\nIf you can't keep up with the volume of CCSD, you shouldn't be in this business. And yes, this feedback will be going to the BBB, CCSD, and our school administrators. Had an apology been given, they would have earned 2 more stars out of me. This is a service industry town driven by CUSTOMER SERVICE. I suggest you step things up.
