Excellent hotel choice in Mesa.  Close to stores and food. Rooms were nicely furnished and clean.  The guest services was great and very friendly staff by everyone we encountered.  The breakfast was awesome and the selection and quality was very good, especially for free.  The coffee was hot and I loved that they had flavored creams.  They take pride in service and I will definitely stay again.
