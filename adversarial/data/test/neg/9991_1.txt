Good pizza but not great. Thin crust with decent amount of toppings, however if this place would invest literally $1 more at manufacture cost it would be one of the best pizzas around. Slightly light on toppings. Dough is on point. Wings are huge but not crispy enough. Don't get me wrong, they appear to buy the most premium wings. They are the size of small drumsticks and are awesome. Another 2-4 minutes in the fryer and they would probably be the best wings in Phx for quality of base material alone. Wing sauce is decent too. Could use a little more butter maybe? This is probably the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. Pizza got another deduction which is probably unjustified due to the wing experience. Pizza definitely has the potential to be top notch. All the fundamentals are there. Overall not terrible. I paid $50 for 2 large 1 topping pizzas and 20 wings. Probably will give them one more try, but after that unless they improved never again. Could get papa John's or Pizza hut or whatever for $20 less with promotion. If you are going to charge premium price your food needs to be amazing or your restaurant is never going to make it. 5-star potential for sure.
