So the fish fry was not my favorite. The fries were great and the coleslaw was pretty good. The fish seemed frozen and didn't have that classic beer batter that you expect with fish frys. the worst part of this meal was their terrible tarter sauce. When talking to waitress we were informed that they put sweet relish in the tarter sauce, this is such a odd combination and was so off putting.
