The Sow's Ear is a cute little cafe\/knitting shop located inside a house-themed that gives it a nice home feeling. \n\nThe food was reasonably priced and my boyfriend tipped $5 in the tip jar at the counter in support of good local business. \n\nWe ordered a grilled cheese meal with chips, a bowl of the daily soup of tomato and roasted bell peppers, and a fruit and nut salad.  However, the food we ordered was slightly underwhelming. The grilled cheese was too crusty, over cooked and tough to eat. Although, dipped inside the soup, it tasted a little better since the soup softened the bread and made it more edible. The fruit and nut salad was a bit simple and wasn't satisfying. \n\nWe also ordered two drinks: iced latte and iced chai latte. Both was a little heavy on the milk but we were able to finish it since an iced drink is always nice on a hot sunny day! \n\nOverall, it was a nice brunch meal and the atmosphere is catered towards knitters who are there to enjoy a simple meal or cafe drink while knitting. There's also the knitting supplies store as well as knitting classes offered throughout the year.
