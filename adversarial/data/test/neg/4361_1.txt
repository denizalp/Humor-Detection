Noodle Asia is very accessible as it's on the casino level. It's 3am closing time makes it perfect for a  late night meal. For obvious reasons I would gear towards noodle based dishes such as Hong Kong Won Ton. The dumplings were pretty good but broth was the killer there. The har gow dim sum appetizer is also a classic and must try as well. \n\nIt is Vegas but price wise it's going to cost you $30 per person for an app + main.
