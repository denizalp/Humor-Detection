Had a good time once we finally were given a spot. We were put on a 2 hour waiting list! So we decided we would go eat and hang out until it was our turn. 2 and 1\/2 hours later i asked where we were on the list. The lady said there were 7 groups still ahead of us due to them making reservations online. They decided to have us wait for 2 1\/2 hours before telling us that we were going to keep getting pushed back. Finally at about the 3 hour mark we had a spot. Manager had to fix our ball machine twice. Manager and server were great! But the system was a bust. 3 hour wait to play for a hour and have the thing break down twice.
