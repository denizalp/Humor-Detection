Last night I made a return visit to Duggan's; it had been 2-3 years since my last visit and I was there for a bigger Event with a social Group I'm a Member of.  Here's some history about Duggan's: they were previously located at Victoria St. in the Downtown Core, then they re-opened as a pop-up in their current location in 2014.  They became a full-fledged Brewery\/Brewpub by the end of that year and - although I didn't find out the full story until last night - they're currently renovating their main floor, therefore they're currently open in their lower floor space only, with a live band space just inside the entrance from outside.\n\nI visited the Brewery a number of times when they were on Victoria St., at least once when they re-opened as a pop-up and I was there when they had an Event on their 1st day as a full Brewery.  I've also been back several times for Events with my aforementioned social Group, one of which included a tour of their beer making facilities downstairs.  As they now need to accommodate live band and customer space, etc. the lower floor now looks radically different - it now resembles a long corridor, but with a fair bit of seating overall.\n\nLast night all of their beers avail. were only $6 which was a pretty great deal; I had 2 beers, both of which I quite enjoyed.  I've never really eaten at Duggan's so I can't really comment on their food but I understand that it's mostly pizza and tacos that are on offer.  I heard that 3 bands performed just during the time that I\/my Group was there and both the musical instruments played and music performed were quite unique.  There was Bar service which was quite prompt considering that it was pretty crowded and became more so as it got later.  The entire downstairs area open to customers had a 'make-shift' appearance so I'm not sure what's in store for the space once the upstairs renovations are complete but there might not be any major changes at first as I believe the live space downstairs was installed when their main floor was still open.\n\nI'll consider posting an updated review if\/when I visit their main floor once it's re-opened and I have an opportunity to see how it's changed.  In the meantime the lower floor entrance is on Brock St.; look for the red Christmas lights and a stairway going down at the northwest corner of the building.
