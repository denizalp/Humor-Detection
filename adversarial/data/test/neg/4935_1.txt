Was looking for a good burger on Saturday and found the OBW on Yelp and decided to give it a shot although it was a little bit of a drive since I live in Buckeye and this is in downtown Phoenix little bit of  a drive just for a Burger however after finishing The Big One completely satisfied and will return
