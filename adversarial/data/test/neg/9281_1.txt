I went here because it is right around the corner from my house. I rarely have to go to the doctor, one of those people that just rarely gets sick. But as I am getting older, I thought a yearly trip was about time.\n\nDr. Limkemann is a really good guy. He really takes time to explain the how and why. His office is friendly and accommodating, the few appointments I have had to make are usually same or next day.
