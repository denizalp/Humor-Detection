I've been to Flemings a few times in other locations as my parents are big fans. The BF though has never been. \n\nThey started us with the bread, which I hate that I want to eat all of it as there's always so much rich food to follow. They do a plain loaf but the sundried tomato butter and the gorgonzola cranberry spread are both so good!\n\nI got the prime rib which is a sunday special. It comes with a salad choice, a side, and a dessert making it a good value package deal. I chose the modern caesar which was very fresh and I appreciate it is not over dressed. The prime rib itself was solid as far as prime rib go. They could have served it more rare, as my medium rare was leaning into medium territory, but not a deal breaker for me. I think though if I had to choose a steak or this, dry aged steak wins. It comes with au jus, creamy horseradish and a nice mustard sauce. \n\nThe BF got the dry aged ribeye. It was cooked perfectly medium rare and the flavor and char was perfect. He could not get over this steak and said it was one of the best he's ever had. I had bites and indeed that is worth its price.\n\nMine came with a side so I got creamed spinach and it was super creamy and just perfect. I make a solid creamed spinach and that I say is begrudgingly better than mine. The BF also wanted a starch so we got blue cheese mashed potato. They need not skimp on the blue cheese butter! \n\nI picked their signature lava cake as my dessert that came with my prime rib. It was gooey inside, but it didn't lava out when cut. The flavor was very nice. The ice cream was solid as was the chantilly cream they serve on the side. \n\nService was very attentive from our main server, the runners but none were overbearing. I really liked our server Stacey in fact. Im awful with names, but I actually remembered because she was good.The manager came by as well to make sure everything was exceptional once we got our entrees.  I've also always liked places that did things like crumb clean up after bread service and change out your silverware for different courses and chilled utensils for cold\/frozen courses. I feel like that should be standard for a nice spot, but I've been to many where it is not. \n\nFor a chain steakhouse, I think it rocks. It's a bit pricey and in a place that is abundant in steak house culture it may not be the first choice, but it's a solid choice. It'll be a moment until my next visit, but this visit was exceptional to warrant the 5 star.
