After having been a member of Crossfit Uprising since April I figure that it's about time I come onto Yelp and put in my 2 cents.  For starters, this is NOT your typical lifting routine + treadmill workout that you can do blindfolded.  This is much more varied, interesting and actually fun thanks to both our trainer Jared and the great CFU members! The workouts at CFU are by far the most challenging and intense yet satisfying that I've ever been a part of in any workout regimen.   You're in and out in under an hour (this includes stretches, the workout of the day [WOD], and the ab portion) but you WILL leave soaked with sweat and proud of yourself for completing the workouts! The atmosphere amongst our fellow members is nothing short of phenomenal - everybody is always there to push you further than you thought possible, encourage you to do one more rep when you think you've got none left, and cheer you on as they wait for the entire group to finish. \n\nSince signing up at CFU I have more energy, I'm in better shape than I've ever thought possible, I actually perform cardio (this is no small task), I sweat while I work out (again, no small task), and I wake up feeling sore and tired but ready for more. \n\nEverybody needs to stop by and talk to Jared and meet the rest of the CFU family.  You won't be disappointed!!!
