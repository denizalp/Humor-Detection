I had tried Thai food from many places.. I have to admit that this is the best place.  The decorations are simple, nice and clean...the services are great, owners are nice and friendly... and the food are EXCELLENT!!! PadThai, Pad Prik King, Tod Mun Kung... The lunch menus are very reasonable around $8 and you will get unlimited soup and salad (I could just have these and be happy;) the dish come with spring roll (yummy). For the price, the service and the healthy choice (vs. fast food) I would defitnitely recommend to everyone!
