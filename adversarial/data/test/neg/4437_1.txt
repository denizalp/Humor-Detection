Had my first shrimp cocktail here over 25 years ago.  They're still just as good, or better, and they are still served in exactly the same way.  \n\nThere's always a long line, but that just tells you that it's a good place to eat.  I hope they never change a thing.\n\nBIG FAN of everything in the Golden Gate !  Love it.
