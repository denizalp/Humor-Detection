What's with this hotel? Stayed here last year, had an ok time but for a melee on the casino floor, spotty housekeeping and the early close of the pool one day. The staff was so apologetic and accomodating, that I came back to try it again instead of working on becoming a VIP at Caesars. \n\nBooked 8 nights for my birthday since I planned to see a bunch of shows and wanted to enjoy the resort a little. I booked early this year but apparently they didn't know I was coming because they only had a handicap accessible room available when I checked in. I definitely didn't request that. But, I'm flexible so I agreed to that instead of the room on the lower floor that gets loud when the dj comes to Mixx. \n\nI went down this morning to swap from the handicap accessible room to a regular room (dying to take a bath) and the front desk agent told me to come back after I pack my room. I came back an hour later and alas! No rooms available and of course the agent was not there anymore. So, I lugged my crap back upstairs to my handicapped room where it will stay until I leave on Monday.\n\nThe rooms need to be upgraded. Terrible Tube TVs, my headboard is coming undone and what happened to the robes and slippers? Two strikes for the hotel... Next time, I'm springing for The Wynn....
