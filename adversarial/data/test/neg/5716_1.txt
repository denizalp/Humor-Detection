Excellent 5 star service received at Optic Gallery on N Stephanie St.  Travis and Teresa did a great job advising me on new Anti-Glare Lenses for my Hugo Boss glasses.  They went over multiple shades of tint to custom my request and im very happy with the results.\n\nEach time I have visited this branch of Optic Gallery the team goes out of their way to help and give the right advice.  Great selection of frames too at reasonable prices.   Thanks again guys appreciate you!
