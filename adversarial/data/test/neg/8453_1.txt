I have eaten at Biryani for the express lunch buffet and dinner. \n\nI think the lunch buffet is a good value for the price. The options are very limited, but it's only $7.00. They offered chicken tikka masala and tandoor chicken. They also had two other bean dishes and then yogurt, tamarind and mint chutney and of course naan. The tikka masala was just ok it wasn't very flavorful. On the other hand the chicken tandoori was completely mind blowing! It was the best chicken tandoori I've ever had. \n\nFor dinner we ordered the tandoori chicken and chicken curry. Once again I was blown away with the tandoori chicken, but completely let down with the chicken curry. It tasted too tomato-ee and too plain. There naan is also so-so. \n\nI would recommend this place for the tandoori chicken but not really for the sauces or curries.
