o far the server is very rude. Tables were dirty and busser never came to clean them. Ordered the soup and salad and soup they had. I believe the comment was,the same four we always have. Wow. . We sat at the bar and our \"server\" was named Jesse. Walked up to the person next to both of us asked them how they were and continued to walk past us. I really don't understand why be in   the service industry if you hate the public. Hope it can be chalked up to a bad day. Too bad because love its close to my house. I said I wouln't come back again bc this lady just treated us so badly, but I gave it another shot. the food was just as good as always and so was the company. Our service was ok,, but I think this location could learn a thing or 2 about service and should take a refresher course.
