Got to spend 2 amazing nights here which made our Montreal trip really special. Wonderful hosts, well furnished room.\n\nThe hosts were both very open and knowledgeable about the surrounding area and highlights in the city of Montreal. We had an awesome stay and ended up renting their bikes for a day full of cycling around and exploring.\n\nCheck this place out when staying in Montreal!
