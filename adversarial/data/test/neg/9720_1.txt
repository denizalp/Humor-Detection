got to see furious 6 here this past weekend. \ni like harkens theaters because they're comfortable and clean. the quality of the picture and sound is also very good.\n\nstaff was nice at the box office. the girl taking our ticket after we walked in look bored out of her mind and could learn to smile, but, hey, whatever! haha
