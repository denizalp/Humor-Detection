My courtyard gate was delivered and installed yesterday. The family and I are very pleased with the entire process at Olson Iron. It was made exactly how the estimator and I had discussed. Even the initial consultation process was a great experience for us. The faux finish is absolutely gorgeous! Everyone that we communicated with was very professional, knowledgeable and accommodating.  I'm extremely satisfied with the overall quality of this company.  We've already told all our friends and family about Olson Iron! I wanted to share my excellent experience with those who may be considering contacting Olson Iron for a project at your home or business to get wrought iron work done for their home, especially for entry and courtyard gates like mine. Highly recommend! 5-stars across the board!
