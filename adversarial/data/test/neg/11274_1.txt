Have been with Firebird housing as an out-of-state owner for over a decade. Recently came to Arizona to visit some properties and met with Teresa. She has been a wonderful liaison between us and our tenants. She's a welcome addition to Firebird housing. Firebird housing has  done a good job screening prospective tenants and securing the best of the lot. It was a relief to see  our properties have been maintained and looked after. Thank you firebird housing!
