Never had been to fired pie before. Counter help were extremely helpful and courteous in explaining how things work. \nWe were impressed with the quality of the salad and pizza. \nOne big suggestion if your having a salad ask for your pizza order to be held until you finish your salad, as it only takes 3 minutes to cook a pizza here. \nLooking forward to going back. \n\nHave been back several times. Excellent. Best salads in the Valley $9. Pizza really good. Unlimited ingredients all for $9 or $11 for gluten free. \n\nHave eaten here around 15 times since they opened and never had a problem until tonight. \n\nFood is really good but had some very incompetent people working there who couldn't even make a salad. Manager Gabe came over and started yelling at us. \n\nOwners need to know this as word of mouth travels fast in Scottsdale. \n\nReally good food. Never had a problem before. Need to train their people better and fire this manager. \n\nFired Pie was really busy tonight. The employees were great. Apologized for the wait which I didn't think was bad. They were very professional. \nFood as always was excellent. Still think they have the best pizzas and salads in town at a very reasonable price. \nNice evening with friends. \n\nNice seeing Fired Pie retaining their help. Excellent service the last two weeks
