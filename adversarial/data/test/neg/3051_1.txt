Any Apple Store can be intimidating and confusing if your not a tech super-sensation. I just upgraded to 6s with 2 phones and the iCloud was making life miserable between personal\/business phone functions that I use. Was lucky enough to get a guy named Trent to help me out. Within minutes he had not only told me but showed me how to solve my problems. Was in and out in 5 minutes solving hours of problems I had the night before dealing with new phones and carriers. Extremely happy with my service at this store. It's also located in a great shopping center called Town Square. Shops, dining, bars, etc. could spend all day in walking distance.
