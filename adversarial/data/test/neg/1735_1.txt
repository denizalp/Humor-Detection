This is an amazing Japanese restaurant! I ate there with some friends on Friday and have been dreaming about it since (today is Tuesday). I am already planning my next visit there as we speak. Each dish brought out was better than the last and I plan to try everything on the menu one of these days. My absolute favorites were the albacore sashimi and black cod. Enjoy mouth watering Japanese food here in Phoenix.
