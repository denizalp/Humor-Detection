This is by far the worst run medical practice in the State of Nevada.  The office manager Kim, has no clue how to run an office or have the slightest bit of empathy for patients.  She blatantly refused to let me speak with Dr. Benson and refused to leave the doctor a message requesting a call back.  As a 5 year patient, unfortunately used to waiting 4 hours for each appointment, I vow to never set foot in this office again.  Do yourself a favor...if your GP recommends Dr. Benson or Dr. Singh, RUN in the other direction.  If you don't have heart problems when you arrive, you'll certainly have them cause by the stress of the poorly run practice.  Go somewhere else.
