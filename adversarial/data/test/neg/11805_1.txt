Got takeout tonight from The Wok.  Ordered sweet and sour chicken and orange chicken dinner combos along with an order of chicken fried rice and Chinese doughnuts which my teenage daughter loves. Staff was friendly and order was ready in less than 15 minutes. All was very tasty and even have leftovers for tomorrow.
