I dig it.  I've been many times now and have never had a bad experience.  Service is always friendly.  They have a great beer selection, ranging from Mickey's (yes) on up.  The atmosphere is good and the music is usually good.  To people who haven't been, I sometimes say that it's like The Roosevelt, except much, much better.  Sorry, Roosevelt.\n\nThe tuna sandwich is amazing!  I generally avoid dairy and eggs, but I order this tuna anyway and I don't ask them to alter it (hard-boiled eggs in the salad, havarti on the sandwich) because it works, it is incredible, and I cease to care when I am there.  The only other menu items I can comment on are the hot dog - good but frankly a little upscale for me when it comes to hot dogs- and the chocolate brownie which is, of course, very good.  My biggest complaint is that the food selection is not the greatest for vegetarians and vegans.\n\nThe restaurant was converted from a cute old home in the Coronado district and has a nice patio.  They have a pretty good happy hour deal, but I can't remember what it is at this time.  This is a place I'm always interested in visiting.
