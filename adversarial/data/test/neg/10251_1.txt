I have stayed at many hotels in Las Vegas but this one is by far my favorite. The suites are amazing Large and great bathroom space. Great when you have a lot of women staying there for a bachloretter party! Great restaurants and lovely decor! The shops are great and you feel like you are in Italy.Can't wait to go back!!!!
