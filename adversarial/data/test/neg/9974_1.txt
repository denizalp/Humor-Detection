Yes this is a cheap decent place for dim sum. But the food all tasted very bland and comes in a smaller portion compared to other restaurants(you get what you paid for I guess). Even their soy sauce were watered down. The only dishes we ordered that tasted ok were chicken feet and deep fried squid tentacles. This restaurant would be great for the ones who live in the area and would like a cheap meal, it is not the kind of place I would bring out of town friends to. \n\nWe were seated at the table that's closest to the entrance. So the people who were waiting for their tables were watching us eat. Some of them were standing right behind my chair. The guy who takes number even put his note pad with numbers on our table a couple times(unrespectful as f) , some of the people who were waiting literally leaned over to our table to look at the notepad which was very rude. This plus the bland food made the whole experience not so enjoyable, I ended up going home hungry.\n\n\nFood 3.5\/5\nService 3.5\/5\nEnvironment 3\/5\n\nWill I come back? Ha, lets see.
