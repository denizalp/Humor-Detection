I would have given it more stars if either service or food was good.  But both were mediocre.  The only thing that was good was the Jasmine tea.  We went there for lunch and most waiters were very young and untrained.   Nothing against being young, but they didn't know how to be a good waiter.  First they forgot about our table and didn't come to get our order for 15 min.  After they brought our food, they never came to check if we had enough water to re-fill it. We made small modification to one of the dishes and they put the extra veggies in the wrong dish.  Waiters were courteous, but green.  They just need to be trained better.  Food was subpar.  We are from Seattle area, so we are accustomed to higher quality Asian dishes. Maybe the folks who gave this place higher star haven't had really good Asian food to compare against.
