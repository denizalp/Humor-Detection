Kim Thompson is the queen of hair! She's been my stylist since 2000., and she will be forever! Kim knows her art and she's confident and amazing at it, no matter what type of hair you've got. Over the years I recommend her to all of my friends and family and I still do and will in the future. You have to go to the best!
