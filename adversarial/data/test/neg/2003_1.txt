I remembered seeing this restaurant on the food network show Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and thought very interesting at the time. Checked it out last night when I got into town and was not disappointed. I had a two meat bowl with JEN RED PORK, chicken fried rice and CHINESE B-B-Q PORK stuffed in a great flour tortilla and a cookie for dessert.  I come to Phoenix for a week every month and would come back again.
