My experience here was very average, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nIt's a very Americanized flavor of Mediterranean food, but the restaurant was clean, the service quick and astute, and the overall meal was nice, if not a bit lacking in flavor. \n\nI had the chicken shawerma and a side of felafel. The hummus that came with the felafel was good, as was the felafel, but the hummus was just alright. \n\nNot a bad introduction to Mediterranean food, but I'd suggest a more authentic place to get some really great stuff.
