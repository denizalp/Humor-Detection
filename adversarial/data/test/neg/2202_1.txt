French Macarons!  So far, next to Buchon Bakery on the strip, these are the best French Macarons I could find in the Las Vegas area.  \n\nAlso, this coffee shop is quite intimate; there is even an upstairs area you can hang out and sip a cup of coffee.  Great place to come by for a snack (my friend had one of their pizza looking salmon snacks and was pretty impressed), a cup of coffee, and delicious French macarons (salted caramel of course).
