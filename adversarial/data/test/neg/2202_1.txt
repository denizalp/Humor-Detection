Tried this place at the recommendation of my barber and glad I followed through.  The Basics:  Big Letter \"A\" from the health dept, clean restrooms, friendly staff and well kept and clean restaurant.  Small place.  Portions are very generous--enough to have dinner and leftovers for lunch.  I had the Hummas Shawarma Bowl with chicken and steak. Man it was good.  I stole some of my wife's Red Quinoa Salad.  We also had the Parsley Fries.  Everything was delish.  We're gonna be regulars!
