Awesome, amazing, honest, gentle. \nDr. Crow is the best. I'm not a big fan of dentists (probably why I need them so often) but this place was great. I went to a dentist in California where I was on vacation and my tooth pain started and the guy tried to scare me into doing $1200 worth of work while I was there. I told him no thanks and went with a friends referral to Dr. Crow. Wise choice. Dr. Crow took care of my needs and didn't try to retire from my visit. Dr. Crow and staff I can not thank you enough. I am out of pain. Tooth fixed and done right. Didn't break the bank either. I will be back for all other needs and you will be getting all of my family and friends business. Thank you so much.
