I was in the area for work and decided to check this place out for dinner as I was craving sushi. I got the Sushi Dinner that came with miso soup, salad, 8 pieces of California roll and 6 pieces of assorted nigiri. It wasn't the best sushi I've ever had but it was still tasty, fresh, and was good for the price point at $17.95.
