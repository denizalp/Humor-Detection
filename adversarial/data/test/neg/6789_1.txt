Solid transition from Awesome Truck to Easier-To-Find restaurant.\n\nHad the Papa K, which is a buttery crêpe with arugula, ham, cheese, and chunky grilled mushrooms.  Totally delicious. \n\nDaughter had the Smoked Turkey, which was more of a \"wrapped crêpe\" and was very good, but not on par with the Papa K, IMHO.\n\nAnxiously awaiting the duck-fat fries to be offered......:)\n\nGive these nice people and their super-duper crêpes a try - the taste will assure that you won't regret stopping by.
