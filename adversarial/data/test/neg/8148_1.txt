My cousins and I went here for a facial\/massage package and were blown away! All of our therapists were awesome! My massage therapist, Douglas, was amazing! He has his own techniques and his talents should not be wasted if you are wanting a Swedish massage. He has the strength and techniques to remove all you tough knots and leave you feeling a whole lot better. I shall definitely return to this place every time I'm in Vegas!
