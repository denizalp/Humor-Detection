Went for a tour and tasting this past Saturday. We're so glad we did. It was an extremely interesting tour and the tasting was excellent. We couldn't wait to go buy their products at the ABC stores. Sadly, due to NC law you can't just buy the product direct from the makers but its worth searching for.
