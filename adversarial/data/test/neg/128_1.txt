I've been a fan first, then a friend after getting to know this man. I'm stoked he's doing what he needs to be doing beyond fighting like the champ he is...and that's coaching. I've seen him coach and dedicate time and serious energy to being the best coach a person can need. If you're in the area, or even just visiting, this is a system that you need to check out. This will be money well spent and invested.
