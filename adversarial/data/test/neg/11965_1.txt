Great shop!  Went in and talked to Dane.  I wanted my daughter's name on my bicep.  Made an appointment with him for the next day.  Day of appointment he showed me his sketch of my daughters name.  Looked amazing.  He knocked out the tattoo in about and hour and a half.  He did an amazing job!  I'm so happy with it.  He said he loves doing lettering.  It shows as his line work is great.  Go get some lettering done from him.  He's a really great guy.  Thanks Dane!
