My fianc√© and I were admitted for no cost because I work at a neighboring museum. I was excited to spend the day there because it had been years since I visited. Unfortunately, if you're over the age of 16, this museum is less likely to wow you. \n\nThe museum is geared towards kids, which is wonderful, but it's rather bland for someone who is  older and knows basic facts about the natural world. The exhibits were rather tired, and I do believe that some of their exhibit descriptions in the dinosaur section were written using a typewriter. It's astonishing seeing as the admission rate is rather high. \n\nWe did pay to see the Planetarium, which was worth the low cost. I believe that's the museums best asset. \n\nDespite my negativity, I do believe this is a great place for kids, especially because it's interactive friendly. I also do respect the work that has been put into the outdoor area, which we only saw a piece of because it was raining.
