Freedom Auto Glass was so great!  I called on a Wednesday and they were able to give me an appointment on Thursday like I requested.  Darrick took down my information and told me everything that my car insurance company would ask me once he conferenced us in.  He was so patient when the insurance company had us on hold for nearly 20 minutes!  The call went just like he said and he was exceptionally polite.\n\nThe technicians arrived today within the 4-hour appointment window, and they called 30 minutes before arriving, just like Darrick said they would.  The technicians (Ricardo and ??) were so nice.  They were very clean and looked professional (of course that should be expected....but I've had a different experience with another company).  Ricardo explained everything clearly and had the work done in about 25 minutes.\n\nI received $100 cash in hand, which was their current facebook promotion.  No hassles!\n\nThanks so much Freedom Auto Glass!  :)
