Good burger with your choice of an artisan bun or whole wheat. Yummy shakes in many flavors we ordered three mint choc chip, chocolate and strawberry banana all good. Served with big fat straws whipped cream and a cherry. Fries with some extra seasoning added.  How about some tater tots? Onion straws for your burger plus about 17 other toppings. Choice of American, Cheddar, Blue Cheese plus one other I don't remember can be added for $.70. 2 single burgers, 3 little moos\/small shakes and one small fry....$25.74. Friendly manager working the line answering menu questions. Five Guys better watch out with their one bun and one cheese. No peanuts at Mooyah but sheets to color and crayons are on the tables. Good luck and welcome to the neighborhood.
