Came to the buffet because we knew they had gluten-free food.  The food turned out to be real tasty and had an endless variety of options. We had a question about an item and was curious if there was any wheat in it.  Daniel Taylor went out his way and brought out the ingredients so we can look and make sure their was no wheat. Such a great experience and he brought us some delicious smoothies on the house! Definitely coming back next time I'm in Vegas.
