Perfect place to come for breakfast when you don't want the hotel breakfast in Montreal. We had a ten minute wait but the food was worth it. Our waitress was great as well, very patient as we decided on our food. The menu has many options so it was kind of hard to decide. My only complaint would be that my French toast was a bit too soft but the flavor was still great.
