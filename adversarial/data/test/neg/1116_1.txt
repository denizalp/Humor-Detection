5 stars for the grilled chicken & empanadas. I had the corn salad & fries.  I didn't like the fries & the corn salad was good.  Wish it had more corn.  The sauce was a little sweet too.  But the chicken was a hit with my family and that empanada was to die for I bought one just to taste made me want to turn around and get more! The Sauce was amazing. Gooey hot cheese and the chicken was flavorful. Light and flaky crust.
