Horrible from the start!!! If I could give no stars I would. We walked on and were greeted with a \"you can have a seat it's going to be a while!\"   No hello or otherwise pleasant greeting. After she finished her customer which wasn't long at all, she just disappeared into the back of the building on what looked to be a smoke break. ( the door was open to see clear to the rear of the building) I waited 10-15 minutes before I got up to ring the bell. She sachets out and says \"License, proof of insurance, and method of payment\", no thank you for your patience, no apology for her abruptness prior. I stepped out to retrieve the insurance document only to come back and she was gone yet again from the desk, just left outside and left no explanation with my husband who was the renter. When she came back, she processed the documents and payment presumably and then goes on to say \" y'all can sit down anyway  cuz I gotta go clean the car!\"  I'm am writing this during my second wait and I haven't even left the building yet and I felt that this ignorance and unprofessional behavior could not go undocumented. Im just waiting to get her name to put a name to this photo. I don't want it to be mistaken as to who this person was that this company has in their employ. \n\nShe just walked backed in flopped some documents and key on the desk and said \"sign here!\", as she sang to the song on the radio. My husband asked regarding the dirty car she brought with someone's glasses clearly on the drivers seat she just got out of and she just replied that's it. Never again with this company just based on the actions of Karen Alexander.
