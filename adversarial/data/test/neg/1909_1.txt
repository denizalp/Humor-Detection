We have frequented this quaint little bar a few times now . . .never to be disappointed.  The service is friendly.   The meals are homemade.  The atmosphere is cozy and welcoming.  I can't believe how many people pass this place up to head a few doors down.  This is a gem and a do not miss.  Nightly specials . . Great burgers.
