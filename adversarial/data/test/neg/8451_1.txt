It would've been 5 stars,  but service was a little slow.  I had the Griddle Sampler which I thought was excellent.  I love the atmosphere.  The decor is really nice.  My partner had a classic two eggs breakfast and he enjoyed it.  Like I said,  if I didn't have to wait for a refill on my water it would've been a 5 star experience.  Especially because of the fact that it wasn't busy at all.
