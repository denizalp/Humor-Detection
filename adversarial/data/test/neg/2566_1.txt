Honestly I don't ever leave feedback on yelp, but this place is terrible and I feel like people should know before wasting their time.  \n\nA couple of weeks ago I saw them turn away a group that drove down from the suburbs just because they felt like closing an hour and a half early on a whim and did nothing to compensate the group.  They were perplexed.  I was perplexed.\n\nTonight I called to place an order for pick up and they put me on hold for 20 minutes, until I hung up and called back to get there machine.  They still haven't called me back lol.  Honestly, there's too many great places to get delicious food from in this city to give this place any business in my opinion.
