BMW speaks of professionalism and regard themselves so highly for being #1 in performance and customer satisfaction but Sam can't even be on time with his appointments or know where the location of his cars are. Frankly disappointed with the service. I've had better service at McDonalds. \nAllows his customers to wait more than 45 minutes, and then loses the location of where the car is to test drive, without even apologizing, is unacceptable.
