I have been going there awhile but after this last time probably will not. The gel nail polish that is guaranteed to stay on 21 days has come off after a week both this time and last time. I had my nails and toes done before vacation a week ago and it's all peeled off. It bubbled and then peeled off. Ridiculous.
