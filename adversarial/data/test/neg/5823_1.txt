Got the Egg Slut and the Fairfax. \n\nThe Egg Slut was basically an egg over potato puree, with three thin slices of baguette. Not flavorful and not filling. Not recommended.\n\nThe Fairfax was good - the eggs were very creamy and buttery, the brioche bun was decent if a tad dry.\n\nThey didn't have tap water available, for that you have to walk 30 feet to a nearby bar, which I thought was odd.
