In general, the Embassy Suites is a nice little joint to lay your head. \n\nBig rooms, free happy (2)hours with appetizers. I mean, you can't beat that. However, my stay at this particular location was sullied by two (minor) issues. \n\n1. We were guaranteed a check in time and weren't allowed to check in until 45min after that time. \n\n2. Got to the room and there was no door knob on the bedroom door...(which I find especially weird because someone obviously just checked out of that room) \n\nOther than that the experience was OK. Breakfast at the Embassy Suites if a pretty big deal apparently. Omelette's, Cereal bars, fruit bars, bread bars etc, etc. Yum. Although, let's work on getting a few more cooks in the omelet line and a few more table in the eating area. Then my bacon doesn't have to get cold while I wait for my omelet and families of four don't have to try to eat at a table with only three chairs, LOL.
