Called John this morning and he had Tyler come out to meet me at my house.  Chevy C10 had been sitting and Tyler got it running for me! Wasn't a simple and quick fix, but he got it fixed and was super sweet and professional! Do recommend and will call again if I need any car fixed. And yes you pay for a mobile mechanic to come to your house if your car won't drive to shop... so yes you have to pay a fee to get them here and then hourly like an other car mechanic place! Well worth it!
