Their fish tacos were a solid B+, meat was under seasoned but the avocado and tortillas were divine. The service was slow and standoffish, which as far as I'm concerned make it a great lunch hideaway on a busy day. Sit at the bar and contemplate the tile as you enjoy the chunky salsa and really good chips. Will return!
