I've eaten here many times over the years and always enjoy my meal.  This past Sunday I took my Mom out for lunch at Toast.  We have pleasant memories of eating here with my grandmother.  That was why we chose to eat here this time.  We ordered two meals and shared.  I had the California salad, which we both liked a lot.  There were many delicious toppings such as sweet strawberries, goat cheese, and walnuts.  The chicken on the salad was tasty as well.  I did have to pick out a few wilted, yucky looking greens, but that can happen.  Overall the greens were good.  My Mom ordered the turkey and Brie melt.  She didn't love it, but I did.  We both enjoyed the raspberry vinaigrette that comes with the salad.  We wanted to request some more to use as a dipping sauce for the sandwich, but a server didn't come back to us for a while.  We came during a not too busy time, around 2 on a Sunday.  All of the servers were polite.  I like that they offered drinks to go when we paid.  It's always nice to have another nice experience in an old local favorite.
