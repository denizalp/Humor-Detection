Yep, the reviews are for real. The place is outstanding. I had a pasta dish with salmon, and it was truly delicious. They make their own with a pasta machine they proudly display. I also came for lunch and kept it simple with a tuna Ni√ßoise salad. That was excellent as well. Even the iced tea, which I am pretty picky about, was fantastic. Valentina, the owner, is lovely, and her waitstaff is attentive and friendly. This is a can't miss hidden gem.
