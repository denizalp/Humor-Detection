I did not want to get all hyped up over the reviews about this place. All too often they will paint a picture in my head which just cannot live up to reality. This is something I am working on. I quickly perused the star ratings, and hurried out the door, excited for breakfast. My friend and I were politely greeted & seated. I saw the first item on the menu.. the \"Mornin Monte\" .. sold! I ordered it with my coffee, forcing my company to let go of his indecisiveness. He regretfully blurted out, \"Errrr.. Ughh.. Combo: eggs, hashbrowns, french toast, fruit bowl\" What a pussy! So that was it.. Seated, orders in, coffee cooling.. all within 3 minutes after parking. \n\nSo we sat. We listened to a group of elderly women discussing their kidney problems, admired the hickey just below our waitress' right ear. We smiled at a baby going crazy on a bowl of fruit with strawberries in it, and cringed over the girls next to us complaining about their struggles at the office. Actually, it was one girl griping, and the other sporadically inserting \"yeah\" here and there. (I thought: bitch, its Saturday.. chill out!) \n\nWe sat some more. Patiently. For about 45 minutes! The Golden Girls had gone.. leaving us with the 2 unhappy hipster chicks.. \n\nFinally! Our food!! The wait was ridiculous, so in order to get me back in there.. this Monte had to hit the spot. It didn't. Not even close. It's a french toast sandwich with egg white, turkey breast, turkey bacon, havarti, and some spicy marmalade. Honestly, minus the marmalade.. this thing was bland as fuck. The french toast egg mixture could use sprucing up. Maybe throw some fresh herbs into the egg white too? I dunno. It wasn't impressive in my opinion at all. Daniel's eggs and hashbrowns were eggs and hashbrowns. He agreed the french toast was wack... and those strawberries the little girl was macking on.. the ones that made him say, \"Fruit Bowl!\".. ya, those were nowhere to be found. In fact, there were only grapes in there. Weird right? \n\nService was great. The big guy who took my money at the end was very cool. I just don't like waiting 45-50 minutes for ho hum food.. Sorry Yoli's, you were a disappointment.
