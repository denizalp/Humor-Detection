for the most part this is a basic hotel.  a souped-up motor inn with not much frills but definitely has all the basics covered.  i travel and stay here on business so i don't know the area that well so I don't know why exactly but this place is always sold out every time I come here but maybe it's the location.  not a five-star hotel.  just a room with the basics covered: clean, amenities, ironing board for when your dress shirts get all wrinkled in the luggage, etc, etc. \n\npushing it into the 4 star range though was the waffles.  :) I didn't expect waffles with my continental breakfast.  don't get too excited. just cereal, orange juice, coffee and muffins (plus the waffles) which is better than the usual continental.\n\nthe place isn't hard to find but there's a weird intersection which makes it hard to turn into.  obviously that doesn't stop the tourists though as it's regularly sold out.  also convenient is the mall across the street and the mimi's (for a more complete meal) down the road.\n\npretty decent place to stay especially for business if you happen to have meetings in the neighborhood.
