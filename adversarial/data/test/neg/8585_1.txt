I can say that being involved in a car accident isn't a fun process.  I'm definitely grateful that I chose benson and bingham to assist me throw the process ! Heather and Cassidy where so helpful throw this scary time in my life . Every question or concerned I had was answered . Definitely one of the best choices I made . Can't say I will be back just because I'm hoping not to find my self in this situation again . But I will definitely refer my friends and family! Thank u
