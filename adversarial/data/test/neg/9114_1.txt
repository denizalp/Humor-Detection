Great place!! I'm a truck driver so I was doing home time in Vegas. Barbers are very cool people. The place got music and tv. Please so yourself a favor call for an appoint first. So u don't have to wait. But the wait time was 1 hr. Not to bad. I invite all truckers to come over. There's no trailer truck parking here but you can bobtail into any of this small a streets and park. I will be coming over for a haircut when I get home time again.
