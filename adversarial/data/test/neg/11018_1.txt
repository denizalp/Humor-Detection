This was my second visit..  Wasn't super impressed the first time but that was early after the opened so decided to give it another try.  Unfortunately I'm still not real impressed.   We ordered a variety of dishes with our party of 5.  \n\nThe positives: the portions were huge; the calzone was huge and the kids loved it; the Alfredo was good but nothing to write home about; the steak was huge and cooked as ordered\n\nThe negative: the bread that came the dipping oil was dry; the lobster ravioli was mushy and bland; the service was slow (but I'll give him the benefit of the doubt because he was new).   \n\nOverall it was a mediocre meal.  Not sure I'll be giving them a 3rd try.
