We have been coming to Sneakers for as long as we can remember. Many owners have come and gone and the food has been up and down over the years. We have been twice in the past couple of weeks and are so pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food. It is excellent. What a turn around now that the new owners have come on board. The french onion soup is to die for and the wings(now marinated by the way) are better then ever. The \"chef\" is superior and i would recommend you try the new and improved Steak Bomb.  Apparrently they are working on a new menu which may include desserts.  The new staff is awesome and they take interest in your thoughts and they make sure you are enjoying your meal. Most people are still going only for the wings and beer to be safe.....but you need to try the other options. You will be so pleasantly surprised
