Saw the George Wallace comedy show in Las Vegas some time ago.  I do recall it being pretty funny.  Shannon F. nailed it on the head when he referred to George Wallace as \"old school\".  He cracked a lot of \"Yo Mama\" type jokes, talked about politics and what it would be like if he were president, etc....scary.  LOL.  We got free tickets, but he was worth it even for paid tickets (low cost of course).
