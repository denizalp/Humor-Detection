Small place with a cute personality given its barren surroundings on this strip mall location.  The staff \/ owner was very inviting and answered all our questions about this Asian fusion place.  And when I saw Asian fusion, I mean Asian with OTHER southeast Asian cuisines...not Western foods.  It's good.  Definitely a place for lunch when you happen to be in the area!
