Good authentic Japanese food actually made and served by Japanese chef; I just made the mistake of coming here for lunch on a Friday... The place was absolutely packed, and the wait staff was literally running to get their customers served. My lunch came but without my salad, soup, or even a cup of water. However, my waitress quickly noticed and provided the rest of my lunch with some apologies. So, aside from a small mishap, the lunch was filling. I had the sushi lunch combo, and the fish tasted fresh, though I was a bit taken aback by the size of it... Not that I'm complaining, but the sushi I had in Japan were smaller and more, for a lack of a better word, delicate. Perhaps they tweaked it a little to suit the North American taste\/perception? In short, I definitely recommend this place for some good food, but just don't come during peak times!
