I have banked with USAA for over seven years.  They are hands down better than any local bank.  They treat us like family.  We apply for all of our loans on our phone and have an approval fairly quickly.  We have been car shopping on a Saturday and completed a loan application online and had the money FedEx'd to the dealership so we never had to hassle with wheeling and dealing with the dealership.  We don't have their insurance, so I cannot vouch for that, but all other services are great. I believe this location is just a satellite office that offers very little service.  But why even go there?  You can do almost everything online - to deposit a large check you can go to a UPS shipping store to make the deposit.  I take photos of my personal checks and deposit via mobile.  I can take money out at CVS - I cannot deposit cash, but I do not find the need to do that; it spends just as easily as whipping out my debit card.
