this review is based on stopping by for dessert beignets to take to my room. I've had them before here\ngreeted by two friendly faces and directed to the bar to place our order. The bartender was busy watching tv and grudgingly took our order. The beignets were s'more flavored and I asked if I could have the traditional non flavored which they did. \nReceived 5 beignets, good but a couple of them were raw inside I think because of the size, they were larger. 3 sauces were good\nMight be my last beignet order here
