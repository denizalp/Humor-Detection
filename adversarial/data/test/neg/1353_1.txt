Okay, I've come full circle with this salon and all in all the service is not terrible but adequate given the prices. I would not recommend having any freshman cut you're hair due to a couple of my girlfriends and I noticing that the younger girls are a bit shaky and nervous (you can def see it on their faces). I planned on getting a v cut with bangs and choppy yet long layers as well as a frame for my face. You see I have a very complicated and exact way I'd like my hair. I'm sure any woman would agree your hair is life! But when I had the misfortune of a problematic hair cut my first visit to Paul Mitchell the girl totally cut my hair an inch shorter than needed! It was extremely obvious she did not pay attention to what I was asking and as a side note? She was more interested in her lunch break and another student's hair than what I was asking her. I rate Paul Mitchell a 3 out of 5. Although I did like the back cut, I did not enjoy these past few weeks of having to braid or tie my bangs up due to their stylists lack of attention span. I recommend at least an appointment so that there is a minimal to no wait & if you do get a first year freshman please be impeccably descriptive! These girls have a tuff time in visioning what you want.
