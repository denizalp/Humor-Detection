I personally think this is the best Korean restarunt in town right now.  The place is clean, resonably priced, good quality, and most importantly, the food tastes authentic. One thing I wish they would do is give a wide variety of side dishes (maybe 10-12?) instead of the 5-6 side dishes you get now (usually kimchi, beans, potato salad, and some vegetables).  I recommend a lot of dishes from this place but the last dish I had and loved was the seafood pancake aka haemul pajun. It is a must try!
