I was excited to take my fianc√© here upon moving back to cleveland from nyc. he's from nyc and when living there we would go for tacos at least once a week. while nyc pales in comparison to LA when it comes to tacos, they're still pretty amazing. \n\ni'll start by saying i definitely had one of the best margaritas of my life at barrio... frozen pomegranate. super delicious. as for the tacos, there is absolutely nothing mexican about them. they are what olive garden is to italian food. i like the idea of essentially building your own taco and i tried to make mine as close as to what i would normally get in nyc (carnitas with onion and cilantro) but at the end of the day, building your own tacos really are no where near as good as having a great recipe for some staple tacos. one gigantic let down is the soft shell being flour... reminds me of when my mom made tacos from the Ortega taco growing up... and while i loved it then, it's just not good for a real taco. it's doughy and overwhelming. the taco shell should be the last thing you notice in your taco and basically just a vehicle for the insides. a smaller double up corn tortilla would be so much better. i hate when people complain about portions of food being too large but these tacos are too big, mainly because of the flour tortillas. if the tacos were smaller you could try a lot more combinations. \n\ni wouldn't hurry back, especially since the service wasn't very good for a tuesday night and being one of two other tables.
