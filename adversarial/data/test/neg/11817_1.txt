Well I finally convinced my bf to come here and I'm not sure why it has so many good reviews. Yes it's cozy and homey...if you live in a shack.  Seemed not very clean. We sat down and it took ten min for the waitress to offer coffee, which she poured and promptly walked away leaving us with no milk or sugar. Coffee got cold before we could get her attention again. Ordered our meals - my over medium eggs were WAY too runny. His omelette was tiny. The staff seemed generally disorganized and confused. We won't be back which is too bad since it's in a convenient spot.
