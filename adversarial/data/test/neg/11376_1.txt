We attended an evening event with Marshmello on 8\/12--absolutely hands down one of the funniest, nuttiest, wild nights.  6 of us on a Lily Pad up front having a blast.  While it was an expensive evening--it was worth it.  I'm not sure that we'll look to replicate it soon--but would definitely do it again in a year or so.  Fantastic energy and an incredible wait staff and security team took great care of us.  A big shout out to them for their great work.\n\nWe've been to the Beach Club in the daytime--which is fun.  But it's double the fun at night--just a different vibe on a roll throughout the venue.\n\nJust plan on spending some serious change!
