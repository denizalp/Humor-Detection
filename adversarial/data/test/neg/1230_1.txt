Went here for the first time today, when I told Sam I had never been there before, he gave me a free beer and then showed me around the back. I'm not too familiar with beer prices in Pittsburgh, but he seems to be a few dollars cheaper than the place on North Federal St. Sam offers to order anything he doesn't have on hand, but seems to have a decent selection readily available. Limited hours, most weekdays open 2-6 so call ahead if unsure of hours.
