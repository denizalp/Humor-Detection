Love love love this place!!! So much fun. \nThey should have an ATM machine in the store it is a bit messy in the back area not all of the machines are on or  functional. It's off the strip, and all ages for the people that are into that. I usually come here with friends, and make it an easy social thing where there is no drinking involved. You do run into the problem of losing your coins to certain machines, it's not really a big deal. I do think it would be cool if the machines had the year they were designed on because some they do have some really awesome machines that are super old. It is a pretty popular place but it's not as crazy as to having to wait for a certain machine. \nThe claw machines are awesome (some of them!) Newer machines are between 50¢-$1.00. \nYou can find some of the older machines being 25¢
