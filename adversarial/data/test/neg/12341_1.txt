The ONLY reason this buffet gets 4 stars is because I cannot eat cold crab legs.  Other than that, I've been to Bellagio 5 times in the past 3 years while on vacation.  It is pricey if you go during the weekends when they serve their \"gourmet\" dinner.  \n\nI liked their dinner selection because it was very impressive and the selection is great.  The food is fresh and clean.\n\nWhat I liked best was their lunch selection.  It was only $20, but yet you get almost the same selection of food that you would during dinner.  I was so stuffed from eating lunch that I passed on even dinner.  The dessert selection was awesome.\n\nI've been to Mandalay Bay, Wynn, and I'd have to say this is the best as far as overall selection.  If you are specifically a crab legs eater, then you will get bang for your buck at Mandalay Bay.
