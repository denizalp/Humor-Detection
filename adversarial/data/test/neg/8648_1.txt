I thought the whole \"Public School\" theme was dope. It's a nice, chill restaurant. Their lunch specials are actually GOOD  and extensive. The fish and chips and Parmesan truffle fries were bomb, and I thought it was dope there were games to enjoy outside while you drink and conversate. Our server was friendly and helpful.
