We pleasantly surprised with this new(er) neighborhood find,  had spring rolls, pho, and, plantains, the spring rolls alone were enough to fill me up.  I've had plantains before but the included dipping sauce put them at the next level.  Glad to have found a new option and to support local restaurants.
