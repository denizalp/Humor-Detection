We went in for quick lunch during expo thinking the wait won't be too long as most dishes were Chinese food. \nDim-Sum we had order came out right away which was good (but bit pricey for the amount of food came out) but the noodle dishes we had order took another 30 minutes before it came out which I didn't understand why it took so long, especially when the restaurant was nearly half empty. \n\nI had ordered Singapore mei-fei which was salty and all noodles were broken as it was over-cooked. My co-worker ordered Vietnamese noodle soup which was good but the side condiments which needs to go into the soup came out 5 minutes AFTER the we had started eating. No point of having them at all. Chicken noodle soup was the worst of all. Soup was bland and not very tasteful, noodles were extremely over-cooked that it was mushy. It seem like it was made awhile ago. Co-worker took 3 bites and couldn't eat anymore. Both noodle soups were just warm, not good when you were expecting nice hot soup.\n\nPrice was OK considering Vegas and its location but I had so much better food at much lower price. I don't think I'll be coming back here.
