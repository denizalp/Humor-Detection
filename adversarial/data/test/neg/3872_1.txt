I was the first customer at this restaurant and on the first day the food was OK. However, my love for Indo Chinese food brought me back to this place again. My friends and I thoroughly enjoyed all the appetizers. In the main course; however, all the different curries ultimately had the same taste. You couldn't tell the difference between Szechwan sauces versus the Manchurian vs the garlic. I'm attaching all the pictures with this message. The lettuce with the Paneer tacos was old and turning yellow-ish. The desserts were really good. I highly recommend the chocolate spring rolls and the chocolate mousse cake !! I would come back and recommend this place but the service needs to get better. It is slow maybe due to still hiring process in this new restaurant.
