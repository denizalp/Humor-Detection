We stopped in at 10:30pm after attending the Knights game for a late night snack.\n\nOrdered a few appetizers, including the ribs.  Food arrived quickly and was quite good.  Portions contained enough food for the price.  Problem was the waitress, Krystal.  \n\nShe delivered our food and since I ordered ribs, I asked for an extra napkin.  She said \"no problem\" and left, only to stop a short distance away to speak with two other employees for about two mins.  She then disappeared into the kitchen and after five minutes I decided to just get up and wash my hands in the bathroom.  \n\nAs we were eating she walked past us two times, never once asking if we needed anything.  Once done we waited over 10 mins for her to come by, and when she did she passed us by for another table.  Had to flag her down to ask for the check.  She returned with the check, and again stopped to talk to employees.  Waited again to pay.  Very frustrating, left no tip.
