Gorgeous fun and full of energy, The Venetian was worth every penny I spent there. The pool deck is bigger than anyone could imagine and just breathtaking. I could spend hours writing this so I'm gonna stop, because a) I don't want to spend hours writing this, b) I don't have hours to write this, and c) other reasons too private and time consuming to list here.  I'm going back in a few months. I won't stay anywhere else. There's no need to. The Venetian has it all.
