Yoli's Cafe is quite charming, I really love the ambiance of the surrounding square even though it is not in the best of places. I really wanted to give Yoli a 4 star and they deserve a 3.5 really. I've had only breakfast here and I had about 5 different items to really try and get that 4th star for them in my mind, but I just could not find that dish that really scream 4 or 5 star. They do things well and they try to be creative but are off the mark a little. The best is likely their French Toast with hawaiian bread is well done, but the syrup is just tad low in quality. The breakfast burrito, I was not much of a fan, seems generic nothing that stood out. The skillet is enormous and filled with great different items but the biscuit was not really a biscuit but more of a roll than a biscuit. The omelete was also decent, but a little too much cheese. Don't get me wrong, I like Yolis and I would not hesitate to recommend it to people I know but I can not say that the food is 4 star. It is what it is which is a nice little cafe with decent food.
