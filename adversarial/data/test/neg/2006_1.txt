I'm in love with the margaritas from this place!  I'm working the jewelry convention all week and have eaten here twice already.  Really good happy hour specials and amazing small plates amazing appetizers  .  I'm coming back with my girlfriends Friday and Saturday night. Locals discount is good too!
