This is our favorite place for Tom Yum soup and sushi makis.  Not too many choices of raw fish which were disappointing, as they mainly have tuna and salmon.  The sushi chef make up for it up in his creative maki selections: soft crab maki, rainbow and other ones which I don't know the names.  Great portions, friendly and attentive staff, good prices.  RECOMMEND!!
