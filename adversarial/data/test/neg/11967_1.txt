Really, really, really good food. Just delicious. The staff is attentive, friendly, skilled, everything you'd want. The ambiance was cozy and wonderful. This was our favorite part of the trip. A great restaurant sets up a really romantic date and if you love quality Indian food you will just love this place. Recommend it to anyone and everyone, worth every penny.
