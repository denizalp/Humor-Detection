We had hot and sour soup, the Szechuan beef noodle soup and the bbq duck & pork with rice.\n\nTypically I hate hot and sour for being too tangy but the soup here even I would eat. The beef noodle soup was hot and salty with chewy noodles. Everything about it was amazing except for the beef.. kindof chewy. The bbq duck & pork was yum as well, it came with steamed bok choy on the side.\n\nOpen late for your late night soup noodle cravings! Mm.....
