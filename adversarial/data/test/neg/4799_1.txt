This place is gross. There is nothing fresh about this Mexican grill. The corn tortillas were of the crispy pre-folded taco shell variety only, all of the salsa looked and tasted like it came out of a Sysco can, and the lettuce had that spinachy taste that lettuce tends to get about two days after you're supposed to throw it away. \n\nYou'll get an infinitely better meal if you go to the Chili's across the parking lot, which is really kind of sad.
