I had seen the emails stating there were changes to the local Sweet Tomatoes, yet I was surprised when we pulled into the parking lot at dinner time and saw no cars.\n\nThe food tasted good, but if you are a fan of Sweet Tomatoes, you will be disappointed to see many favorites gone. No more blueberry muffins, minimal choices on soups, no chili unless you buy it ala cart. My children were disappointed to see no more brownies and pizza, and no toppings for their frozen yogurt.\n\nThey had very little signage on ingredients. As a vegetarian, I found it very difficult to determine beyond the vegetables what was vegetarian or not. They had some pasta and cous cous salads but it was tough to determine the ingredients. They no longer had the potato bar and the vegan margarine. They did have some additional ingredients in the salad bar (or at least that I may have not noticed before), mixed bell peppers, some seeds (chia seeds?), and dehydrated cranberries. \n\nThe shopping ala cart is just not a good experience.  If I had gone to this restaurant not expecting Sweet Tomatoes perhaps it would warrant more stars. Unfortunately, by branding it as a Sweet Tomatoes Field Kitchen you go in expecting a Sweet Tomatoes experience. You do not get it here. \n\nWe were not told of the $50 fee for losing the card, as other reviewers mentioned. They gave us a card for each person in our group so I don't know how they would even know if we lost a card when we went to check out. \n\nWould I go back? If someone else wanted to go, I'd go with them and I'd eat and be content. But, I don't see myself being a regular any more, nor would I expect to go with my kids. As others have stated, this was a kid-requested place for birthday dinners and family nights out. It was a great place that had something for everyone.  \n\nI hope that Sweet Tomatoes does not convert its other Phoenix restaurants to this \"concept,\" though our next closest Sweet Tomatoes is now about 50 minutes away. Bye bye Sweet Tomatoes. You will be missed. :-(
