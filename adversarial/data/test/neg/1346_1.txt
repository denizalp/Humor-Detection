I had posted a review before and it was not flattering. After about 2 years the wife and I decided to give this place another try. Glad we did. It was much better than our last failed visit. We even went back 2 more times. The food has been 'good for this area'. Its bar food but then this is a bar so that should not be a surprise. Still have not tried the pizza here. Maybe next time. Service is great but then we seem to come at off times so it's not been very busy while we were there. This place is worth checking out in my opinion.
