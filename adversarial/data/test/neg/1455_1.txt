4 of my kids have been going to Adelson educational campus for the past 6 years.  This year I'm sending my 5th child. I couldn't ask for a better school for them. I have 2 kids in upper school,  2 kids in middle and now my little one will go to Kindergarten there.   I'm impressed with their education level and their curriculum. I would recommend this school to everyone.  It's not just a school it's your family.
