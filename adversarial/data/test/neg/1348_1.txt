After our first visit we've been recognized and greeted by name. We are always catered to. We've received such great service and we're treated like part of the family. Albert and his dad Allen go out of their way to ensure our visit is exactly what we wanted. I love trying new dishes and I haven't had anything I didn't like. I recommend the tum yum seafood soup! You can't go wrong with Pepper Cafe, the prices are low and the quality is great!
