Where is Liz? Where is Marisa? This place used to be a way cool place with great service.  Seems to have gone downhill since they changed staff.  Always overpriced but was worth it when you \"had\" cool (and hot) girls giving you great service and actually being knowledgable on their products. The owner\/manager doesn't seem to be so bright.  My recommendation would be to go to hippy gypsy down the street.
