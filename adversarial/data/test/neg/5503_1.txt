After quite a bit of searching for a place that offered drop-off wash-and-fold service in Calgary, I found this place. I was in town only briefly and, with limited time, did not want to spend my day doing laundry at the coin-operated machines (or pay extortionist rates at the hotel). I called this place, but there was  no answer, so I just drove by. Walking in, I found a very harried lady behind the counter surrounded by piles of laundry. At first she told me that she was too overloaded for same-day service, but after a while, took pity on me, as I was leaving Calgary in the morning. She ended up charging me $1.50 per pound and had my clothes ready, folded, and waiting within about 3 hours. The clothes were ready to put into the suitcase and my day was freed up! If you need laundry service, I highly recommend this business. If you can, it is probably a good idea to plan a day in advance, as the lady did seem very busy. Also, don't be discouraged if nobody answers the phone; just go by anyway and talk to the lady behind the counter in the back.
