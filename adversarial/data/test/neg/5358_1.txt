For brick style pizza, there are better tastier places that put more toppings. This is the worst pizza if you care about taste and temperature. Will prob go out of business in a year or two. Your better off getting pizza from Paris hotel where its hot and tasty and busy. Or in the front of planet hollywood where pizza is better than here and customer service much better. This pizza place is as dull and slow like mid day. Never bringing or recommending to anyone. My son after a bite said, this pizza sucks! About 15 bucks a personal pan, not even worth it. Targets personal pan pizza hut way better
