I never write reviews, so when I do it's either absolutely amazing or horrible. This place is absolutely amazing! Happy hour drinks are great-- not to mention the food! Our bartender was extremely attentive and so sweet! Totally made our night. Coming from out of town, it's always a trouble finding places you re comfortable at-- but Trish made sure this place feels like a second home by the way she and her staff treat you.
