I had the street noodles and corn fritters, and both were good enough to write a review. This seems to be a relatively new place and their servers and owner give me the impression they are trying hard to succeed. Very pleasant staff and have live music on Fridays. I would recommend checking this place out if you're in the area and looking for some good Thai.
