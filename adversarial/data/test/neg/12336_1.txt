Great place. My family loves them...they probably don't love my unruly family. Absolutely the best fried fish dinner to talk about how much you love it, order the all you can eat portion then eat a tiny bit because, it turns out, you've eaten all kinds of junk food right before we went. It's also the perfect place ask to come as a reward, get two orders of grape leaves, eat them as fast as you can and then complain about being bored while your parents TRY to enjoy their meals.\n\nDon't worry...as much as we love the place, we don't go very often.
