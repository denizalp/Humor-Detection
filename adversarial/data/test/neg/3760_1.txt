Very satisfying.  The food is terrific, the service ... well, not really all that memorable, which is usually a good thing.  Lots of great non-alcoholic beverage options, thanks to the full bar with great mixers like sour cherry juice.   I was their first customer for lunch, and my lunch was ready almost instantly.
