Friendly staff and fantastic food! The Dundas St roll is a must and a favorite of mine. I always order one to go after a dine in. The Chirashi dish has pieces of sashimi (of choice)with vegetables and you mix rice and special hot sauce into it. Another must eat, it's healthy as well! So tasty yumm! The double dragon roll and black dragon roll are also amazing.
