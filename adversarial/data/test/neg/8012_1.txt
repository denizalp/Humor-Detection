The Care we received in the Vet Clinic was exceptional.  I was told over the phone my appointment was this morning but when I arrived they had us down for tomorrow.  I was coming in for a delicate issue.  The entire staff front desk, vet tech and vet went out of their way to help us out.  Great customer service and empathy.
