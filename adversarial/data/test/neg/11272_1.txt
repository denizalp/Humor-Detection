I was torn between 2 and 3 stars and decided to be as fair as I could and settled on a 3. A 2.5 would probably nail it. \n\nI've now visited Pi 3 times, all using groupons. I've tried both the caprese and della casa salads, as well as the sausage, pepperoni, and margarita pies. One calzone as well, but I can't recall which one since it's been so long. \n\nAs others have mentioned, over the course of time the pizzas have gotten smaller and the price either the same or higher. Also, despite the thin crust I prefer, they still somehow manage to come out soggy to the point of dripping all over the place when you attempt to fold a piece to put in your mouth. Again, when they first opened this wasn't my experience. Something has changed over time. \n\nMy other large gripe with the pies is the odd way they put on toppings. One, they don't give you all that many, especially so considering the price. A few of the photos right here on Yelp can attest what I'm speaking of here. Two, in all my experiences, they were all concentrated in one area so you only get to taste them on a couple of bites of the entire pizza. Spread them out evenly please. At least try. \n\nOn the pro side, both salads were of good size and very well done and tasty, probably the strong point of the place. And while I don't recall which calzone I had, I do recall being more pleased with it than the pizza. \n\nService has always been friendly and attentive. I like the atmosphere as well, though I have only gone during lunch hours. I probably wouldn't say the same if I went at night, but I avoid the Southside at night in general for this very reason. \n\nPlace has potential, and I may give it another try in the future to see if they clean up few things up as I'm not a fan if thick crust pizzas so prevalent here in Pittsburgh. Otherwise I might stop in for a salad or two. But for now, it's a bit underwhelming and overpriced overall.
