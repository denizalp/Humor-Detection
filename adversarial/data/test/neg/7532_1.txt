If you have a lot of time on your hands, I would recommend you coming here. My Fiancee and I waited exactly 57 minutes for our food, from the time we placed our order. \nThere was 0 apology, and the food, which was \"meh\" came out room temperature. \nMy waitress was O.K., but I felt as if I was asking her a favor to wait on us. \nI did get a latte, on my morning there, and it to my surprise was not bad. There was 0 bitterness, and I honestly enjoyed it very much, however, my Fiancee and I agreed we would not come back to this Cafe.
