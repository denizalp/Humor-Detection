I came to visit this place as I am a big fan of Bubble and non-Bubble tea, which can both be ordered here.  When I first walked in I was immediately impressed by the ambiance, and as I got to the counter, the warm, welcoming greetings from the employees intensified my impression.  The waitress that assisted me was very friendly, and knowledgeable of the menu items offered.  It was recommended that I try the Taro Bubble tea, as I have not had it before. I ordered the Taro Bubble tea, calamari, and edamame, which all were very delicious!  In addition to the ambiance, great menu, and friendly staff, board games are also available for you to enjoy, along with plush couch seating.  If you are interested in a nice, laid-back outing to enjoy, please give this place a try!  \n\nNOTE: Do not coming looking for meals, as only finger foods and some tasty looking desserts are available for consumption.
