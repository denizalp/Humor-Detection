Very good spot for Happy Hour drinks with coworkers. Easy location on the 215 and solid prices from 5-7 pm. I've also been to a couple of larger parties there and they always do a very nice job. For the Las Vegas locals, this is basically a nicer version of PTs. Great at what they do, but not really a destination spot. This is the place everyone agrees on. Beer is cold!
