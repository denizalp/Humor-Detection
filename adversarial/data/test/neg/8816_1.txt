We came here about 3 weeks ago and had Dim Sum.  My family recommended this place to have lunch.  Being chinese and a frequent explorer, I have had my fair share of dim sum.  This place was actually pretty decent.  I enjoyed some of the items here. Some more than others.  I wasn't expecting much since we were in Vegas, but this place did a great job.  Service was great as well.  I must say they make an awesome gai mei bao. The only thing is this place was pretty pricy.  In Los Angeles, you can get some great dim sum for $1 an item!
