What I ordered: venti iced dirty chai, light ice, soy milk, bacon and Gouda sandwich no egg.\n\nWhat I got: venti dirty chai with what seems like whole milk, not light ice, and a sandwich with egg on it.\n\nI get my drink regularly from various valley locations, including this one, and it's usually very consistent. \n\nI guess I just expect my order to be correct when I wait in line for 10 minutes, and pay over $10 for breakfast that I can easily purchase elsewhere en route to work.
