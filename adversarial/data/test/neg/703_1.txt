We are here it is 12:30 and the restaurant is not busy. Sitting in the bar area. Marla our server is horrible. Hasn't come to check on us. My daughter needs a refill and the server is no where to be found. Portions are tiny for the price you pay. I didn't leave a tip. She is just awful. Will never come back.
