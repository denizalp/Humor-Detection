I'm a huge fan of Indian Hakka food.\n\nThis place doesn't disappoint. The food is on par with popular places like Federick and Lin Garden. But without the lineup.\n\nThe food is priced affordably, quality ingredients and flavored just the way I like it and always comes out piping hot.\n\nThe only thing disappointing is the old decor and tired looking furniture. Not a first date kind of place.
