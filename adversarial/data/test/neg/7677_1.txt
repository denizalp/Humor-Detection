Switched from Chase. They offer online appointments to speak directly to a banker. Walked in BOOM done. Chase? They do have multiple tellers and bankers BUT customer service? Nah, my wife stood inside the bank and was not greeted\/acknowledge for a good 10 minutes and she was the only one there. The only teller was on his phone not even paying attention. She asked to speak to a banker was told she needed an appointment. We have tried multiple times setting the appointment. Like calling and walk ins. Was turned away 5 times!!! We eventually closed our accounts with them.
