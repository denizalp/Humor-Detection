I have owned SUV's for the past 23 years so I have always had pigment tint from the factory on my vehicles.  I recently bought a new mid size sedan which had no factory tint.  Needless to say, I was not used to feeling out in the open as I drove so I started my research on after market tints and companies that do this work.  I spoke to the dealer and did my own on line research. I chose Tint Pros mainly because of the reviews I saw online. When I got there, the owner Z, walked me through everything from how he applies the film to tint level options to UV exposure. He is very professional and comes off as very honest.  He never quoted me or pushed for the higher level tints 3M offers but when I asked about them he was glad to share his insight.  I ended up choosing the middle of the road option which was pricier than the standard Tint Pro quotes.  So I left the car and came back later that day. It looked much better than I thought it would as I was still unsure about a film on my windows instead of the pigmented factory windows.  I was so pleasantly surprised! Car was clean and windows looked great.  If I sour on the process it won't be because of the work Z did - it would likely be because of the product. That is saying quite a lot.
