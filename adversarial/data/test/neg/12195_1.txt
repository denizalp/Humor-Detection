AZ Native Scapes recently completed the sprucing up of our backyard and we couldn't be more pleased.  Our house was built in 1993 and we already had several mature trees and plants we wanted to keep.  Craig was so helpful in developing a plan to incorporate the plants and yet really make  our backyard much more of a restful oasis.  We got the beautiful paver extended patio and paver side walkway we wanted plus a number of beautiful new plants to fill in the area where we removed a lot of grass.  We no longer wanted the upkeep of real grass and so during the installation process were still able to contact Craig and change to artificial.  CRaig and his crew were so professional and considerate.  He even had his crew replace our heads on our drip lines to the old plants as well as install new dripline for new plants.  He came back then following week to check on everything.  We would recommend him to anyone looking for a landscaping project.
