Really, really good. Had not known what to expect as we hadn't been there before. We stopped on the way home after a weekend out of town. Not too much seating, which was fine for us as we were getting take-out. \n\nMy husband had the chicken and I had the ribs. His was a bit dry, but the ribs were fall of the bone delicious! We will definitely be back again, and will likely order way too much just so we have leftovers!
