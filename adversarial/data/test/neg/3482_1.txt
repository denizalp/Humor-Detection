As far as I'm concerned places like this (smitty's, Denny's, Phil's) are for the day after a big party where people have been drinking all night or the drive back from camping. The menu items are priced extremely cheap to match the food that you are about to get. Nothing they bring is more complicated than a meal any home economics class would teach in first year high school. The service isn't great most of the time because the servers are overworked and underpaid.
