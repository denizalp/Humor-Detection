I have spent many, many drunken nights here. I love the outdoor seating. It's usually the only place I favor the outdoors over the indoors. The inside tends to be a little too loud for my tastes. I like having conversation while drinking and usually I can barely hear anyone inside. I love going here in the summer or during winter break when there are less frat guys. I generally don't like the crowd when school is in. \n\nOf course the only reason to go here is progressive night. If you're looking for anything other than to get drunk quickly and cheaply then this place probably isn't for you. The rails are ok, but obviously not the best. I've found the Red Bull and vodka, pineapple juice and vodka, and screw drivers (in that order) to be the best. \n\nAs far as the food (fries, cheese curds, etc.) goes I've never gotten any except when I was incredibly drunk. Drunk me liked it a lot. Drunk me also thinks Denny's tastes really good. So take that however you want.\n\nHonorable mention to the staff who put up with the drunk people. They're usually nice despite the customer base. I've only ever had one bad bartender and I don't think she works there any more.
