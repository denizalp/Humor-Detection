One of my favorite sushi spots in phx (second to sakana). they use purple rice for their rolls, that alone is awesome. The fish is fresh. Fresher that other establishments with higher prices. There are grab and go rolls that are fresh, but if it is not busy you might as well order made to order rolls. I actually picked rolls that other yelpers suggested and raved about and i was totally satisfied! Oh yea, price point is on point. :)
