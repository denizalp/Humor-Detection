Would not recommend, customer service is huge in my eyes and this place was disappointing.\n\nPoor customer service, the cashier was awful and wouldn't make eye contact, did not hand me my receipt so I had to grab it off the register myself and did not want to help me decide what to order. I ended up ordering the house lo mein and paid 10 bucks for a tiny box of noodles that ended up being extremely dry. This was my first time here and will definitely be my last.
