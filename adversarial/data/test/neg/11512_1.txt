I had to give Barroso all stars because I have no complaints and  left there feeling completely spoiled! 6 of us popped in on a Sunday evening to have dinner and as it was a very snowy evening were not surprised to see that it was fairly empty. Lucky for us, because we were hungry. The lovely decor and dim ambience were both inviting and surprising, and we couldn't wait to sink our teeth in. The service was outstanding. Although we were some of the only patrons, the water glasses were constantly filled and the staff was attentive and very sweet. The salad, main courses, amazing frites, and pitcher of sangria were all to die for and I will definitely be back. Just another gem in Montreal that would be a shame to pass by.
