I probably wouldn't go back here. You are seated by a hostess and you are free to get your own beverages and go get food at the Buffett. Your buser will disappear and you'll have plates piled at your table.  \nWe got here just before the lunch cut off and stayed for the crab legs and other dinner goodies. Most things tasted over salted and looked quite old.
