Always great & efficient service at this location! I know that Chipotle is a typical franchise restaurant, but I really like the quality of the food here.\nTasty, Fresh and can be made healthy. The locations I have been to in Charlotte have very friendly and efficient service. I'm a fan of the Burrito Bowl. That way you can really mix the ingredients into a perfect bite every time!
