Very small but very cozy spot. They only take cash or Canada credit, with me being from the states, just had to run next door to use the atm. Prices are reasonable. They have a bloody mimosassssssssss! I know! Crazy! The service was amazing. I got an original breakfast with eggs. Delish! I also got Animal Style Homefries! One of THE BEST things I have ever had. Would love to eat agin. Overall id go back for drinks and food!
