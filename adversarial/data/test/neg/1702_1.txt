This place is amazing. The vibe is cool with music blasting, writing on the walls and friendly staff. \n\nWhile the wait was longer than I anticipated (15+ minutes) it was well worth it. I ordered the Angry Steve and it did not disappoint. It was a hearty breakfast sandwich. My boyfriend ordered Ya Boi which is similar to the Crunch and Munch at Bagel and Deli at Miami University in Oxford, OH. He gave it a 5 star rating.\n\nI will definitely be back. I plan to print off a menu and cross off the ones I've tried. There are so many it's hard to choose!
