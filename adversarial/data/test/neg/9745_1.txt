My husband and I came for the Sunday brunch and it was so worth it.  The pressed coffee is so great!  I had the special which was a frittata and stone ground grits and my husband had the arugula,  poached eggs and pork.  Then we were too early for a Bloody Mary so we tried the cinnamon rolls.  Um wow! Service was fantastic.  Parking can be scary but we will definitely be back.
