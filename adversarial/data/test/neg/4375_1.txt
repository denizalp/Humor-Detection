Meh. Wasn't my favorite. The salad was weak for $10. The service was good once we finally got greeted. Not a terrible experience but also not the best. My friends wrap was pretty lame for the price too. I could've made better food at home for cheaper. Probably won't be returning anytime soon. The food lacks flavor and isn't very original. Oh well.
