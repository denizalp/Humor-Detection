We sch an interview for Punkin our 11 mo old pit mix.  Punkin has been overwhelmed and snappy at the dog park.  We walked into camp Bow Wow, Kelly greeted us and Punkin immediately warmed up to her.  She stayed and played for 5 hours.   The staff passed Punkin in her socialization visit with flying colors.  We will be back!  The certificate of completion with Punkin's picture was a Bonus! Thank you.
