LOVE this place! Usually the first place I come to once I get into Vegas!! Their pho Dac Biet & Pho Ga very tasty! We had Pho places in LA but this tops LA!\nI also usually order their sandwiches (grilled pork & grill beef, but pork much tastier) by the masses (10-15 sandwiches) to take home... and yes they have Bahn mi  sandwiches in LA too, but This places bread doesn't harden up!!! they freshly baked their bread rolls EARLY in the morning, Kathy (owner's daughter)says.\nVery fast friendly service... always a MUST, when I am in Vegas, and that is often once a month!
