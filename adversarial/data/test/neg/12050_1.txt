Finally!  I got a chance to visit a ramen house in the U.S.!  It's very similar to those in Japan but with better seating. I had the Shishito peppers as an appetizer which were very tasty. Then a pork belly roll (mini sandwich), also great. Finally the Totonku ramen which had the 20 hour cooked broth. It was meaty, fatty, and delicious. Perfectly cooked egg, not hard, but right at the point before hardening. \n\nSure it's not health food but hey, good food like this in moderation is OK. Life is nothing without its little pleasures. I'm very happy with my new little pleasure.
