It's just ehhh. For street tacos the meat should really shine. Don't expect to be noticed or spoken to first if you don't know Spanish. The staff just looks right through you. They will smile and laugh with each other, but treat you like you are bothersome. \n\nThe atmosphere is cool, much like a Tex-mex style restaurant you would find in Texas. Clean place and the tv's are a nice touch. Great place to watch a game.
