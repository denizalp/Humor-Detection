In town for the weekend and turned to Yelp to find a dinner place. This fit the bill perfectly. The menu is huge and every plate that went by our table looked amazing, in addition to big portions. We split the friend green tomatoes and the Caribbean Jerk War Pig melt and we were stuffed! Great craft beers and our waitress, Sam Smith was a huge help. The place filled up fast and we see why! Really enjoyed it.
