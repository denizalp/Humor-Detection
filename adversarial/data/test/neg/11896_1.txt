We were here back in March (2015).  If I could give it 10 stars, I would.  My boyfriend LOVES BBQ and Little Miss definitely lived up to its reviews and expectations.  It was blazing hot when we were waiting in line (for about 45 mins, during lunch) and we were offered cold bottled water which was nice and were able to chat with some nice people in the line.  The ribs and brisket were our favorite! Just ask for a little sample and they will let you taste before you order.  Enjoy!
