Relative to their nicely-made website and nice-looking decor, I was surprised at their averagely-priced menu. I easily ordered 5 different rolls last time, about 45 pieces altogether, for about $40 - an average price for a small sushi boat. \n\n2 of the rolls were from their special menu, namely Calla Roll and Guma Roll. Unfortunately both of them cheaped-out, differed from their picture on the menu. (Perhaps it's because the main sushi chef wasn't there. I know some sushi restaurants can improve by miles away depending on which chef is behind the sushi bar, but then that would turn into a consistency issue. Back to the topic.) Instead of having smoked salmon wrapping most of the roll as depicted, the actual Calla Roll only had the top part layered. Next, Guma roll is a vegetarian roll, supposedly nicely covered with spinach leaves, but mine was sprinkled with chopped spinach leaves and stems. I obviously needed some extra effort to chew down the cellulose in the stems. Other than the discrepancies from their advertisement, the food was ok, rolls were averagely sized. The other rolls I order were Gold Dragon, Toronto Roll and Spicy Tuna - the usual stuff. Should you wish to pay a visit here, I would still suggest you to go for their special menu because the food there is \n\nService was exactly what one would expect from servers of \"my own people\". Friendliness and attentiveness of this category of servers varies according to the time of the day and their mood of the moment and they don't quite bother hiding it. They're not the worst, just don't expect them to be cheerful, delightful who will make you feel like your business is appreciated, then you'll be fine.
