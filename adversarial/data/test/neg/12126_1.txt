Stumbled upon Cocina Lucero during a recent business trip in Toronto.  Mexican food overall in Canada is definitely not as prominent as it is in the states, so I definitely had to try this place.  It was also located on Yonge street which is one of my favorite spots in Toronto.  \n\nOverall, I thought the food was really good.  I was one of three tables so the service was fine, of which I had read some complaints below.  I ordered my first Steam Whistle beer as this was the only beer they had on draft.  Not the import I was thinking of getting, but still good nonetheless.  For dinner I had a set of 4 tacos 2 pulled pork and 2 pulled chicken.  Each pair of tacos were delicious and each topped with an avocado.  The tacos also had the traditional pairing of cilantro and onion on the side and the salsa on the side was the perfect heat.  \n\nI saved enough room and was able to try their fried ice cream \"helado frito\" and it was tasty.  The outside was a bit soggy and not the strong texture I was anticipating.  I will try something else the next time I go.  Overall, a great experience and great food.  I will be back in the near future.
