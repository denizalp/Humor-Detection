Let me first say that who ever gave it 1 star doesn't know Mexican food. I guess they have never been outside of Charlotte Before!\n\nThe food was priced very well. It was cheep and tasted very good. We started off the night with a Margarita which was good. Got Guacamole that was tasty as well. You cant go wrong with a 2.50 guac dish. As for as our main dishes it was great!! I think this place is very good. \n\nI have yet to be there for the Lunch or Lunch Buffet, the dinner was great. The plates were huge and tasted wonderful. If you think that \"South of the Border\" is good Mexican then A) you don't know good Food B) this place will blow that crap out of the water!!\n\nIn the area you can not beat this place for food and for the price. it is a must go to place here in this part of Charlotte. If you think you want to have a good night with some friends and your thinking Bull and Barrister, I strongly recommend this place!
