Found this Butcher through yelp. I ordered a Crown Pork Roast and Turkey Breast roast this past Christmas. The staff was super helpful in helping me figure out how much food I was going to need. My husband then bought their fresh ground beef and made the best homemade burgers I've ever had and hubby is a cooking novice. Their In House sausage is fantastic, I recommend the Apple. They only get 4 stars from me because I haven't had the opportunity to purchase too much from them. There is so much more to explore!
