Just visited here for the first time on the wkend with my bf.  We were both kind of excited to try it as it always seems to be busy.  There was nobody in there as it was getting near closing time on a Sat night.  We waited over 30 minutes for our food.  He got the Hero burger meal and I got poutine.  We live pretty much right beside the restaurant but we drove so that the food would be still hot.  \n\nPoutine was as good as jack Astors and them kind of chains and it was only 4.99$ my bf wasn't crazy about the burger but said he didn't realize how many sauces etc they had and rushed his order as we went so close to closing. Gave it another shot and they've stepped their game up. Keep u all posted.
