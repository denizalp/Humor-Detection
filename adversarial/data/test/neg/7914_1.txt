If they had a special rating to rate higher then 5 star Warren Rosegreen would be in the category. From the time he helped me out to get my house on the market and get it appraised to what it needed to be for me to sell it till after the time it sold, to purchasing a new home he has been by my family's side helping make the process so less stressful. He was with us every step of the way, calling us, texting us making sure with our new purchase we were getting the best deal also going with us to every appointment. We became friends, I think God sent me his way but I must say if you want a good agent down to earth then look no further, Warren Rosegreen is not your typical agent he is a super agent. Glad I was able to meet a good agent\/friend. Thank you Warren and Reality one, appreciate all the help!!!
