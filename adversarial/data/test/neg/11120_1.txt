This restaurant seemed a little clustered with many different things.  First you have the bakery, and then you have the seating area for brunch.  Now I was highly disappointed with the service, overall I felt I had to wait a little longer than you usually should.  First off, I don't think any restaurant should have a seat yourself option.  Unless you are ordering from the cashier service yourself and then seating yourself, this should never EVER be an option.  It took about 20 minutes for our server to come and get our order, and it took another 30 mins for our food to come.  So overall, almost an hour to actually eat and order which is something I don't find lightly.  I think the girl near the bakery section felt bad for us so she came and got our order, which I found nice of her.  \n\nAside from the clustered and noisy ambience, the food was ok.  My boyfriend and I ordered the crab eggs benedict, french toast, and the biscuits and gravy with a side of eggs and sausage.  \n\nThe crabs benedict was good, I think I got way too much meat I didn't even find the bread at the bottom of it.  The flavors were all there though.  I wasn't too fond of the potatoes, I thought it was mushy and to weird of a spice for me. \n\nThe french toast was good, a little thick cut and huge but I understand the big serving idea.  I think I needed a little more syrup instead of the small side they gave me.  The bread was really thick, I think more syrupy sweets would do it justice.\n\nThe biscuits and gravy was ok, personally I thought it was too light.  I actually like the biscuits and gravy from south point which is rather odd.  But I thought they had more flavor.  \n\nOverall this place was ok, I don't think I'll be returning soon because of that clustered feeling.  On top of that I paid $43.00 for everything which I thought was little too pricey.  I could've gone to egg works and paid less than that, but hey that's just me.
