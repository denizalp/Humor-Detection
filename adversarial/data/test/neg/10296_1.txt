Gelato Heaven! The Lychee Gelato is soooo good! It's delicate, fruity, icey not heavy at all. \n\nI was lucky enough to get a surprise gelato cake for my birthday! The \"Juliette\" is amazing! 3 different layers of gelato; Strawberry sorbet, like a sweet cream and creamy strawberry make the perfect bite together! You will make anyone's birthday if you get them a cake from here!!!
