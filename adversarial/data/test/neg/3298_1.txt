After having a horrible night at Chateau the night before, XS was a welcome breath of fresh air.  Yes, we had to wait in line - but it went quick.  Yes, we had to pay cover.  But I would still do it all over again.  There was enough room on the dance floor that I wasn't getting stomped all over.  Shot girls walked by so that I didn't have to trek to the bar.  The people were friendly and it was never too hot.  I would definately suggest this club!
