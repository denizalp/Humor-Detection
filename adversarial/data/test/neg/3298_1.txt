I had a balayage done with Natalie R and I am very happy with the outcome. I had a balayage previously with a different stylist and was not pleased with how the blending was not natural and how some bottom layers didn't appear colored at all. Natalie took the time to listen, acknowledged my concerns, offered suggestions, and ultimately did an excellent job. She is truly a balayage specialist! She showed utmost professionalism and was very friendly as well. \n\nThe salon itself was a very clean, sleek, and beautiful place. Parking was very easy to come by in front of the salon. I was greeted and offered a beverage upon my arrival. The other stylists, including Alex, were very friendly and welcoming. All in all, it was a very positive first time experience and I left feeling confident and happy with my new hair!
