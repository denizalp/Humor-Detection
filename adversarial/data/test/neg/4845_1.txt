Giving this place 3 stars mostly for the service and the calamari appetizer which were both excellent.  I ordered the Tuna steak with Jasmine rice.  It was good, not great.  Pretty much just a piece of fish with no seasoning and zero effort was made on plate presentation   I asked for some wasabi oil and that at least gave it a bit of flavor.  My date had the Mahi Mahi with butter which I tasted and it did have a nice flavor to it.  I thought the place was bit pricey for what they were serving up which was nothing fancy.  The outside dining overlooked a retail store and their track lighting spot lights were way to bright for dinner.  I don't know the dining scene in Charlotte too well as I was visiting, but I did read a lot of favorable reviews for this place so maybe compared to other places in Charlotte this is a real treat for the locals.  I probably would not go back.
