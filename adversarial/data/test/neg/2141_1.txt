My entire family has been seeing Dr Schneider and Dr Kohring for the past 25 years.  They provide great family\/general care as well as urgent care.  I recommend making an appointment to keep your wait times to a minimum.  You can get same day appnts for late hours.  They have a lot of experience and treat their patients with great care.  I recommend these guys over all of the family drs I tried over the years, they are worth the drive if not close by.
