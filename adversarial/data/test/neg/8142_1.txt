I recently resigned from RR, but as a former employee & current pet owner my cat and dogs meds were very inexpensive as is, but our quality & sterility is at a higher standard than most compounding pharmacies. When you use roadrunner you will feel like family. Primarily since everyone at RR has pets themselves. We try to give you the best value for our base price if we can. Overall In my personal experience our meds have worked amazingly for my furrbabies Kitty & Polar. FYI if you have a cat, ask your vet for our transdermal gels! Giving any cat liquid or a capsule will be the fight of your life. & if you do find yourself needing a liquid med I recommend sweeter flavors just to mask the bitterness of most medications. - Dani
