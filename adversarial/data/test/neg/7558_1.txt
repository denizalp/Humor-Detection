Some items were delicious, overall mediocre on the $60 prix fox menu. The stars were the brussel sprouts, hummus, cigars, and the lamb was perfect. The flat bread did not look or taste appealing, only had 1 bite. The waitress was not familiar with the wines and couldn't answer basic questions which was disappointing. Otherwise, the service was great and the environment quiet and romantic, if seated in the back. The front section was open to the casino and likely more noisy.
