What a disappointment. Arrived at 7pm to be rushed through dinner and be offered a selection of about a third of the items.\n\nThe waitress was very unfriendly but the most surprising part was that we were told she was the owner.\n\nMy wife and I have been vegetarian for quite some time and the quality of the food was mediocre at best.
