I have many, many diesel vans in my fleet.  I read the reviews and believed this shop may be the shop for me.   Rather than telephone I took the time to drive there and visit the shop and management.  Three days ago I drove over and met the Mark the shop manager.  Mark was unsure if they could take on that many trucks?  He assured me the owner John would be calling me that afternoon.  Well three days later I am still waiting.   Obviously, they either do not have the expertise or ability to handle our business, or have such poor customer service skills they just don't feel it necessary to call back a customer.\nI am just happy I realized this now rather than after I send over tens of thousands of dollars in repairs.
