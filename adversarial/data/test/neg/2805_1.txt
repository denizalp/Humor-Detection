Came here on my lunch break. Waitress was friendly although I felt bad for her because she was the ONLY one working tables. They should've had 2 people for the size of the place. \n\nI had the Rounders Burger and it was really good. Wasn't pleased with the fries. Most of them were hard. I decided to get a martini and ordered the Lotus Blossom. Not a fan. \n\nOverall not bad.
