What can I say, this is a Walgreens. They are conveniently open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week with a 2 lane drive-thru pharmacy. I primarily come to this Walgreens to pick up my prescription and my experience is always hit-or-miss. The pharmacy can be EXTREMELY SLOWWWW. Especially if you come here at night since they are located near the hospitals so there is usually a small line of people filling prescriptions. \nI had one experience probably 6 months ago where I decided to go inside the store one night so I could pick up a soda or something with my prescription. There were maybe 3 or 4 people in line in front of me. I waited in line for over half an hour. During this time, any car that went through the drive thru was being served more promptly than the people standing there in line. When I finally got to the counter, the staff member was very apologetic that I had to wait so long, although I know it was not her fault, they were just severely understaffed. \nI do have to say though, that in recent months, they have been more efficient with their operations whenever I have come through here.
