Located right inside the guy-concordia metro, Mr.Gao is one of the best cafeterias to stop by for a quick lunch. Their regular combos are hearty and well-varied, perfect for lunch. In addition to the combo dishes, there is also a regular dinner menu with dishes like spicy boiled fish and 大盘鸡. The rice noodle soups are very good and worth a try if you ever come. If you ever need help ordering something, just ask the staff and they will be happy to help you. :)
