Horrible customer service in the pharmacy. They clearly hate their jobs here.\n\nNeed to find another pharmacy that services TriCare..so rude\nSoooo slow..I wait in drive thru for up to 20 minutes then told I have to come into drug store as they had internal problems. Then wait another 20 minutes. Every time I come here it's a fiasco
