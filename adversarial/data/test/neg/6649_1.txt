The place is still amazing for the 3 course meal that served 12-2pm daily. For $25.16\nStill the best lunch on the strip. Way better than going to a disgusting over priced buffet that's for tourists. Very nice \nritzy upscale restaurant that at night becomes one of the most expensive restaurants on the strip. \n\nIf you get there exactly at 12pm when they open you'll get in without a reservation. The service is great with them changing all new silver wear after each course. This is my choice when I go. \n\n1. Tomato salad with feta cheese and cucumbers \n\n2. The salmon (from Scotland not that Atlantic farm raised junk) \n\n3. Greek yogurt martini (made in house and it's so rich and creamy)\n\nThere are what's called supplementals meaning items on the 3 course meal that you have to pay extra like lobster pasta for $15 more or the grilled octopus appetizer for $10 more. The lobster pasta is excellent with ton of lobster meat and the octopus is amazing no teeth needed so tender. \n\nIf you stay with my 3 choices then you'll stick with the $25.16
