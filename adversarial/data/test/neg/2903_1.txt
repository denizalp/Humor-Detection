Very disappointed. \n\nWednesday night. My friend and I popped in for a burger with a gluten-free bun \"to go\". The young host was a very nice guy and took our order right away. I came to check on the food (right as it was coming out from behind the bar) and was informed by the host that they were out of gluten-free buns. (Keep in mind, the food was already done and coming out from the bar). He told me they could \"put a regular bun on the side if I'd like that\". I wouldn't like that. I can't eat a regular bun so what good does that do me? I expressed disappointment and asked if they would remove any cost from the meal (let's be honest, a burger without a bun is a pretty sad excuse for a \"meal\"). He said he couldn't. Up until now, my experience has merely been with this young kid that probably doesn't know too much about how to handle a situation like this. So I don't want to fault the him too much.\n\nBut here is the part I am most frustrated with. \n\nThe bartender who delivered the food to me said that they have been \"out of gluten-free buns since Sunday\" (keep in mind, its Wednesday). I quickly asked why I wasn't informed of that when I ordered  and she shot back \"normally our waiters will say that, but because he is just a host he didn't see the sign on the back wall\". Okay. So because you guys didn't adequately tell your host what to say (or you just messed up), I have to pay for it? So again I ask if I can have a discount or something. Nothing. It was just a \"what's the big deal, it's just a bun\" attitude. And I wish I could say it was just those two involved. But by this time, another waiter\/host had come over and been listening to this entire exchange. \n\nThis is the epitome of poor customer service. Rule #1: ALWAYS try to fix an issue before it becomes one. A simple \"what can we do to help this situation?\" would have gone miles. I ended up leaving the restaurant only to decide (once I got to my car) that I wouldn't stand for this. $12 for a sad patty in a box? I don't think so. So I went back in. \n\nI asked for a refund. The young host went to get a manager. It didn't seem like he found one so he grabbed another bartender, who was nice, but wasn't able to make a refund. So then the host went to find the manager again and did. She came over and was able to refund me the money. (Side note: she was very nice, helpful, and understanding). \n\nMoral of the story: had ANYONE offered to help fix the situation (i.e. taking off the cost of the sweet potato fries I ordered (~$3), giving me a discount on something else, giving me the option to reorder, immediately going to find the manager when it first happened) then I would have left feeling like it was just a mistake the young kid made and not think much of it (heck, I've been in his shoes before). But the fact that so many people were involved (before the manager) and NONE of them had the common customer service knowledge to try to alleviate the situation, it reflects very poorly on the restaurant. And because of that, I got a refund on my entire burger. This restaurant could have saved money in the long run there. \n\nCustomer first...especially when it's your problem.
