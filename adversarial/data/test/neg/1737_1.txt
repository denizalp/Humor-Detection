Service here was off the hook!  They do have a hot meter, but manager brought over additional hot sauces in case we wanted to \"spice\" the dishes up to our liking.  Had fresh spring rolls and they didn't disappoint.  Also had Panang Curry and Pad Thai.  Very generous portions and authentic flavors.  Great for take out too!
