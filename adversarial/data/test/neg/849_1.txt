Awesome food if you're looking to satisfy your Viet cravings!.. I've come here plenty of times -  mostly for take-out and it always hits the spot.  I usually get the BBQ Pork Vermicelli with Spring Roll, which I highly recommend.  It's delicious, flavourful and everything is made fresh.  The portion sizes are decent for the price that you pay.  Although, the restaurant seems kind of old and run down and the staff aren't the friendliest, the food is what keeps me coming back for more.  My co-workers and I make it a ritual to come at least once a month so that pretty much says it all.  We're hooked, check it out for yourself!
