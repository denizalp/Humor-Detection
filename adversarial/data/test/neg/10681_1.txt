The Kindergarten Melt (Grilled Cheese and Tomato) was almost perfect, but the tomato was over ripe, which ruined it. Sorry, you just cannot get away with serving rotten tomatoes. \nMy friend got the Monte Cristo Melt and loved it. Beautiful looking.\nThe best selection on the menu. I liked the choices for Vegans too.\nThe coffee was terrific. The service was perfect and the food came out really quickly.\nNow for the noise report:\nThe music was annoying...lots of electric guitar played too loud on some very cheap speakers. Yes, I am over 30. It was frantic rock...not enjoyable rock. Those of us over 30  had to shout over the music.  It feels like a dance bar, but it is a restaurant. I think the goal is to attract the under 30 crowd. \nWhen we left at Noon on a Sunday, there was a line out the door. Standing room only. Lots and lots of people love Grilled Cheese. The food is very good.
