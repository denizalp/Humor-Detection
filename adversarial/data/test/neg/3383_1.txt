Mediocre breakfast at hotel.\n\nService was quite slow, -1. \n\nI got the Portuguese Sausage & Pastrami Hash, and food was okay, nothing too special. Could have made it at home. I liked the toast, but it was just cold. -1. \n\nI really did enjoy the consistency of its whipped butter (very spreadable but the taste was so bland...I like butter deep yellow in color, with a rich taste), but its jam (cranberry, I think) was the star of the meal.\n\nOverall, overpriced for what it is. Would not come back.
