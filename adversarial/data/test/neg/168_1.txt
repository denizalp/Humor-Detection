Reserved a full size.  \"Gave\" us a Honda \"Accord\".  Got down to the lot and it was a Civic.  Had to go back to the desk and they made us wait while they borrowed an Altima from Hertz.  Should have told us from the start instead of hoping we weren't going to notice.  For shame, not the way to do business.\nCharged us for prepaid gas which I declined.  Caveat emptor if you are drawn in for the price.
