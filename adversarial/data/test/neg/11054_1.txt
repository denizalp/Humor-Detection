FANTASTIC!!! I grew up in Puerto Rico; my family regularly went to Las Marias to visit my abuelita Carmen who was an amazing cook. I know how authentic Puerto Rican food tastes, this is authentic. The service is excellent, the food is heavenly, and the price is right. I will gladly be making regular trips from Scottsdale to Peoria to be a repeat customer.
