I was pleasantly surprised with this place... Charlotte needs more cool places like this. We really enjoyed the Smoked Salmon Crustini and the Sweet Burger. All this,...plus the atmosphere was super cool w\/ Band Of Horses playing on their house stereo!  The egg nog ice cream was dangerously good!!!
