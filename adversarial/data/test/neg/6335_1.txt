Great service and great food!\nI don't know why this place is not popping during lunch time.  We came in on a Saturday during lunch time and the place was empty. \nThey first serve you with a hunk of cheese straight from the cheese wheel.  Then they give you salami, spicy zucchini, and bruschetta. \nOur server i believe his name is Daniel, was great!  The way that he explained the specials drew a picture in my mind. I didn't even need the menu when he was finished.  \nTried the classic caprese , excellent.  The porcini raviolli was great in the truffle sauce.  Loved the veal chop on the bone so so so good.\n\nWhen I'm in Vegas I'm definitely coming back!
