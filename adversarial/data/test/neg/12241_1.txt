I met a friend for lunch to try the Caf√© Hollander for the first time. While visually appealing, our dining experience fell short. \n\nWe decided to split a sandwich and ordered the avocado BLT. We each ordered a cup of soup and a full order of the sweet potato frites. \n\nWhile waiting for our lunch, I had to ask twice for more hot water for my tea.  Our waitress was friendly but elusive. \n\nWhen our meal arrived, our sweet potato frites were luke-warm at best, the avocado was missing from our sandwich and my tomato bisque was chili.  And our elusive waitress was no where to be found. \n\nAnother problem with the sandwich was the bread which was toasted to the point that it should come with a warning that your mouth will be scraped raw as you eat it.  Not sure of a solution to this problem; perhaps less toasting or a different bread option. \n\nMy friend did report all of the issues we experienced and the manager did credit our bill the cost of the sandwich and soup which was above and beyond what they had to do. More frites were offered to us also but at that point we were full and not wanting more. \n\nI would give this restaurant another chance. The menu is impressive and it would be worth another trip.
