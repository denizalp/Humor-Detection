We have eaten at Roys all over the map, starting with the first restaurant in Hawaii Kai on Oahu, and so it has a special place in our hearts.  If we are in a city with a Roy's and it's a special occasion, we always try to get one meal in at Roy's.  If you like Pacific Rim\/Asian Fusion Cuisine, this is the place to check out.  The quality is incredibly consistent and we have never been disappointed.  Naturally, the service is very attentive but not over bearing, and the atmosphere is a little more romantic than many other hip places (quieter, more dimly lit).  They have a nice selection of deserts to finish the evening!
