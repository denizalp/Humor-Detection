The food here was very good, but it was the waiter, Trevor, who earned the extra star!  I came in, with my check-in special, and he looked at it and started making suggestions.  Since this cuisine isn't something I eat every day, I was happy to follow his advice, including the fantastic Lebanese pilsner.  I would definitely come back here for the food, the beer, and most of all the service!
