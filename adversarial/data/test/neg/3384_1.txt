I have been searching for replacement Migun bed parts for quite some time and stumbled upon Migun Charlotte website that offered services and parts.  On a limb I emailed an inquiry and was surprised to receive a response within a few hours (this was after business hours).  Tom was knowledgeable with the parts and made the entire process seamless.  Within a few days I received the parts which appear new and functions perfectly.  \n\nI am very pleased with this transaction and recommend this business for Migun parts!
