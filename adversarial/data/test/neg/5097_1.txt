What a great time, I took my  girlfriend here for her birthday. Such a crazy experience! When we got there we checked in and then had to put anything that could light up in a locker. They took our drink orders and asked about any food allergies we had. Once we were ready to go back they came up and guided us back to our table. I think everyone should give it a try at least once!
