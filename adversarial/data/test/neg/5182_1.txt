Excellent food and very reasonably priced!  We LOVE the Pepper Steak stir fry with beef and the Massaman Curry is always a favorite of ours.  We finished the meal with Mango Sweet Rice and it was delicious as well.  It's fast, affordable and delicious food with fabulous service.  Our drinks were never empty!  We will definitely be returning.
