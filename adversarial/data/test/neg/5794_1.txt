I stop in about three times a week to this location and I am always satisfied with the speed, price, cleanliness, and friendliness of the staff. I know with a certainty that I can get in and out with my order in under 5 minutes, which other restaurants do not share the consistency. \n\nI am mildly obsessed with the bagel sandwiches...(insert Homer Simpson thinking about donuts) I prefer the ham, egg, and sharp cheddar on a cheddar jalapeno bagel. I know, I know, I really need to stop being so health conscious. HA!
