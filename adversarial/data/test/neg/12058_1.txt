First time to Chatters, recommended by my daughter and was not disappointed. I made an appt very conveniently online taking the chance on any available stylist and was booked with Gina for a haircut and style. She was lovely, took her time, gave me some great advice and I left a very happy customer. Great service and price hard to beat at any of the competing salons. I very rarely am satisfied with my haircuts and will absolutely be a repeat client! I was also impressed that for the first time ever, I was not bombarded with pressure to purchase products.
