Not a bad place to go for a quick drink. Get in early because this place fills up really quick and it gets really crowded. Every time we go I can barely move around.\n\n There Saint Patrick's Day party are great especially, if you have children. you can just sit outside and let them run around. The only downside is they do run out of corned beef hash quickly.
