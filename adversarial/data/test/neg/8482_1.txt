This has been my go to Chinese food spot for the Last two years. I would recommend them to everyone! If you like HOT & SOUR soup, they have the best my husband or I have ever had and super quick with delivery! Hands down the BEST CHINESE FOOD! Plus the staff is so nice and helpful. I can't say enough good things about this place. MY CORNER CHINESE I LOVE YOUR FOOD. THANK YOU FOR BEING SO RELIABLE!
