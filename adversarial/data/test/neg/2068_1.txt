This was a Small, nice clean store. They had 0ne TV up front but it was kind of away from the normal sit-down area. The clerk was helpful in giving me suggestion because I was not sure exactly what i wanted. I ended up going with the Cold Vanilla Latte. It was prepare fairly quick and was rather tasty.
