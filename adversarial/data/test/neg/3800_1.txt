Pros: My favorite restaurant in AZ. I have never ordered anything that I haven't enjoyed. Nothing tops their pesto sauce. The best part is, it comes free with the bread at the beginning of the meal. Last night, I ordered the sweet potato cannelloni. It's very rich. My friend described it as, \"Like eating a dessert.\" Since I have a sweet tooth, I loved it. My sister order the pork tenderloin. Her friend ordered the chicken scallopine. It paired perfectly with my past. My BFF ordered scallops. Cooked to perfection. Like eating light puffy clouds of air. \n\nCons: Price
