I give this 4 stars because of the freshness of the sushi. I've been here 4 times in the past week and a half and the fish was fresh and the chef is always putting out plates in the goround. The decor is pleasant and modern, but they need to turn the music up on either the tvs or the music. But this is made up by the prices! Cheaaaap! it's great for a sushi craving and it does satisfy!
