I think I paid like 13 dollars or something for an \"asparagus and sundried tomato frittata with herb spread\" which turned out to be kind of a sad omelette with a few chunks of cold asparagus and tomato sitting on top and some gross cream cheese stuff smeared overtop. Also some equally sad, probably well pre-frozen homefries similar to those served in my high school's cafeteria. Not good. I wish I had taken a picture. It was really quite crap. I honestly would have been better off getting one of those prepackaged wraps at Starbucks or a Tim Hortons bagel; at least they would come hot.\n\nThe server, though, was very nice.
