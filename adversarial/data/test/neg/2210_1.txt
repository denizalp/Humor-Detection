Never ever returning to this location. I go to this Cafe Rio all the time. They give me 50% off every time for the longest time. New Asian Manager told me that they give nobody 50% off and he's going to talk to the employee that's been giving me the discount. The service here is bad but the food is good. BRING BACK THE OLD MANAGER!!!!!
