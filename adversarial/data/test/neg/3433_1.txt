Everyone needs Rehab now and again.  Check in to Rehab Burger and Check out any burger on a pretzel bun.  Their pretzel bun is probably the best I've tasted.  It has that full, salty, pretzelly taste!!!     The sweet potato tots on the side were good too.  Good drink selection and awesome wait staff.
