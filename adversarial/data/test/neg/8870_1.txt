The overall environment is modern. \n\nWe had to wait 30 mins to be seated but we dint mind. \n\nThe food's comes from a simple menu is basically breakfast & then lunch after 11, and the portion sizes are decent, but yet the food did not full me. Service was prompt and courteous. The 4 stars just stems from the fact that the food didn't fill me, and they ice the water to death (Don't mind me. I hate ice in my water.)
