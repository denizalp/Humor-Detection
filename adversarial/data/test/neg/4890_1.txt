Absolute WORST haircut my dog has ever had!! I spoke to the woman who cut my dogs hair and told her exactly what I wanted, and I think she did it the exact opposite on purpose!! The haircut was wayyyy longer than it was supposed to be, extremely choppy, and there is even a bald spot on her chest! The staff was the farthest thing from friendly and I even heard them yelling at the dogs! We will never go back and I advise everyone else to go somewhere else, too! Worst $48 I've ever paid!!
