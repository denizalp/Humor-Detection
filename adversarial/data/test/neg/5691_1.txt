Absolutely phenomenal! I've gone here a few times to grab some treats (love to support local business). But yesterday I grabbed a slice of chocolate cake and my life is forever changed. It is unlike any chocolate cake I have ever had before. It's not easy to describe but it's not a sponge type cake. The icing is very good as well (borderline too sugary). I have now found my favorite treat that I will get every time.
