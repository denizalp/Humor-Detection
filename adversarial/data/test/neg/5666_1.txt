Once upon a time, Camden Cotton Mills was my first choice for a Charlotte apartment. Unfortunately, they didn't have a suitable place available on the date that I needed, and I ended up across the street at Post. But when my Post lease ended I came back to Camden for another look, and was surprised by what I saw. I don't know whether the place changed or whether my awful experiences at Post better informed my apartment hunting, but regardless this place felt like a glammed up frat house. Even on our quick midday tour the hallways were echoing with loud parties. I can't imagine what it's like on a Friday night...
