Stopped here for a bud light on the way home after a busy day at work. Was initially told that the keg was being changed. Fine, I'll wait it's 104 outside and I want a cold beer. \n\nFew minutes later I was told the Bud Light has run out and they don't have another one. It's 6:15pm on a Saturday Evening. Bartender asked if I wanted a Coors Light instead. I said no, if I wanted a Coors light, I'd have asked for one. Oh well, taking my patronage elsewhere.
