I thought the Q here was pretty darn good, I thought that the pricing versus food quantity was appropriate and thought that the food was quite tasty. The Pulled pork was solid, the sauce was good too with just the right amount of kick. The cornbread tasted like a properly executed cornbread should. I did think that the fried green tomatoes were pretty weak, it isn't hard to make some really top notch fried green tomatoes with a mild amount of effort. I once again loved the beer selection as well as the layout with garage doors that opened up for when the weather is nice. I left here stuffed from the platter so that is all I have to say about that! I was slightly irritated though that they have a space for a tip when you order at the counter and they simply bring the food out when it is ready, and there are signs that tell you to bus your own tables, sort of tacky but some places roll like that. I'd certainly come back again.
