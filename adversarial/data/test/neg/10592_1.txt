I cannot get enough of this place. \n\nFood: Fresh, Delicious, Diverse\nAtmosphere: Comfortable, Classy but Casual, Well-Organized\nService: Amazing, Friendly, Quick\n\nMy boyfriend, roommates, and I come to Malaya almost once a week. The menu is not overpriced, the staff is beyond friendly and recognizes regulars, the food is spectacular, and you can't beat the atmosphere. \n\nThe sushi is always fresh, warm, and has that special something to each roll. I turned a sushi-hating friend into a sushi-craving friend simply by taking her to Malaya and letting her pick the first sushi roll she spotted. The meals always come quick, the portions are generous (I need a to-go box every time,) and the menu is diverse enough to satisfy everyone at the table. The Miso Soup is the best I've ever had. The house Plum Wine is delicious, that perfect balance of sweetness and tang, we can rarely get away without taking a bottle home. The tables are set far enough apart that you have complete privacy during your meal, but there is more than enough seating to accommodate a huge crowd. The staff is ridiculously friendly, promt, and thorough. \n\nOne of my absolute favorite restaurants in Charlotte. Hands down.
