It was recommended by a local from Las Vegas, we were taken here for lunch by a freind of my wife's.\n\nSince the portions were very large we shared. I had chicken sandwich (sorry forgot the exact name) with a side of fries. It was great.  \n\nIt's opn 24hrs, has a nice bar and nice atmoshere, good service, very quick and they get busy. \nOverall very good place to eat if you stay at Circus Circus or Startosphere cos it's at that end of the strip. It's a great place to have a meal espcially if you are on a low budget. Sandwich with fries was $12.50 if i remeber correct.
