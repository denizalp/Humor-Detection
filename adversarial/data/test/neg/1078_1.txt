No wonder seats arent filled up at this dennys. The waiter was very unhappy and seemed like  he hated his job. Service was bad. Food was very bland. They charged one of my friends wrong. Added an extra  oj to his bill. Never coming here again! !! Stay away. P.s bathrooms had blood on the walls and no toilet paper !!
