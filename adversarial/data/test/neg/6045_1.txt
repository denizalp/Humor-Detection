From the beginning when Scott came to see my furniture, he was honest, knowledgeable and straight forward with what needed to be done. We just picked our furniture up and he went above and beyond. Only only is the color, texture and cushion fill wonderful, all of my arm rests, which were once dry and scratched, look conditioned and new. Highly recommend Scott and his work. After much research, we found his prices to be extremely fair for the service provided.
