The pedicure chairs are very comfortable, and their massagers work well. $25 for a pedicure, extra $5 for callus remover. I get pedicures every month, and this is the smoothest my feet have ever been. Be careful if you have them use glitter polish. It takes longer to dry. Not the most high end, but I will go back.
