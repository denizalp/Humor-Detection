We love good Steakhouses and we'd heard this was a good one to try in LV, but we're very disappointed. The food was great so \"Hats off to the chef\", but the service was the worst. They had 2 waiters waiting on us and still couldn't get it right. We had to continuously ask for drinks. They forgot half of our food. The meals came out the same time as our appetizers AND our salads. When the hostess came by and check to see how everything was going we told her we were having a terrible experience in their restaurant. She told us she would have a manager stop by which never happened. All in all the worst restaurant experience we've had in Las Vegas. \n\nI ended up emailing their customer service the next day and they apologized for the crappy service and emailed me a 25% discount code for our next visit. That was nice, but their website is so confusing that you can't find where to redeem it. Luxor Fail!
