Horrible service left a burger out of my order and told us to go back because they said they would compensate the meal and give us a sandwich which was the manager brenda who apparently hasn't finished training. Now i go back in today and the other manager Nancy was getting arguementive saying she cant do anything and would not fulfill the promised customer service. Not to mention the rest of the staff gave extremely dirty looks, and also disrespectful and threw the burger on the counter at us..... Definately losing my business for good.
