I find the Grocery Pick Up staff at this Walmart store to be truly outstanding. Best store in the city.\n\nYes that's right, I said grocery pick-up!\n\nYou mean you haven't tried grocery pick up yet? It's so simple and convenient. I shop for all my groceries, frozen food, canned goods, dairy, meat, produce, and general mechandise, online at Walmart.ca, when it's convenient for me, including in my boxers, at 3 a.m. after coming home from playing a live gig with my band. :)\n\nThen I simply schedule my pickup for whenever I like in the next few days, (or up to two weeks in advance), and when I show up at the store I selected, I phone to tell them I am parked in the pick up area, and they come out to my car and load all my groceries in my trunk. All I do is just sign and drive away!\n\nWhat could be simpler and more convenient than that? No more wandering around the store trying to find what I'm looking for, no more asking for directions or help finding products, no more lining up waiting for a cashier, or trying to figure out which lane is moving the fastest. Now my total time at the store is literally 5 minutes or less, sitting in my car, even for a large bi-weekly grocery order.\n\nEven if something is not in stock at my local store, they will deliver it right to my door, at no extra charge, the following week. \n\nSo why not five stars? Walmart gets their fifth star when they make every item in the store and in the sale flyer always available for online shopping. Come on Walmart, you can get these items on your website in the same amount of time it takes to print those sale flyers!\n\nHow much does all this manual labor, packing, loading, and service, cost me, you ask? How does $3 sound? Yep, only 3 bucks! \n\nAnd they prohibit tipping of any kind, (no matter how hard you try), so this is such a smart choice, both financially economical, and a very efficient use of your time.\n\nThanks Walmart, I'm a fan.
