Great place!! I was recently a new dog owner and took my French in here with me and the nice gentleman behind the counter was super knowledgeable and more than helpful, I wish I could remember his name! I don't shop here as often only because it is a little further of a drive for me to get here but the few times I've been here, excellent service! Such great people working here, thanks Noble Beast!!
