I absolutely give EcoDry Carpet cleaning a 100000% satisfaction!!! Chris came on time and even called to let me know he was on the way.. My carpets look phenomenal and he also cleaned my couch and throw pillows and they never looked better!! I have two chihuahuas that make a lot of accidents on my carpets and they look brand new. I love the fact that they are Eco friendly and extremely professional and Chris is just an awesome guy! I highly recommend this to anyone!!!
