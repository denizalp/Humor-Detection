The kitchen is nice and the tub is great. The sofa bed needs to go. I can feel the metal poking me at night. The blanket and sheet need to go too. It is so old and so thin.\n\nThe time share presentation is a long 5hrs one. They tell you it's 2 hrs but they won't take no for an answer. Very disappointing.
