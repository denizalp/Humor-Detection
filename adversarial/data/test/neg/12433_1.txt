William Lyon also built my home next to an asphalt plant without properly disclosing it.  My real estate agent asked about the \"sand and gravel pit.\"  The William Lyon sales rep said, \"it's no big deal.  They have reached the water table and they are closing.\"  This is not true.  They have at least another 10 years to go.  While informed professionals agree that it was not properly disclosed, it has become apparent that the entire situation is something of a racket involving \"regulators,\" the builder, the polluter and the local government.  The state attorney general and the real estate board side with the builder, and the builder has seen to it that there are conflicts of interest with practically every real estate attorney in the area.  \n\nWe have had a number of other issues that I will not address here, which have entailed us being required to have a parade of contractors through our home for two years only to fix nothing.  Their strategy is to wear you down so you'll go away.  It finally worked.  They also have apparently weaseled their claws into the Registrar of Contractors, too.  I am exhausted from it all.  My \"happy place\" has been nothing but a major source of stress to me for the last two years thanks to William Lyon.  We are trying to get out, but now home sales are falling though as a result of the asphalt plant.  Apparently when you actually tell someone that they are about to buy a home next to a major industrial polluter, they change their minds about the purchase. \n\nBuyer beware.  I will personally never purchase from William Lyon Homes again.  If you do, know that there has been no due diligence on their part to make sure your home has been built in a responsible location and it is likely that they've gone to great lengths to take away your ability to do anything about it.\n\nThanks, Arizona!  You really are the wild west!!
