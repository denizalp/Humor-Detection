We came in because of the reviews. Disappointed. My corned beef hash omelet was browned and dry. Wife's cream cheese and chives inlets was tasteless. \nHome fries were barely warmed just like to cold plate of bacon. Must have been yesterday's. Coffee was bitter. \nOur waitress was sweet and the place is pretty good looking.\nBring a parka.
