I highly recommend this spa. Asian foot massage spas are a dime a dozen out here but this one was professional, clean and overall very pleasant. This is the place to get your massages! Out-of-towners; take an evening off the main strip and take a cab out to this Chinatown strip. Get a foot massage here, dinner and tea downstairs and visit the shops on this part of town.
