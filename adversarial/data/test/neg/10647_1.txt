Small unassuming place in a strip mall.  Parking lot available.  Greeted and seated quickly.  Ordered 2 bun dishes; one with pork with egg roll and grilled chicken bun.  Service was rather slow.  When the dishes came out 20 min later, the server apologized for the slow service saying that they had to grill the chicken.  The dishes were large and both were tasty and fresh.  So here's their score.  Food-4; quantity-5; service-3.  Obviously only one cook.  There are plenty other pho places that serve food much more quickly though and just as good.  Prices are reasonable.
