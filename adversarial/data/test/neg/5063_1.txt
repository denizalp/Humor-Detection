Boulder City is a great place to spend several hours in a small town atmosphere which is exactly what it is.  There's a main street called Nevada Way with several restaurants, souvenir places, and antique stores.\n\nA walk on Nevada Way is a fine way to spend some time looking at the many pieces of public art.  These sculptures, some are for sale, heighten the beauty and charm of this city.\n\nThere is history if you do the walking tour of the city.  Stop at the museum at the Boulder City Hotel and you can see why the town is laid out the way it is.  Find some of the original 5 Companies housing.\n\nIt's an enjoyable city.\n\nPS:  Guy, there's a Starbuck's in BC.  I stop there often after hiking.
