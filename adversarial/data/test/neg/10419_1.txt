House Doctor Exterminating is the best!  David Ramos is a great guy.  He gave me a very reasonable rate that I could afford to treat my house and take care of a termite infestation with the most activity in my garage.  He checked out my house for almost an hour, and even checked to give me advice on a water leak, also in my garage)!  I needed the service to be done at a certain time, as I work from home and needed to be available for conference calls.  His employee arrived at my house right at 8 am (I needed him to arrive before 9 am to let him in, etc).  They did their work, cleaned up afterwards, and left around 11 am.  I am thrilled and relieved to have this termite situation taken care of, and the treatment came with a 5-year warranty.  They are the BEST.
