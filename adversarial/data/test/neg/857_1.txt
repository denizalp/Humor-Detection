I have used this company for a few of my properties and when I started about 5 years ago I didn't have many issues.  It was convent to use the same company for my newer purchases for my rentals and man this is by far the worst experience I have had.  Multiple properties have had issues and my last issue was a washer that had gone out and they told me they would replace it,  it has now been over a month and my renter is fed up with hand washing.  If you call in for a claim or just to even talk to someone expect to wait 45minutes or MORE! Try doing that a few times to fix an just 1 issue.  I will now look for another company to do business with. Thanks for nothing but a $75 service fee and more money and time out of my pocket.
