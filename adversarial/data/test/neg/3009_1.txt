We really enjoyed eating here.  I has the minestrone and linguine with chopped clams and my wife had the lasagna. Both were very good. The house red and white wines are complimentary with the meals. The service was good and they gave us a piece of teramasui since it was our wedding night. It was a good experience and I would totally eat there again.
