I'll start by saying the massage I had was wonderful. Very professional and listened to what I asked for in pressure to make me more comfortable. It was very off putting that I had to walk from the woman's spa area through the gym in my robe with nothing else on to get to the area where I would have my massage. I didn't feel very comfortable with people running on the equipment. I did like the atmosphere of the actual spa area with the hot tub and saunas. The ability to get bottles of water or juice was a nice touch. I also loved the sugar scrub that was available for use. I didn't like getting locked out of my locker even after putting my code in successfully multiple times before I went for my massage only to come back and it not work. I was not the only one this happened to. They quickly came in and got it opened but it was frustrating. I was also not impressed with getting hit by the shower head when it blew off and smacked me in the back of the head. I told them I was fine but the only response I got was it must've not been screwed on tight enough.
