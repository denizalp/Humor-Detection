Excellent food. Good customer service, but not intrusive or in your face.\n\nIf you're lucky, you'll be able to get an outdoor seat!\n\nI would really like to see this place succeed.\n\n\n*** Update***\n\nI just want to reiterate that this is one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh if your criteria are REALLY tasty, original food at a very reasonable price!
