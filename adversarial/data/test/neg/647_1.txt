I was traveling with my boyfriend and his Belgian family and I was in charge of choosing restaurants and booking reservations. They love to have aperitif so I suggested we go to Pullman for some wine and snacks before dinner. Since they love wine and are pretty knowledgeable about it this place was great. They got to try some nice wines and we had some delicious cheese and charcuterie. It was the perfect pre-dinner place. It was even mentioned that this was their favorite bar on the whole trip.\n\nNice decor and good service. It was a pretty elegant place with a relaxed environment. Would be a nice date-place or girls night.\n\nA bit pricey so I would suggest going here expecting to pay a lot
