First time trying Five Guys was here and I was impressed. As someone probably already mentioned, a regular burger actually contains 2x patties, which feels like the size of a double whopper. Couple that with cheese, bacon, and \"everything on it\" and you have a formidable meal to contend with.\n\nThe fries are definitely something worth mentioning. For an in-n-out regular, i've become accustomed to stuffing my face with soggy, limp potato ropes. This place has the real deal. An order of regular fries is just a small drinking cup filled with thick, crispy, greasy fries. They load your cup of fries into your take out bag, then top off your bag with even more fries! They must have thought i was pretty hungry, ordering the bacon cheeseburger after all.\n\nBe careful sitting near the back of the restaurant, AT&T reception is pretty bad inside.
