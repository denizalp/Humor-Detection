I had never been here before but found it was a good pub food.  I had the fish tacos and a spinach salad.  It is pub food so much is deep fried but aside from that the food was quite good.  My dinner companions had fish and chips which was very good.  The staff was attentive and extremely nice.  I would recommend this restaurant and I would go back.
