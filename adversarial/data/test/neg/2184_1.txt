On thursday (10-27-16), at roughly 4:45 pm. The bar tender (female, long dark hair) was taking the order from 3 people in our group. All 3 of us were making large orders, all with special requests. We were not simply ordering \"the burger\"... we were ordering different kinds of foods and toppings, salads or potatoes with or with out the extras, medium\/medium well, etc. its a lot to try to remember when there are 3 different orders, and the bartender was not writing anything down. \n\nShe took my 2 friends orders, and by the time she had gotten to me, i asked her if she was sure she \"didnt want to write this stuff down\" and she snapped back at me by saying \"are you fucking kidding me? I have a lot of customers. Can you just tell me what you want?\"... i was shocked and said i dont want anything, im fine, dont worry. She then continued to attack me by saying \"now your fucking insulting me. Tell me what you want\". I told her that i dont want anything, im fine, this will be my last beer.\n\nShe walked away, and my 2 friends were asking me \"what was that all about\". I explained to them how she swore at me twice. The bar tender over heard me and said \"i can say what ever the fuck i want\". I told her i would be letting the owner know how she was acting and what she had said to me and she responded by saying \"go ahead. The owner will 86 your ass because i can do what ever the fuck i want\". \n\nI offered to pay for my drinks and leave, she wouldnt let me pay. \n\nThis place is usually a pretty decent place. They tend to get your food order wrong, but if you can get past that, its a decent little pub. I will never return to this place, and neither will my group of friends. Not as long as the people who work there are allowed to talk to customers in such a way.\n\nHORRIBLE SERVICE
