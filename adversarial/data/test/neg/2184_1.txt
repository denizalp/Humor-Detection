I hate to do this but the food was literally the worst Indian food. We ordered all chicken dishes for take out and the meal took 45min to make, which we thought was a good sign. However, once we starting to eat the chicken tasted awful and some pieces had tendons in it. It's very unfortunate since we were all starving and ate everything else, which was ok, and left all the chicken for the dog.
