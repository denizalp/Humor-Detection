The food is overpriced for what they give you- one chicken breast and a spear of broccoli was $22.50. Talk about making a come up!! Not to mention it wasn't seasoned very well.  \n\nThe interior of the restaurant looks very dated. \n\nThe only positive was that we were pressed for time and our waiter was able to accommodate. \n\nNot worth it. I would rather wait for a table next door at Meat and Potatoes than return here even if they are the only place with open tables which was the case tonight.
