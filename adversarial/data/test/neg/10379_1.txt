Very professional, friendly, and helpful staff. I worked with Jim Levine who did an outstanding job getting me the car that I want within my budget. I was looking online for this car as I had lot of specifications which made my search even harder. Eventually I ended up contacting many dealers all across the country and I can easily tell the difference with MB of North Olmsted. The customer is the priority at all time.
