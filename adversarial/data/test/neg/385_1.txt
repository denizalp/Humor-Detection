Dinner on an otherwise ordinary Thursday night offered the following:\n\ntasty dogs\ncreative topping combos\nnicely cooked frites\ndelicious dipping sauces\ncrisp salad\ngreat bar\ninventive cocktails\nquality beer selection\n\nAnd the best part was the service. Our hostess was genuinely welcoming, nothing over the top, just friendly and warm. Our server saw similarly nice, not too showy but still polite and polished. He dealt with a food allergy concern by going straight to the source - the chef's recipe book - and providing a quick, definitive answer.\n\nWe went in with no expectations and wound up having a really nice time. Can't wait to go back!
