Came here for happy hour with some friends.  Margaritas were good. Not as strong as I like but good...lol!!!  Chips and salsa is good.  Great flavor.  Asked for the habanero salsa....has a nice kick. Which I liked..  :).  Ordered the guacamole dip, Ono taco and a chorizo taco....it was all good!  No complaints.!!  Bartendar was very attentive and friendly.
