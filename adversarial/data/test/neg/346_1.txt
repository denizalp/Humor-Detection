We had a great experience using Hertz. We had our minivan rental for 2 wks and put lots of miles visiting 6 National Parks from the North Rim of the Grand Canyon through all 5 parks in Utah!  It was great having all of the space. We had no issues and being a gold card member really made it so easy to pick up and return quickly and efficiently!!
