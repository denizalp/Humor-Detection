Dukes of Air handled my air conditioning issue with kid gloves. They scheduled service promptly, they arrived on time (even a little bit earlier than promised), and they did not try to upsell any services. \n\nKalem was professional, courteous, and polite. He diagnosed the problem, explained what needed to be done, and went about fixing it. When he left, there was no debris left behind.\n\nI highly recommend Dukes of Air. They live up to their excellent Yelp reviews!
