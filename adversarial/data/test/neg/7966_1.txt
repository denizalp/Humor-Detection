I'm not the best at reviews but I feel this space needs one!!\n\nI Love this place! Joi and Yadi are amazing at what they do. Loved each and every session I have ever been to. If I could go every day, I would. Since having treatments I just feel better overall in mind, body, and spirit. I have also tried their pyramid protocol to rebalance and heal some digestion issues, worked very well!! The Sunday Qi Gong class is wonderful too! (They have Friday classes as well but I've only been to Sunday).
