I am very impressed with Pick of the Litter.  We are very particular (as most pet lovers are) in who takes care of our pets.  We have a dog and two cats.  The cats are extremely needy and never quite adjust to us being away.  Monika makes our trips very comforting because we come home and Cosmo and Freeway act like we were never gone.  Lisa is great and easy to work with and a genuine pet person.
