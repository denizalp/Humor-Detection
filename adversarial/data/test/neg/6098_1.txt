Sorry but this was terrible !! Service so so slow ... food at best mediocre !! Very expensive.. Probably the worst Caesar salad I've ever had ...nice young man making said he had no idea what he was doing .. he had watched the other guys make & they were running behind so he was helping ! two pasta dishes plain stone cold ! Has a nice atmosphere.. beautiful setting & dinning\/ bar area ..  but food maybe the worst in the valley ... !!
