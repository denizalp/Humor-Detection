So I saw a couple of new signs on the side of the road on my usual route and decided to stop in real quick for lunch takeout. No customers were there and the lady (maybe she was the owner) was happy and welcoming. I ordered and she asked if I would like my salad while I waited as they do not package it to-go. I accepted and it was simple, fresh & had a delish peanut dressing I wanted to lick off the plate... We shared a quick chat. The place is very nice. Clean & modern, a bit dark due to the black walls and ceiling but they have white paper balloons hanging like little moons all over the sky. Nice tables with fresh flowers sitting on them. I will def be coming back to sit down and eat with my boyfriend.\nThe food, which I got to-go, was yummy but a bit spicy and I LOVE spicy!!! I usually get medium to hot but stay away from thai hot. I asked for medium and it was \"a drink of water between each bite\" spicy! Next time I guess I'll try mild. I ordered the Gapow. Very good but I would have liked more basil flavor, it was very light. The bell peppers & everything were cut to a perfect bite size.  I liked that cause then every bite could have a bit of ALL the goodness rather than a single mouthful of bell pepper or onion or protein at a time. The chicken was tender and not dry at all. I really liked it and I will go back!
