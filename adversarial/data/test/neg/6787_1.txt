I've been working with Graham Beech over the past few months on a tattoo to cover a childhood scar on my shoulder. The shop is always welcoming, alive, and vibrant with good energy. \nAll of the artists share a passion for their craft, and Brandon at the front is able to connect you with all of the details on the entire process. \nTop of the line care, respect, attention to detail, and devotion to your tattoo.
