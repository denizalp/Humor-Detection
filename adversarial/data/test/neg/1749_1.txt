The rate is pretty affordable.  My daily rate is $75 US including taxes.  First of all, free WIFI is good.  I can receive email and do some basic search without an issue.  I live in a room right next to the recreational room.  It's ok but I came in during the orientation week.  Those kids just were not considerate and they were having a loud party (not sure if they have drinks) every night.  My room is literally on the other side of recreational room.  They didn't stop until 2 or 3am.\n\nSome basic amenities are missing from the room such as iron, iron board and hair dryer.  But you can request them from the lobby.  I got 2 TV sets which were about 25 inches (max).  They got cable as well but no TSN\/ESPN.  \n\nI stayed 4 nights and I do not believe there's any towel replacement.  Housekeeping task is restricted to garbage removal.  The pictures on the url show it's like a suite but there is no coffee machine and stove and you cannot request them from the lobby.  For the bathroom, it's shower only (no bath tub).\n\nOne other thing, there's a fire alarm one night around 9pm.  There's NO instruction on where to go and what to do.  Everyone was rushing to the ground floor.  I saw some morons who were standing next to the elevators (not on ground floor).  I was so glad it turned out to be a false alarm.  Again, instruction should have been posted on every room what to do in case of fire if it cannot be communicated to residents during check in.
