I've been to several dentists and always struggled finding the right one that offered both a great dentist and staff. I couldn't be happier to have found Dr Panelli. Not only is he great, but so is his friendly staff. I had a small chip in my tooth that I was self conscious about and had paid lots to have fixed in the past, not only did Panelli fix it perfectly, but he guaranteed his work, something my past dentist didn't do. I highly recommend making your way to his office!
