Would give this 2 and half stars because it really was just a meh experience.\n\nCame for late night food on a weekday and didn't expect it to be super busy but found it was relatively lively.  It's literally a giant house and your table could be in any part of the house layout - living room area, sun room area, etc.  It's quite a homey feeling, but as it's a pretty old house in a pretty old neighbourhood, expect to find the usual grime and dirt around the corners.\n\nMenu is your typical bar food of wings and burgers and fries - I found my celery in my wings order to be a bit brown.  Otherwise the wings are passable - neither good nor bad.  I see the other reviews rave about the breakfast and will come give it a try another time.
