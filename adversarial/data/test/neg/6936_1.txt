I can not believe the way my mother was treated by this company. Her garage door stopped working one day and she called Lodi because she had used them before. A service technician came out and did the work. When leaving the technician gave her his card and said next time not to call the main office but just call him directly and he'll do the work off the clock cheaper. My mother, being a woman of integrity found this disturbing and called Lodi to report their employee. Who knows how much legitimate business this man was stealing from his employer. Whoever took this call brushed it off. Sometime later my mother had another garage malfunction and once again called Lodi. When scheduling the appointment she asked that the technician that had come out last not come back. Lodi did send another technician who said she needed new railings but had to order them and would have to come back the following week. The following week the same man who steals from his company and she specifically asked to not come back showed up to do the work. At that time he told her she didn't need new railings he could just bend them back into place and it would \"save her money\". She called Lodi to ask what the story was. One technician said she needed new railings and the other said she didn't. Lodi never returned her call!!! So she stopped payment until she could get a return call and an answer to the conflicting technician stories. NO ONE FROM LODI HAS CALLED HER BACK IN 2 WEEKS. Every day she is wondering if her garage door is going to stop working because the technician didn't put the new railings on her garage \"to save her money\" and wouldn't listen to her when she asked that he put them on. Then today the bank informed her that Lodi disputed her stop payment because she is a \"racist\". What!? What does that have to do with anything!? Until today I had no idea what ethnicity this tech was my mom wasn't happy with because she had never once mentioned it. To me this is UNBELIEVABLE!!! Are the owners even aware of whats going on or is this all behind there backs?! Wouldn't know because no one is calling us back!! Stay FAR FAR away from this company. There are may more credible companies out there. They're YELP rating really says it all...
