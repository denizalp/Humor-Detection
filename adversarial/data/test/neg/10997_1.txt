I had lunch today at Boston Pizza.  It's been awhile since I've been at a Boston Pizza.\n\nIt's been years since I've had a pizza at Boston Pizza as I usually order Broken Lasagna.  Today I ordered an individual Meateor pizza with regular crust.  It was really good and filling.  I'd get it again.  Thin crust is 520 calories and regular crust is 880 calories.  \n\nElyse was my server.  She was friendly and chatty and took good care of me.
