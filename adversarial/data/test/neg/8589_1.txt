Eh- ok I guess I would say for 4-8yr olds- a lot of the rides are dinky. Everyone who works there looks like they hate their lives. It's hard to go during the week cuz they don't have a lot of workers and therefore you have to find one to let you on the ride. No worker stays at one ride- they bounce around everywhere.
