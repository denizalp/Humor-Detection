Not sure what all the haters experienced, but my brother and I dropped in while charging our car and had an awesome experience. We were sat with no wait, our waitress was attentive, friendly, and just wonderful. I tried the \"prime steak burger\" and had the fires as well as a side garden salad. By description it appeared to be a response to shake shack. It was fantastic. My brother tried the bacon cheeseburger with fried and a side salad, and he too reported it was really good. All I. All a total bargain. Oh, and yes, both dining room and restrooms were in shop shape.
