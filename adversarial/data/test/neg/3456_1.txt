Bagelino`s has been kicking around Calgary`s downtown core for awhile.  I remember frequenting the Bagelino`s on the corner of 4th and 4th for years, before it disappeared and for me, \"miraculously\" cropped up again on 8th Ave and 7th Street.\n\nSeeing that I am watching my waistline a bit, I dont indulge often at Bagelino's, since bagels are a healthy choice, but not a diet-friendly choice.  \n\nToday, I succummed to Bagelino`s because they had a board out on the sidewalk advertising Tomato Soup as the special.  Tomato Soup is one of my favorites, so I was drawn in.\n\nFor lunch today, I did enjoy the delicious, homemade Tomato Soup, and I also got a whole wheat vegetarian bagel sandwich.  Over the years, I have tried different sandwiches there, and they have never disappointed me.\n\nThis restaurant has recently been bought and sold and is under new management.  As a result, I have seen no change for better or worse in quality.  The bagel sandwich I had today was consistent with the whole wheat bagels of previous owners and location.  Delicious, flavorful and fresh.
