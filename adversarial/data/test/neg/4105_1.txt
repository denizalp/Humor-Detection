I have been looking for a place that makes decent Enchiladas and is casual\/ not too pricey.. saw Cocina Lucero walking past it and decided to try it with my friend.\n\nPlace was pretty empty at lunch hour on friday which didn't feel like a good sign but I was definitely glad I went in. The food was excellent. We ordered nachos and guacamole, beef enchilada and fish tacos - everything was mouth watering and declicious.\n\nService was slow and we had to go inside to find the waiter to get a drink refill (we were on the patio). However the food more than made up for it. If it wasn't for the poor service, I'd have given it 5 stars.
