I was very pleased with the service I received from Pearson Eyecare Group. I had RK over 30 years ago and when I turned 40 a woke up and could no longer see, back to glasses I went.  I was told that I could only wear hard lenses and that they would have to be fitted and eventually we would find the right fit!  That never happened and I have been stuck with glasses ever since.  Dr. Macklin asked me why I did not wear contacts and I said because everyone said my cornea's were too flat from the RK and I would forever where glasses until I was eligible for a cornea transplant.  Dr. Macklin said that he felt he could fit me with an Acuvue daily where lense and he did just that.  I am now a contact wearer again!  I can not say enough about the service I received here and would highly recommend that you use Pearson Eyecare!
