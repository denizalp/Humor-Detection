I found this company on a daily offer special. They did my carpets and did a great job.  I had them come back about 6 months later...this time they did my carpet and tile (my tile was dirty)... everything looked GREAT. My kids looked at the tile and thought it was brand new.\nWe have told many of our friends about this company...and they all have been very happy with the service.\n2 BIG thumbs UP!!!
