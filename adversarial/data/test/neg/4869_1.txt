First off, let me start off by saying I have found my new favorite steak house. If I could given this place 10 stars I would. My mom had eaten here prob 20 years ago and so we weren't sure how good it still would be. We had a choice between Ruth Chris and here and based on yelp reviews went with bobs. Let me tell you, the filet was amazing! It topped every steak house I've been to so far, better than Flemings or Morton's (which both have filets at double the price). Actually this is the first time I got a steak made right on the first try( med well). Also we ordered a ribeye (which normally I don't care for) but even this one was flavored so good and was so tender, I would consider ordering it myself. \n\nDesiree was our waitress and she was awesome. We will forever ask for her when we go there, which will be our monthly place to dine (maybe more). She kept our drinks full and was on top of everything. She made us feel as though we had been going there for years.  \n\nAfter our experience today, I can totally see why the reviews are great.  I strongly encourage you to give this place a try and if you aren't sold at that point... Then there must be something wrong with you. ( relax, I'm only teasing).
