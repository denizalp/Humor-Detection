I have come here a lot and it's always been a great experience. Today after going through the wash i noticed my vehicle was still dirty. I went to the attendant and asked to take a look and he just mumbled to me and said he will check. He then went and stood by the manager for 10 min. till i walked over and asked the manager about my issue and he told me that the $6 wash was only a touch up wash ?!?...\nSo they advertise a $6 wash but the fine print of it is ( if your vehicle is clean ).
