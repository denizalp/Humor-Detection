Not great really.  Portion size was small.  Food had some flavor, but overall not something worth waiting for.  We called ahead and still had to wait 30+ minutes.  I had the lamb shanks and there was little to no sauce and the menu said it had mash potatoes.   There was probably two tablespoons.  Atmosphere is cool, but not even close to one of the best restaurants in Peoria.
