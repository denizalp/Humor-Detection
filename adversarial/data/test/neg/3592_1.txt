To update my review, please don't come here if the chef (Didier) is not likely to be in the kitchen.\n\nThat means avoid coming here on weekday nights, and come for lunch for Thursdays, possibly Fridays. Saturdays would be the best days to come here and eat (especially Saturday night), as he is sure to be in the kitchen cooking.\n\nIf he isn't, the escargots tend to be over salted by the sous chef, the souffle was slightly cooked (I tasted scrambled eggs on one side of the souffle), and the meal is just \"okay\". I mean, it's still better than your average restaurant, don't get me wrong... but at the prices I am paying, it is not EXCELLENT like the first time I came here to eat.\n\nJust a heads up.
