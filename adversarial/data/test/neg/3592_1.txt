We were so surprised at how well this restaurant is doing. What a nice little when treat we visit family in Ohio. The king crab was delicious but the lobster pappardelle was outstanding!! The service is top notch but the views are what really won us over. We spent a beautiful summer night here. Our dinner started at 8:30pm (which is a perfect time to catch the sunset). \n\nHighly recommend this place!
