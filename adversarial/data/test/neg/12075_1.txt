Staff knows Lakewood housing and yards and are happy to help guide you through any project. They carry Benjamin Moore paint.  I thought paint was paint until I used this stuff - for exterior work it can revitalize and strengthen old, neglected wood. \n\nI save money shopping here because I only buy what I need for the job and get exactly what I need to do it right. \n\nThey also help with crafty artistic projects and you can see by how they do the windows and displays that they pay attention to detail.
