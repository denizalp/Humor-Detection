We went here for lunch and the menu was interesting.  I ordered the salmon with quinoa and my husband ordered the chicken salad.  We also ordered the bread pudding with ice cream.  That with one nonalcoholic beverage came out to $70.  The food was good, service was great and the interior was beautiful but I don't think that we would spend that much on a casual lunch again.
