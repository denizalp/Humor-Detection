So fresh and so clean, clean.  Amazing selection of local and organic produce.  Wake up on Friday morning and bring in your delivery box, full of fresh, carefully packed fruits and\/or vegetables, and you will be loving this company.  By far the best quality produce I've found in the valley.  We also like the option of switching out up to 3 fruit\/veg selections each week for something more suited to our needs.
