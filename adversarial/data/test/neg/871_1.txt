I get a pizza delivery flyer on my door at least twice a week. This small Pizza delivery place in a non decrepit shopping center delivers exactly what you need when you call upon pizza delivery place! Good prices, and yummy food when you don't even want to pick up the phone to have food delivered, as they have an on line order format. I always feel like Sandra Bullock in \"The Net\" movie when I order on line. They remember your address and your only a point and click away from pizza, jalapeno poppers, decent salads, chicken fingers, and all the good food one may need on a Sunday afternoon. I'm not giving this place four stars because there is grease less pizza or a veggie plate, but when one needs pizza, and good accoutrement's call these guys!!
