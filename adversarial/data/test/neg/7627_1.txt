This is a fantastic spot for Indian food because everything is fresh prepared.\n\nSo if I want to remove some spices from my food, like cumin seeds (which are junk because they irritate the digestive tract), then it's no big deal. Almost all the other Indian places in town premix things several days in advance which means the food at these other places isn't truly fresh.\n\nI also like the variety of choices on the menu and it's also rare to find Indian spots with dosa.\n\nService is very attentive and friendly.\n\nKeep up the good work!
