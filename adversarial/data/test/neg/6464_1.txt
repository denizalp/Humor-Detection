Let's be honest and get this out of the way. Guy Fieri annoys the crap outta me on DD&D. He never lets the chefs talk without butting in. LET THEM TELL THE INGREDIENTS, WE GET IT YOU KNOW THEM ALSO! \nAnyways, I was pleasantly surprised and had a good time eating here. I wanted to try an appetizer but I knew it would fill me up. It's Vegas, the night was young. I decided to try the turkey burger. It had a spicy kick to it and was delicious. It came with fry trio which is basically 3 different types of fries. Wish it had a pickle with it as I saw the other burgers have them! \nNice server, well organized drink runners. Overall great time!
