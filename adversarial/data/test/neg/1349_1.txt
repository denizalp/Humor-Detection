All I have to say is WOW, the line might be 45 minutes but its well worth the wait. The staff are extremely friendly and the food quality is 6 stars to me. The brisket just melts you don't even need a knife. Their sauces are amazing with the pulled pork and sausages. I've been to Texas and had their BBQ, this place puts some of their spots in place. I would highly recommend you coming to this place with an appetite.
