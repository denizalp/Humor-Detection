Great little soup and wrap place. I've tried every wrap there, and I like their special flank steak wrap the best, which they usually have. Most of the wraps contain similar things. (sweet potatoes, spinach). But the flank steak one has brie, and a nice sauce as well. For soups, they are all tasty, though they are mostly the pureed variety and I do like my soup chunky usually. I like when it eats like a meal :) The corn chowder with crab soup was my fav. The butternut squash with pear was a distant second. The place gets busy at lunch, but if you go in the evenings it is quite dead and you can beat the rush.
