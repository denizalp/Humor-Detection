Loved all the dishes I had. Started with the pumpkin congee and youtiao (deep fried bread) . The bread was so doughy, chewy, and very addictive. I wanted to order another plate, but my husband ordered other entrees so had to contain myself. Their house chili sauce and deep fried bread make a good combo.\n\nThe entrees we ordered came out all at once. We ordered  the fried bean curd, deep fried sea bass, and the salt and pepper squid. These were also very delicious. Especially the sea bass, it was crispy on the outside, but the sea bass was perfectly moist and not oily on the inside. Definitely getting this again.
