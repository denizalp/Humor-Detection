After spending the early afternoon at the Charlotte Museum of History, my husband and I found Lang Van nearby. (We ran into another group that just finished the museum there as well. I'm sure that happens often.)\n\nSimilar to other reviews, the outside of the building is very plain. However, as we walked in there are decorations of bamboo sticking up around the tables and it was open and bright. We received a warm greeting.\n\nThe menu is a bit overwhelming because they offer over 130 items to choose from. Some dishes (mainly vegetarian) were just under $10, while many dishes were $11 to $15. We ordered #2 Summer roll for an appetizer and the Green beans and tofu (based on a prior review and it was a recommendation of our server). \n\nThe Summer roll was great! Just enough for us to both try one. The dipping sauce was delicious. The green beans and tofu was very good. I'm not a big fan of a lot of onions, so I had to pick around them in this dish. The tofu was great. The portion was enough for us to share and we were very full at the end. \n\nWe received a lot of attention and our glasses of water never ran dry! The little cookies at the end (when we got the bill) were a nice little treat...just the right amount of sweet. We will definitely return over and over again so we can begin to try more of their many dishes.
