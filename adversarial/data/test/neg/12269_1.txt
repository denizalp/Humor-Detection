They have a large selection of flavors and even had a few ice cream flavors, including light butter pecan. I didn't try the ice cream so not sure how it is here. I got the strawberry yogurt and it was really good. They have a wide variety of toppings as well, candy, crushed cookies, and fruit. The fruit was fresh, and the topping area was clean unlike some places you go and it's just a mess with everything mixed up. The place was also pretty clean, and good customer service.
