Consistently disgusting, stale, rotten and unsanitary. Maybe get a bagel here if you're in a pinch, but I would not recommend anything more. Over the course of the past year, I ordered three different salad options (prepackaged, yuck) and they were all nasty. I received one today and it had a HAIR in it. Almost barfed. Also, the \"bread\" that came with it was hard as a rock. \n\nMy husband ordered a sandwich from here today and the tomatoes were rotten. How on earth this place stays in business is beyond me. This is why we need to minimize crappy franchises like this. A smaller business would never survive, trying to sell this garbage. \n\nAfter giving too many chances to this Panera, I will never come here again.
