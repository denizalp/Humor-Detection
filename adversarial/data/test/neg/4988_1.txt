Praise the lord!  There is a fast(ish) food restaurant near(ish) Crowfoot that serves a decent veggie burger!  I've already been to Smashburger three times, each time having their Spicy Baja Black Bean Burger with a side of smash fries (and on my last visit I also indulged in a milkshake as I had a 50% off coupon).  The veggie burger here is no imitation meat product- it's a handmade patty that is falling apart full of black beans- get it signature style with pepper jack cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, onion, spicy chipotle mayo and jalape√±os on a spicy chipotle bun, or use it in place of the meat in one of their other burgers, like mushroom swiss or avocado club.  Skip the plain fries and opt for the same-price smash fries instead- they are tossed with rosemary, olive oil and garlic.\n\nThe three times I've visited I've taken my food to go, as I'm ashamed to be seen in a fast food restaurant (yeah, yeah...), and they do a great job of packaging the food so that it stays in perfect condition.  We're talking plastic hamburger cases and poutine with the wet ingredients packaged separately.  Dine-in looks nicer than most fast-food places; maybe one day I'll overcome the shame!
