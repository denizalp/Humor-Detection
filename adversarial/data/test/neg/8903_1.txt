I was a little hesitant to head in, since a bistro inside a convenience store isn't generally a sign of good food.\n\nWow was I ever wrong! I had an iced latte and a wrap, and it was beyond amazing. The owner was so extremely friendly, and you can tell they take pride in the food they serve. \nI thought getting a little chocolate with my meal was such a fantastic touch too!\n\nShame I don't live closer or else I'd be there daily.
