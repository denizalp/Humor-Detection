I love having somewhere on the Danforth to get good quality tea.  The owners are really sweet and know their tea; they're always happy to make recommendations or just have a chat.  The food is great; it's good quality, consistently well made, and inexpensive, and Tsaa is pretty much the only place to get a good sandwich in the area.  The only downside is that they have a small kitchen and when they get crowded, (which is often,) the food can be a bit slow coming out.  I particularly like the avocado buschetta bagel and the french toast.  They are guaranteed to have a tea for whatever mood you're in, and the one time I tried the coffee (why get coffee when you can get tea?) it was also very good quality (and I'm quite picky about coffee.)  You can't go wrong!  A personal recommendation: they serve hot chocolate steeped with any tea of your choice: there is a cinnamon black tea (I forgot the exact name) which makes the best hot chocolate I've ever tasted.  I guarantee you won't be disappointed :)
