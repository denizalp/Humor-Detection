In town for a week and have already been twice. Super friendly service and delicious food at a good price. We got the chicken pot pie, which was done perfectly with flaky crust and lots of veggies. On another occasion we treated ourselves to a chocolate croissant and coffee. Best coffee we've had in tempe. Do yourself a favor and support this awesome business, I hope they are around for a long time.
