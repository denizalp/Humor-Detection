I have been a customer of Knibbe for 5 years and have spent approximately $3500 for repairs.  I have a 2009 Matrix with 240,000 km.  Last week my clutch broke and I had the AMA tow it to Knibbe for an estimate.  Knibbe advised that I needed a whole new clutch system at the cost of $3500.  I called Auto Expert and for the same work quoted me $2400.  Last Friday I called Knibbe and advised I was taking my business elsewhere and made arrangements for my car to be picked up by AMA on Monday.  Monday they sent the AMA away and I had to have two additional conversation for them to release my car.  It was towed Tuesday morning and by the afternoon Auto Expert called to advise that they needed to adjust the linkage under the dash, it would be ready the next day.  So for checking the clutch operation, repairing and adjusting the linkage under the dash, oil and filter change, lube chassis and check all fluids, lights, belts, hoses and tire pressure, I drove away for $315.00.  Very happy Auto Expert customer. :)
