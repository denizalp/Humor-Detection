Table is amazing.  My parents always take me here when I'm visiting.  Jeff and Fish always go the extra mile to make sure we are happy.  This  past Friday Jeff made a special dish my mom requested, Lobster Mac and Cheese, and it was absolutely delicious!  They put a lot of effort into creating a diverse bar menu that has something for everyone.  I'd highly recommend Table to anyone.  Check it out!
