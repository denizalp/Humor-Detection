Such a wonderful restaurant if you want a larger meal for lunch or dinner. The food is really flavorful, and is a nice mix between American and Peruvian style. My favorites are the huge chicken quesadilla, and the massive chicken salad. Though \"salad\" is a rough description of this behemoth. Tons of chicken and steak fries on top of it, and then a mountain of cheese. Simply wonderful. And the green chili sauce makes everything better, and can clear out your sinuses.
