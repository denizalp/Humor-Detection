I have to say thanks to my fellow Yelpers for their reviews about Tazza as they were spot on. My friend and I ate lunch there and we experienced some great service, great food, and just enjoyed some Lebanese hospitality.  It felt almost like we were eating at their home and they wanted my us to enjoy and sample their great food, which we did. I had some falafel that came right out of the pan---Wow is the only thing I can say about them.
