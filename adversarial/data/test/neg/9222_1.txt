I went to the dealer initially to get an alignment after installing new control arms and shocks for my BMW E90. The dealer was really disappointing and didn't listen to anything I said. They ended up with out of spec data on the front and rear. Oskar here at Arrow was really nice and knowledgeable. I was able to talk to him before the alignment and tell him what I'm looking for in the car. He even showed me what he adjusted under the car. He was able to even out the camber and adjusted the toe accordingly, which the dealer failed to do.  I would take all my future cars here!
