My pug loves it here. So far she's been seen for an eye issue and a dental and we've seen nothing but amazing results. Lewis is always wagging her tail when we get into the office. The white board sign welcoming her was so cute. Nice touch. We never have to wait long and the prices are so reasonable. My dog is my daughter and it feels nice that I can trust her with Dr. Cruz and staff! :))
