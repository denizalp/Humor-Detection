Everytime I have come here, I have left with the \"I will never be back\" attitude. Yet again, Canyon 49 has shown me why I always say that to myself. The pretzel bites are greasy and flavorless, and the cheese the come with it is basically water. I ordered a Bacon Lettuce and Tomato sandwich, and had to ask for lettuce on it because it doesn't come with lettuce??????? Not only that.. but when I got the sandwich, it came with spinach. This is embarrassing as a GCU student. I wish my school was better in the public eye rather than a joke.
