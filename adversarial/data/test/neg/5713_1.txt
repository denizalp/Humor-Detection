Integrity, honesty, and great communication are a few of the words, just off the top of my head, that I would use to describe Eric and the Super Junk crew.  Recently, after years of neglect, I took a weekend and gutted my entire backyard (you would be amazed at the stuff I found back there) and was able to do so with a smile, knowing that Super Junk would be by on Tuesday to cart all the debris away. They showed up on schedule, finished the job, and my makeshift dump site is cleaner now than when I started the project.  When you choose Super Junk, what you are really choosing is peace of mind....and, in this day and age, it is a rare occurrence that you can say that about a company.
