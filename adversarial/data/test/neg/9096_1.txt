The cakesters are extremely, extremely sweet. The first few bites are always delicious, but then it's a bit too much to eat all by yourself. They also have vegan options, which are really moist and delicious. My only complaint about the vegan cakesters, is that in the frosting you can feel the texture of the sugar- as if the sugar is not incorporated completely. \nThe staff is not the most friendly. They always seem kind of bored and distracted- as if they don't want to be there. They're not rude, but definitely could work on improving their customer service.
