Ordered delivery from Delicias today for lunch as I work in downtown and my co-workers and I are always looking for new places to eat the deliver.  We were so happy we stubled upon this place via yelp.  When I called in our order the man who took the order was friendly but I have to admit we were a little afraid that he didn't understand where our office was located.  Well 45 minutes later we had a delivery guy show up with our food and menus.  The food was so good.  My co-worker ordered a Carne asada Taco and chips and salsa and I ordered a carne asada burrito.  We both agreed the meat was good and not fatty and it was seasoned well. We are so happy we found a new place that we can order from. :)
