Definitely go! Delicious food, burgers were incredible and fries are a variety of waffle, shoe string and crinkle, which was a cool touch... Seasoning was amazing on them, too! Pretty pricey for a lunch of burgers and beers, but I'd say it's worth it. We went around 1pm and our food came out super quick! I'd go back!
