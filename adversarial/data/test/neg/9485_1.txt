Just got my nails done about two weeks ago. The color selection was huge and both my mani (shellac) and pedi (regular polish) are still on with no chipping or lifting. The customer service was also fabulous and everyone was so attentive. I will definitely be back! \nAlso, when I was there the outside big sign still says Q nails, but the sign in the window does say Evelina's Nails.
