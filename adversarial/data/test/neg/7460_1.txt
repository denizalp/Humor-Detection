If I can give a zero star I would! I have always taken our vehicles to AJ's auto. In the past the prices were fair and they did good work. Of course those were smaller jobs and fixes. I then took my truck to them for a \"New\" engine and it cost me 6k for a 2003 Toyota Tacoma engine. About 6 months After getting the engine I called to tell them that there was white smoke coming out of the tailpipe and it would sometimes rattle and lose power while pouring out smoke from the tailpipe. He told me that does not help him and I need to bring the truck in. I did, only to be told that they couldn't find anything wrong with it. So I took the truck home and the problem persisted. Fast forward 2 1\/2 Year's. That rattling noise came back stronger than ever and the truck finally stopped working. Only to be told by another mechanic that the engine has a hard knock and certain pistons were not firing and so on and that it would require the engine to be pulled apart and a new engine would more than likely be needed. He was also surprised that the engine used was a cheaper model and when he found out what I paid he was floored. Not just him, but also another mechanic at a completely different shop. He even quoted me a cheaper price for an original rebuilt motor for a much cheaper price. When I called AJ's to see if there was a warranty. I was told that the warranty had expired. The reason I am writing this is because after I got the new motor and experienced problems with it, I was basically told there was nothing wrong and now that it doesn't work I am being told the warranty expired. Then I am told by 2 different mechanics from 2 different shops that I paid way too much. Then I find out that the problem of the smoke coming out of the tailpipe was coolant related and ultimately the engine overheated. Why couldn't they figure this out? I also told them I was losing oil and it meant that I was putting in oil every few weeks. Wish more could've been done and they really dug deeper when I brought the truck back in after the engine swap that cost 6k. Needless to say, we will be taking our vehicles to another mechanic that we can depend on.
