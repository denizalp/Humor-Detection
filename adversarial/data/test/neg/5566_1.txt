I recently moved from Queen Creek and went to a fabulous car wash.  I have been trying not to compare Cobblestone on Arizona to the car wash that I just left so I waited three months to write this review to be accurate.  \n\nPros: \n\nI do enjoy the convenience of this car wash being close and quick. The tire shine is awful and my wheels were dirtier coming out than going in.  I had to spend allot of time trying to get it off after every car wash.  Spoke to a gentleman and he was very nice and removed it off my plan, apologized and stated they were trying different products to help with this.   I enjoyed being listened to and helped in such a friendly manner.  They do give a wet cloth before your wash so you can have a towel if you forgot yours.   They also have great hours!  7 am to 8 pm, awesome! \n\nI love the vacuums on both sides of the car and compressed air to dry! \n\nCons:\n\nThis place is dirty and has trash everywhere.   There are young kids who are working there and they just stand around waiting for a \"newbie\" to come and sign them up.   I realize it is the patrons who are trashing up the place when they clean out their vehicles and don't take the time to pick it up as they should, but when you work at a car wash that is one of the job responsibilities, pick up the trash.   Again, I am trying not to compare to my previous car wash, which experienced the same problems, but they had their employees walking around with a bucket picking it up.   The other day I was there I got out of my car and it smelled like the dump.  I gagged, got back in my car and moved it.   It smelled the same and I had to leave.   It looked (and obviously smelled) like the trash had not taken out the day before.   Before leaving I looked around and all the employees were standing waiting for new customers.   \n\nI also feel the air freshener they hand out with the wet towel is useless, I throw them away every time.  \n\nThere is not a lot of shade when drying your car. They have the blue triangle shaped tarps that don't provide a lot of shade.   I wish they had complete covered drying area like my old car wash to help with water spots and the heat of the summer sun.  \n\nWhen the young kids are waving you into the car wash they look miserable, never happy, never a smile, just miserable.   Then they are supposed to spray down the front of your car and loosen up dirt and debre but they barely spray to make a difference, they also seem lethargic (nice way to say lazy, or sleeping with their eyes open).  I  have been sprayed twice, lightly, because they wait too long to give the towel and these automatic windows only move so fast.   Between the trash and the miserable looking young employees I don't feel like they are welcoming their customers.    With these car washes almost popping up every other block you would think they would care a little more.  \n\nSo the only benefits to this car wash is closeness, because I don't want to drive more than 5 minutes, and the hours of business.
