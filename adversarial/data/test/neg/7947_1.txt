800 degrees is authentic Neapolitan pizza cooked in wood fired ovens.  You can select from their list of pizzas or create your own.  They also offer salads, appetizers, desert and alcohol.  I can't comment on anything but the pizza but the two times I visited, the crust we perfectly cooked and came out quickly.\n\nThis is not a sit down service establishment.  It is very good fast pizza in a very casual atmosphere.  The pizzas are slightly larger than a personal pizza but not enough for two.  Prices start at about $14.00.  On my next I will be sure stop by and venture into the Burrata and tomato salad appetizer.
