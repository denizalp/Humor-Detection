I'm a firm believer in second chances, and although it has taken us about a year to come back, we're glad we did. And we attribute our satisfied experience to the staff--and based on our last experience there, it was a surprise! \n\nFirst off, we were greeted by two young ladies in the front. Prompt. Polite. We were already impressed.\n\nOur server was Wes and can I just say, he was the easily the best server we've had yet. Everything he did seemed effortless and the attention to small details were not ignored. Very polite, patient, knowledgeable, prompt--he didn't miss a beat and he didn't overdo it by constantly coming to our table. It was a seamlessly perfect dinner. At Red Lobster. WHO KNEW?!\n\nWe chose the 4-course meal which was a good thing and a bad thing. Mostly good. The bad was based on the fact we couldn't get out of our seats. \n\nWe started off with soup: spicy chicken tortilla and New England clam chowder. Not out of this world, but still good and perfect complement to the mini-blizzard going on outside.\n\nI had the shrimp and scallop linguini; rich and creamy but it was a perfect portion. I didn't feel like it was an overwhelming amount. Thank goodness because I ate the entire thing and I feel no guilt! =)\n\nMy boyfriend had the wood-grilled chicken with portobello wine sauce. That was also a nice portion, and the green beans were well-seasoned. We could've eaten an entire plate of that with no problem. I didn't get a chance to taste the chicken but he took it home and ate it for a late-dinner. No complaints from him as far as I know.\n\nDesserts were a triple-chocolate brownie a la mode and caramel cheesecake. RICH. RICH. RICH. Good gracious--what a way to top off the meal. At first I was a little annoyed by the small portion, but as soon as I took a bite, I was so glad they were that size. I think my pants would've hated me. \n\nHuge kudos to the management and staff (especially you, Wes!) for such a great experience. We were already having a somewhat off night and we took a chance to come eat here again, hoping it wouldn't be like the first time. Not even close.\n\nAnd I know the exterior was changed but I could swear the inside was remodeled as well. It just didn't seem like previous experiences at other Red Lobster locations where I felt like I was on a fishery boat. Regardless, two thumbs up!
