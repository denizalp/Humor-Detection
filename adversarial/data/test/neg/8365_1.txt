I have been living out of hotels and moving around since April of 2009 so I have seen my fair share of hotels.  I stayed at this particular Candlewood for over six months and I was actually sad to leave.\n\nCustomer Service- To me customer service either makes or breaks a place.  The staff here is exceptional in this area.  They call and leave a message in your room when you have mail to pick up, there is always someone readily available to help at the front desk, and they resolve any issues quickly.  During my stay here the dishwasher stopped working. They had someone there first thing the next day to install a brand new one.  I always looked forward to talking with the staff members every day, especially the girls at the front desk.  During my stay there I really felt at home.\n\nFacilities- Okay, so you shouldn't go in expecting the Hilton.  As far as appearance goes it's really a no frills kind of place.  But it has all of the essentials and they keep everything very clean and well-stocked.  The pool is open 24\/7 and also has a hot tub.  I really took this for granted during my stay because I didn't realize just how rare it was to have a pool with 24\/7 access. After a really hot Phoenix day there was nothing nicer than grilling a good dinner on the outdoor patio, jumping in the pool and enjoying an ice cold margarita (not provided by the hotel of course).  Their exercise room is one of the nicest I have seen out of all the Candlewood Hotels I've stayed it, based on variety.  They have 2 treadmills, an eliptical, a bike, a stair climber, a floor mat, an ab machine and a weight machine.  Everything is well laid out and kept clean.  There is a water fountain and they provide towels and santizer to wipe down the machine.  The laundry room has everything you need...although you want to try to do your laundry before peak times.  There are rude and impatient guests who will throw your clothes out of the machines even before they have finished their cycle. (Pet peeve!)  \n\nAdded bonus...this hotel is next to a TGI Fridays and an AMAZING seafood restaurant, Pappadeaux.  So, if you want a comfortable extended stay hotel, stay at this Candlewood.  And be sure to tell the girls at the front desk Tina Z said hi! :)
