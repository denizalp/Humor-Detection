Quite the dive bar.  Good beer selection, super casual atmosphere, and the best dogs in Cleveland. They have at least 50 different things to put on top so it's totally customizable. Get whatever you want as long as you get the fried egg. So good. \n\nThey also have a bunch of random event lineups, from mathmaticians talking theory, to classical music concerts, polka, experimental electronica and more. Find something eclectic that suites you! \n\nIf you wander in and there is nothing special going on upstairs, they have shuffleboard and some other games downstairs
