I highly recommend joining Ageless Karate. Myself and my two daughters (age 8 and 5) have signed up and have been attending classes several times a week now for the past 4 months and we couldn't be happier. \n\nSensei Joe is an amazing teacher and a great motivator. What really sealed the deal for me was how well he connects with his students of all ages. All in all you can tell he genuinely cares for the well being of his students. \n\nThe cost is reasonable and it's even better for family's. How the school handles belt testing is superior to most karate schools as well.\n\nAgain I highly recommend checking out Ageless Karate and see for yourself.
