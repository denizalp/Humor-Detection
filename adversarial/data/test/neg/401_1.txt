Good quality Asian desserts, in a trendy style space. Very modern, all black decor. \n\n- Mango sago: perfect sweetness level, very creamy and rich.\n- Green tea shaved ice: my favourite; it was very rich and the cream green tea sauce to pour over was amazing!\n- Green tea waffle: Great mix of fresh waffles, green tea ice cream, red beans, and cream! \n- Drinks are also yummy, I tried the Royal mango one and it was like mango heaven!
