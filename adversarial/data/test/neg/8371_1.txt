I realize this is not the original Strip District location and might lack in charm somewhat.  However, when you live any place that does not have a Primanti Brothers nearby, charm takes a back seat to food.  And the food here is good.  \n\nThey have pizza, salads, and more conventional sandwiches, if you wish. But why would you wish?  This is the place to order the prototypical Primanti Brothers sandwich: meat, cheese, cole slaw, and fries all between the two slices of excellent bread.   Be warned that the sandwiches are huge and thick, so it takes some effort to eat them.\n\nService is quite speedy.  The noise factor can be high - I had to ask if they could turn down the music a bit so that we could hear each other.  They complied, but the volume slowly crept up.  Not a deal breaker - I would eat here again.
