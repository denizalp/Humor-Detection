Wow!  Best way to describe this place.  My wife and I stopped for lunch one afternoon.  Still thinking about the food.  It was phenomenal!  Shrimp and grits - awesome.  Fried chicken and biscuit - awesome.  Banana pudding - awesome.  Staff was attentive and knowledgeable.  Highly recommend stopping in.  Note: we had tried making dinner reservation the day of and they were pretty well booked up for the night.  Would recommend making reservations sooner if you want dinner.
