We came here for the first time a couple day ago and the food was delicious but One of their Tom yum soup was a little too salty. \n\nI was a little unhappy about the service because none of the server come and check on us how we were doing even though I see them checking other table a couple times. One of the server came and fill up our water without saying any word. As a restaurant owner, I don't want my employee treating our customers differently by their apparent.
