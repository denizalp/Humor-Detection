I tried this place for breakfast, lunch and dinner. \n\nThe service was prompt and friendly. \n\nThe music was relaxing and not loud. \n\nThe food exceeded our expectations - it was delicious, reasonably priced and nicely presented.\n\nI would recommend this place and will come back next time I visit MTL.
