New to the area and wanted real diner food. We came to the Landmark not knowing anything about the place......WOW......Huge menu and food was fantastic and so much of it. We're used to paying NY prices so $15 per meal was a steal and plenty of leftovers.\n\nThe wait staff was good and knew the answers to our questions. We have been a few times now and plan on trying it for breakfast very soon. As for Guy being there.....Who cares....he's a stiff unlike this place.
