My boyfriend and I stopped in on a Sunday night for a date night. It's just off the strip, so it's more expensive than most nearby restaurants but it's also classier. The restaurant itself is huge and quite beautiful. The menu was also very large. Our server was nice and the speed of service was just right. While we probably wouldn't make it a regular date night, we will certainly be back for special occasions.
