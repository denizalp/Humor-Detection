I am obsessed with TRISH!! She's always done an amazing job with my mani\/ pedi and I never complain. She was over at Diamond Nails and have moved over to Crystal Lash Lounge and Nail Bar and of course I followed and can see why she moved here. It's so cute and lovely and very peaceful. 5 STARS ALL THE WAY!! LOVE YA TRISH!
