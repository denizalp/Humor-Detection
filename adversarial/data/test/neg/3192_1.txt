This issue is with the tech and Jordan a supervisor. I was charging my new S7 Edge when I got a warning about the phone overheating. I tried to close the apps but the touchscreen was not working. I was able to reboot using the buttons. The phone came on with a green screen. I have insurance so I took it into this store. I told them not to wipe the system for any reason as I had vacation pictures I needed. Tech calls me over and tells me phone needs to be replaced. He then tells me he wiped the system. Thanks, \nI called the next day and asked for the Supervisor. I am told his name is Jordan but he is at lunch and he will call me back. After a few hours I call back and Jordan answers the phone. I mentioned that I had left a message for him earlier. He acted surprised and asked who I spoke to. However, without any further information, he later tells me his tech determined there was water damage and I would have to file a claim. How does he know who I am if he didn't get the message? I asked him to do a actual water damage test and not just rely on a visual inspection. He said his techs report was final. I have been with Sprint since 2002 and surprised to get this type of attitude.
