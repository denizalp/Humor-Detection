I feel like most of this has been said before...but there is nothing like watching a friend try the brisket from Little Miss BBQ the first time. Meat butter.\n\nI ordered a 5lb brisket and 5lb pork shoulder for a birthday party. When I showed up at Little Miss, they sliced it fresh for me, had all of the fixings boxed up and ready and of course gave me a couple sample tastes. On my walk out the owner gave me a tour of the smoker and a couple or serving tips. \n\nFortunately I ate a slice as I set up for the party because that was the last I saw of the brisket that night. I saw a friend going for his third trip through and asked if his wife had one plate yet...his response, \"this is too good to share.\" \n\nThe food stands up on it's own but the overall vibe of the place and the owner's attention to detail (and customer service) could make you overlook a 4.5 star meal, but after a couple of visits there, I'm not sure they are even capable of putting out anything below five starts.
