How do you put the right star amount on a mixed experience? We actually enjoyed the food. The burgers were tasty, and the fries were exceptional. My son also got a banana milkshake, that he enjoyed.\n\nUnfortunately... he also came away with what we assume to be food poisoning. Stomach was upset almost immediately after eating, then spent the day in bed and in the bathroom.\n\nI understand food prep is a tricky business, and there are going to be instances like this, even in the most sanitary conditions, but it certainly makes me wary of a second visit.
