When we walked in, it was pretty slow.  \nBut the burgers were great.  The staff was attentive and the milkshakes were tasty.  The mushroom cheeseburger came with fresh onion and lettuce. The French fries were done to perfection, and the food came out fast.  My wife had the meatball soup, and it was so large my daughter and her shared it.\nPricing was extremely reasonable.\nDefinitely worth returning!
