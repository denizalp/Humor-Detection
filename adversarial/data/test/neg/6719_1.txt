Stopped in this morning for an early breakfast and was happy not to see a line as I was in a hurry. I was seated immediately and then the ship slowed, waiting 15 minutes to order after I had my coffee while 2 other tables who arrived at least 10 minutes after me had already ordered. The place is mostly empty, thank God for my server as he is not a multitasker
