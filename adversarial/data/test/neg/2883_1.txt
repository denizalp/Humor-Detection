Ima just keep it real I don't want anyone to go through what I went through. The Scorpion drink tastes like shit. When I talked to the waitress who brought out the drink, she said they don't take drinks off the bill even if you don't like it. I ordered it frozen, it tastes like rotten orange juice. Very bitter, didn't even drink it at all. What a waste, horrible customer service as well. Our waiter had an attitude.\n\n\n\nHOWEVER...... the food is bomb I ordered wings. 5 stars on the wings and fries.
