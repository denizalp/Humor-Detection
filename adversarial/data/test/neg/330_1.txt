I actually love RC Willey and have bought from them many times. However, I have not had one delivery that I didn't have to call back and have something fixed.  This latest time was a washer and dryer delivery. The first time I used the dryer it was so wobbly and the door opened the wrong way. I called the store and they had another crew out the next day to fix the problem.  In that way the store is great. But they need to have their delivery people more responsible the first time out.
