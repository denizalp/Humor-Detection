For a long time, I wanted to try the lobster spaghetti here & I finally did! It was good but  not as delicious as I had imagined. Also the portion was smaller than some pictures I had seen on Yelp. I'm not sure if they reduced their portions... Overall the ambiance of the restaurant was cool but I was disappointed by the food. The rabbit croquettes were ok but lacked rabbit taste. The bbq porc plate with peaches was ok. The meat had pieces of fat which isn't pleasant. The peach and smoky bbq taste was good though. By far the best part of the meal were the desserts!!! Enjoy!
