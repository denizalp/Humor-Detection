Just discovered this 'cafe' and were pleasantly surprised. Malaysian hospitality and great home-style cooking. We took 3 different dishes with our party and will certainly come back to check other dishes. All portions were filling at a price of 7 dollar each. The ambiance is simple and could have been just transposed from Malaysia. The menu is limited, but every item is worth a try and -in our experience- clearly authentic.\nService is perfect and extremely friendly. Highly recommendable!
