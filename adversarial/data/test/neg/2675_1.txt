Came on a Sunday afternoon and there were a few other groups but it wasn't too crowded. \n\nGreat games including all of the usual suspects and some newer stuff. \nReally good prize selection with reasonable redemption value. Place was clean and well maintained and the two staff members were helpful and friendly.\n\nLove that they still have tokens and physical tickets along with self serve ticket counter machines so you get the satisfaction of watching the machine dispense tickets but don't have to carry them around until the end.
