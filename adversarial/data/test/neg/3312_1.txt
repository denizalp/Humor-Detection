Middle top range sushi, great prices.  Prefer to get take-out as the seating space is crazily over-crowded and squished together and there is usually a long line-up out the door with people waiting to sit.  Also, you get a 10% discount if you get take-out.\n\nLove the sushi, love the rolls, especially \"Casa Loma\" and the bento box deal is fantastic, especially with salmon - there is enough food for two people.
