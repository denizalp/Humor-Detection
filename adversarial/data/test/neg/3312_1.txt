If you can make peace with the fact that you're going to pay casino floor prices for this food, it's really a good option for lunch.\n\nI had a simple lunch- a club sandwich which was fresh and delicious and served with fresh greens with a nice vinaigrette dressing. \n\nI would definitely eat here again. The service was fine (and it was super busy during the lunch rush).
