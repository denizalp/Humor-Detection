Coming from NYC I thought it would be next to impossible to find a decent pizza place here in the mid-west.  I was wrong.  Casa's pizza can stand toe to toe with any pizza place from NYC.  My family and I have been ordering from here since we left the Big Apple and relocated here in Aspinwall.  Even my mom from Sicily was impressed by how good the pizza is.  That is no easy feat.
