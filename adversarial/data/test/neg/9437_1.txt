I've never had Ethiopian food, but this was a good experience. The restaurant doesn't look like much on the outside, but that definitely changes once you see the indoor decor. I enjoyed the authentic food that was provided here, my order was the whole fish with rice and salad. I don't know what that sauce is called but it had a nice spicy kick to it. All of the food was delicious and I'm glad I stopped by.
