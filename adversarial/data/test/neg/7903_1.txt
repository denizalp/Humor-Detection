Had a wonderful dinner there last weekend with a friend who enjoyed the restaurant as much as I did.  \nWaiters- went out of their way to make it a great dinner. Brought 3 types of salad dressings when I couldn't decide on what I wanted.\nwedge typesalad- just ok, wouldn't order it again.\nceaser salad- just ok, my friend woudn't order it again.\nbread basket- neither one of us like it and we LOVE bread.\nmashed potatoes- very good\nfilet mignon- WOW, it was great, lots of flavor!  Went to 3 restaurants for steak when we were in Vegas, this was the best one!  Ordered medium-rare, and it was perfect. \natmosphere- pretty, a little loud with the music playing but it was 10:00 p.m. and it is right next to a night club so that was pretty much the clientele.
