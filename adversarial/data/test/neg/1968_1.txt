This place is awesome! I attended my first aerial hoop class two Tuesdays ago and loved it! Class size was no more than 10, students were friendly and talkative, instructor Katie is super nice and helpful. Instruction is given in a mixed combination of individual and group lessons. She pinpoints what each student needs to work on to succeed and is encouraging. Exercise and stretching is emphasized both during the beginning and ending of class.\n\nIt's very easy to sign up (call and reserve or do it online) and you get to take a free session for your birthday!!!!\n\nI cannot wait to return!
