This place is terrible. They clearly don't know what they are doing. Drive to Phoenix or LA. I asked Service department to fix a rear door in my Range Rover sport. It took them three days and they fix the wrong door.\nIn the process they changed the sync of my key \nFob so I only have one key that works the doors and the ignition.\nI was told to just drop by in like a get my other key to work. This is totally faults. I tried to call them to make an appointment and they're too busy to sync my key then I tried to call the manager and left message for the manager and he will not call me back.
