The Venetian has always been my favorite Las Vegas hotel attraction and earlier this year I was lucky enough to stay here for a bachelorette weekend. \n\nFirst off, the lobby is just elegant. Something about walking through with my rolling luggage amongst the marble floors and painted archways made me feel like a million bucks. And it just kept getting better. Once in our suite I discovered 2 plush queen size beds each with a beautiful lounge chair at the foot, a sunken living room with an L-shaped couch, desk area AND dining table, and THREE flat screen TVs! One in the living room, one in the bedroom and a bonus one in the bathroom!  The bathroom was the best..with 6 ladies having to doll up each night to go out, we could all do our hair\/make-up comfortably without having to sit on eachothers laps or rub elbows! The bathroom has a separate sink area (2 sinks), vanity area (with seat), toilet room, glass shower stall, and deep tub. Oh and ofcourse, double doors leading to a full length mirror, marble floors and excellent lighting. It was every girl's dream. \n\nWe were able to try out the Spa and at $150 for a one hour massage, you get an experience you wish could last forever. I work hard for my money so once in a while I like to get a little (ok a lot!) pampered. The fluffy white robes, the attentive spa attendants, the complimentary juice and fruits, the soothing voice of the masseuse, the MASSAGE itself...all left me with a huge perma-smile for the rest of the day.  I cannot wait to go back! \n\nOther great perks at the Venetian besides the beauty and central location - home of Tao Restaurant and Nightclub (my favorite vegas nightspot!), lots of high end shopping and adjacent to the new Palazzo Hotel, a foodcourt if you need something quick or if on a budget, and ofcourse...the GELATO in the middle of the shopping area is something you cannot miss!\n\n*sigh*...my heart beats for the Venetian....
