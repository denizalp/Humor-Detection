Thank goodness for Beer Bistro rescuing my night and the aggravated first impression of Toronto that I was getting.  Not only were they serving food late and open until 2am, they had just the atmosphere that I wanted--moderately lively but not overbearingly bustling or loud, like most places were around that time.  Besides, the beer and food menus both enticed me.  (Chicagoans:  think of a roomier, hipper, less pretentious, and more menu-ambitious Hopleaf.)\n\nI loved the space, especially the high ceilings.  It was modern but also comfortable.  All of the staff that I encountered were top-notch and very friendly.  The hostess was nothing but cheery both before and after I changed my mind about sitting outside and asked her to hop back inside.  She gave me the perfect little table in the corner.  My server Jeff G. was spot-on as well, with the small exception that my water glass was left unfilled for most of my meal.\n\nOf course their specialty is beer (which technically would make them a brasserie), specifically the northern- and central-European and European-style varieties.  Of their 20 draughts and 110 bottles (yes, I counted), most are imports from Belgium, Germany, the Czech Republic, etc, and many others are local to Quebec and Ontario.  Most servings are in the $6-$7 range (for a half-litre or 300ml), and they also offer a sampling of three for $6--great for trying several kinds.  They group the beers on the menu by personality, such as sociable, bold, crisp, quenching, spicy, soothing, robust, contemplative, etc.  \n\nAll the food came out with a classy presentation and tasted great to boot.  I started with the bistro salad, which included shredded beets and a white-beer\/truffle vinaigrette; and the bacon-wrapped shrimp--five very large prawns wrapped in \"bacon\" (not the crispy American kind), with dollops of an interesting sweet\/spicy sauce on the side of the dish.  Let's say B+ on both of those dishes.\n\nThe Berkshire pulled pork primanti was huge--just the sandwich fillings were the size of my fist.  There was a generous portion of pulled pork, a wonderful multi-vegetable slaw, a few frites, and a slice of smoked gouda.  As a straight-up pulled pork sandwich, I have had better; but as a \"fancy\" version it really worked, especially the slaw.  A- on the sandwich.  Overall, I loved the food.  I skipped dessert in favor of a Leffe Brune.\n\nOne last note:  in the dining room and bar they have framed old beer advertisements (vintage and classy, not like modern beer mirrors and whatnot).  However, the men's room takes the cake:  above the urinals are flat-screen monitors showing old 50's and 60's TV commercials for long-lost beers such as Schmidt's, Duke's Golden, and Hudepohl.  What a brilliant idea and delightful touch.\n\nIf I lived in Toronto, this would be a regular spot and would probably get the fifth star (rare for me) after the second or third trip.  Apparently they also offer weeknight tastings, and Beer School is in the works.  I cannot recommend this place highly enough.
