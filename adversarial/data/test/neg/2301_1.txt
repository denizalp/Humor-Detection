My daughter wanted to go here after a friend mentioned they could do all these fancy designs and she wanted a British flag to honor the Olympics.  So I was a little nervous when I read the reviews becuase I am all about service (in case you haven't noticed from my other reviews).\n\nI was going to give them the benefit of the doubt becuase if you go to any nail shop in the Phoenix area that are run by Asian people, they are all the same. Never super good on their delivery.  \n\nWe were surprised.  They were friendly and our nails are so fun.  They did a great job on my daughter's request to put the British flag on her big toe.  They give you a little back message while your toes dry before putting on the pattern.  And they are no more expensive than any other nail salon that I've gone to.  Especially since they do these fun pattern.  Other nail salons will charge an extra $5 for a simple flower.  \n\nWe're going back - for sure.  Can't wait for Halloween to put some fun halloween pattern on my toes.  This is when it is nice to live somewhere hot and you wear flip flops the majority of the year.\n\nTip: they were super busy.  I made an appointment and got right in.  I did see one person who made an appointment with a specific person having to go with another nail tech.  Stil would recommend making an appointment.
