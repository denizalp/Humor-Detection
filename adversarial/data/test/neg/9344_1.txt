A good friend of mine kept inviting me to go with her to this restaurant, and I kept thanking her but declining. I don't like Thai food.\n\nBut then another friend of mine from work had her birthday lunch here, so I went, figuring there must be something I'd like.\n\nI ordered the sweet and sour chicken.\n\nI've been back several times since, and I still am amazed at how great their food is every single time. The chicken is lightly fried and moist, and mixed with the sauce it tastes heavenly.\n\nI've always had very good service every time I've dined here, and I have to admit that this specific restaurant has made me become more adventurous when it comes to trying new things. Once I tasted how good their dish was, it made me wonder what else I was missing out on by being so timid.
