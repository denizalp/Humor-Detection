My wife and I wanted to dive back into sushi after a bad experience at another location in the Valley. We went here with friends that recommended it. We ordered the California roll, philly roll and Las Vegas roll and all 3 were delicious!\n\nWe will not only go back here often but we'll continue to expand our sushi horizons because of how good this was.
