Yum. NCounter. \n\nI can't believe I've only been to this place once; my first time being last week. \n\nI always see NCounter while I'm browsing Yelp and think \"I need to try this place!\". So when I finally went to lunch with two of my girlfriends here, I was more than anxious to see what it was about. \n\nI brought my dog so we sat outside on the patio. The patio is a great size and was all shaded so it wasn't very hot. One of the workers even brought out a dog bowl of water for my dog which was really sweet. \n\nWe chatted over bloody mary's, mimosas, and bellinis for a couple of hours. I wasn't hungry at the time so I didn't' try any of the food, but my friend is somewhat obsessed with this place and says their food is amazing! \n\nThe only bummer is that this place closes early (I think 3). The patio started to shut down and I was surprised that they were closing. \n\nOverall, if you're near Mill and are looking to get breakfast or lunch, go here.
