This guy was awesome! We used them for a bachelor party a couple weeks ago and he did everything we asked of him and was flexible when we went over the time we reserved it for. A few days later we called him last minute to get a bus to bring people back from the reception, and even though he was booked out he had a bus for us at the venue within the hour. \nBesides the awesome customer service and clean buses, I have never heard of a cheaper rate in Las Vegas in the past 15 years.
