We dropped by without a reservation tonight for dinner. We were greeted nicely a were seated quickly. The restaurant is brightly lit, clean and very busy. The service was prompt and efficient. The 2 sushi chefs were remarkably fast and their presentation was fairly good...especially considering their speed. We didn't know it was an AYCE   place but decided to order a la carte anyway. They were out of my favourite - Hamachi - but that can happen so I gave them a pass on that but the other fish in the sushi was average at best. We also shared a teriyaki steak which was rubbery and substandard.  I guess the AYCE standard is more about quantity than quality so if you're looking for a lot of average food at a set price this is the place for you. If you're looking for excellence try elsewhere.
