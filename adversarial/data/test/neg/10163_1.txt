I was a member for 5 years, and agree with the first comment.  I canceled to join JCC.  I was not explained when I had canceled about a 30 day notice, and was charged again.  I called to fined out why, and the girl on the phone was extremely rude, blaming me for not remembering this from over 5 years ago, and hung up on me twice.  I was not yelling at her either.  Terrible way to treat a long time client, and not a great way to part company.  If you like being treated like this, go here!
