This place f*@^%!$ sucks. No line to wait in, no 'Hi i'll be with you after this customer'. So you Stand about waiting forever and then other people come in and they get helped before you. So I walked out, not waiting even longer for the same thing to happen. Trash customer service. And of course people are parasites and don't care if you haven't been helped and ask hey were you waiting or hey He was here first. Nope. When I called they weren't polite either and the prices they were throwing around are a joke as well. This is why I stick to buying online. \n\nNeeded a hose 4\" hose for my dirtbike's fuel line and they wanted $16 for it. That was a hell no, also looking to get a Banjo bolt for a quad but couldn't get any help with that because they obviously don't give a shit about their customers. Got the hose for free at Autozone. They normally charge about $2 for that type of hose too lol.
