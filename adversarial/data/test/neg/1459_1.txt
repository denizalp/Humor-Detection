Oh how I love this place!  There are soooo many spices that it may be a little overwhelming during your first visit.   Do not panic!  The staff are friendly and knowledgable so ask tons of questions. You can taste all spices before purchasing and their website has tons if recipes.  This is a great place for beginners and those that know their way around the kitchen.
