Highly disappointed. The food was a little pricey, the service of our food was slower than molasses. Server said they were backed up. Took almost an hour for some egg whites and biscuits n gravy. Not sure where someone got on here that their B&G were $2.99. Mine was 8.99 for 1 biscuit and 2 over medium eggs. Probably won't ever go back there again.
