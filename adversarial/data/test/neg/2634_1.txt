I recently discovered Nobu. I was trying to fulfill my sushi cravings. Loved their sushi! Delivery services were pretty quick! Their sushi was great! Not too much rice or tempura and the price is fairly reasonable. \n\nMy sushi rolls came with four different sauces but I had no idea which sauce was supposed to be with which roll. My only suggestion would be to label the sauces for deliveries and take outs!
