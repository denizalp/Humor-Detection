My husband brought me here for Mother's Day. He rented the whole salt cave for just us. I was expecting more of a sauna but it is not. You wear all your clothes and should probably wear socks as it's just room temperature inside. It was very nice. You can even taste the salt in the air. I've used salt saunas to aid in treating my bronchitis. I'm not sure about salt caves. But it was relaxing. \n\nWe also used the infrared sauna. It wasn't very hot. It said 133-130 degrees F but we hardly broke a sweat. It was just like sitting in a warm room. I wasn't so impressed with this. I know infrared doesn't get as hot as a regular sauna but if you're looking for a sauna to sweat, this isn't it. I'm sure it's good for some. It's just a personal preference. \n\nI had a massage also. Full body. It was very nice. I read reviews about poking hard in the shoulders in a painful way. She did do this. It was a little painful. I have zero pain in my back after though. So I imagine it was helpful in some way. No pain no gain. Nothing unbearable also. Everything about the massage besides that one uncomfortable part was amazing. Hands, feet, hot towels. She did such a good job I was sad she didn't massage my temples lol. The essential oils they used were very nice. Lots of lavender and peppermint. \n\nOverall we had a good experience here and will be coming again.
