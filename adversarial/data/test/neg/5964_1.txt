Don helped me and my husband with our taxes last year.  We felt he was very knowledgeable and competent, so I called him today to ask his advice about paying off a mortgage and rental property.  He offered very sound advice over the phone on a Friday afternoon without charging a dime!  We will definitely be keeping him as our tax advisor for as many years as he will be working.  Please don't retire soon, Don!
