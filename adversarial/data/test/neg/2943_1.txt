This was my second visit to Cafe Siena, not sure what happened to my first review but the first time was not that great.  The service here still needs some work.  We sat down and a lady came over and took drink orders.  When she came back with the drinks, someone in our party ordered wine but it never came.  When the waiter came we told him about not getting the wine, he called the lady over and asked her where the wine was to which her response was she was not told exactly what type of wine was wanted.  Everyone at the table looked at her as we all heard specifically what was ordered.  Obviously she just did not care enough to listen.\n\nOur food order was taken and the food came pretty fast and it actually was pretty good today except the wings, they were not appetizing at all and the entire plate was left.\n\nOur waiter never came back after the food came to check on drinks or any other needs.  He finally came back when we were done eating and dropped off the checks and disappeared again never asking if we wanted more to drink or anything else.\n\nNeedless to say one of the bills was wrong and we had to go to the register to ask them to find our waiter as we waited 10 minutes and he never came back.  He nor anyone else ever asked what the issue was with the wings nor did they care.\n\nThe management of this place seems to be interesting as you never see them either and it seems like everyone just does what they want.  We did not go there because we really wanted to, we were there for a conference and people needed something close to eat at because some had flights out.  \n\nWe were going to the hotel once a month and TGIF was a much better place but they are now closed so you have very limited choices for a quick bite.   Very sad.....
