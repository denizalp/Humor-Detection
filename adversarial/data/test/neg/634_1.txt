Rented a truck from here when I moved from Charlotte. I reserved the truck online. When I got there, the people they have working there are some questionable characters. Not exactly the epitome of customer service. The guy who helped me kind of brushed off some of my question. My experience was pretty quick and simple. But at the end they just hand you the keys and tell you to \"find the truck with the same number\" that are all parked in the back of the parking lot. How about you walk yourself out to the back of the parking lot and make note of which truck is which? For me when it comes to customer service, it's the little things that make the most difference. The people they hire are people you can tell are just there to collect a paycheck and do as little as possible.
