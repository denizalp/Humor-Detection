We decided to take our neighbors out and we decided on Olive Garden. After ordering we we're told that they ran out of bread sticks and just received a new order and we're baking them now. Bread sticks are a essential item with our soup and salad so I was a lil unhappy. We had our salad and enjoyed our conversation. Still no bread sticks. As we are enjoying our soup and salad they bring out our main course before we were even close to finished. Still no sticks. The waitress was very nice but you could tell she was overworked. I asked for my lasagna to go and when I get home it is not what I ordered. All in all I feel we didn't get what we payed for.
