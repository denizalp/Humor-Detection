Super friendly staff! From the moment that I walked in I was greeted by the manager and guided to my table promptly. Sarah, our server, was very cheerful and knowledgeable about the menu. She had great recommendations for us and was very good about checking on us and bringing coffee to our table. \n\nWe look forward to coming back soon!!!!
