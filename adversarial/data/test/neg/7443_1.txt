If you have a car while you're in town, definitely check this place out!\n\nWe ordered the meat combination plate, it comes with kalbi, teriyaki chicken, mean jun (meat omelette), macaroni salad and rice, wonton saimin and spam masubi... \n\nThe combination plate is great if you want a little of everything! All the flavors were right on and the meat jun was cooked perfectly!\n\nThe wonton saimin was really good, especially if you are in the mood for soup to help cure that hangover... the noodles were fresh and the wontons were really good, the skin wasn't too thick and the meat filing was good and generous!\n\nThe spam masubi was a little dry, it needed a little more teriyaki sauce or something, so I wouldn't waste stomach space on this. \n\nWhile we were there, it seemed as though EVERYONE ordered the jajangmyun (Korean wheat noodles in a black bean sauce... i will definitely be back to try that out!!
