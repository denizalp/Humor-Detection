Well where to begin: this place was a treat in every aspect from service to the food. Coming in the waiting staff are incredibly welcoming and were very helpful in explaining how to order. On top of that, they were very accommodating to my grandmother who is not a fan of sushi and recommended the Chicken Teriyaki which she loved. \n\nMoving onto the meal itself however. We got a combo of spicy Garlic edamame and Parmesan with flaming sauce which was unreal as an appetizer. We then moved onto the speciality rolls which were incredibly flavorful and we kept craving more. The Roller Coaster and Jackpot rolls were unreal and were chock full of flavor. \n\nTo end the owner had come by to ask how everything was and all in all from customer service to the food this restaurant was amazing and I can't wait to come back!
