We went for breakfast at Denny's, being the cupboards were bare, I ordered coffee and obv it was cracked as leaking , the waitress finally walked by and said I'll bring you more coffee I said No it's leaking and I don't want it, she brought our food after a long wait, I finally went for our bill and the other waitress asked and she said yeh take a coffe off , she said it leaked, well that pissed me off, then went to register handed her a hundred she whipped the receipt up and said do you want to put a t on the charge , I said No I just handed you a $100, oh yeh right. , I know I live in a Sr area but don't try to scam us , ugh no more Dennys, I wouldn't lie that a cup was leaking , what is wrong.  I took forever to get our meal, we live in Sun City Grand and  will not be going back, never saw her after order or once she sat it down, had to ask for bill, oh we also froze it was so cold in there asked to get it warmer said they couldn't change it, obv set for the staff not the clients
