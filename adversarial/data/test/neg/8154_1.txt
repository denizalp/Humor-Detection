Honestly, this place was Eden to locals when it first opened. Nowadays it's super bro-like and bathrooms are filthy. Service is below average but the premises themselves are \"okay\". \n\nThe games certainly make up for the lack of quality but I do wish the place was as awesome as it was when it first opened.
