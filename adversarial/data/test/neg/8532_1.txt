Always a good lunch time spot for a (mostly) quick \"to go\" lunch. The lunch time line is usually out the door but they work quick and the line moves along at a good clip. Seating available indoors and outside, plus the usual market square seating\/ambiance as well. Solid food and lots of combinations for your Greek food fix.
