This Bakery is my favourite for flavour of the breading and filling. Price is a bit higher but reflects quality. My only con would be they don't keep up with demand that great. \n\nRecommended:\n-fried pork dumplings: these are by far the juiciest and most flavourful filled ones sold among the chinatown bakeries.\n-pork floss bun:\nsoft sweet and salty floss with a soft fluffy light and sweet bun, nice!\n-all their little triangle shaped meat filled pastries. the flaky layers are nice, and the filling is meaty, not just flour.
