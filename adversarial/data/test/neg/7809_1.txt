I set an appointment to have my brakes done, both axles. I dropped the car off at 9:30 and told it would be 4-5 hours to complete.  After calling numerous times without being able to speak with a person, on  my last call, I told the person I would wait on hold to speak with the SA.  I was told that my vehicle would be ready in about 1 hour (this was at 2:30), since the vehicles ahead of me all got behind finishing up.  When I arrived at 3:30, the car had been ready since 3, no one called me to advise it was early.  They only did one axle, since the front pads were still at 50%, good for another 50K miles. So it took them 5.5 hours to do one only axle. Good thing I got there on time at my appointment in the morning, or I would have been w\/o my vehicle all day and not been able to work, since I drive for Uber.  If the work had been finished in 4 hours, I would have given 4 stars, but I expect reliability from a workplace and I don't think I got that today.  It should have been better.  I've been to the Chandler location in the past and it's about the same there. Mediocre.
