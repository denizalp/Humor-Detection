I love Susan Feniger so this was a must try for me. Although I didn't have a meal the margaritas were amazing...blood orange was my fave & the guacamole was huge & delicious. I even returned when we had friends visit us to have a margarita. I live in NM & know good & this is good. We will return for a drink again in the future. Our bartender was knowledgable & service was fast & friendly.
