I was in here today, and while the food was excellent, the server ruined the entire experience. Chrystal was rude and inattentive. We sat for many minutes before she walked by and said (with a grown) \"I'll be with ya'll eventually.\" After another 2-3 minutes she finally came to the table, by this time we had already decided what we were going to eat, so we gave her the whole order. She said she would put the order in and bring our drinks right back. She left for a few more minutes, came back and checked in with another table without our drinks. She then went to get our drinks. She checked in with us multiple times throughout our meal just in passing, and not acknowledging when we needed more drinks and forcing us to either put empty glasses to the end of the table or request them. About halfway through eating, she brought us the check, never inquiring if we would want dessert. When she came back 5-10 minutes later, we had long since finished eating and asked for 2 boxes. She brought the boxes and my 6 year old had decided to take her leftovers home as well, so we asked for a third, only for her to promptly roll her eyes at the table and walk away without acknowledging our request verbally. When she came back, a member of my party outstretched her hand to take the box and begin packaging the leftovers, when Chrystal looked right at her and put the box on the end of the table, just out of her reach. After the check was paid and we stood up to leave, I witnessed Chrystal do a celebratory dance that we were leaving. Very visible and inappropriate. I understand that her shift was probably over, but I am disgusted that this is the way that servers are allowed to act in this establishment and will NOT be returning.
