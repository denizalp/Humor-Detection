About 9 months ago I started taking classes just for fun...to learn something new and now I am hooked!  I highly recommend the studio. The instructors are very strong teachers, friendly, and personable. They meet you at the level you are at and then help you get better.  Dancing can be done as a couple or as a single person. Dancing allows you to exercise your body and your mind.
