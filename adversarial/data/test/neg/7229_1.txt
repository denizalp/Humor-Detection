My husband and I had our annual pre-Thanksgiving dinner at Hank's on Wednesday, November 25 with my mother, our two sons and one of their girlfriends.  We sat in Margot's section.  The reason for my note is twofold:  (1) to say that Margot was terrific.  She was so attentive to all of us and our needs.  We were there for darn near 3 hours and we never felt rushed at all; as a matter of fact, our dinner was so leisurely, we all totally enjoyed ourselves, the food and the service.  (2) I also want to mention our absolute delight in the sommelier, Joseph Hoth.  He is very, very knowledgeable and was extremely helpful to us when making our selections.  Our wine bill alone was pretty high so you know that he was very interested in our selections and made sure they were all properly decanted and poured.  He even went so far as to save for me the empty bottles and the corks from each of them.  One of our sons is quite versed in wine and he and Mr. Hoth had a terrific time talking about the different types, vintages, etc.  Food was wonderful as were the side dishes.  Everything came out as we requested it and it was all hot.  After dinner drinks, coffee and desserts were enjoyed by us all.  We always appreciate the attention paid to us and to the details surrounding our meals.
