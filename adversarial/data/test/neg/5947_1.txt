I understand that this location is under new ownership but the only thing that stayed consistent is their stale garlic bread. We ordered our usual, family-sized baked mostaccoli with marinara, and the tray was 1\/2 the size for the same price! Also, they have chosen not to include salads with this order anymore! Then we tasted the food and it was comparable to the sauces off the shelves at Walmart. we used to love Rosati's, but I guess their new ownership doesn't get it. Besides that, they were rude and uninterested in resolving our concerns. We will never go back, and I advise the same.
