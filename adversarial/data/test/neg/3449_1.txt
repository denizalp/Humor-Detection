No one does it better than BAMIYAN when it comes to traditional Afghani food! Fresh made to order with a very simple menu. This location is the original that started it all. It is always packed. Their basmati rice is simply one the best I ever tasted. I highly recommend Bamiyan especially this location since you get to experience the food along with the wonderful people that live in this area. \n\nMy fave dish: chicken tandoori dinner
