We were there for the 7:30 Dec. 30 showing  and the show itself was awesome.  But through no fault of the performers; there was an hour long interruption caused by technical or mechanical difficulties at the beginning of the show.   For some reason the center staged got jammed and would not go down.  The bummer part was the general manager of the show came out after a few minutes and made an announcement saying the technicians should be finished fixing the problem in about 5 to 8 minutes...........which actually took an hour.  He should have offered free drinks or something for the inconvenience....since we missed our dinner reservation!    But overall, the show was spectacular....yes, this is one of the best cirque du Soleil show I have seen!
