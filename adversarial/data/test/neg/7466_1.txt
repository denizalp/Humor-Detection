I always end up getting either a buckwheat or chickpea crepe, and I try something different every time. It's all amazing! And though I'm temporarily having to give up caffeine, their coffee is amazing too! They've really got something for everyone- whether you are looking for a sweet treat or something savory, this place does not disappoint! It's definitely my favorite brunch spot!
