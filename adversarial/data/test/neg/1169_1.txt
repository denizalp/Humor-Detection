The two star rating is mainly a result of price, taste, and portion size. I rarely eat at \"high-end\" restaurants, so when I do, my expectations are high. I was initially disappointed when I was told that while the Caesar salad dressing is evidently \"made fresh,\" it couldn't be modified to accommodate my request for no anchovies. Fine, I ordered it anyway. When it came out, I was surprised it was such a small portion. It tasted \"okay,\" but I've had better salads for less than half the price. My husband was not impressed with his salad either. For my entree, I got salmon. Again, it was \"okay\" but not great and lacked flavor. My husband got steak, and it was dry and flavorless; I was shocked about this due to the price. Nearly $100 for 2 salads and 2 entrees (no drinks) was just not worth it. Needless to say, we won't be going back.
