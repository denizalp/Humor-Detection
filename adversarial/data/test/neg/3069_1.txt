Love love love the fried chicken.  Biscuits were light and fluffy served with delectable butter and homemade jam. Charred okra was tasty and a fresh take on how to serve okra. Flat iron steak was tender and flavorful.  Even the mixed medley of fingerling potatoes were fantastic.  The red velvet Whoopie pie is gargantuan and is rich with cream cheese filling and dipped in chocolate.  Homemade pistachio ice cream was creamy and definitely a favorite in the dessert line up.
