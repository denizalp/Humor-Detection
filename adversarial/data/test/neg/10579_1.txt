Pretty good for Persian pastries in Toronto. This is a well managed small cafe\/bakery that gets pretty busy in the summer.\n\nIf you are going for tea time, try it with Zulbia & Bamieh (zulbia for example is a form of deep fried dough covered in honey or syrup). If you are looking for something slightly more healthy, the Napoleon is also a good choice at the Red Rose.\n\nIn case you are trying to cool down, Persian ice cream is pretty good at this selection. The faloodeh (noodle ice cream) is particularly satisfying, and goes really well with lemon juice or sour cherry syrup on top.\nThe saffron ice cream is also a good choice.
