I've noticed that kfc is really starting to go downhill lately. It all started when they took the BBQ chicken sandwich off the menu and replaced it with a deluxe sandwich. Then they stopped selling mountain dew. Kfc was one of the only fast food chains where you could get mountain dew but now that it's off the menu I have to drink root beer when I go there and it's not really the same. And half the time the soda doesn't mix right with the corn syrup in the fountain so you either get corn syrup sludge or soda water when you buy a fountain drink. I think that they're purposefully trying to give you a bad fountain experience so you'll buy the bottled pop with your meal which costs twice as much. My last complaint is about the ketchup packets and the napkins. You used to be able to take as many as you want but now the old chinese lady working there only lets you have 2 and if you take more than 2 she gives you a dirty look. Do yourself a favor and choose popeyes chicken over kfc
