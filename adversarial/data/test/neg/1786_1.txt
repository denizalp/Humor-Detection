I have a love\/hate relationship with ulta.  They have fantastic products.  Not only do they sell the nice, expensive products, but they have the less expensive hair products and cosmetics also.  Half of the time I feel that there is never anyone around to answer questions and there will be an extremely long checkout line.  But sometimes I feel like the girls will not leave me alone for two minutes without asking if I need help.  There have been a few times that I have told them I would find them if I needed help and then no more then 5 minutes later they would ask if I was still doing ok.\n\nI love that they have a salon and the girls are usually very helpful if I need help with hair product.  I hope to schedule an appointment for my hair to try them out.\n\nI have two comments about their coupons, they are great at giving you coupons if you have forgotten yours.  But sometimes their coupons are very misleading and you can't use them on the good stuff... read the fine print before commiting to an expensive product.
