I've seen Hubert make countless burgers on several shows and dang it, I knew he wasn't in the kitchen but just had to try it.  Flavor was there but the off temperature killed it for me. You'd think that a place like Fleur they'd be spot on with giving you exactly a medium rare but nope. #disappointed
