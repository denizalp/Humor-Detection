Cute store, good food but employees need a course in how to provide good customer service. Everyone we encountered was business like. Not one of the employees we dealt with would look us in the eye and gave us only begrudging answers. Will comeback on a different day to see if it's just the Sunday crew or if it's company.\nUpdate: Spoke with Thumb management and he assured me that the past customer service we received was not the norm and stated that he would look into the situation. Due to this I am increasing my review to a four star. We are planning another trip to Thumb this weekend so if the customer service is back up to par per the manager I will increase to a five star
