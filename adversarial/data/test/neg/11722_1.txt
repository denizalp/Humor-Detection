I wavered between a 4 or 5 star and finally ended up at 5. Not only was our meal delicious but the atmosphere is incredible and the whole dinner was memorable. Having come from a small town in the Midwest, I didn't grow up with places or patio's like this (especially not ones you can sit on in January or February) and every time I stumble across one in Phoenix, I act like a kid in a candy store and take 20 pictures of everything and just get HAPPY. The ambiance of the patio was something out of a dream to me. Lots of greenery and vines, pieces of neat decor, and LOTs of candles. \n\nMy fiance and I came here with another couple for her birthday dinner and I was so happy that Cafe Monarch was where she chose to go! We had discussed Different Point of View or Elements at Sanctuary but ended up here as it was closer to our after dinner plans at Mabel's on Main. While this place might seem better suited for a romantic dinner for two, it also worked pleasantly well for a table of four. It has been bookmarked on my Yelp forever and it seemed like the type of place that warrants a special night out. \n\nI had been a bit hesitant about the menu since its a limited offering every night but we had the perfect meal when we were told a beef tenderloin filet was offered that night. My FAVORITE! The other meal was scallops. Our waiter was attentive and kept us good on drinks the whole evening. The time between courses was slow but I think they intentionally do that to make the dinner an event rather than trying to turn over the tables quickly. Since we had plans for after dinner, we asked if they could pick up the pace and they definitely did, so the effort was really appreciated. \n\nThe filet had a coffee rub on it and a nice sauce over the steak that I enjoyed a lot. So many times you go to Capital Grill, Ruth's Chris and the like and get a big steak but not a lot of other flavors or seasonings on it. While some may say that's the way a steak should be served, sometimes it's nice to switch it up. The filet was 8oz and was very tender and cooked perfectly and I thought the sauce complimented it very well. The salad and dessert were both good too and I would jump at the chance to come back here again. It may even be at the top of my list when my parents visit in April. Definitely has the WOW experience for me!
