Our favorite Pita place! The food is always fresh and customer service is always great! Sometimes you have to wait about 15 mins for a fresh kabob, but it's worth the wait! Love the sauce! Good on everything. Prices are reasonable, tons of parking and easy access shopping center right off 67th & 101 fwy. we have been here multiple times and even brought guests from out of town and they love it too!
