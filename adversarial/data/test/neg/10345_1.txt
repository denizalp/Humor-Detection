Eyebrow threading is $6. Save your $6 and go elsewhere. I have two very differently shaped eyebrows now after going in for a clean up. I expressed multiple times that I only wanted a clean up. She made one eyebrow thin and the other looks untouched. When I showed her where to remove she said ok and took off the wrong place and messed it up more! Will never come back. I have two events upcoming and I look sarcastic. Happy Halloween -__-
