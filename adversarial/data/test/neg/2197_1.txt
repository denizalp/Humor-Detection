They just redid the menu in the last few months here. We'd been coming here long before the menu change, so I was a little skeptical. They simplified it quite a bit. But oh wow did it deliver! We've loved this place in the past and the menu change honestly just made it even better! They did take away the kids menu, which with us having two kids was a bit of a blow, but we were able to get our kids items that they liked on the happy hour menu. Definitely worth checking out!!
