ghetto.  lots of really bad shoe stores.  not good shoe stores, but stuff 'new to canada' and white trash people would wear.  A depressing shopping experience, with a one of a kind truly awful food court...  only saving grace (not one star), the flea market downstairs on the weekend; at least unique, interesting to aimlessly wander about..
