The NC Music Factory is a great venue.  From the time you exit the highway...and see the inviting light sculptures along Seaboard, you get the impression you are headed to something good.  You pass the great restaurants and clubs...and can park within 1\/2 block or less from the entrance.   The atmoshere for jazz concerts has been great.  You have choice of lawn seating, VIP and non VIP.  The sound quality from any location of the venue is great.  So my preference is defined by my \"5-Row\" rule.  If I can be within 5 rows of the stage...I am good.  I enjoy attending this venue!
