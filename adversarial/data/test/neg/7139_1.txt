This Walmart is so clean and has very friendly and helpful staff. Tyler was our cashier today. He showed us nothing but kindness while checking out our products and was very polite. We left Walmart feeling very welcomed & happy. Even though this store is smaller than the one in Arroyo Plaza, I definitely prefer this because of our interactions with the workers.
