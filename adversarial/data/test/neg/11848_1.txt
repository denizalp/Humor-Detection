1 star off for the pricey entrance fee ($22 adult, $16 for student ID holders and teens), but the rest was phenomenal. To add context to my review, however, I must mention that I've never been to the big science museums in Chicago and New York City, which I heard were 10000x better than OSC, but I have been to the Smithsonian Museums in Washington, DC and I still think the level of detail and organization of the exhibits at OSC are comparable. \n\nThis is my 1st visit to the OSC and I was pretty happy with the friendly and helpful service, fast entry (despite coming mid-day on a Saturday), and easy to navigate venue.\n\nThere is plenty of parking (paid I assume) and a drop off area near the main entrance, where you can purchase your tickets. Each floor is organized by theme, e.g. nature, space, but on the main floor where you entered they have new, rotating exhibits. Currently, they have a really interactive biomechanics exhibit set up with lots of lessons on how animals move. Pick up a map and explore the whole place!\n\nMany exhibits are hands-on interactive and all have descriptions\/how-does-it-work explanations, so each are self-explanatory. Unless you're coming with a large group I don't think you'll need a tour guide since exhibits are self-explanatory. \n\nI think younger children (elementary to middle school) would enjoy OSC more than high school or university students, but as a medical student I was pretty fascinated by everything :) You should probably plan on staying at least 1\/2 day here since there is a lot to see. Note that certain exhibits like the planetarium and IMAX have a schedule (1:30PM and 3:30PM showings), so look up times beforehand online.\n\nFor hungry visitors! I was impressed by the Tim Hortons, ironically, just outside the entrance since they had Pizza Pizza, ice cream (packaged), and healthier refrigerated options including a curry wrap (vegetarian), chia pudding, and greek yogurt parfait with fresh berries and cashews+other nuts. Yum!
