Always busy but worth the wait! We are weekenders, and they're always fast and friendly! We enjoy the ambiance because having a toddler, it's not too easy to go out and about for breakfast, however, they're always super accommodating and never mind if he makes a mess! Lots of other families with kiddos too!
