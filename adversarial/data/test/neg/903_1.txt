My family and I are vacationing here from California and we really did not know where to eat and this place popped up. We ordered a pile up, breakfast burrito, egg-a-bagel pile up, and a humble hash. Would recommend any of them. Service was excellent, friendly, and attentive. Food came out quickly and hot. The next time we come to Arizona we will definitely come here again.
