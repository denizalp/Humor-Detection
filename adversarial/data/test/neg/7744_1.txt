I have been here a few times and every time I've eaten solid well made Italian food.\n\nThe front of the space is a market with pastas, frozen foods, and plenty of other neat little items to pick up on impulse. The deli and pastries are wonderful as well, my personal favorite is the rainbow cookies. \n\nWhen I go we normally share so I got the opportunity to try a good amount of items. The calzones to warn you are just as huge as they are delicious. The gnocchi in pesto was great and cooked perfectly. And the bruschetta sandwich was different than expected but still a good size and taste, once again was perfect. All of the pasta and noodles will be just what you're looking for. The allla vodka was perfectly creamy and rich! I can't give this little spot enough praise and suggestion if what you are craving is home cooked heavy Italian food.
