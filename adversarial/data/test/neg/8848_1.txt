Every place that serves or sells hummus manages to provide a vastly different taste - some are good, some are very good, and some are not edible.  Pita Jungle manages to consistently create quite good hummus, and they do it with multiple flavors.  I have simple tastes and am a creature of habit so I usually order their hummus and chicken.  Not only is their hummus good, but few places that I have been to create chicken that is as flavorful so it's hard to pass that up when I go to Pita Jungle. \n \nSome other great options are the California Beach Club (I sub the turkey for their fantastic chicken), and pretty much all of their pizzas or lavosh crisps.  And in the same vein, when I go for the lavosh pizza I tend to order their chicken glazed lavosh pizza.  For those of you who didn't notice any pattern, chicken is a solid way to go.
