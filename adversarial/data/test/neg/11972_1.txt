Fresh and variety of menu options. Even have soup, but a little more expensive than the average fast food meal. 2 adults & 2 toddlers cost us $30. Small pitas are just under $6, large are just under $8. To add chips\/drink is additional $2.50. They do have a Coca-cola machine that give tons of drink options tho which is nice. Clean. Only a few tables inside, tons of seating outside.\n\nBuffalo pita tasted like spicy bbq not usual buffalo sauce...
