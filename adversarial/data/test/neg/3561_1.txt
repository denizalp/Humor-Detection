I had a very positive experience here. The exam was quick and easy, Dr. Lee is phenomenal. The whole entire staff it personable and friendly, I love it! My glasses were done in less than a week and they are perfect! One thing I really appreciated was that they were not trying to nickel and dime me and I can't say enough about how friendly they are. I will be recommending this place to everyone I know in need of glasses\/contacts!
