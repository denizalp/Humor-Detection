Have had a non draining drain for obviously many years...lots of dirt and tree roots in my pipes. Was told by Roto Rooter plumber in Pittsburgh, Pa. that he wasn't sure he would be able to unclog  approx. 60 feet of pipe. He (Ed) worked so hard and he did it !      it was so apparent that he knew what he was doing. I still may need further work, which he facilitated in getting me an appointment with a Roto Rooter estimator.  I am, so far, a satisfied customer !!!!!!!
