Came in to have some breakfast wait was 30 mins we went to the lounge to have a drink in the meantime while waiting we sat by the fire and had a drink once we got seated the food was delish!! Love that they give you the option of toast, bagel, muffin. The ambience is good totally 80's vibe definitely be back when in town.
