So impressed with this place, peruvian food is comfort food to me and every peruvian restaurant that I find in phoenix always ends up closing down but I sure hope this place sticks around the food is absolutely amazing and spot on with authenticity! The service is also great our server was very nice and did a great job! This is definitely my new favorite restaurant and I will be back!
