Tried the Kelly O's in the Strip District for a Saturday Lunch. Small and noisy as well as quite busy. Had a few minute wait which wasn't bad given how busy they were. \n\nI decided a sample of a number of things was in order. The World Famous Breakfast was good but not \"world famous\". I tried the Turkey Pot Pie soup -- awesome. The Mush with crumbled bacon, the way Guy from Triple D's likes it was good. Finally I had the Pittsburgher - 1\/3 lb burger, pierogi, Polish Sausage, and cheese. Quite good but the Polish Sausage was 2 very small pieces. \n\nThe diner is quite noisy so you may need some quiet time to decompress.
