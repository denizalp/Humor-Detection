I'd i could rate this place no stars I would! This is the worst place!!!!!!!! We were approached that the hotel we were staying at and thought it might be a good idea to check it out. The gentlemen ( Thomas and Warren) were awesome who got us setup for the tour and took us around. The part that had us vexed was when we decided we needed a little more time to think about making such a commitment... Warren brought over a shark salesman by the name of Pablo. His demeanor was shitty!!!! Expressing that it wasn't the money that was a concern Pablo became aggressive and condescending. The location was beautiful but, his actions made sure I will never do business with the grandview. Beware of this establishment and their sharky sales tactics!!!
