Love this place!\n\nCame back again and realized you ask them to warm up everything for you, and you definitely should! Everything tastes better warmed and the croissant insides are nice and melty.\n\nThe pastries are fluffy and flakey--everything is delicious. Because of the express Chatime here, it makes it even better!\n\nIt's a nice place to sit and chill. The staff are super sweet and didn't question when I said the 8 pastries I ordered for myself were not take out. My friend and I had minor regrets eating so many pastries all in one sitting, after eating dinner, plus a bubble tea for me. Still coming back for more though!
