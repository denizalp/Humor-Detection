I want this restaurant to be good because it is so close to our house, but the terrible service consistently outweighs the quality of the food.\n\nWe came in on Monday night as a party of 5. There were two other tables occupied and we were told we would need to wait to be seated. It ended up being about 5 minutes before we were seated. \n\nWater was spilled on our table, our water glasses remained consistently empty, food had to be sent back because it was missing ingredients, and part of our order was forgotten and never provided. Luckily we didn't get charged for it. \n\nHowever, the food and sides are all solid. The food is awesome but the service needs a lot of work.
