Was greeted with friendly service. This place is not the cheapest lunch if you order sides and a drink. Fairly small restaurant with big taste and size on their sandies.\n\nI ordered the fried chicken sandwich, it easily goes in a top 5 fried chicken sandwiches I've ever had. Crisp, fried to perfection, the sauce, the bread, it all works. I think next time the sandwich alone will be enough. I also got a side of fries which were a little over cooked and too crispy for fresh cut fries, but they were good nonetheless.\n\nThey had Ace Hill lager which was delicious, would definitely get that again.\n\nOverall a solid place for sandwiches and would return for their brunch menu or to try their other offerings. Based on price ($26 for lunch) and the over cooked fries, they lose a star.
