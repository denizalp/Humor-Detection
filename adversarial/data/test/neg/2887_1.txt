Their AYCE is pretty good here. Service is sometimes slow, but I keep coming here so it's not that bad! They're a bit pricey, but they offer some pretty good options. I've liked most things that I've had here with the exception of calamari (which was an error in my part for ordering it from a sushi restaurant!!). I love their chicken udon, I get it everytime!!
