This place is a \"must do\" if you've never had Indian cuisine! We weren't sure of the different sauces so the girl taking our order went and grabbed a sample of each to help us decide!!! What service! We ordered Chicken Tikka Masala and Lamb Meatballs! Both were very good!! We're definitely going back!
