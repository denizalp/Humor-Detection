Underwhelmed.  The decor was outdated and looked drab. The lighting was nonexistent, we were basically eating in the dark. The wait staff was friendly,  but honestly it was hard to understand them because they spoke so,  so fast. The food was not great.  I ordered #23- Gaeng Panang curry. I ordered it with chicken. I was greatly disappointed when it arrived. It was barely spicy,  despite the waiter describing it as \"level 3\". The chicken was rubbery, the vegetables were soggy, and the jasmine rice was mushy. For $12 I was expecting something not quite so gross. The saving graces-nice staff, clean,  not busy at all. The cons-drab decor, not great food. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant.
