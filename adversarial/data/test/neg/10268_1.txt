When you need \"stuff\" and lots of it, Sam's Club is the place.  It is just like every other chain big box bulk store.  The plus side to this location is the gas pumps which are usually about ten cents cheaper than most others.  \n\nThere are usually a large number of seasonal items that have great prices (right now, grills, patriotic decor and food).\n\nThe downside?  Lines are usually long because most registers have converted to self check out.  I HATE self check out, especially when you have a lot of large and bulky items.  \nRating would be higher if there were more staffed check outs and less self serve.
