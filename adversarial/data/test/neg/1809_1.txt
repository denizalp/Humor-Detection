Walked in here for the first time with my girlfriend thinking it would be good, but it took us forever to get seated then when we did get seated we had a small dinky table which hardly fit any food. However, in our case we did not even get much of the food we ordered.. We did not order much but at least 50% of the food was not delivered and we had to ask two times before we were actually heard. Even when we were heard it took another 20 minutes for the food to come. By that time we were sitting, not eating anything and getting full. What's weird is that the table beside us had such quick service and they got food before us even when they ordered AFTER us.. Their table had 3 adults and 1 kid. No matter the party size,  I think all service should be equal and no one should be neglected or ignored. I would not recommend eating here nor will I be coming back ever again even if someone wanted to pay me(that's how bad the service is) , what's even worse is that they will autograt your bill for that terrible service.
