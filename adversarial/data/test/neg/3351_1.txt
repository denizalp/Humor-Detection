My friend and I came here for the first time over the weekend and we loved it. Kayla and Kim were very friendly and fun. They did a great job on our pedicures. We loved the detox pedicures and are looking forward to trying some of the other options they have as well. Overall, this salon is an inviting and comfortable place to go and relax! We will be back again for sure.
