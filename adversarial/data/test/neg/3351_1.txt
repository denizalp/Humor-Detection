Great food!\nAttentive and accommodating service.\n\nMy boyfriend split a pizza with a friend of ours.\n-Roasted Chicken, House BBQ Sauce, Corn, Pasilla Peppers, Red Onions, and Cilantro Pizza. (great!!!)\n\nMy boyfriend also got:\n-Chinois Chicken Salad, Candied Peanuts, Crisp Wontons, Chinese Mustard Vinaigrette (so good! very fresh!)\n\nI split a pasta dish with a friend. It was a delicious corn, chanterelle mushroom, and cheese ravioli with truffles.\n\n Can't find the exact description online at the moment. FANTASTIC. I absolutely loved it. I couldn't think of anything I'd want to have changed with it as far as taste goes. Perfect.  I of course, would have liked a bigger portion. I did split it, but even if I hadn't, I would have wanted to eat a little more. The split portion was like a taste of an appetizer for me. Good thing the BF let me have a slice of pizza.  \n\nI find that the Pizzas are the best value here for lunch. $15 gets a nice medium sized pizza with incredible flavors and fresh ingredients.
