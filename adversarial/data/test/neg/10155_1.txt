Jade Palace knows service extremely well...In fact it is legendary. How and why...the owners are true hosts and show examples that every restaurant owner should abide by. You are always greeted in a warm and friendly manner and the food gets usually cooked at lightning speed.  I cannot fault Jade Palace for anything as each and every one of my experiences dining there has been flawless and the food memorable, plentiful, and the  the prices reasonable. \n\nWhen ordering food for take out, I am always offered a drink which I think is a nice touch. My favourite item on the menu is the hot and spicy eggplant with chicken.\n\nEnough said...don't be shy..Order out or dine in. you are guaranteed a fabulous experience at Jade Palace.
