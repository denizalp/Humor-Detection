This place is just north of the strip, super close. I ate lunch there and ordered the personal size pizza. The lunch portion only includes cheese, so they charge you for toppings. Overall, the pizza was good! Probably not my favorite pizza in the whole world, but definitely good. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. \n\nI also ordered the mozzarella sticks. Also pretty good, but not the best I've ever had. I believe they were frozen, rather than home made, but none-the-less, still decent. Full disclosure: thenorder comes with six. My picture was taken after I ate one \n\nI would eat here again!
