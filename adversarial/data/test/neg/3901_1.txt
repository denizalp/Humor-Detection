We arrived and was welcome by the person at the front desk very nice guy answer all our questions.  Got to the room was nice and clean.  This is a modern style hotel very well taken care of.  Is near many restaurants and accessible to the highway.  The breakfast was very good and u can order several things from the cook.  Overall a very good experience.
