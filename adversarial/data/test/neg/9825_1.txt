Wanted to try this location out because Rainbow & Warm Springs is always so busy in the parking lot. \n\nPros of this location:\nFresh Juices, Yum. \nStarbucks inside. \nWasn't so busy & nicer looking shopping karts. \nNice selection of fresh flowers. \n\nCons:\nRed onions all didn't look fresh, all looked old. \nSeafood department 75% of the seafood looked super frozen and not that fresh. \n\nI'd probably only go back to this location if i need to buy flowers and fresh juice. But besides that I will go to other stores like Smiths and Sprouts.
