I've officially become a regular here. Cheap martinis EVERY night (friday-saturday included!).. you had me at hello! Now that I've been here a dozen times, here's why this is my favorite spot in town for a drink (and sometimes dinner).\n\n*Martinis are CONSISTENT and well crafted. Top shelf liquor, hot bartenders, fun combinations. I have yet to try one I didnt' love! At $5-$7 each during happy hour, they are very reasonably priced. Brassy Blonde is my personal favorite, but the pear one they haven't put on the menu yet is awesome as well. \n\n*Atmosphere is great. Swank and upscale yet laid back and comfortable. I feel great in here wearing jeans and a hoodie or a little black dress. Comfortable large bar, low lighting, and huge plasma TVs. They also have great live music fairly often.\n\n*Food is great! Steaks are awesome (even by Vegas standards). I have yet to have a bad dish here. Lately I've gotten into their succulent sliders. The meat patties are HUGE and juicy and cooked medium. They were covered in cheese and some diced onions. They were served on yummy fresh baked fluffy buns. Some of the best sliders I've had in my life honestly. No tiny smushed little patties here!!  At $10 for 3 they are hardly cheap, but considering their size, you could make a meal out of 3 of them for the average appetite...
