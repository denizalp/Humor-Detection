Dined for the first time this evening. I chose sushi while my boyfriend ordered General Tsos chicken. I have to say that it was some of the best sushi I have ever eaten in Pittsburgh and beyond. Service was amazing and out server Natalie was extremely nice and attentive. We will definitely be coming back!
