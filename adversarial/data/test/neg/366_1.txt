Have passed this place many times thinking I need to try it sometime.  I should have passed by today as well.\n\nFirst off, the service was slow.  We visited when there was only one other couple eating there.  The hostess and one server sat behind the front hostess stand with their heads buried in their smart phones.  Our server was inattentive at best \n\nFood was bland and and as quick as it came from kitchen, I kind of wonder how it was prepared.\n\nIf you are looking to dine in the Montrose\/Fairlown area, find another place.
