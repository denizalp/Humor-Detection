Came here for family lunch last week. Five of us and We ordered the following...\nCrab soup\nPeking duck\nFrench beef\n3.0 lbs Lobster with house sauce $29.95\/lb\nSaut√©ed garlic Chinese broccoli\nWalnut shrimp\nFried sole fish with sweet n sour sauce\nThe food was savory and gratifyingly tasteful. No MSG, they say?! They also served in generous portions. We had plenty of leftovers.\nAnyways, for the amount I paid, we might have as well went to Bacchanal @ Caesar's Palace Buffet. It would have cost me less.
