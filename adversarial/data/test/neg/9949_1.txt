I have been to this location at least 10 times and several other locations about the same amount of times. I've come to expect a certain level of service and experience when I go. The wait is normally long no matter when you go, but on this day, I didn't have to wait for more than 10 minutes. \n\nThe waitress brought us some bread, but it was cold and not a full order. We looked to the table next to us with the same amount of people and they had twice as much as us. We love the bread here and always look forward to it. Even after we finished our bread, we were never asked once if we wanted some more. \n\nBefore we got there, I had it in my head what I wanted, since the menu rarely changes. I have almost all 1,334 pages memorized. Undoubtably, I wanted some of the fried Mac n Cheese balls. Also, knowing that the portions can sometimes be rather large, I decided I wanted the chicken tenders. They say they are Cajun, but as someone who grew up eating Cajun cuisine, nothing about the feels Cajun. I just wanted them because I knew they would bring me a mountain of them. \n\nOnce the food came, I was ready to climb the plate. The chicken tenders came with succotash and an order of mashed potatoes. Everything was just as good as it's been in the past. Also, when I say they bring you a mountain of food, be prepared to have plenty left over for the next day (or so). \n\nMy wife and I split the lemon raspberry cheesecake (had no clue they even had this) and it was amazing. It's now my favorite cheesecake flavor. I can't wait to have it again\n\nMy only real complaint was the service. As I stated, I always expect a certain level of service when I go to Cheesecake Factory and during this visit, I'd rank it at the bottom. I had to flag our waitress down on multiple occasions. I never felt like she cared about us and she never once checked in to see how we were doing. Other than that, my experience was still a good one.
