I had really been looking forward to trying Tom's because I had been in Vegas a year earlier and waits were so long that I didn't stay but figured the food must be great.  Booked a reservation this time.  Ambiance is nice as well as view from patio but food was so mediocre.  Husband and I shared pork belly Banh Mi tacos and a Cuban sandwich.  Not the normal meat preparation for Banh Mi, more of a thick slice of fatty ham, flavor was OK but nothing we would eat again.  Cuban was decent but far from the best Cuban I've had.  What really turned me off to Tom's was the drunk couple sitting in the patio harassing and insulting people walking by on the street and in the restaurant.  I'm sure the drunk woman must pride herself on how many bars she's been kicked out of because she kept asking the waitress if she was going to get kicked out.  By the time I left she was still not kicked out.  For a higher end restaurant it cheapened the feel and shows poor management.
