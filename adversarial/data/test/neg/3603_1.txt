Add this to the list of identically terrible experiences with this place.  Two technicians walk in, do not actually check anything on our appliance, and just tell us to buy another one instead of them trying to fix ours.  \n\nAttitudes were rude, don't say hello, making snarky comments to my wife.  Total time in the house was less than 5 minutes, literally checked nothing on the appliance, charged $100.  Called the office and talked to the David guy who is supposedly a manager, who just wanted to defend his guy as being a \"surgeon\" and try to talk down to us.\n\nWaste of time and money, avoid at all costs.
