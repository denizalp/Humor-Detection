Its too bad Yelp doesn't offer negative ratings because if they did I would give it to them. I had been going to this salon for awhile and had a great stylist. Apparently the one I was seeing up and quit or was replaced by someone else. The receptionist tried to lie saying she rang me about this yet the ONLY call I got was to confirm my appointment with the stylist I had been seeing for the next day. I should of known then to leave but I was there after driving 30 min and needed my hair done. They assigned me to some new girl who I had never seen there before. The stylist was nice i'll give her that but should no way have scissors in her hand. I left with a terrible cut that was totally unmanageable.  I was very frustrated as I paid good money for the cut. To top it off they tried to email me about an appointment with some new stylist (apparently the one who I saw last left) now charging $75! As if the $60 wasn't high enough the last time?Save your money and go elsewhere trust me you'll be glad you did. I found a great salon now that fixed the last stylists screw up. Apparently they get a lot of this salons screw ups sadly. This place is totally unprofessional and does not care about its clients. All they want is money and apparently more of it. I defiantly will NOT be going back and will be telling people to stay clear and find a better salon that doesn't screw hair up and charge ridiculous amounts.\n\n**Edited to note I too will NOT edit my review no matter if you try to contact me so don't bother. I normally don't do reviews but I really don't want someone else wasting good money on a terrible haircut, then having to pay again elsewhere to get it fixed.
