This place is really good, but I cannot give 5 stars for 2 reasons. \n\n1. We ordered about 5 pizzas and a couple of them came out with fairly burnt crust. I'm not a fan of the burnt taste on crust. Just about everyone at the table ignored the crust... unusual for our group. This does not detract from the pizza itself, which was very good.\n\n2. They don't know how to pour beer. The only have 3 (I suppose it is a wine bar after all), but at least know how to poor it if you're going to serve it. We ordered at least 5 pints and each of them came with half head. Kind of annoying. Luckily the glass was chilled, so it was still cold once it settled.\n\nThe pizza is so good, the alla mamma is our favorite. The sangria was delicious, we downed a whole pitcher. I would definitely come back to this place in a second. The owners (I believe thats what they were) were very kind and welcoming. They took care of us very well and we were happy with our visit.
