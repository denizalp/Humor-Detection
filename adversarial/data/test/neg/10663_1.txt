I have to do an updated review for this restaurant!! It is STILL my favorite!! And I eat out a lot. It is about 20 min from my house, but I never mind making the drive.The food is fantastic! Mario is THE BEST!! And Adi takes such wonderful care of all of their customers!! You really feel special when you are there. They catered my 50th birthday party and did a fantastic job! All of my guests raved about their food! I cannot recommend this restaurant enough!!
