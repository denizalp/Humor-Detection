i had no problem with the see e guye when they were big o. they did a good job In my power sterring pump. \n\ni have to say that ive learned to stay away from this place bc i got straight lied to not once twice but 3 times.  i gave them many chances to redeem themselves.  \n\nthey fired the guy that screwed up my vehicle.  i handed them brand new high quality parts to install and some of them are unusable.  While changing my oil this week, months later from what they promised was a fix to their mistakes.  i discovered they also accomplished bending my frame where the a-arms attaches.   i went under the vehicle to change oil and try and mount my shock that is dangling freely.    one out of two bolt mounts is ruined so its the only one i can use.  did i mention these were NEW parts?   i specifically took it back to them to fix these issues and they didnt do it. simply lied to me  .   while under there i discovered screw up number 7 and 8. The contol arm bolts are backwards so the short one is barely hanging on the nut with only a few threads.  then i guess they some how  accomplished bending the frame  support where they a-arm attaches.!  f me.  And to add stupidityto this they put the chrome wheel cover on clearly covering the air valve !?!?\n\nim done done. been in this dust bowl 5 yrs and i cant find a good and honest mechanic to save my life.
