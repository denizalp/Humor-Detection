I went to Tammie Coe a few months ago . With my mother in tow we ventured in and found lots of yummy choices. The coffee smelled wonderful.  My  eyes spied a special treat that I rarely get to sample. \nA coconut Macacroon!  I love them. We took our treats outside to little tables and ate. The taste was amazing . i can't wait to go back again. \nI keep thinking I need to get one of her beautiful cakes for some family occasion as well.
