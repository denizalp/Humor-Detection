The food was great and the dessert was excellent. We had the Dolchino Trio dessert plate. Best of all was our server Alexander. He did everything right. He served us the night of 11\/11\/2017. We didn't have to wait for anything. He offers us bread after we finished our first bread plate, filled out waters frequently, recommended plates.
