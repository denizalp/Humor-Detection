Everything was so fresh!  Loved their suggested menu recipes. A huger variety of options.  Couldn't decide so split 2 different burritos with my daughter. We had twin dragon and caterpillar. \n\nWe tried the taro chips in original and a side of edimami. \n\nEmployees were so patient with us in explaining anything we asked. \n\nVery clean restaurant too\n\nFor sure would go back.....like tomorrow!
