A bit too much hype, I guess. Went there last night and had the char burger with onion rings. The rings were great, done perfectly and there was plenty of them. But the burger had no wow factor at all. It was okay, but I've had a lot, lot better ones. I'd picked up some jalape√±o slices from the self-serve bar, and was glad I did, because they gave the burger some much-needed zip.\n\nA good service experience, but I doubt I'll be back.
