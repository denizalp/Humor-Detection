I have been there several times, and it was disappointing nearly every time. I ordered an omelet on two occasions, and it was way overcooked, and the potatoes were mushy and gross.\n\nI returned to try something else, just because I live very close, and the Bacon and eggs were quite good, however my English muffin was burnt (obviously as well, why did it even leave the kitchen) and the potatoes were their usual low quality.\n\nI would (and do) drive a bit further up the road and eat at TC Eggingtons, same money, infinitely better food.
