You know you've just experienced good service when not ten minutes after the appointment, you're excited to write a positive review on Yelp!  Our air conditioning wasn't working as efficiently as we wanted and with the heat coming soon we opted to get an AC tuneup from AZ Dukes of Air after seeing positive reviews here. And we are so glad we did!  Our AC didn't need fluid - our tech, Todd, fully inspected the unit and noticed there was something wrong with the way it was installed (by a diff company four years ago). Basically only 50% of the air was flowing through correctly. Todd quickly made the fix and literally within minutes we could feel cool air throughout our home. We were very pleased with his service and for of course fixing a problem we didn't know we even had until today. We will definitely be using these guys for our annual tuneup and all other calls moving forward!
