We've driven past this place tons of times.  It's always packed so we tried it out this morning and it was AMAZING!  We were greeted and seated instantly, had a phenomenal wait person.  The food was excellent - sweet potato pancakes were stellar. Nothing but awesome all around!!\n\nThe funky deco - lots of animal heads - adds to the fun here.
