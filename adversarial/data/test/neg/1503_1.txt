Highly recommend!! I called looking to have a bouquet delivered to my friend in the hospital who was having a baby girl. Andrea responded promptly and we discussed what I had in mind. I told her I wanted there to be pinks but just wanted it to be fresh, and left the rest up to her. Andrea followed up quickly via email confirming the details, and sending the transaction to be paid through PayPal. Super easy! Andrea emailed upon delivery and included pictures for me to see the bouquet. I was blown away at how GORGEOUS the bouquet was and at a very reasonable price!! And of course my friend loved them too! Thank you A Hunt Design, it was a pleasure!
