Dr. Fisch is a great professional. I got pregnant from my first cycle. Due to my PCOS my egg count and quality was not expected to be the best. Dr. Fisch was spot on with my hormone dosage which prevented the common OHSS in PCOS patiences. I'm delighted to welcome my baby early next year. With much appreciation thank you Dr. Fisch and Staff!
