Friendly family run restaurant catering mainly to takeout although currently a few tables inside and out if you wish to eat there. We had squid, chicken, steak and short ribs all of which were delicious. They were accompanied with rice and hibachi prepared veggies in ample proportions. Will certainly go back again to enjoy their fare!
