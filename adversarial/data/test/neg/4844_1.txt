A fantastic addition to the steadily, well rapidly growing Charlotte Craft beer scene.   This brewery, originally from Morgantown, features one of the most expansive tap selection among Charlotte Craft breweries.  I always life to pop in periodically to try their newest small batch releases, and I have 0 complaints as far as bartenders and staff are concerned.  With a picturesque view of downtown Charlotte this is a great Brewery to grab a happy hour pint, or a great Brewery for city tourists as well.  The Hefeweizen and Strawberry Vanilla Milkshake IPA were the two highlights of my visit
