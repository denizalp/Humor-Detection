We had a great time doing a little staycation in the Valley. Stayed on the Players Only floor. Our first night was ok, I woke up and opened curtains and noticed floors were complete soiled and disgusting I took pictures and took them downstairs to front desk where the on duty manager quickly apologized and upgraded us to the penthouse suite. That was a great night the views where spectacular and the room was perfect. The kids loved the slide and we enjoyed watching the kids have fun. Would definitely stay again.
