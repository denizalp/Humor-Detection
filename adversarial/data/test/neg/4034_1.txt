This place has definitely improved since we were here last year. Really enjoyed ourselves. It's smaller and less of a hassle than the bigger casino bowling alleys. Good mix up of music. Mostly families playing which is a nice change from the young and obnoxious crowds that usually frequent a bowling alley on a Saturday night. Looking forward to planning my son's 6th bday party here at the end of this year. Hope this place keeps up the good work.
