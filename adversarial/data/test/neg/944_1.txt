So the best way to acknowledge a failure in the service at your Clinic is to tell the entire world that \" Dr. Ram is a VIP only Doctor\" . May be he should be practicing in Hollywood or at the white house.  I did not care much about Dr. Ram, Dr. Vasquez is actually who I was scheduled to meet with. It is easy to pass the bucket. I understand the staff being new or in training, it does not justify poor service, I didn't question the skills of the staff, I question the service rendered or not. You are still getting 0 stars from me.
