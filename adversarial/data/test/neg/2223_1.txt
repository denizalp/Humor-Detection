I was glad to see the place open on a Monday night.  We were greeted with smiles from across the room and from the sushi chef.  It was around 530 and only 3 tables occupied which had me concerned.  But our waitress came right over and took our drink order.  \nWe ordered a couple of sushi rolls and a Spring roll.  Took about 12 minutes to receive (remember 3 other tables), but all the apps were very good.\nI ordered a grilled cod fillets entree and phad thai; my son had a dish with wide noodles.  \nThey restaurant was filling up while we waited for our entrees.  Others were served before us that came in after our appetizers were served.  I was told that they wanted to be sure the fish was cooked.  About 15 minutes later four hot steaming meals came to our table.  My fish was great but coated with a slightly bland sauce, and I ordered it 3 chili style.  Side if broccoli was cold.\nI loved the phad Thai, best I've had in Charlotte.  Tender noodles, spicy peanut sauce with a hint of sweetness.  \nThe others enjoyed their meals without any issues.\nNice addition to Ballantyne.
