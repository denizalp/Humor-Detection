I really don't understand the positive reviews. Based on these reviews and a perusal of the menu I booked a table for 6 on a Thursday evening. When we arrived half our party was late but they were kind enough to seat us anyway (that's why this is a two star review). We decided to order some starters while we waited. We were seated minutes after happy hour ended. Other tables had delicious looking fries and the waiter agreed to let us order them despite happy hour having expired. How bad can a fry be before you stop eating it? Very bad. They were limp, greasy and chewy. The warm Brie was a room temperature gelatinous mess. The food was so bad we left, met the rest of our party outside, and ate elsewhere. There is a lot of competition on Boston Street and this place can't keep up.
