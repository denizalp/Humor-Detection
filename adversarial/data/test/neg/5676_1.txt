Good quality, cheap coffee. I want to try brunch here one day. Super chilled cafe with free WiFi. And super hipster. Staff are so so... depends who is making your coffee. I guess I'm used to more engaging baristas and café staff who make you feel at ease. These dudes are kind of passive about that, but maybe that's the vibe of the café. I still go for the coffee. It's decent!
