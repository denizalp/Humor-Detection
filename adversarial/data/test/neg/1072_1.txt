I was really anticipating a great green chile pork burrito. I went through drive thru. Very nice young man helped me. He asked if I wanted any hot sauce, I said yes I'm going totally green today. The total tab was $6.80 including tax for 1 burrito. Which I thought was pretty pricy considering it is fast food. The size of the burrito was very big and had a lot of big chunks of pork and green gravy. It tasted awesome. Just enough heat for me. But the pork was extremely tough. If the pork is braised or slow roasted it should melt in your mouth. There was a lot of fat in it too. The only way you can get that tough meat I believe is microwaving. I hope this is an isolated situation. What a waste of money. I have had rolled tacos with guacamole and they were good. I hope somebody else posts their experience with the green chili was awesome. Taco Tuesday! I ordered 2 tacos, one chicken one beef, the winner! Chicken! I was impressed with the taste and texture of this oh so familiar dried out, tasteless concoction. This was the bomb, tender, tasty, all the things you want out of a taco. Congrats! I'll see you on Tuesday
