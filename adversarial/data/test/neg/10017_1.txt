I was recently here for my first visit. I ate Salatka 1(salad with burnt carrots, sunflower seeds, smoked chili, onion) and Pierogis(minus the sauce because I'm weird about sauces but my friends ordered them with the sauce and found it to be delicious), and I also had their gin cocktail. \n\nI have no complaints about their food. Each item tasted fresh, all the ingredients balanced each other well, and I would order each item again. My gin cocktail was equally delicious. I sipped it slowly not to take away from experiencing each flavor of my meal. This drink was so well crafted I found myself saying it is one of the best cocktails I've ever ordered between places in other US states and countries where I have dined. \n\nI plan to return and am hoping for the same experience. My friends have eaten here a couple times and commented to me saying each time they have been delightfully pleased. \n\nLast but not least, service was prompt and professional. Even though you order at the counter, it doesn't take away from having your food and drinks brought to your table in a timely manner and their servers remembering to check on you.
