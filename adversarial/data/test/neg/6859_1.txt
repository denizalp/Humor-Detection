We had two visits for my Son's broken Clavicle.  We only saw Dr Hrasky briefly on both visits.  Dr Tipton took care of pretty much everything on both visits.  He was an absolute delight to work with. He was super great with both of my kids, 2 and 4, and knew how to make them feel comfortable.  It came as no surprise he has two little kids of his own at home.  The overall vibe and decor of the office and exams rooms is appropriate for kids. The office staff was friendly and Dr Hrasky seemed alright for our brief encounters with him.  Seems like Dr Tipton handles most of the office visits, which is the reason we will return here exclusively for any needed orthopedic care.
