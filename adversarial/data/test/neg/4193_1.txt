This park is awesome! My husband and I have taken our nephews here over the years, but I've never really ventured beyond the playground area that's directly behind the library. The playground is pretty big, and there's also tons of grass for the kids. I don't really love parks because there are always teenagers screwing around and swearing and I feel like it's easy to lose sight of the little ones. \nWe decided to venture over here with our dogs for a change of scenery. I can't speak about the dog park, as we avoid them due to not knowing whether the dogs are vaccinated, spayed, or trained and we just don't want to risk it. However, we spent quite a long time exploring the sidewalks and nature trails last night for our jog. There is tons of space for your dogs to get some exercise, and we even let our Doberman cool off right along the edge of one of the splash pads to avoid heat stroke. We'll definitely bring our dogs back for some exercise in the future!
