Most delicious Chinese food I've ever had. Everything was fresh and seasoned to perfection. I had the dinner combo of sesame chicken. It came with an egg roll, two cheese puffs (which were amazing), lo mein, and fried rice. I would suggest this place to anyone who supports local businesses and fresh tasty food.
