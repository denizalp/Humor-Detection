this may be the fastest I have ever Yelped and it proves that I am hopelessly addicted to this foresaken site!!!\n\nWas in the area and figured I would hit up this burrito place.  i was in the mood for the slop that makes a tasty burrito.  This certainly was not bad.\n\nHUGE burrito.\n\nlots and lots and lots of meat\ntons of sauce, guac, cheese, pico, and more of all that too.\n\nPretty tasty and now I am stuffed. \n\nI am in the area from time to time so I think I will go back and kill some more burritos.
