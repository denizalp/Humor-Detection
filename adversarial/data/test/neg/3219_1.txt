This branch is one of the only two in Las Vegas that can give you a checkcard on the spot.  My wallet got stolen last night (for the 3rd time this year) and I did NOT want to wait for it in the mail.  I zipped over during my lunch break.  The banker was super sympathetic and helped me get a card right then and there.  Helped ease my stress a TON.  I love Chase!
