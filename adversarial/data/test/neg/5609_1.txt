So a update I had my x rays done 7\/17\/15 today is 7\/22\/15 I was wondering why my doctor hasn't called me so I stopped in and they said they revived my x rays on 7\/21\/15 mind you Simon med said  they would send them STAT due to what the tec saw why did it take 4 days to send an important x-ray to my doctor again because they have terrible customer service skills just read their response to my last review
