Good service.  Staff knew we were celebrating my birthday and took very good care of us.  However, there were a few odd things:  \n1. Red velvet cocktail: this is a cheap lambic beer in a tiny flute that will cost you $14.00 each.  All alcohol is overpriced here to the point of being insulting to the patron.\n2.  This place is supposed to be top-notch, so you would think the guy and girl dressed like they were going bowling would be turned away.  Nope.  Everyone else was dressed rather fancy, even the staff.  This place used to be strict about dress code; it's a real turn off when they're not.\n3.  Price.  The filet, scallops and shrimp were good; however, not as good as the price warranted.  Dinner for three, with only two sides and three beers, was $300.  I will not be doing this again, because it was not a \"$300 dining experience\".\n4.  The place was LOUD.  So loud you could barely hear your table mates.\n\nThis place is expensive, loud and not romantic.  There were children and babies.  Don't take a date here.  Take him\/her to John Q's, Pier W or Hyde Park. \nMorton's is a solid steakhouse but you'll pay through the nose.\nPros: valet was only $10.00.  Also, a complimentary photo and dessert was included because we were celebrating a birthday. ($17 value).  These were unexpected surprises and I was wished a happy birthday about ten times before I left!
