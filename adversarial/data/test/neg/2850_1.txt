I had the regular burger and added cheese ... it was a lot of burger! A lot of toppings and a good size of meat so I was excited to try it, but was disappointed.  \n\nThe meat was dry and needed salt, the thick tomatoes took over the burger I had to take them out. The only good thing about my meal was the gravy. Even the fries were limp. \n\nI'll probably go back to try a different burger and their poutine.
