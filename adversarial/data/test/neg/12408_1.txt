We had such high hopes for this restaurant because there are very few German restaurants in the city. We were excited to see some beers that you don't find readily and they were each served in their proper glasses on matching coasters which is important in German beer culture. \n\nThe decor is decidedly NOT German. We didn't feel like we were in a German style place at all and there was no smell of food in there either which seemed odd for a restaurant. \n\nThe menu features almost all schnitzel dishes...not much of anything else other than currywurst with fries and some bratwurst. We ordered one of each of those to share on our table as appetizers and also ordered a schnitzel dish each and cheese spatzle as an extra side. Soup or salad comes with the schnitzels.\n\nWe waited and waited and were not served anything for quite some time. I started thinking they were going to serve everything we ordered at once, so I went and made sure the waitress was going to bring our appetizer dishes first. She said yes. Shortly thereafter, she came out with our entres. We told them to just forget about the appetizers and we also asked where our soup\/salad was. The waitress said 'oh, sorry' and brought those out after our entres. \n\nThe schnitzels were very breaded and dry...thick with coating...like they were bought frozen, already breaded. Each had a flavorless sauce on them (3 different ones at our table) and 2 of us actually put their soup on top of the schnitzel to give it some flavor. We suspected the sauces served were made from Knorr packets. The yogurt dressing on the salad was actually just plain yogurt slopped on top. Everything was an epic fail as far as service and food went. I don't think you can smell food cooking when you come in because they are actually not cooking in there.  If you're wanting a German beer, go here and hope for ok service but do not go here to eat. We left disappointed and angry.
