Loved this place!!!  \n\nMy husband and I were in the area attending my family reunion, and this restaurant was recommended by a staff member at the Hyatt Place. \n\nIt was a short walk from our hotel.  We went around 1 pm for lunch on a Monday. There was no wait at all for inside seating and 1\/2 hour for outdoor seating (we were in a rush so we sat inside).  It was a nice atmosphere both indoor and outdoor, and their bathrooms were also very clean and cool looking.\n\nOur waiter was friendly and gave us good recommendations.  We started with the bread with pesto. This was the best pesto I've ever tasted.  I think maybe it had more cheese than most I've tried.  \n\nI ordered the butternut squash and spinach cannollini (sp).  It was absolutely delicious! I LOVED the different flavors I tasted with each bite, a sweet and salty taste - almond slivers, spinach, mushrooms, squash, butter sauce, etc. \n\nMy husband is a basic kind of guy when it comes to food, so he ordered the burger on toasted wheat bread (he does not like ciabatta and all of the other fluffy 'foo foo' type of bread).  He said the burger tasted fresh and it had arugula on it, not your standard burger.  The fries were also good.\n\nMy husband had a peach bellini which was delicious, and I had a red sangria which was also great.\n\nWhen we were done, I decided to walk through the area with the gelato.  I ended up with 1 scoop of Oreo cookie and cheesecake gelato and another of blueberry cheesecake gelato.  Both were creamy and delicious.\n\nThis was our last dining experience before leaving AZ.  We had a great time in AZ and this was the icing on the cake.  I am SOOO glad we decided to come here!
