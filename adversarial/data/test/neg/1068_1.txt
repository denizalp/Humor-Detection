On a road trip back from Chicago my daughter found this hotel searching on her iPhone.  I told her to look for a Marriott or a Marriott family hotel.  It wasn't far from the highway and the place was clean.  All we were looking for was a comfortable bed and a morning shower.  This place fit the bill.  It would have been nice if the place had a bar but a limited supply beer and wine could be purchased at the front desk.
