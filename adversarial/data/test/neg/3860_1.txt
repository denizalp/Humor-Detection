CVS Pharmacy is one of my one-stop shopping. While waiting for my prescription I can go shopping for groceries and pick up some cat and dog food for my Animals and I can't forget about my little fishy Etc. I would definitely recommend checking out this CVS Pharmacy its under new management and I can see the improvement. So I would definitely stop in and check out the new changes with the new friendly staff new management and the wonderful pharmacy staff.
