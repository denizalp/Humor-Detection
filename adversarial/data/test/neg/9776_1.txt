The menu itself looked pretty good, but the food itself is a little disappointing. I thought it could be a nice place where you could go with friends or come on a date, but I found the place looking pretty childish, even the menu. (But that's just me - I guess I expect more and am being a bit pretentious.)\n\nThe meal came with a salad so I asked for the Caesar, but it tasted like the lettuces were pre-drenched in dressing so it was real soft and mushy. I like my greens fresh and crisp. \n\nI also ordered the garlic bread appetizer (forget what it was called exactly), and it might have been nothing too special, but it was still probably the best thing I had that night. If you want a small meal, just order a side of this and eat it yourself. It's good and filling.\n\nFor my meal, I ordered the chicken parmesan. The chicken was mushy and tasted uncooked thoroughly at some points. The spaghetti.. the noodle was a bit overcooked and the sauce wasn't that good.. overall, I was pretty disappointed at this place.
