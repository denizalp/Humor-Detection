I was in Vegas with my bf looking at neighborhoods (we are both from out of state) and we dropped in during lunch time. My bf is Greek, fluent in the language and experienced with the food. We walked in and without looking at the menu, my bf ordered several dishes that he remembered from his childhood. They had it all! I don't remember the names but we had an octopus, cheese thing, greek salad, tsaziki...or something like that, lamb, and dolmathes. Everything was STELLAR. the service was excellent, the staff was so warm and friendly. My bf who always talks about his own mothers cooking all the time said that she would even love this place. We will definitely be coming back here when we move here. Try the octopus! The texture was nothing like I ever had before and the taste was out of this world
