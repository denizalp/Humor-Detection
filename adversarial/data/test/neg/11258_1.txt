My friend and I ate here for lunch on 10\/31\/14. Our waitress was Norma and she was excellent! First, I recommend you really read the menu board. ONLY Monday - Thursday can you get the lunch for $7.95. Otherwise, it's nearly triple the price! \n\nBeer is cheap! $4.00. We ordered the Oyster Rockefeller and it was good. You get 6 large baked oysters for $15. Next, we ordered the Combo Pan roasted shrimp and crab. It was good and hot. However, it doesn't come close to the pan roast at Ocean Trail in Scottsdale -- which is my No. 1 favorite. You will have to do a lot better to pass Ocean Trail. But overall, it was OK. Nothing remarkable; a bit pricey for what you get. Total tab for lunch was $73.00 without tip. That was with only 1 beer and 1 wine.
