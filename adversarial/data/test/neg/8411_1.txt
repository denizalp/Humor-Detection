The food here is truly special.  Authentic Latin but with a modern twist. The Meyer Lemon rotisserie chicken is amazing. Service was attentive but we never felt rushed. We wish the noise level from fellow patrons was a little better managed so we could have heard the lovely Latin music playing in the background.
