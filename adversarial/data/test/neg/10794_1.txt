I visited NBC for the first time this past weekend. What an extraordinary business they run! The staff was friendly, helpful, and seemed to genuinely believe they have an excellent product. They had sample cake and popcorn, as well, which was a nice touch. The store was bright, well designed, and had everything you could think of to top off your bundt cakes! The cakes themselves were moist, tasty, and delicious---plus, if you sign up for their e-mail club, you get a free bundtlet on your birthday! I will definitely return and appreciate a well-run business like this one.
