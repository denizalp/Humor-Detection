Steve made sure our girls night out lived up to expectation. He was prompt, extremely courteous, and made sure we knew how to reach him if he had to park further away while we were at our destinations. \n\nMy friend did the coordination with him, but from what I saw, he was attentive to her requests, and provided an extra hand (i.e with her swag bags) at the appropriate time. \n\nWe had a fantastic night out on the town to celebrate a Birthday and a large part of that was the fact that we got to be together (we had a large party!) and no one had to drive. \n\nThank you Steve and Arrive in Style Limo! I would absolutely recommend.
