I have been going to Le Peep for more than 15 years - I really do like the food but there are times on the weekends that the service can be a little questionable. They serve coffee on carafes and it's honestly never enough for the table..... there are times when you ask for a refill that it seems off-putting to the waitstaff. That said, the pancakes and food are always fresh and done right when we go and that's why we keep going back. They customize (eggs whites versus regular eggs, scrambled versus over-easy) and always get it right. That says something!! It's not the cheapest breakfast, but they're no different than the numerous other weekend breakfast joints around CLT. We are happy LePeep is here and will continue to be post-church regulars.
