Walk into the Vinery Stained Glass Studio and you'll discover a world full of color and light. The store that specializes in stained glass windows, glass panel cabinet doors and home decorations offers more than just beautiful accessories. Owner Denny Berkery said he can also provide you with the materials and training you'll need to create these works of art on your own.\n \"The Vinery evolved over the years into a teaching studio,\" Berkery said. \"We teach a lot of classes, all areas of stained glass, glass mosaics, bead making and fused glass.\"\n Berkery said he's more than happy to take on both residential and commercial work creating decorative stained-glassed panels for hire. But after 30 years in the business he derives a great deal of satisfaction working with students to develop their skills as glass workers.\n He said the classes offered at the Vinery provide a comfortable environment where learning is simple.
