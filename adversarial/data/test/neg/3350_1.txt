Fit me in on short notice for a mens cut and color.  Overall I was happy with the service.  Boa took care of my hair and did a great job.  From a guy's perspective, the place was comfortable.  Price was very fair, I was actually surprised as I was expecting my final amount due to be higher.  Now if someone there would have helped me pick a sick new haircut, then I would have given them 5 stars!
