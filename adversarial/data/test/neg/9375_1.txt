It does seem a bit strange to be drinking in the back corner of a supermarket, but nonetheless it was an enjoyable experience. The Watering Hole is a bar inside the Whole Foods Market in Chandler.  I came for a beer event, Pitcher of Nectar Distributing had the owner and head brewer from Ass Kisser Ales on hand and they were hosting a sample tasting of their more popular beers.  \n\nYeah, the place did seem a little overwhelming because of the crowd, but I thought the staff handled it very well and were quick on their feet.  It took me less than 5 minute to get a drink because I went to the bar and ordered it, I didn't sit on my ass and wait for service.  I had a chance to talk to the bartender a bit on this Friday night, he was friendly and seemed to know what he was talking about when it came to craft beer. He was really enjoying the event I believe.\n\nI had never been in this store prior to this event, but I feel motivated to go back for a closer look....at the market and at the rest of the beer list at the bar.
