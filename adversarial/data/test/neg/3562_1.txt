This is my favorite local brewery.  Super fresh and tasty beer with an ever changing rotating set of taps.  Along with their amazing beer, Heritage Catering is there to serve up some amazing food to go along with it.  Located right on the bike trail, it is a great open and airy space to enjoy a few beers at.  Extra points for their ability to can their beers in a crowler so you can enjoy it at home as well.
