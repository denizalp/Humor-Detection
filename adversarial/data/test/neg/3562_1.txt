PHE-NOM-E-NAL! I've never been to anything quite like this show. It had me dancing in my seat, clapping along to the beat, and mesmerized at each turn. The dancing and acrobatics were out of this world, and everything blended together so well that it was seamless. Imaginative costumes, scenery, and interpretations of the music. Great show for people of all ages!  The only portion of the show that had the slightest bit of an unpolished look was the rain\/rain boots number. It was ok, but compared to the rest of the show still needed a bit of fine tuning. What an amazingly talented group of individuals putting on what I feel is the best show in Vegas!!!!
