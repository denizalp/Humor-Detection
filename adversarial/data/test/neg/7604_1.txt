We were excited to try  Tom Thumb's especially since we love triple D.  So disappointed - we had the brisket sandwich which was very dry, the aioli sauce was just simple mayo and Texas toast was simply toasted white bread.  Although they did have many kinds of BBQ sauce to try I would have liked the brisket to be more flavorful.
