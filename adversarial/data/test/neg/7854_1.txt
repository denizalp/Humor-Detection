Love Dr. Garcia! We've been going to Foothills Pediatrics since our oldest was born; she is now 2.5, and we now have our baby #2 who we, of course, bring in to see Dr. Garcia as well. Dr. Garcia sees a ton of patients, and always remembers our girls. She also always has the time to sit and answer all our questions and concerns. I must say that the front office staff has gotten a lot better since Dr. Conti, and I think there is still room for improvement. BUT...they will not keep me from seeing our favorite pediatrician, Dr. Garcia.
