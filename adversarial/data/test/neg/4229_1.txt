First off I would like to thank Marcus for his great insight and patience. That being said you will be waiting.... and waiting. The product is worth it though. I put the side charging upper on my new 300 Black out w\/ a PRS stock. It works great! I don't have to worry about smashing my finger against the cheek rest.\nFinish is great, easy to clean and take down. The only bad thing I could say about this company is: they have such a great product that they are back-ordered and you will have to wait. If you're okay w\/ that, hit them up!
