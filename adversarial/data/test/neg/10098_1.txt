I stopped here this week for a quick lunch between errands. With its white walls and immaculate tables and countertops, its obvious that this place has only been open for 4 weeks. I appreciate a high standard of cleanliness when it comes to most things, especially in regards to where I'm eating. So kudos for that. However, because it feels so sterile and new, along with its bright lights, high ceiling, and white everything, it lacks the warm, inviting  atmosphere of \"homey\" diners. That being said, I believe food and service matter most so I'll move on. I ordered the Turkey Avocado Bacon Sandwich with tomato on toasted sourdough with a side of greens. Everything was very good and very fresh. The guys running the counter were smiling, polite, and upbeat. They also played good music. This place has the potential to go far in little Waunakee and I hope it does. I'm sure I'll be back really soon to try their drinks and baked goods!
