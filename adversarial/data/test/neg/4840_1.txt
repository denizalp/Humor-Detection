Stay away.  I echo the review of William C. \n\nI've used this company and they are messy and not professional.  They have signs on the major roads and that is what got my attention at first.\n\nThey are not licensed. However, there are some other sprinkler repair companies which are not licensed but are good.  Keep searching elsewhere.\n\nThank goodness there is a website like Yelp!!
