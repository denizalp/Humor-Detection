This is one amazing sweet shop...get the key lime tart, almond croissant, bear claw...all taste delicious...and what about a tamale in a pastry shop....which taste surprisingly good..for $1.50, you won't be disappointed...by the way, the price is way cheaper compare to the shop on the strip.. will be back for more for sure.
