I read the reviews on Yelp and decided to give them a shot. I've either paid too much or had cheap parts that would last a couple of days you know how that goes.  John was on time, he was actually early for our appointment. He showed me what was wrong, then let me actually see the price of the item unlike other \"Wizard of OZ\" behind the curtain mechanics. You will get the price straight up no hidden bull.  I was able to ask him any questions I had and he answered with much respect and knowledge.  One thing he told me was or I'm putting this in general is he treats everyone with honesty because that is how you get loyal customers in the long run. My car is up and running and I've got John's number for future repairs. Thanks for the power steering repair.. Toyota Celica 93
