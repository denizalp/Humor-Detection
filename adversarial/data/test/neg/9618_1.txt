I think this is a great idea!  I love the idea of it being upscale but affordable due to it being a school.  \n\nThe service was good as the students are definitely trying their best.  I went on a night where the kitchen staff and floor staff had just switched too, so everyone was \"new\" at doing their job, and for the most part it was still good service. There were a few slow times though, but that's going to come with any school that is servicing the public.  \n\nThe food was pretty good overall.  I'm not going to lie, I'm writing this review about 6 weeks after I was there, and while I remember it being good, nothing is specifically jumping out at me as something that was truly above and beyond amazing.  But it was definitely worth the price of the meal.  \n\nMy only complaint is that the meal was listed cheaper online than it actually was for dinner.  I also believe the menu posted online was slightly different.
