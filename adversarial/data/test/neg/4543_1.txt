Quick recap: legit Mexican for a legit price. Small place with great service.Pretty much a hole in the wall place that is worth checking out. \n\nThis place is a bit out there with no major highway or retail spot which would bring traffic in. Unless you live close by you probably won't know it exist. \n\nWith that being said I would recommend people make the drive to this place to check it out. Pretty authentic for a good price. \n\nOnly thing I will say is that the chorizo here is not as spicy and full flavored as most chorizo you find in restaurants but it's still good.
