Visited this place from out of town and was pleasantly surprised. \nThe chips and salsa was great. Took some salsa home for a great price. \nI had the shrimp terriyki with rice and it was delicious. Everyone else at the table enjoyed their lunch too. \nGood food, the bathroom had one stall out of service and the place was a little run down. But the food made up for it.
