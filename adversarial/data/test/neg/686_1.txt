Love this place, excellent staff and nice atmosphere. I love how big the rooms are and the fact that they come with a full kitchen and laundry. This is the only place that I stay in Vegas. The only issue that I'll have is that the internet (which you have to purchase) is horrible quality. I spent my money and wasn't able to hardly get any internet access. Also I didn't like the fact that the front desk staff doesn't give chnage and usually has attitude when you ask for them to break money. But other than that this is my favorite place to stay in Vegas
