Very expensive but very good Chinese food. The service is fast and friendly. The food is cooked immediately and is out in minutes. On a slow day, you can see the chefs watching you eat just to make sure they didnt screw it up. If you're willing to spend the extra dough, then go here. The lines can get long though, but they move people in and out rather quick.
