I went to Thai Lahna yet again last night because I am addicted.  The complexity of the curries are amazing, but I love the pineapple fried rice with curry powder, scallions, tomatoes, shrimp, chicken, spices-----and they will really heat it up with the peppers!  The staff are always very friendly.  I usually go once a week now that I'm back in the Phoenix area------oh, and don't forget the coconut ice cream!
