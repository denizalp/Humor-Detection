Allegiant charges for everything be very carefull when booking online which by by the way they charge for and call it a convienance fee  ..they charge to board the plane early,they charge to pick your seat early...they charge for water..ect ect....Now if I fly a major airline [to Grand Rapids Mi. ] I get frequent flyer miles that are worth around $40 a round trip...Once in a while [ proubly once in 10 flites ] I get a $300 bump this averages to be worth $30. per flite.Allegiant has no FF program or do not over book..so if I deduct that $70. I dont think I save any money..But even with all the negetives I still fly Allegiant because of thier non-stop flights ..Around 3 hours to GRR and 4 hours back to LAS is worth it to me...
