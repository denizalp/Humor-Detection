I went to try this massage place because of two massages groupon special, man it was the best one I had, the first touch by Dana on my back was really firm and strong, and that's when i could tell it was going to be a good massage. She really took the time to massage the spots that you have the most pain. Also, when I went back to the place for the second groupon massage I was half an hour late because I was in a car accident, i was like there goes the massage, and when i called her later I did not make it in because the accident. I was really happy when she told me not to worry about it and re-schedule for another time. The second time was just as great as the first time. I will definitely go back in the future any time i need it massage to relax.\n\nBTW they moved to a new location at Bethany Home recently
