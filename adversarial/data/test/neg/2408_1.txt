We have been to this location a handful of times and always have had a positive experience.  Yesterday, I took my daughter in and it was terrible.  Carla was the stylist on the floor and while she was nice, she did an awful job cutting my daughters hair.  I asked for her to trim off about 1.5 inches and add in some light textured layers to help lift my daughters curls.  Since my daughter is 7  I didn't want to hoover, so I sat up front.  I was shocked by how awful the cut was.  The layers looked hacked and her hair was crooked (which she corrected upon pointing it out).  I didn't say anything, because I didn't want to upset my daughter.  Thank goodness hair grows... just not fast enough so save my daughter from the butcher job.
