I like this hotel for two reasons: Mix Lounge on the 64th floor (amazing views) and Fleur by Hubert Keller, the french tapas place (delicious). \n\nI haven't stayed here so I can't comment on the rooms, but if you're looking for a place to stay, you'll be definitely be surrounded by good places to hang out and eat.
