Food was awesome and service was great. We had ribs, bbq shrimp with bacon skewers, prime rib, salads and onion rings.  Everything was delicious and plentiful.  Table next to us had steaks and they seemed well pleased too. Margaritas were just okay and they need some horseradish to go with the prime rib but overall it was great and we can't wait to come back.
