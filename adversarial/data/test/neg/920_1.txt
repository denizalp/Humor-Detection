Came here late on a Monday night with my Friend. We wanted to get boiling crab but it was already closed so we gave this place a shot. The ambience is just like boiling crab. It even smelled good. What is cool about this place is that they have a lobster claw machine, where if you were able to grab it, you could win the lobster and they would cook it for free. \n\nI wanted to order half a pound of shrimp with a side of rice and French fries. I usually do half a pound of shrimp because I can't finish a pound of shrimp when eating with rice. When I got my order she gave me a pound of shrimp. This got me very confused because I ordered only half. Then she told me that they don't sell half a pound and only by the pound. The server never told me that. And I asked her if I could return the rice then. Thankfully the manager was very nice about it and said the rice would be free. And apologized about the confusion. The sauce is okay, they don't give enough. I had to ask for more sauce. The sauce costed extra but didn't charge me because of the whole shrimp confusion. \n\nAfter my whole experience, I realized I still like boiling crab better. The employees are nice but the food is mediocre.
