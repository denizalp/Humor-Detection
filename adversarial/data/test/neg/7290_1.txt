Saw it for the second time last week. If you are \"ehh it's ok\" on Beatles music you will still like the show. If you love the Beatles, you will pee your pants in excitement. \n\nThe theater is fairly small and even the back row of the cheap seats has a good view of the action. In fact, I think the cheap seats are better than up front, because they allow you to see more of the action, for half the price. \n\nStill, I'd pay full price to see this over and over again.
