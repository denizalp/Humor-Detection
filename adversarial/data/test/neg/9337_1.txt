I LOVE THIS PLACE.  The first time we ate there it was 21 years ago..I  go there for the chicken livers with a tarragon cream sauce served over a bed of linguine.  YUMMMY.  Hosted a dinner party two years in a row for 40 people and the bill was ...reasonable.... Fun place to go...not fancy ...dated...but the food is good!!  The lasagne was yummy too!...and hrmmm what else did I steal off someones plate...stuffed mushrooms..and hrmm scampi..  LIFE IS GOOD
