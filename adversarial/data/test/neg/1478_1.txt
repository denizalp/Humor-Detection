Went today for the first time and it's not bad! There are better Korean restaurants out there in my opinion, but that doesn't mean I wouldn't come back here! \n\nI ordered the Jun Special Combo because I wanted to be able to try a little bit of everything and it was quite good. My uncle got the bimbimbap and that was delicious! My cousin got the meat jun.  All the food was good, not spectacular, but good :) \n\nThe service was kinda ehhh haha She got us our drinks and took our orders, but she rarely checked on us and even though the restaurant is small it was kinda hard to flag her down to get our check. The water tasted kinda funny too in my opinion. I think my favorite thing is that you can order the side dishes in cartons to go! I will definitely be going back to get a small container of bean sprouts, my fav! \n\nAll in all, worth a try and the prices aren't bad!
