Went here with a friend. We had the tonkotsu and tsukemen ramen with the fried chicken appetizer. The appetizer was free with the punch card!  The fried chicken was excellent. Tonkotsu was great in my opinion, large bowl to maximize surface area for eating with just enough of everything. My friend thought the tsukemen was only ok. Will probably return another time!
