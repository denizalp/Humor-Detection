My wife came home one day raving about this office and the staff there. Being a business owner my self I had to come and just see it for my self. So I picked her up after her wisdom teeth removal and the staff and office was top notch like she said.  \n\nNow it's my turn to get a few things worked on. I have to pay out of pocket so I did shop around and they also have the lowest prices.  \n\nIn conclusion great staff , nice doctors , amazing office and lower prices in town. I don't live anywhere near by its worth the drive they also have extended hours too.
