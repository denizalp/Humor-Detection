I am so glad that I found Boca Park Animal Hospital shortly after I moved to Vegas. The veterinarians and vet techs have ALL been exceptional with my three dogs. They truly care about each pet that comes in and really go out of their way to give them the best care possible. Kim (vet tech) was especially kind answering many of my questions regarding  my new puppy and even gave me a bag full of her dogs clothes. She is super kind to all three of my dogs and greets them every time we come in. I am grateful for the exceptional care they have given to my dogs: Dr. Gibson operated on my Sadie and kindly followed up several times to check on her. Dr. Hill very compassionately treated Baby Jax after he had an accidental fall, and Dr. Ensign has been amazing treating my Bailey's heart condition and monitoring Jax's health during his puppyhood. I love that they invited him to come in for free play days to help ease his experience during his shots. It's also great how they have holiday events and toys for pets. I highly recommend this Hospital to all pet owners!
