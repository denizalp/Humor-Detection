We bring our whole family here. The kids actually do not dread going, which is rare. I never took care of my teeth and are very nervous and filled with fear when going to any dentist (should never watch the movie Marathon Man) but the team there is always helpful, nice and make me feel as much at ease as I ever will at a dentist office. They really are a wonderful dental group. You would be happy at this place. I rarely write reviews, but this place deserves one.
