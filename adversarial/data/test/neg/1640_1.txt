Just left this place. I preordered food weeks ago for thanksgiving, including a pecan pie. Apparently, they don't have any pies left... even though I preordered and reserved today, this morning, as pick up date\/time. They offered to give me two pumpkin pies for free, but I already have that covered. They also offered any other pie, but I don't want things I don't need and that my family doesn't like. I asked if more would be made and they said no. I asked if the other store had them and apparently they do. So now I'm dragging myself to South Park for a pie. Why am I even doing this? What a waste of my time. If you offer preorders and can't fulfill your obligations, why should I ever preorder?\n\nThanks for wasting my time during a busy holiday week, Whole Foods\/Amazon.\n\nAlso, the bakery's current posted health\/sanitation score is below 90. Maybe not getting the pie is a blessing in disguise.\n\nUpdate: I called and had them cancel the pie at the other store. I'm not wasting my time at that place today. I have too much to do today.\n\nAlso, I was planning to buy beer, wine, champagne, and other side items and snacks for tomorrow from Whole Foods. After this happened earlier today, I decided against that and will be picking up everything else from the local beer and wine store, and Publix. \n\nIn the grand scheme of things, this is about as minor of a problem as anyone can possibly have in this country. However, you failed a customer during a huge holiday (the biggest at my home), and you lost a tremendous amount of trust. \n\nEnjoy selling Echo Dots. I just want my pie.
