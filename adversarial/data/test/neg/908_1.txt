I dropped in to ask about hydroponics, as I was totally clueless.\n\nThe guy holding down the fort offered me a very large compendium of gardening that included a very informative section on hydroponics (but was very helpful in most every other area of gardening). The book cost about $20.\n\nThis is a very large warehouse that should satisfy the needs of every contractor or landscaper.
