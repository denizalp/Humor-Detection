After getting mediocre haircuts at places like Fantastic Sam's and Supercuts, I was in search of a professional salon. I found Boulevard Salon on Yelp! and decided to give it a try since it had so many great reviews. \n\nI made an appointment with Jessica and I was taken care of very well! She is a master at what she does and was able to finally cut my hair exactly the way I wanted!\n\nI highly recommend Boulevard Salon, especially Jessica. You definitely won't be disappointed!
