This is a little slice of the east coast in Vegas. Bagel cafe has all the trimmings of a full scale deli and restaurant. The deli side has fresh meats, fish and favorites such as chop liver, on display and ready to order. \n\nThe restaurant side has comfy seats and a wide menu. \n\nTry the Asiago Bagel, toasted with cream cheese, tomato and lox. \n\nThe pastrami is cut to order and great. \n\nThe only downside is that they do take their time. You could easily wait 10 to 15 min for a order at the deli counter, so make sure your not in a hurry.
