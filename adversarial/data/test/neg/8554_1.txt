I had another OB-GYN for my first baby, but the experience that started off great just didn't last. The doc was fine, but her staff was rude and their wait times were outrageous.  I was recommended PV OB-GYN and couldn't be happier!  Dr. Crum is AMAZING! She's caring and the staff is fantastic! She delivered two of my babies and I wouldn't go to anyone else. I even had some insurance changes and was willing to pay out of pocket for this place - but eventually they took my insurance. Highly recommend!
