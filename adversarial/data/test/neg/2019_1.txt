My husband and I were looking for a nice place to board our 2 little dogs while we went on vacay for 10 days. After searching the Internet we found Wiggles and Wags and we r soooo happy we did. We just picked them up after their stay and this is the first time EVER that they looked happy and healthy after boarding them. We r so grateful that we found a place that will take care of our precious furbabies as well as we do. Thanks so much to the staff for taking such GREAT care of them!!!!
