I really like the idea of sushi bowls\/sushi burritos but dannnnnng this place gave me the runs . But who knows if it came from this place lol.\n\nAnyway, I made my own bowl, equipped with spicy ahi, yellowtail and shrimp tempura. I think it's best to get half rice and half salad. Keep in mind that you can get whatever toppings as long as it isn't the \"extra .50\" tab. Things like crab, masago and avocado was extra .50.\n\nThis place does give a lot of fish! Like 5 scoops of spicy ahi. Gotta admit the yellowtail was a bit fishy. \n\nI think the chipotle mayo was what messed my stomach up. Try as many dressings as you like before they smother it on your bowl!
