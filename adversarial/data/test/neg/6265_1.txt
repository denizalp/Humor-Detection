I have long been a big fan of improvisational theatre.  Ever since performing in high school and teaching shortly after graduating, improv will always be an exciting memory for me.  When the chance came up to go watch some improv here in Calgary, I jumped.\n\nThe Loose Moose Theatre Company has been around since 1977.  They are well known within the improv community for being a top act.  They recently moved to the Crossroads Market and perform out of that location.\n\nWe had the good pleasure of attending one of their Friday night Theatresports events.  Theatresports is where they combine traditional improv with a competitive team environment.  Effectively, teams compete against each other to make you laugh.\n\nThe quality of the individuals and teams was incredible.  They definitely know how to perform and both my fiance and I were laughing all the way through.  I've also heard great things about their other events, but haven't had the chance to check it out.  But for Theatresports alone, I walked out in pain from laughing!
