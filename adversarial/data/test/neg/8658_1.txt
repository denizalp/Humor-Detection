This place is awesome.  The staff working here know what they're doing and are very patient with us DIY'ers that come in and have tons of basic questions.  There's a shorter balding man in particular who is absolutely wonderful in helping out.\n\nThe big surprise: they have a full lumberyard down the alley behind it.  Reasonable prices for lumber right off the Ossington strip.  How many times did I walk by this place without knowing that?   \n\nThey have all the essentials and some extras.  I've mostly used them for the basic hardware supplies and lumber, but they have a full set up for paint and carry quite a range of high-end kitchen and bath fixtures.  \n\nSkip renting a car to drive to Home Depot.  You may find just what you need down the street!
