Came here after lunch on a Thursday afternoon and wanting something sweet. Decent drinks and okay desserts. Very difficult to find the place but the best description I can give is to look for the office building with greenish tinted windows that has \"100 York\"  labeled on the building.\n\nThe atmosphere is more targeting teens and the younger crowed with menus that look more like a child's story book. Its weird see men in suit and tie holding what looks like a child's menu. If I was opening a cafe in this area I would probably be targeting the many office workers in the area. But I guess it gets most of its business from the younger crowed during the night since its been around for so long.\n\nLarge Macchiatto $6 - WARNING - wait for it to cool down or sip very slowly or else you might get burned like I did. The drink is topped with cool whip cream so when the scolding hot drink hits your lips its a painful surprise. The drink itself is sweet and pretty good.\n\nLarge Cappuccino $5 - lots of foam on top, pretty decent flavour.\n\nAlso got a slice of cake called the Cherry Potter for $8.50 - probably the most expensive slice of cake I have ever purchased. Fell way short of expectations. It was basically a New York cheese cake with apple crumble and cherries. The syrup sauce from the cherries were over powering and really didn't taste really good and ruined the cheese cake itself. Most expensive and one of the worst cheese cakes I have ever had.\n\nService was good as there wasn't really that many customers at about 2:30pm.
