First time here. Went to see Captain America (AWESOME!) and needed a place to eat before the show. Read a lot of good reviews so I figure I'd check it out.\n\nWas by meself and welcomed by George the bartender. I did sit at the bar. George was great. Very personable and welcoming. I ordered the daily special: Halibut over a veggie succotash. Outstanding! Perfectly cooked fish and the veggies were flavorful. I chose a Chablis (yes the REAL Chablis from French Burgundy) and it paired wonderfully with the Halibut.\n\nI didn't have time to try an app or desert. But the Entree was excellent! I will definitely be back!
