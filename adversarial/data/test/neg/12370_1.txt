Stopped here for lunch on Sunday and was blown away. Everything was amazing! Chips and salsa were the best I have ever had. Salsa was very fresh with the perfect amount of spice. The chips were light, not greasy and deliciously salty. We also ordered the chunky guacamole which was also perfect!\n\nI got the garden enchiladas which were topped with a tasty green sauce that I highly recommend. The fianc√© got a duo of shrimp tacos, one fried, one grilled. Both were good, but as with most things, the fried was unbeatable. \n\nThis place makes pretty much everything in house including tortillas, chips and salsa, etc, and you can definitely taste the difference!\n\nThe service as awesome too! And so was my bloody Maria which was only $5 since it was Sunday. \n\nWe went 3 days ago and I am still amazed by how delicious the food was.
