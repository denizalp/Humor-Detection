I have been going here for 11 years and it has always been amazing food made by amazing people. Sophocles and his staff are the best in town. I am moving out of state and tonight when my wife and I were deciding where we wanted to have our last date night meal together in Las Vegas, it was an easy decision. We knew we wanted to have Kyklos and just as always, not only did it not disappoint but they exceeded our expectations. In our plans to move I have been looking forward to the exciting new opportunities and had few things that will I genuinely miss about Las Vegas but I can honestly say I will greatly miss Kyklos great food and Sophocles and his friendly staff. Anytime we come back to visit this will be number 1 on our list to visit. If you want the best Greek food definitely try Kyklos!
