Go here!  I have never had a bad meal here.  Not always known what exactly I was eating, but good is good in any language.  The plates are deceiving, you might think that it is small portions, but you will be satisfied.  You need to go here.  Every time I visit vegas, I make it a point to come here.  It is a must stop place.  The food is amazing, and the service is good.  The waitress is very helpful and informative.
