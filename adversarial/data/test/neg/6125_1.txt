I was very excited to try this restaurant as I love pho and with make it yourself, what's not to love?\n\nPros\nChoose your own soup base, noodles, toppings\nEasy set meals that come with a free drink\nDiversity in drink menu- important as I am caffeine free\nEasy to order, no language barrier as you just mark down in a box on paper what you want\nFish base soup has no msg\nTom yum soup although spicey is not too spicey\nService is good\nPlace is busy. Opened 11am on Sunday, we got there at 11:30 and it was getting busy- by 12:30 there was a line at the door!\n\nCons\nCash or debit only, no credit\nFood was mediocre, I had the beef tripe, beef brisket, egg noodle, and Tom yum soup base. Could be what I ordered but I am looking forward to ordering a different base next time.\n\nI will be coming again to update my review.
