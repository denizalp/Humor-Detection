Chocolate chip cookie: I pride myself on making great c.c. Cookies and I taste test them from every bakery that has the, to justify my claim to greatness. These were excellent chocolate chip cookies.\nSnicker doodle: as good\/better than the chocolate chip\nBoston cream cupcake 10\/10, great texture, flavor, filling, topping. Everything\nFudge filled cupcake: the buttercream on top was one of the best I've ever had\nCherry\/cheese Danish: sweet but not too sweet flaky goodness. Fillings were on point. Would get this again every time.\nFrench cream\/cinnamon muffin: nice texture, great flavor\nProbably the thing I liked most was that none of these items were overly sugary sweet
