I forgot about this place for a long time because I was buying my quick Asian food elsewhere but elsewhere closed and after paying for a sit down dinner at a Asian restaurant plus tip recently - I decided it was time to return to Chino.  I ordered the pork fried rice and egg fu yung bowl.  Old school chinese with vegies.  My biggest complaint about fast Asian food and buffets are that they are all about bland meat with very little vegies but Chino did not disappoint me and they were super fast.  I will be returning to work my way through the menu.
