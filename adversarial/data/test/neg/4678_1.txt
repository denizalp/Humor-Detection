RIPPED OFF!!\n\nBeware of the difference between what the U-Club shows you in their slick on-line advertisements vs. what you actually get on your plate. My wife and I and another couple decided to dine there on Feb 13, 2015. The advertisement offered a champagne toast, roasted rack of lamb (4 chops were shown in the picture) an appetizer and a lucious looking dessert. What we got was NO champagne (our server said she would bring some for a charge), 2 tiny pieces of lamb, (not 4) and a sliver of dessert. All of this for $40 per person plus tax and tip.  THIS IS THE MOST DISSAPOINTING MEAL AND MOST EXPENSIVE MEAL I'VE EVER HAD.
