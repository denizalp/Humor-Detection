I went there to find a cause for a propane smell coming from my 04 pacifica and ultimately fix the solution. After inspection and taking apart my manifold. they told me my upper lower intake manifold parts were ceased, ( the flap and motor).  they also told me there was a vacuum leak coming from the manifold and that is the cause of the propane smell. They also warned me that my engine light will come on and stay on forever which I never had and my suv will not pass emission. they promised a replacement for my upper lower intake by swapping it from one of their buddies as dealer quoted an outrageous amount for that part. They told me they were doing me a favour by doing that and told me to wait as the mechanic guy have to drive up there to get the parts. they kept me waiting for hours and hours for THREE days promising me they will pick up the parts and  start working on my vehicle after taking care of the other vehicles in their bay. yup, the send me home twice after causing me to wait 6+ hours a day. I left the vehicle for two night as they have taken apart the manifold. my only option was to tow the vehicle as they taken apart my parts and they were working on other vehicle. I wasnt going to do that because of the cost. On the THIRD DAY they found out that their buddy manifold wasnt compatible with mine as his was from a 4.0 l pacifica engine, and mine was a 3.5 l engine. After much  disappointment AND FRUSTRATION, especially after keeping the vehicle with them for TWO night and sending me home for TWO DAYS after LONG WAIT Frank told me  they will TWEAK the manifold and eliminate the smell. guess what, after paying them $300 dollar the cost for repairing my manifold, the smell of propane was still there.  My car ran in perfect shape before bringing it to their shop WITH NO ENGINE LIGHT. It still ran the same and the smell of propane was there. I dont know what I paid $300 dollars for, they havent fixed the issue. they told me the smell was a result of someone prior doing propane test on my vehicle to check for leak and it will fade with time and driving. I dont buy that at all. I been driving my suv for 4 months now and the smell hasnt went away. I will never go the shop again. They are not loyal with their promise. kept me waiting as much as 7 hours a day FOR THREE DAYS and sending me home claiming they WERE busy, offered false promise. Maybe because I was  young and Frank thought he can take advantage of that. I cant believe I paid $300 dollars for a problem that was not fixed. Its all Frank's fault. the mechanic was a young guy as well and he seemed knowledgeable. But even he himself was confused to the smell of propane. I will NOT go to that shop again. $300 dollar wasted on a repair that was not REPAIRED. PATHETIC!!!
