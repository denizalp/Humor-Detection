The interior is very charming and rustic. I loved the glass jars that surrounded the old fashioned light bulbs. This restaurant was just amazing!!\n\nWe started off with some classic biscuits.\nBiscuits- They were so soft and fluffy. The honey butter and peppery tasting fruit jam were delicious. \n\nLow and Slow Smoked Chicken Salad- My mind was blown. The flavors and texture were so so good!! I am not a salad person, so I am very thankful that my friend decided to order this.\nThe chicken is soft and mixed with corn and a creamy buttermilk dressing that had a citrusy flavor. This is placed on top of a slightly sweet fried cornbread. There was some chicken and crunchy cornbread in every bite. I wish that dish would have lasted forever!! \n\nFried Green Tomato BLT- Even though there were only 3 small pieces, they were packed with flavor. The fried green tomato was topped with some hummus made from peppers and pork belly. This is an interesting pairing of flavors, but they work well together. The pork belly melted in your mouth. I wish they gave more of the pork belly!\n\nBacon Hash- The hash was made of Yukon potatoes, yams, and pork belly. It was good, but was my least favorite appetizer item. I would not get this again.\n\nDulce de Leche Strawberry Waffle- The waffle sounded delicious so we got it. But, it was just a waffle topped with some cut strawberries and a dollop of cream. It was a decent waffle. This was definitely not worth the $15 price tag. \n\nIf in Vegas again, I am making sure to revisit. The overall food, attentive service, and ambiance make this an awesome dining spot. The next time I visit, I am going to order 2 Low and Slow Smoked chicken salads and eat them myself.
