Their chow mein and fried rice are sooooo delicious! Wish I could get them in half portions because the portion size is HUGE (!!!) and sometimes I only want just a little to satisfy my craving, not enough to live on for 3 days.  I also highly recommend the walnut shrimp.  The staff has always been excellent and super friendly.\n\nI didn't give it 5 stars because every time I go here I always think \"DANG that was expensive\" but I guess for the portion size it's about right. Like I said, if they offered a half portion of fried rice and chow mein for half the price, I'd be a happy camper.
