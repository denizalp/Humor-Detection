I work nearby and go here all the time (at least once a week). The servers are really friendly, I love the breakfast & lunch options, and the food is always fresh. During peak times there is a wait, both to be seated and sometimes for your food, but nothing out of the ordinary. Probably not worth making a trip for but if you're in the area it's a solid option!
