Recommended. \n\nI've been getting haircuts here now for almost six months. Eli has many years of experience, he does an excellent job and he can also be quite personable and conversational. \n\nDuring my first cut, he recommended that I let my sideburns extend more downward ... it was something I had been considering for quite some time ... and they look very good that way! \n\nEly works hard, all day long, six days a week, taking his craft seriously. \n\nA true barber shop in atmosphere and craftsmanship.\n\nUPDATE: Ely now only works FIVE days a week! Good for him!! His chair is dark on Saturdays and Sundays.
