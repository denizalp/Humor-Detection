Excelente from start to finish.  I am very picky when it comes to Mexican food as both my grandmothers were great cooks.  This place does not disappoint. From the friendly service, the addicting salsa and simple yet delicious tacos. I had 3 steak and 1 shrimp and they were wonderful. I love the cabbage in the tacos.  You could taste the love in these dishes.  Can't wait to return and try all the other plates.
