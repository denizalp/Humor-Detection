Hands down one of the top five meals I've ever had. King crab, potatoes, and corn in garlic sauce and it was perfect. We also tried the calamari and the kids had wings and fries. The people were so friendly and the food came out quickly. We were visiting from the US and the first thing we asked was if they had locations there. Sadly, nothing in the US just yet but we have our fingers crossed!
