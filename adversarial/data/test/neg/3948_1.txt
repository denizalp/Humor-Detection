I'm 27 and currently going through chemo treatments for breast cancer. The ladies here are amazing and know how to help with style and color for all age ranges! I've been to about 10 wig shops searching high and low for one that fits my needs, and I'm so thankful to have found this place! They were so helpful and really went above and beyond to make sure I found what I wanted! Now I can stop worrying, thanks ladies!
