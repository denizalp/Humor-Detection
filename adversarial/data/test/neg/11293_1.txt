Delicious and fast service. It's hard to find a good taco place in Scottsdale that isn't completely Americanized. This place has tacos that are bigger than a quarter and for a reasonable price. Go to other Mexican restaurants here and you'll be paying a lot for less than average tacos that won't even fill you up. They also have great Horchata and Jamaica! Definitely making this a regular spot for me and my family.
