Worst place ever.\n\n- super unorganized , even though they all work right beside each other seems like they have no idea what the other is doing. Setting up delivery was a nightmare etc \n\n-terrible communication. they don't call back after several msgs left. Don't email when they say they will etc\n\n- have no idea what products they have, even on their own website, which also doesn't work properly\n\n- zero customer service. Especially the sales manager Avo.\n\nBetter off going ANYWHERE else other than here.
