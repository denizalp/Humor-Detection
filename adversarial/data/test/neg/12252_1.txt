Their pizza is what I have been looking for ever since moving to NC from PA.  Its the really good thin floppy fold it up and eat it kind of pizza.  The atmosphere reminds me so much of small little italian pizzerias that run throughout Philly and NJ.  Wonderful food. We got there about 11:40 for lunch and by noon there was quite a line and most of the tables were filled.  Go a little early and have your pick of tables.
