I love that this place caters to so many different tastes, with both authentic Chinese dishes (yes, authentic) and Japanese dishes + sushi as well! They manage to do both really well too. We came for lunch and it was decently full. Service was a little wacky with many different waitresses and servers coming to our table but they were all cordial. \n\nThere is a sushi buffet for lunch, but they also have an option where you can get 2 rolls for $7 or 3 rolls for $9. It was so cheap that my expectations weren't very high but the sushi was definitely better than some fancier\/more expensive rolls I've had in the past. They are small, but 2 is perfect if you aren't super hungry. I like how there isn't a super thick coating of rice around the fish, which happens at other buffet places.  I'd recommend the buffet if you have a large appetite or came with a large group of people. I also tried a spicy beef dish off the Chinese szichuan menu and it was very tender. It is definitely spicy though. \n\nFor the price and quality, this place can't be beat.
