I looked around and heavily researched ordering a cake for 40 people for a close friend's b-day party. After calling\/e-mailing & dropping by 10-15 bakeries & cake places, I finally found Rondi. She was extremely professional, easily responsive & accommodating in all my requirements; even adding cake for 10 additional people 1 wk prior to picking up the cake
