Finding a cafe like this one that serves good coffee AND has plenty of places to sit and study is a rarity. The first time I went there, the barista recommended I try their crab dip. I did, and it was arguably the best decision I've made in 2016- SO GOOD. I'm now verging on \"regular\" status there.
