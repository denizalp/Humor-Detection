Went there after work on a Monday night after work with a fellow chef to get a quick bite. Worst mistake ever! My burger I ordered was beyond dry and the coleslaw looked like it was sitting out in the open for hours. My friends Mexican wrap that he order was missing cheese and the lettuce in the wrap was warmer than the meat. I have no idea what type of chef would let that type of food leave his kitchen, but I will definitely not ever go back. Stay far away from this place!
