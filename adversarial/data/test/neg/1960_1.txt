Worst food at a Japanese restaurant  I've ever had. So disappointed in this restaurant.  I've had better maki rolls from my grocery store in Wisconsin!  The spicy edamame was bland.  The sockeye salmon roll was very bland and tasteless. This was a dinner I hope I can soon forget.  I thought I would have a great dinner here in Toronto but did not.  The service was ok.  I would recommend that the Ritz Carlton take it off their list of recommended Asian restaurants. Terrible, terrible, terrible!
