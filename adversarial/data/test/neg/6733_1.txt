I was referred to this place by a friend actually. I came in hoping to get my problem fixed, but my hopes were crushed. My air conditioner in my car was not blowing. I left the car there overnight. When I came back to get my car the next day there was leftover trash in my car. I let that slide, because my air was blowing again. The air was hot, but I figured it needed time to start blowing cold air again, so I waited a day. The air was STILL hot. I took it to get checked by someone else, and they said there was no frion in the car. There were no leaks, so it just was not refilled.. As a shop who is supposed to make sure everything is fixed before giving someone their car back, I definitely think it should be their responsibility to make sure they put something as simple as frion in my car before giving it back. Not only that, but not my car has problems starting up since they changed the ignition switch. I had horrible service by this establishment, and I will never go back or recommend ANYONE to go here.
