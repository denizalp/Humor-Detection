This bakery is awesome; just like you might find back east. Went earlier today which wasn't super busy, but not slow either. The staff were courteous and helpful.  Bought a German chocolate cake for a birthday; the cake was phenomenal - probably the best German chocolate cake I have ever had! We also tried the Napoleons, Devil Dog and Rugelach- all of which were amazingly good!!  Totally worth the calories - no regrets with stuff this good :-)!!
