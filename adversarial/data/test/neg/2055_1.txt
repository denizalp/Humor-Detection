The very first time we came here, it was an amazing experience.  Conch fritters were amazing and the sandwiches we got were delicious!  But the sandwiches are only during lunch and they took conch fritters off the menu and switched it with another fritter.  It is pricey, but the meals are customization.  Nice when you're trying to eat healthy!  Also they have an ad at LA Fitness that says that you can get a discount on lunch when you show your key tag! :)
