Omg, can't believe I've missed a Mexican restaurant in\/near Pittsburgh!  Went here with my miserable (Pitt lost) husband after a game. No friends were in tow...so perfect for trying a new restaurant. We got a window seat right away and continued to love the night. I had the chicken enchiladas and my husband had a burrito....along with the chips, salsa, drinks......soooo good. Fresh, large portions..hubby admitted (after fried ice cream) it was a winner!
