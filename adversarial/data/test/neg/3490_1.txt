Found 2 plastic pieces of jagged edges on two separate occasions inside the food. Like someone was trying to kill the customer. And had to go to doctor to look at the lining of my stomach for ulcers. Doctor said to stop eating whatever trying consume. You do math. The reviews below are just family members of the owner. Try googling little. Truth is close by.
