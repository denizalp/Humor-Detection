My husband found this spa and booked a package of treatments for me as a belated birthday gift. It was wonderful! There was some confusion initially as to my appointment time, but the staff worked it out. Sarah gave me a wonderful massage that I needed very badly. She was very knowledgeable. I enjoyed my time in the salt room after it. Bella provided great service and conversation during my mani-pedi. I would highly recommend this salon\/spa and if I lived in the area, I would be a regular! \n\nUpdate: Going on 3 weeks since my manicure and it has officially lasted longer than any other manicure! I've been swimming a lot and still do not have any chips and it still looks good. Bella is a miracle worker!
