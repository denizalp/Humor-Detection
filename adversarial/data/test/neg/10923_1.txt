Weird new setting, before we used to go we could order chinese and Indian food at same time , doesn't matter where we sit. I went today and my whole family of 7 had to go back empty stomach as they don't allow both cuisine at one place. We can only pick one. Such a disappointment! We are local north Olmsted resident . Now this restaurant is no use for our nice family dinner.
