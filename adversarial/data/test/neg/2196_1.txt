Perfect little hole in the wall pizzeria tucked in a corridor on the third floor of Cosmo. Pizza was delicious, served quickly and they do such a brisk business here that everything is always fresh rightout of the oven. No seating in the pizzeria itself but there's plenty of comfortable hipster loungers and couches around the pool table directly outside the shop. Great little find.
