I scheduled an appointment to have a tooth evaluated and treated with Dr. Shalev because my dentist said I most likely needed a root canal on the tooth.  I was fully expecting to get a root canal because that is what my dentist said i would need done, but she doesn't do that type of work.  I have never had anything done to my teeth other than regular cleanings and having my wisdom teeth taken out about 15 years ago.  \n\nDr. Shalev did an evaluation and said my back tooth was cracked and I had an infection at the bottom of my tooth.  He took his time to educate me on the structure of the tooth and showed me the x-rays that were taken and explained that there was an infection at the bottom of the tooth.  He said I could get a root canal or the other alternative was to get the tooth pulled.  He said going the root canal route without insurance would cost a couple thousand dollars because you will then have to get a crown and follow-up with it.  I could opt for the extraction and it would probably be a couple hundred dollars or so.  He said that I wouldn't need to replace the tooth with an implant if I didn't want because it was my back tooth.  He said I would want to get an implant if it was a front tooth or cornerstone tooth, which it wasn't.  But that was up to me.  He did say that if I had the tooth extracted without adding an implant that the tooth above it could go down because of gravity.\n\nI really appreciated Dr. Shalev's honestly in giving me the options, helping me to watch out for my wallet.  I would have never thought of extraction had he not brought it up;  I was fully expecting to have a root canal but I opted to have the tooth pulled.  I asked if he pulls teeth and unfortunately he said he didn't.  He said that he'll send a report to my dentist.  He did however give me some antibiotics for the pain.  I asked lots of questions and he was very patient and answered every question I had.  I liked that he did seem rushed at all and took his time with me.
