I would give it five stars because their food is amazing but it's so expensive. I love their breakfast sandwich but for $12 it's pricey. You don't get a side but you get a 1\/4 of an apple or a few grapes. Their chocolate chip cookies are amazing. They have really good sweet treats. My husband swears by their gyro.
