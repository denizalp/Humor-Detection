I live very close by in the area and have known about this place for quite some time... Managed to stop by this morning for brunch and it was not what I expected.  For some reason, the exterior of the Van Horne plaza is pretty off-putting, but the inside of this restaurant is very homey.  My friend and I got the early bird and it was pretty good!  The scrambled eggs were done very well along with the rest of the potatoes, toast, sausage\/ham.  Will come back again in the future!
