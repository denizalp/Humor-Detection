We had patio reservations at 6:45 so the sun was setting as we got there.   The sun went down quickly which make the setting on the patio so great.  \n\nWe were there celebrating our anniversary while on vacation.  We've eaten here on several occasions during trips to the Phoenix area.    It's always the best meal of our trip.\n\nWe both had salads.  My wife had the filet while I had the ribeye.  They were both prepared perfectly.  We ended the meal sharing a cowboy candy bar for dessert.  \n\nYear after year Lon's continues to be a great place to eat a special dinner.
