Hmn,,,I wanted to give 2.5 Stars but there is no such option, so I will give 2 stars.\n\nI never liked pho till maybe a year ago, and I had since been a fan of such delicious comforting food. I have been going all over the places downtown Toronto to try pho at different restaurant. This place is okay, I get the idea they are kinda cheap.  They don't serve huge potion and, and the basil and meat everything is smaller size than most places that serve pho downtown Toronto. So I dont think I will go back. The taste is okay, nothing special.
