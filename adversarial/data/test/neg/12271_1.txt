Mark the bartender is amazing! Such a charismatic guy and is so polite. My first time visiting was unsure about a \"wine burger\" but I've tried beer bratwurst and I love those. The woman cooking my burger was also a blast and did a great job on my burger with how I wanted it cooked. Burger tasted great and loved that there was an option for pepper jack cheese! Will go back 10\/10
