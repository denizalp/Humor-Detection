Just got off the phone with radiology specialists who apparently has nothing to do with this hospital....  but originally got my (wrong) insurance information from this hospital because they didn't provide appropriate communication. They still have the wrong information. They apparently can not get the right information the hospital because THAT would be a hippaa violation. So I have to spend my morning with my kids screaming dealing with their BS customer service 20 minutes on the phone while my kids fight because they can't get my damn name right four months later meanwhile... centennial hills? Summerlin? No issues. So yeah this isn't changing don't go here. They don't give a damn they can't get their crap together they won't make a policy that aligns with federal law until they're forced to.
