Okay 2nd time using ABT Electric and I remain soooooo impressed.  The first time I used them for installing all of my various Ring products which included them having to cut into my stucco and install flood lights.  Amazing service, zero mess and friendly electrician.  Yesterday they were back to fix my BBQ light, rework my garage and laundry room lights and mount a TV (which included breaching the stucco AGAIN)!  All work was done perfectly.
