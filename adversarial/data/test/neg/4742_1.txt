After searching everywhere online for a wedding chapel in Vegas last minute of all things this was hands down the best decision! Carrie was a life saver by the way! She was extremely helpful & always attended to every detail I requested. Response was fast by phone and email which is a huge plus because as a stressed out Bride it helped ease everything. I didn't see the venue until an hour before I walked down the isle & again I was not disappointed! The pastor & photographer were very sweet & caring as well. I would highly recommend the package upgrades & also the DVD of your ceremony. It's a beautiful memory & everything turned out great. We had our ceremony in the Pavilion at 8 pm & it was beautiful! It was even big enough for both sides of our friends & family. I also ordered my bouquet through Carrie, I sent her a picture & told her what type of flowers I wanted & her staff did an amazing job putting my bridesmaids bouquets as well as my bouquet together (I put mine in a shadow box for keepsake). Champagne was also brought into the bridal suite for the girls & myself just sayin. I could go on & rave about how much I loved this place but I'll just end it by saying they took really good care of me, so I know they will do the same for you.
