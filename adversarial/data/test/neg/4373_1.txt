If I can give 10 stars I would! The staff were very knowledgeable, inventory are ALL the fun, and the staff was superb. The overall experiance was amazing! They have range supervisors so, it feels really safe. I shot the Kriss FULL AUTO, and the .50 cal is worth the rush. And I'm military, I thought I shot it all.
