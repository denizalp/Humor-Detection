Haven't been to Chianti in many years. Only to the 17th Ave location. This was our first time at the Crowfoot location. Sadly, we keep forgetting it's there.\n\nWe arrived and it was busy, but not crazy busy. We were seated within 5 minutes and didn't have reservations.\n\nOrdered up a couple beverages (glass of wine & beer) from our bubbly and friendly waitress.\n\nDecided to start with some appetizers.\n\nAppetizers ordered: Calamari Alla Romana & Bruschetta. Both were very good especially the calamari. Will have it again.\n\nWe were ready for dinner and they have a great menu, a bit of everything. (pasta, salads, mains, fish etc. etc.) which made the decision a bit hard since I wanted a bit of everything.\n\nDinner ordered:  1 Cannelloni & 1 Combinazione Della Casa (Cannelloni, Fettuccine and veal parm in this combo) \n\nThe cannelloni was baked and delicious. The Della Casa, which is a combo of three things was great as well. Loved the spinach fettuccine. Will order the combo again since it gave you just enough to sample all three and be full.\n\nAfter the replenishment on our beverages, we ordered some coffee and dessert.\n\nDessert ordered: Tiramisu. It was really good and tasted fresh and authentic. Not sure if they make it in house but it was really great.\n\nService was great. Food wonderful and very economical for all the food we did enjoy. Will be back now that I have tried a few things and know the location of this Chianti's.
