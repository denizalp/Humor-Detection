I have never been to a vegan\/vegetarian restaurant as good as this. Fucking fantastic! I just moved down from Utah and they don't have shit there, now I am eating my heart out at all these wonderful places. I had the cauliflower tacos with a side of fries and my mom had the hummus plate. Everything was delicious! :) Those cauliflower tacos were soooo good!!! The seasoning and sauces and flavor were great all around. Absolutely nothing to complain about. Also had a blonde cookie\/brownie thing and that was heavenly. I miss great yummy cookies and pastries and this definitely hit the spot for sure! My mom is not vegan or vegetarian and she really enjoyed all of it too! A million thumbs up!
