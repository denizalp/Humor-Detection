We stopped in for a late and small dinner.  Overwhelmed and over eatting in Montreal.  So, we ordered a burger, medium rare and fries with a side of coleslaw.  We started with the coleslaw, a vinegar based slaw, and it was great.  Reminded me of the fish fries in Milwaukee that always came with great coleslaw.  The hamburger arrived and it was darkly charred.  My husband and I didn't expect it to be medium rare inside but it was.  The charred outside kept the flavor in and the meat they use was delicious.  Speaking as someone who really enjoys a great burger - this one made it to the top.  And the service was great.  The guy outside told us that Mister Steer had been there for 60 years.  I can see why, great food and great service.
