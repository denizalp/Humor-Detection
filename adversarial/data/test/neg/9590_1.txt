In a search for a Michoacan alternative, Boyfriend and I ended up at Chapala's. Side note: how are there not more sit-down Mexican places around?\n\nThe restaurant was probably 1\/4 full, which always makes me feel weird. I love excellent service as much as the next person, but when servers have too much time on their hands, they hover and it creeps me out. Thankfully, a minimum of hovering here. The complementary chips & salsa were tasty. The chips tasted fresh. There were two salsas: a hot and a mild. They were not kidding about the hot, but it was really good, so I continued to torture my poor tongue :)\n\nBoyfriend got beef enchiladas. They were swimming in sauce and the filling was all beef (no veggie overload in there!). I had the carne asada tacos. Oh wow, were they delicious. They reminded me of street tacos: well-marinated meat with diced onions and cilantro. Nothing else was needed! Highly, highly recommended entree.\n\nIt's cheaper and tastier than the Michoacans. We ate for $30 out the door.
