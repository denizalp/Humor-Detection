I've eaten at several Boston Markets but this is the one closest to me. In my opinion, it's far superior to most fast food but it's nothing special.   It is good if you're too tired make dinner and want something fast and tasty.  The people at the counter are always very nice and helpful.  The side salad is actually pretty good and has more variety than your typical lettuce\/carrot combo.  The mac and cheese and the creamed spinach are really good if you're not watching calories.
