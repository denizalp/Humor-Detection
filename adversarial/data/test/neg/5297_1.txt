One of the places i went to when i visited phoenix. This place is pretty interesting, first time i encountered a chinese-mexican fusion.\n\nIt did not disappoint though. I tried their jerk chicken, jade red chicken, rice and beans. They were pretty good.\n\nI dont see myself going back to Phoenix but just in case i do, i might go and stop by this place again.
