Felt like I went back in time to the early '90s. Not a ton of games, but enough. It was very dated, but very clean. It's more for kids between 5 and 12... however, 12 seems pushing it.\n\nIt has LaserTag, so that was cool for the bigger kids.\n\nI did order two pretzels at the snack bar area that never came. We to leave so I didn't bother picking asking what happened to them. Only $4 lost. The GM seems flustered by everything.\n\nSomething good was that most games took only 1 token to play, unlike the other kid's themed pizza places that cost almost $1 per game. \n\nOver all, not sure I would go back. However, if my kids got invited back for a Bday party like this time. I would take them. They seemed to have enough fun.
