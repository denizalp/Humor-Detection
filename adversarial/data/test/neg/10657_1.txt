Always a favorite spot of mine for lunch. I recently had the Sheridan sandwich with some field greens which was absolutely massive and delicious. The turkey was so tender! All of the staff is highly attentive and make sure to suggest beers that you may like according to what you are drinking (happy hour is bad ass too, $2.50 draft).\n\nI'd also like to mention that it's one of the only places I've been to that actually plays good music. None of that today's hits mom n pop crap. We're talking old and new school hip hop n such. Awww yeaaahhhh.
