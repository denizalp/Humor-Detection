The decor, the food, the service was all beyond fabulous!!  The BLT app really good!  Their fried chicken is truly the most moist, tender, and flavorful chicken I've had in my life.  Their shrimp and grits with the chicken jus was also  the most flavorful and delicious I've had ever.\n\nI loved their cocktails particularly the watermelon sling - gentle and smooth. \n\nOur server was Tom Brady (obviously not of the Patriots) and he made the experience beyond great with his perfect food and drink recommendations. \n\nThis is definitely a spot I'd come to again next time I'm in town.
