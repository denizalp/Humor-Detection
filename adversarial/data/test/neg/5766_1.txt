Came here for after dinner drinks on Saturday night at 10'ish.\n\nBeerbistro is divided into two sections: dining area and bar. We sat in the latter. The bar has a lot to offer including beers (both domestic and intl), wines, and pub grub. By reading other reviews, it seems that there's brunch as well. The dining area was crowded so I think it's safe to assume that the food here is good.\n\nUpon taking a seat, our drink orders were taken (awesome). Service was quite entertaining as well. There was a live jazz bland in the very well-lit bar area.\n\nI'm giving this place a SOLID three stars for now, but this based solely on my experience of coming here for DRINKS (only) on a SATURDAY night. I just wasn't feeling the vibe. My sister tells me that it's different on weekday nights. And I would have no qualms coming here for a nice dinner.\n\nA-ok for going out on a Saturday night ~
