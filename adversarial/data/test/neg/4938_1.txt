We love our pizza so it can be difficult to find a place that has new, different, out of the box toppings. This place nailed it! We got their loaded tot-zza, which is their most popular, and toppers classic. I absolutely fell in love with the loaded tot-zza as I LOVE my tater tots.\n\nThey have a crazy amount of sauces to choose from and three kinds of crusts. They also have gluten free options. You can tell they take pride in their work and believe in quality, not just getting pizzas out the door. \n\nCute place, friendly polite staff, and delicious pizza. They are only take out or delivery. Bummer, I would have loved to sit and eat our creations.
