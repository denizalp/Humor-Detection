My new favorite place is Scottsdale! I stopped in this morning for a bagel sandwich. They had exactly what I wanted and the entire experience was exceptional. Upon entering, you are greeted by a friendly worker who either takes your order or seats you. My server, Vanessa, was exceptional. She took my coffee order right away and returned promptly with coffee in hand. After taking my order, the was attentive but not over-bearing; very efficient and friendly. The food was great. I had the egg-a-bagel with pepper jack cheese and bacon. Also, USE THE YELP CHECK-IN OFFER FOR A $0.01 MIMOSA! What a great deal! You'll see how big the drink is in the photo. All in all, a great experience and I am so glad I decided to try NYBB out for the first time!
