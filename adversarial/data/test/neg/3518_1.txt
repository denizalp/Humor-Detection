I must admit, at first sight I was a little skeptical, but they have some amazing food here. Loads of flavor, lots of food, and inexpensive prices. If it's your first time there, they give you free samples of their menu and explain how to order to you. If you are in the area, you have to try this place. If you're not in the area, it's still worth the drive!
