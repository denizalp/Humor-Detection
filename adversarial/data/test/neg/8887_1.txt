Very cute little place, very comfortable seating inside. Nice and cozy.  Menu is large, but not too large. The people were friendly.  The food came out pretty quickly, we got the BBQ for 2 with brisket, pulled pork, and rib tips. The meat was nice and tender, very smokey. Everything tastes homemade. I did get a mouthful of fat that was kind of gross with the pulled pork, but that's kind of unavoidable.  The fries were battered, which I love. Greens were good, potato salad was good. I am picky with potato salad, but this was a nice, mild, savory type. The only reason it lost full 5 stars is that mouthful of fat was unappetiZing, there were a TON OF FLIES that keep landing on me and my food incessantly, and they had a \"don't tread on me sign,\" so that was uncomfortable :\/
