This is a regular spot for us. Overall we enjoy coming here. The place has a good vibe and the menu has good variety. They have recently made some changes to their menu and we are not so sure we like it yet but we will visit a few times to give them a fair chance before we decide. Service tonight was great. Jess was our sever and she's very friendly and approachable. She checked up on us just enough as she never interrupted our meal but always made sure we were ok. We had the bruschetta and a pound of medium wings. The bruschetta was ok. It had a bit too much of the garlic ailioli sauce - we prefer more of the balsamic sauce instead. The wings were good but they could have been cooked a. It longer. Overall we will be coming back again. A good mix of service, food and atmosphere that are all equally pleasant.
