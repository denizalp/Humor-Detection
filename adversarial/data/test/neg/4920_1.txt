I wouldn't give any stars if that was possible. Service department is horrible. I was given a loaner. Loaner left me stranded. Tyson is the service guy I had. He quoted me an extra $600 for service that he said it may or may not fix the problem. When I picked up my vehicle that was never smoking or turned off on me well that's exactly what happen. This place is horrible and worse if your a woman. They treat you as you know nothing about cars. Never again.
