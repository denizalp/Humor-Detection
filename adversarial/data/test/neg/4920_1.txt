This store has unfriendly, unprofessional staff. We walked in and nobody said anything to us, not even hello or at least asked us if we needed any help. We walked around the store for a good 20 minutes and still nobody said anything to us. The two girls were just at the cashier talking but totally ignored us. This is one store that I won't be visiting again. We won't be buying our next dog here.
