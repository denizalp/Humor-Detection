This Cafe Rio location is by work and home for me and I eat here often. The service is always fast and the food always good. My favorite meal is the barbacoa (don't order this if you don't like sweet meat) tostada with the house dressing. I've ordered pretty much everything and have had every kind of meat they offer and all of them are so good! There's nothing that I wouldn't eat, if ordered. TIP: If you don't eat the tortilla from the salad, you can totally order the tostada and save a couple bucks!\n\nOn the contrary, the desserts are not very good. I've tried all of them and I wouldn't order any of them again, nor did I finish them when I actually did. \n\nAnother down side is that the Cafe Rio drinks aren't very good towards the end of the day. I do understand that they don't make a new batch when they are close to closing, but I can't get my favorite drink (horchata) if it's after 7pm because it just tastes terrible.
