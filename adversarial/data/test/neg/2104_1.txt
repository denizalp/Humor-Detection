The avocado fries and cheese and cheese curds were delicious! I can't say I've ever had avocado fried before, but I'm also surprised I've never seen the option on a menu before this. Two cheese crisps were also more than enough for three of us to share. It was surprisingly filling. My favorite was the fig and prosciutto, delicate balance of figs and arugula. Overall, food was good, but unfortunately service was slow for a partially filled restaurant for food you wouldn't expect to take that long..
