Hubs and I tried this for our date night.  We split the Outlaw burger.  It was cooked very well and the fry basket was cute.  The only hiccup was the efficient was an efficient waitress who cleared our table while we shot a game of pool, but we didnt leave anything at the table to show we were still there.  All cool!  We will go back and enjoy anither good time.
