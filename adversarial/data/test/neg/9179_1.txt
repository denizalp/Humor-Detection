Service was excellent. Cooks have ever a lot to be desired, do not know ghetto difference between over easy over medium or over hard. I ordered my eggs over medium first they brought them over easy, returned them to get over hard. Upon returning these eggs back they still came out over hard. Retrain cooks possibly managers as well.
