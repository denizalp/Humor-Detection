Great customer service!!! I set up an appointment online, but it did not fully register. When i came in at my appointment time they could not find anything in the system. Thankfully Cheryl called my insurance and verified everything for me, so i could keep my appointment and repaired my windshield, which was great considering i knew they were very busy i could hear them handling several calls. Janet also did a great job with making sure my daughter and i were comfortable offered us drinks and crayons so my daughter could color. Before i knew it my car was finished very fast and friendly service. All the staff was very smiley and i did not hear them say no the entire time i was in there. They are making sure all windshields are fixed.
