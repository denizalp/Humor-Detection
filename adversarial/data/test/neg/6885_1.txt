M&M is a nice restaurant. I think they have problems accommodating a large crowd for restaurant week. Service started out good, but then they had problems with computers, so paying the bill ended up taking 4x longer than it should have. Steaks were over cooked. Sides are too big and looked like family style. Should have been told so we could have ordered more variety.  Ameretto cake was good and moist. I thought there was supposed to be music at 7, but when we left at 8 we saw the musician leaving. Couldn't figure that out. I think M&M would be better at other times.....not restaurant week.
