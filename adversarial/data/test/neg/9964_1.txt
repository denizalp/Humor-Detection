As far as Ramen goes, this is my go-t- recommendation for a trendy Charlotte place. The inside is small, and has a tendency to be noisy. I usually get seated at the communal \"farm\" tables in the middle of the restaurant. The brussel sprouts that \"move\" seem to be a commonly ordered side\/appetizer, but in my experience it is more about the novelty\/instagram factor than about the taste. Skip the brussels and get the steamed buns as your app.
