Similar to other reviews, this Starbucks is not pleasant. I only will go to this one if it is a last resort. And, every time I have to go as a last resort, I remember how horrible they are.\n\nThe drive-thru has very rude staff. They don't immediately hand your credit card back which is rude. I want the card back before you give me my drink. \n\nThe staff get annoyed when you order something custom. The last time I checked, Starbucks is supposed to make your drink according to how you order it. \n\nI've been in the drive-thru with a messed up drink and have had to go back inside. They are rude about remaking a drink. \n\nI would never tip this location. I would recommend driving down  the street to another Starbucks.
