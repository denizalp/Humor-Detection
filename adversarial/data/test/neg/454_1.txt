In Toronto on business and went for dinner by myself.  No bar to sit at, which was a disappointment.  Restaurant is very nice inside and wait staff was good.\n\nI had the Pistachio Goat Cheese Salad and the Cataplan.\n\nThe Salad was very good with a generous amount of goat cheese.  I hate when restaurants put a tiny bit on the salad.  Not so here!\n\nThe cataplan was ok.  There was plenty of fish, Salmon and another type, clams, mussels, and squid.  My complaints on the dish are two fold.  First it was so freaking hot that I couldn't touch it for 10 minutes.  Even then I had to blow on the food before I ate it.  Secondly, there is a lot of broth which goes to waste.  I would prefer to have some rice with the dish, or even better have the rice cooked in the stew to make a sort of payaya (I know that I killed the spelling on that).  I think it would be a more satisfying dish of there was a way to get the great broth flavors integrated into some rice.
