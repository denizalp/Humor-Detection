Went here today during my exam study break time to carb up, and carb up is what I did. I have the fried eggplant with vegetable toppings. The bread was perfectly delicious and so were the toppings. The only downside was that I asked for it to be spicy and it wasn't at all, and that it was super messy. I got sauce everywhere, and used a ridiculous amount of napkins. \nService was nice and friendly, I'll be back and I can't wait for my next messy and delicious visit.
