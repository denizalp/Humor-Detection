While the hotel is freshly renovated, certain amenities are BROKEN.  Pay per view lacks content, and is generally stale and has only older movies.  The stay connect app has not worked in months, even after reporting it.  Internet, is painfully slow, even if you pay for the premium.  I would give this a 5\/5 rating if the internet, stay connect app and pay per view worked.  When you are away from home for an extended stay, you need some of these simple items.
