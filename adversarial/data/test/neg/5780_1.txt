Worst service ever! We came here after a concert,  and I understand it was busy and the waitresses were running around. But when you have been sitting at the table for more than 20 min without getting acknowledge that should of been our first clue to leave and go somewhere else. We finally got a waitress to take our drink order and she kind of seemed upset, because we had no lids on our drinks and I didn't even get a straw. After placing our order we waited an hour to get our food. We kept in mind they were busy, but when groups that came after you get their food first and faster than we did that's when I had a problem. At this point we were ready to leave and we wanted to pay for our Horchatas that were just ok and the waitress kept ignoring me and left me standing at the register. Might I add another lady that came in at the same time as us had the same reaction and we were both complaining loudly. That's when we were just at the point of walking out, since they didn't care to take my money. As soon as the rest of my group (3 other people) got up our waitress was there with our tacos. Literally the tacos are all over price and not worth it. Go somewhere else!  Service is horrible, food is horrible!
