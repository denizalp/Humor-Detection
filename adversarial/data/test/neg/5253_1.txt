I, like most people, first heard of Origins on Yelp via a deal that was advertised. I went in with neutral expectations and was pleasantly surprised. Lucy was very professional, the ambiance was decent and the use of aromatherapy was perfect. The only negative I have isn't even about this business at all, more like the location of the office within the business. So for that reason, I still give this place 5 stars. I'll definitely be back!
