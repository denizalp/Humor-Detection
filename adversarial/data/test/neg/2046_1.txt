Ordered a large Sicilian thinking it would be big enough for 2-3 people for the price of $14.95 but it wasn't. A little soggy when we took it home. Ordered margarita pizza which was good but cold. But 9.00 for a small sandwich! THats ridiculous! I would of rather of gone to jersey mikes next door!  $34 for 2 sandwiches and a personal pizza is ridiculous!! Sandwiches didn't have much flavor either. Don't know if I'll be back!
