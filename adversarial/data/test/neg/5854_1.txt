Came here just yesterday on a whim, got a table right away, it was quite empty so I thought it wasn't going to be too good (good places are usually packed).Was i wrong! The food is reasonably priced, absolutely delicious and filling and the service was outstanding! The manager here is absolutely charismatic, attentive and just flat out wonderful. Great experience and will definitely return!!
