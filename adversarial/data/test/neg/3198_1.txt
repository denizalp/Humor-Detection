First timer and most likely last timer. Came in around 1pm. I wasn't familiar with the concept so felt a bit lost. I asked a worker how it worked and rudely responded \"can't you see the menu behind you\". Secondly I started ordering a quesadilla with their new meat. Same worker rush me threw the line avoiding questions I had. Payed $11 for a greasy cheese quesadilla with spirits of meat. Another restaurant claiming to be Mexican when it isn't.
