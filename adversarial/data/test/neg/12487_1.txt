The food was delicious but the service was disappointing. We were late for our reservation time but still got seated, that was nice. The place was a bit empty and that's why I didn't understand why it took so long for  everything. Drinks took forever, food took forever. Had the pork taco and carne asada it was yummy.  The guacamole taste authentic and fresh. The quesadilla was a joke lol ... it was small small little think. It's an okay place won't pick it but will go if invited.
