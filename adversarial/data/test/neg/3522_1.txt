Tucked away across from the Charlotte Trolley building you will find a packed Futo Buta! I have had this restaurant on my radar for some time and decided to stop in for lunch during the work day. It was crowded as I predicted but seating was available at the bar so I took it. The menu looks delicious from start to finish. Offerings ranged from a pork belly ramen to sushi. I decided to try the dumpling app, sushi and ramen! I need to stop here and say that ALL of the food--including the food I saw come from the kitchen is both yelpable and instagramable lol. You want pictures of this food! \nBack to the review- the dumplings were the Kuronuta Pork and Scallop Gyoza. They were flavorful and unique. For sushi I tried the Salmon Belly Nigiri. It was fresh, colorful and melt in your mouth good. For ramen I chose the Tonkotsu. The broth was bold and I especially enjoyed the organic black mushrooms. \nOverall my experience was very positive. I will be back!
