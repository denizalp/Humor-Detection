Disclaimer: I have not tried their chicken sandwich, which looks amazing. I can't do a breaded chicken sandwich so bummer on me. What makes this place great for me is they are willing and able to do a \"naked\" style chicken for me. I get all their delicious cajon seasoning with none of the breading. Score! The missing star is due to their artisanal sodas instead of regular Coke products.
