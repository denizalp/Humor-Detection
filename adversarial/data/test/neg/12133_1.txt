Came in for a full set with shellac 2 days ago and 2 nails are already chipped. I am on vacation from work so haven't done much to cause a chip. Poor work done by one of the male nail technician. None of my nails are evenly shaped or match length with other hand. When I told him that it didn't look right during session he continued to tell me \"it will look fine at the end\" I paid 65$ for a acrylic full set I don't want something that will look \"fine\" I want something that will look good for this extreme price I'm paying. Will never return.
