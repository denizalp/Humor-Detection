I would advise coming here on the weekend, they have delicious eats and I love the small cafe atmosphere. I have been here several times, and my photos reflect that. I would suggest coming in earlier as it get's really busy on weekends and they sometimes run out of items. \n\nI'm not a big fan of their drip coffee, so I usually grab a coffee from Starbucks next door. I love the Cr√®me Brule French Toast, I'm usually not a big fan of French Toast but they really know what they're doing. Thick Slices of Toast that is usually super moist, topped with Creme Chantilly and in season fruit. Another thing to order is the  Huevos Chiilaquiles, it's really good. Tomato, tortilla, eggs, avocado, pico de gallo, cilantro and delicious thick slices of Bacon. \n\nI have also had the Lemon Ricotta Buttermilk Pancakes which are not bad, I like how moist they are and topped with Lemon cream cheese mousse, Blueberry sauce, & maple syrup. Most of the pastries are really good, the chocolate chip cookie is famous here but it's a little too overwhelming for me. If you have a sweet tooth, you'll enjoy it. \n\nKeep Eating, \n\nAngela
