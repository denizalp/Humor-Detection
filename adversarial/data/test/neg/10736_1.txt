I just enjoyed a classic Italian meal that was surprisingly delicious and nuanced.  The place itself is unassuming from the outside, but given that it's March and 3 degrees F outside, it's no wonder they keep the shades drawn.  Entry is through the side hallway in winter since they close the patio.\n\nOnce inside however the restaurant itself feels a bit cavernous, but very comfortable; with a split-level floor plan and small bar area.  It was sleepy at 7:00 pm on a midwinter Wednesday, with a few solo travelers like me and a few couples, and one larger family party in the corner.\n\nThe service is friendly, attentive, prompt and unpushy.  The menu is classic and simple.\n\nI had the Caesar salad, the Agnolotti and the Tiramisu.  Each dish was very delicious and exactly what I was hoping for.  I could say something here about \"travelers should be grateful such a place is nearby since not much else is;\" but frankly, the place is good and would do well anywhere.\n\nI also ordered a pizza to go since the Tripadvisor reviews were all about it; I was full from dinner but it smelled so good I had a bite and it's awesome.  Pizzas are made and cooked to order, thin crust, and done in an open fire brick oven right there.\n\nI'm here for six more days, and I'll definitely hit this place again.
