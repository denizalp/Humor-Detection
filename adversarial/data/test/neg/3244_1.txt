FOOD\nThey stuff your wrap with a fair chunk of meat! Not too many dine in and mostly take outs. Food is fresh and always busy there. You'd catch a lot of police and firemen grabbing a bite to eat there. The people who works there are friendly.\n\nPARKING\nIts a nightmare there as there's only so much parking in this tiny isolated plaza. During rush hours, it's the worst. If you can wait out lunch or have an early lunch, you will be guaranteed a parking spot. Closer to lunch, you'd have to camp out for a spot.
