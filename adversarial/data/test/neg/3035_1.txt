I like this place :) I lived in Vegas back in 2002 and would take visitors here before going to the strip. The food is good, the wine is free (not top of the line, but what do you really expect for free?) and the service has always been good. \n\nI just moved back and I thought it was just as I remembered. Great place to have a date :) I got the eggplant parm, which I thought was good. Eggplant can go badly and this one definitely did not!\n\nI still think it's a fun place to eat and will continue to bring my friends here for a meal when they come to visit.
