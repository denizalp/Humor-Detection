I'm loving this new Denny's. I like the style and decor. I had an awesome experience. Our waiter was from Hawaii and she made me feel like I was back home. She took care of us even if the restaurant was really busy. Looks like they did just open a couple weeks ago. Food actually came faster than expected.
