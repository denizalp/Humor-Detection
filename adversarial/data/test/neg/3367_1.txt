I LOVE this location! Sammiches are amazing and the decor and music are really awesome. I'm a sucker for ham and pineapple so that pakalolo sandwich is my favorite. The employees are really friendly and are always in a good mood. It's cool to be greeted by the people at the register as well as the ones making the delicious sammiches. Definitely worth a try!
