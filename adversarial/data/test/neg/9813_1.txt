Took the family and had lots of laughs. High energy performer with skill and humor. Interacts well with the audience. Sit in front for a chance to become part of the show. He includes kids too! Excellent juggling act at the end with objects that light up in the dark. Bathrooms just outside the door. Meet and greet with Jeff after the show.
