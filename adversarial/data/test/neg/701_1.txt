Thanks again Stephanie. Best service we had on our stay in Phoenix. Ask for Stephanie!! Today we were in the area for a little shopping and found this restaurant it's on the side of a plaza ...being from California I was weary about the fish. So we check it out... it's empty but little did we know we were five minutes early from open and they let us in with welcoming arms... the manager sat us down and we immediately asked any recommendations and she gave us 4 which 3 of them we tried...first the tempura avocado half (best app by far) which was something out of this world... second we tried the special which was a grilled shrimp and strawberry salad... this is definitely for all those who agree raspberry vinaigrette is a bit to strong this was on the milder side... one recommendation is use a different salad mix rather then the garden leafs.... now to talk about the fish we had the sunset roll as well as calamari the sunset roll was outstandingly fresh as well as a nice kick of spicy to it. The calamari is a must try.... however the food was not only good but our server Stephanie guided us through the entire menu... including knowing every beer on draft... she also knew the lunch special and keep in mind we showed up right as the doors opened and she was ready for us. I thank her for making my birthday lunch amazing for my boyfriend and I.
