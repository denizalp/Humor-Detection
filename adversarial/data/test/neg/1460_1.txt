Ate here a couple times during a long stay in Vegas.  \n\nIt can be pretty pricey, esp for noodles, because you can typically get Pho for less than $10 at any normal restaurant...whether or not it is \"Prime\" pho.  The pho here is $16.95, but just remember, you're eating at the Venetian, so you can't expect dirt-cheap prices for anything...this is how they roll, so you can either roll with it, or roll yourself out to another eating establishment =p  The pho was very good tho, bigger than I expected, and the broth was pretty good.  \n\nThe wonton soup and fried rice were pretty good also, and so was this spicy noodle dish, which I forget at the moment exactly what it was called.  \n\nLines can be long, even late at night, but because you're in Vegas, you just gotta gamble and go when you're stomach wants you to go and see what happens.\n\nWould definitely eat here again, esp if I'm staying in the hotel, just because it's so convenient.  I DID, however, have one encounter with beverage;  how do you run out of drinks? Granted, we got here after 10, but goodness, no Thai iced tea, chrysanthemum tea, OR Pepsi?! Come on!  Gotta stay stocked...people.  That's the only reason for the 3 star rating...if I come 3 more times and they have the drink I want, then I'll bump them back up.
