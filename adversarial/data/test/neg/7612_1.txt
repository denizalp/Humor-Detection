The management at this complex is horrific.  My boyfriend lived here for four years and has indicated to me that he's had nothing but problems with the management.  They hide behind the corporate facade and don't really care about the tenant or anyone for that matter.  Very unhelpful not to mention the price of the rent is very high for what you get.  They put a water regulator on the shower which allowed for no water pressure when showering.  Plus they put a paint type coating product on the tub which never allowed for it to get clean.  They also required to come into the property and install efficiency lightbulbs which emitted NO light.  The location is about the only thing positive about this place.  Worst management ever.
