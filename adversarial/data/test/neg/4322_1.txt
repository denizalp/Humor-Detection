Chicken Lips looks live a dive bar when you walk in, but the staff is friendly and it's a cool place to eat.  These are some of the best chicken wings I think I've ever eaten.  I've tried both the original and the dry rub and they are second to none.  The homemade blue cheese is delicious!  I brought a friend here who does not like blue cheese and he was loving it.  I will definitely be back here.
