Stop selling sushi please. I ordered 2 rolls and was not happy. Very small pieces. Not worth the money. Had no flavor. Spicy tuna should have some type of kick but no not here. Customer service was good no complaints there being it was my first time. However the woman was prepping a container of 2 or 4 ounce sauces in the dining room when I walked in so that kinda made me wonder how else food may be prepped there. She didn't have gloves on and set the pan full of sauce on top of table in the open to be exposed with the ladle sticking out dripping. Would not come back here.
