Located in the lobby of the CIBC building is this chic coffee bar. If you like other small coffee joints like Pilot or M square in the financial district then you will probably enjoy Dineen too. I always get their Vanilla Latte half sweet (regular sugar is way too sweet in my opinion). Their coffee is okay but their lattes are better.
