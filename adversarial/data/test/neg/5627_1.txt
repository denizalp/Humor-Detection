Thought this would be a fun place to take the kids. Our 8 year old refused to try the sushi but loved the chicken teriyaki. The 12 year old got yakitori that was a little dry but still thought it was good. We liked trying new rolls we haven't tried before and the fact that we all got full for $30. Yes there are better sushi places but the sushi was still good here and the conveyer belt entertained the kids.
