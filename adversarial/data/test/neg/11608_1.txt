This was, by far one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. \n\nLet me preface this by explaining that we were in Vegas for a birthday (we are all in our 30s, and wanted to have some nice dinners out), and because we had a party of SEVEN people (one more than they allow for an Open Table reservation), I was required to email a coordinator, sign a contract, agreed to a minimum per person that will be spent, and then put down a $150 non refundable deposit. For seven people. I get it for 10 or more, but there are MORE than enough tables in that restaurant to accommodate 8 people.\n\nI have also eaten at the Miami Yardbird and had an incredible experience -- from food to service. That was also for a birthday, and we were comped dessert (with candle) and glasses of champagne. That was why we went with the contract\/minimum nonsense for the Vegas location (despite the fact that we seamlessly made a reservation at the much applauded Bazaar Meats for EIGHT people and had on of the most exceptional dining experiences ever).\n\nFirst of all, we arrived on time (actually, early by 10) minutes for our reservation and they weren't ready for us, but seated us at some sofas at the bar. As we were starving, and our table was nowhere near getting ready, we asked for two appetizers with our drinks, but the waitress told us, no, we should just wait for our table to order food, and basically denied our food order... so now we're still waiting (because the table we were waiting on STILL hadn't left -- by the way, the host said \"there's another table in the back, but I'm going to seat you out here\" without even giving us the choice) and we're beyond hungry. He was nice enough to get us a round of shots, but frankly we would have preferred food.\n\nFinally we get to the table, and the waiter from the start is lackluster. He barely spoke to us, didn't explain the menu (only two of us had dined at Yardbird -- in Miami -- before) and basically left as quickly as he'd arrived to take care of other tables. We finally ordered, and when the food arrived, he'd forgotten to put in my ENTIRE order. Just mine. My whole table ordered food, and only mine was left out. This was the first time I had to speak to the manager, Scott, about the issue. He was understanding and offered to take care of something off our bill (great). I assumed it would be my meal, as that was what was completely ruined and poorly handled. So at this point, I returned to the table.\n\nWhen my food finally did come -- shrimp and grits -- it was pretty much inedible. Gummy, slimy, not at all appetizing. Another friend got the same thing and we both barely touched it. At NO POINT, did our waiter ever RETURN to the table to ask how the food was. Instead some bus boy came over and TOOK OUR FULL PLATES AWAY without even a question as to WHY we hadn't eaten.\n\nSo now we get the bill. Scott had taken off one or two drinks and a SINGLE order of side Mac and Cheese (we'd ordered three total). I was honestly appalled. So at this point, I went to speak with him again, explaining my continued frustration. Not only had we had poor service, but the restitution of the poor service had been badly handled.\n\nThis was lackluster -- and I think that's being gracious. The food was disappointing (at least four people in our party barely touched their entrees because they were either overcooked or cold) and the service was absolutely deplorable. Scott was great, in the end, but that was the one redeeming factor.
