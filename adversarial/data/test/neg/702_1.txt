I was just tooling around Old Montreal, and I wanted to visit this place because of the live jazz and the outdoor seating.  It was in October, and the flowers were still abloom.  I ordered a pineapple daiquiri, and it was good, but the texture was off.  \n\nI ordered a crepe with ham, cheese, and asparagus.  It was huge, fresh, and delicious.  I took a chance and ordered the strawberry cheesecake crepe as dessert.  It was pretty good but I wouldn't get it again.  It was just something different, and I wanted to stay around longer for the great, open atmosphere and the lovely jazz.\n\nThey aren't the best crepes around, but the food along with the location and ambiance would keep me coming back (if I lived in Montreal).
