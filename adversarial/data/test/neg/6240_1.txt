First had Emerson Fry Bread at the 2016 Taco Festival and it was the best taco I have ever had. I follow them on IG and Facebook but I always seem to miss them by only a few hours. So when I heard they were going to be at the 2017 Taco Festival I bought a pair if tickets and searched them down! I love this taco truck!!
