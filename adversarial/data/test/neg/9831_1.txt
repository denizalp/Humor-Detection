I cannot say enough good things about our experience with the Olmstead Team. We're first time home buyers and had no idea what to expect. From the beginning with house searches and touring to the end when we signed our paperwork, the team made us feel important, informed and excited about the life decision we were about to make. We specifically were especially pleased with Mark Wyant and Monica who were available to us 24\/7 and quite honestly, we still keep in touch to this day. Their knowledge not only about the home buying process but about Homes in general was extremely impressive. They truly are not only the best real estate professionals, but we consider them friends. I could go on and on about all the good things we experienced with our team but I would recommend them to anyone looking to buy or sell a home and cannot thank them enough for making our dreams a reality.
