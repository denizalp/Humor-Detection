Love this place!!  Reminds me of home.  Everytime I am in town I stop by for a coney, fries, and a Faygo.  It is always a blast to talk to all of the other people in this place (mostly midwesterners) about having an authentic coney restaurant in town and finding out where they are originally from.\n\nI have been trying to convince Dave to open in Tucson!  Let's get it done!
