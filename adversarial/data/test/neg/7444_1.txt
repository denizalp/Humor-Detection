We came to this buffet because it billed as the best buffet in town at the time.  We were extremely disappointed because all the food was at the wrong temperature.  The food that should be hot was only slightly warm and the food that should be cold was only slightly chilled.  The flavors would have been good if severed right and that only added to the disapointment,  We walked away wanting our money back and vowing never to return.
