Where do I start this barber shop is like nowhere I have been before the whole place is like a giant man cave. The barbers are a bunch of awesome men cutting hair right and taking the time to make it decent. I got a cut from the owner and boy this puppy looks great some before and after pics of the beard and hair cut http:\/\/imgur.com\/dKpXnFK. I really enjoyed the time he took to cut my hair about an hour and boy the 2 hour wait was worth it every dime 25 bucks and made me feel like a new man. The shop is very full due to these guys having repeat customers just sitting there watching all them do their work is nothing by pure artisanship. They have earned the a long time customer repeat as I won't let anyone else touch my beard or hair.
