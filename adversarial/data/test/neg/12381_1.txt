Stopped in here for lunch and met my bro. The greeter was nice and our waitress Missy \nwas great as well. Lots of great eye candy for the guys :-) TV's everywhere you look which was way cool. They could use a pool table, I thought the food was excellent, a little slow to get but overall I would come back in a heartbeat.
