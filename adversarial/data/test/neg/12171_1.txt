I went on a bus shopping tour down to Cross Iron Mills for the day, and the Michael Kors Outlet (as it is called in the online store directory) was what I was looking forward to the most. Unfortunately, it was a huge disappointment.\n\nFirst of all, I'm not sure that it is even an outlet store. Granted, I did not see any of the merchandise that is currently in their regular stores (except for some watches), but they barely had any sales! There was maybe one table of purses on sale and some little clutches\/wallets. The store itself is small though neatly organized, but the lighting is kind of cold. The back half of the store is clothing, but they don't have any shoes at all - I love MK shoes so I was really disappointed about that. The sales girls just stand there and look pretty - they barely even say hi to the customers. Someone else who was on the bus tour said that she had shopped at an MK outlet in the states this summer and commented that the prices at this outlet really weren't anything special. \n\nThey should take cue from the Coach outlet store - and I don't even like Coach! I would have a different view on the MK store if it wasn't supposed to be an outlet, but as it stands... don't bother going out of your way to visit.
