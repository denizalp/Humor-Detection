My husband and I had been here several times and enjoyed both the food and the ambiance. However, our experience on Saturday night April 8 was horrible.  We brought our son, daughter, son-in-law, and grandbaby, and expected a pleasant, outdoor dining experience.  Instead, the service was incredibly slow, the food mediocre, and the manager failed to properly address legitimate concerns.  We arrived at 7:30 pm and didn't leave until 10pm,  because the service was so slow.   We repeatedly asked for our food.  It arrived 1 1\/2 hours after we ordered!   By the time we got our food, we were all so tired and starving, we couldn't even enjoy it. When we told the manager about the delay, she accused us of being wrong about the time, and tried to blame the poor waitress, telling us she would call over the server and let her explain that she had somehow failed to tell us the kitchen was slow that night.  It was a terrible way to handle customer service and not fair to the server.   The manager  gave us a free desert and 20% off the tab.  But we would have rather had good food, served on time.  We will not return.
