The delivery order that was supposed to take 45-60 minutes took 90 minutes. The food wasn't bad. Portions were very large. Sauce on the eggplant and tofu dish was on the bland side. I requested light ice in my Thai iced tea, and it seems like they put extra ice in the cup. There are plenty of Vietnamese restaurants in the area with better food.
