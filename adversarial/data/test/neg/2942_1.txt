Cafe rio is usually reliable and decent for fast Mexican food... If you haven't eaten here it's worth trying.... But this location (blue diamond) has to be the SLOWEST service of any cafe rio in the country.  Not a one time problem, every time, it takes this location 3-4 times as long to clear a line than any other location I've visited.  If you ever do get your food, it should be pretty good... But that's a big if.
