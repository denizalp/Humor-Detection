HORRENDOUS CUSTOMER SERVICE! We were just at PSH enjoying ourselves watching the game with friends and our kids. We were upstairs and right in the middle of food, drinks and the game and were told to \"wrap it up and go because they were setting up for someone else.\" They also told the group next to us. We were told sorry and they tried to offer us a free bowling pass when we came back. Needless to say, I told the manager we wouldn't be back. Do not go to this place that does not value every customer. Absolutely the worst lack of customer service I've ever experienced! I don't even want to give one star.
