Grand Master Kim has been a gift to my daughter. She has been taking instruction from him for the past three years. My daughters attitude and behavior have completely changed for the better with his influence. He teaches respect, honesty, integrity and shows kids what they can do with a little hard work. I definitely recommend Grand Master Kim and his staff at the World Taekwondo Studio.
