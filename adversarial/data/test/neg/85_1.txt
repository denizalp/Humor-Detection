I've seen Little Miss BBQ showcased on a few different platforms with all raving reviews. Well the hype is real, this place is outstanding! Their customer service is top notch, everyone was very polite and helpful. They have the best brisket I've ever had hands down! Definitely a must stop for some amazing cue.
