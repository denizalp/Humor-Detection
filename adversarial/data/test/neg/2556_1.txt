My husband and I ordered two plates - mixed shawarma plate and minced beef kebab (kefta). The shawarma meat was some of the best I've had across Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal. You can choose your own sides - salad, grilled veg, rice, potatoes, etc - which is almost unheard of at a flat price. The minced beef kebab was made fresh to order. \n\nThere are many wow factors;\n1) well seasoned meat [by far the best I've had; they don't rely on sauces to flavour your meal (even though they have great ones)]! \n2) sides were delicious, fresh and generous\n3) the price is very reasonable as you get an unusually large portion - I could only eat 1\/3rd in one sitting\n4) it's family run and offers warm, friendly service \n\nI didn't try the garlic potatoes but, damn, they looked amazing and the table next to us was raving about them. \n\nCome here.\nYou won't regret it.
