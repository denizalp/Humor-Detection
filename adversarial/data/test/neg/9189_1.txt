7+ years later I still feel the need to say thank you to Dennis and AWM!\n\nAs a college freshman, I bought my first home in 2009. That year almost every homeowner I knew was losing their home and that made the idea of buying a home scary. Thankfully I had AWM and loan officer Dennis M. Zicha on my side. It has been over 7 years and even though I no longer live in that home, I do still own it. That property and its associated mortgage have proven to be a good investment in my future. Over the years I have contacted Dennis a hand full of times and each time I feel like I have been given solid loan advice. If I could rate AWM on a scale of 1-100, I would give them a score of 100!
