I was staying at the El Cortez Cabana Suites over the weekend and popped in here Saturday night for a nightcap. The reviews are great, but sadly, this wasn't my experience.\n\nWe arrived at midnight and were able to settle into some comfy chairs. What I really like about this bar is that it's mellow and you can actually have a conversation here. \n\nPrices were average--not expensive, but not inexpensive. It was $23.50 for three cocktails. We missed the happy hour.\n\nWe had an awful cocktail waitress. It was clear she didn't know much about mixed drinks. I ordered a stoli, soda and lime, and she brought me a pepsi drink. She was fine with the named cocktails from their menu, but not a custom (though not atypical) order. She did have the bartender remake the drink, however. She also interrupted us to settle our tab, even though the bar wasn't closed. It was just an awkward experience all around.
