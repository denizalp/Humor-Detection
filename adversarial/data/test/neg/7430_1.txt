A really great little shop with a little bit of everything - music, movies, books.  If you have a half hour to kill, there are much worse ways to spend your time than idly perusing the shelves here.\n\nI like used book stores because generally I feel like if you can get something in good condition cheap, there's no reason to pay full price and put more waste out there in the world.  The best part is that sometimes people will pencil in funny notes in the margins, or write in their own editorial or revisionist remarks.  Bonus!  It's like the MST3K for books!
