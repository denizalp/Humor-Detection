Horrible service!!! My husband and I had a flight to return home from Las Vegas on September 19 at 12:34 pm.  We boarded the plane on time and once all the passengers were seated and buckled up we just sat there.  After about 15 minutes of sitting there in the hot plane and all the passengers fanning themselves, we are told that they are having some kind of mechanical problem and that we will be leaving in about 5-10 minutes.  As time keeps ticking and the plane is getting hotter we are told that the plane is able to fly to out to our destination but they might not be able to turn it back on to fly back to Vegas. So, it's ok to leave us sweating in the plane although we are able to get to our destination??  After about 30 minutes an older gentleman felt sick due to the heat and had to leave the plane.  Another 10 or so minutes later my husband felt sick also and he was also escorted out ( I wasn't going to leave him by himself so I also had to leave).  Once off he felt better but we were denied access back on due to TSA rules that if you vomit you aren't able to fly out for a certain time frame.  We had to wait at the airport 4 hours and take a flight to a different city and pay for a rental car to get home.  My sister who did fly told me that they were offered a \"courtesy cup of water or soda\" but after the plane was on the air.  Not, while everyone was waiting and sweating in the hot plane.  There were children in there as well. I feel like we should have not boarded the plane if they had issues or they should have allowed us to get off instead of sweating in a hot and cramped plane for about an hour.  Terrible service and lack of empathy towards the passengers.  Next time I will just chose another airline to do business with.
