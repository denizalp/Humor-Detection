When it comes to vehicle inspections, this is the place to go. I was in and out within 10 minutes. Being my first time getting inspected in NC, the handful of guys there were all really helpful and knowledgeable. There's a nice little waiting room with a tv and a vending machine but honestly you don't even have enough time to sit and need either one. I'll definitely be recommending this place to friends
