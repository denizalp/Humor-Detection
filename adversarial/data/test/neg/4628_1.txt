You can't go wrong with IN-n-Out. After hearing about this place open up recently I was wary of trying it. I assumed oh well it's on the strip it's going to be overpriced and slammed in there. Sure enough I was right about one thing. They are slammed. Surprisingly it's the same price as any other In-N-out. My boyfriend came on a Tuesday around 2 o clock this place was busy. No seats to sit inside or out but we got our food fast. Service was really great and efficient. The decor in here I love. There is a clean red and white theme with the little palm trees all over the wall and the outside is bright and neon like any good place is in Las Vegas. We got our usual two doubles with animal fries and a chocolate shake. The food was hot and fresh! My fries were nice and crispy with lots of spread. Definitely coming back to this location
