2nd time coming and the sushi was horrible. Maybe it was an off night but the quality of the fish was very poor. The rolls were bland. I mean, their baked green mussels were so watered down and gamey that I had to spit it out. And it took the waitress at least 15 minutes just to get us water. I live down the street from this place but I would rather drive an extra 20 minutes just to enjoy sushi elsewhere.
