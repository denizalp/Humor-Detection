I have lived in my current home for 6 months. Some. security patrols my gated community - on bikes! They can't even drive after anyone who robs me to get a plate number. This company is a joke. Their security guards look super homeless walking around in their dirty security shirts. I didn't really care much until recently last week when they had a visitor to my home's car towed. It was parked in front of my house, not in a red zone. Did they knock on my door and inform us they would be towed? No! Whatever kickback the towing company gives Simon's broke security guards must have been worth it, and I'm sure unreported on a 1099.  I tried to call the Simon Security company and leave a message, but their mailbox is full (I'm sure full of complaints from customers they constantly fail). I also work out at EDC every year and we joke how their security leaves their posts and doesn't want to be there all night, probably because they pay so poorly and late. Find a real company, one with integrity and one you can actually contact with a problem. This one is full of broke peasant employees with no sense of decency or community.
