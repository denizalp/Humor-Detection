I go here for my tanning vice each time I plan an out of town vacation and need some base. They offer a one month unlimited tan pass in their regular beds, but I notice I need to pay an additional $20 each time upgrade to the 'mac daddy' of beds. This is the only time I notice significant color.  The staff is friendly. DÃ©cor typical.
