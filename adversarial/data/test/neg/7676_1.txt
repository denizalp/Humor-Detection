I dined here on a Saturday evening without reservations.  Initially, the hostess advised us (myself and two others) that we would need to wait at the bar for about 30 minutes, but a colleague of hers was quick to correct her that they had a table available. It didn't matter to us who made the mistake, we were just glad to get a table.  \n\nWe had fresh oysters to start.  Their assortment of sauces was satisfactory.  The cocktail sauce was tasty and the shallot vinaigrette tasted perfect, but the shallots were absent from sight.  I would definitely return for fresh oysters.  \n\nWhen we asked our server about the portions for the Crab Shack Boil, she was forthcoming and told us how it's a rather large portion and recommended we order 2 for the three of us.  She was absolutely right.  My party and I did not touch the potatoes since they'd fill us up too quickly.  We left about  of the food behind even though we had barely touched the bread either.  The food was well-seasoned for me, meaning it might be too salty for those who prefer the lighter seasoned taste.  Their garlic butter was to-die-for!  \n\nThe service was okay.  If you prefer your server approach you every once in a while to check up on you rather than having to flag them down, you're probably better off at Rodney's or Oyster Boy.  \n\nI found that the prices here were well worth a switch from my two other favorite oyster joints.  They have featured oysters here, or their 'specials'.  The price of their special was almost a steal.  12 Malpeques for $18.99!
