The kitchen is very clean. The people are very friendly and it's refreshing to see a chef interacting with the customers and asking for opinions. The chasu is absolutely to die for. The noodles are handmade and very yummy, and the broth tastes very clean and is delicious! I would highly recommend eating here and I commend them for doing so well considering they haven't been open very long yet.
