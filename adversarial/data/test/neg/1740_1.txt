Received discount flyer in mail for 1\/2 off  entree.  So I went after rush hours. Plenty of parking spaces and no wait time. Ordered my 3 adoba chicken tacos with all the topping I wanted (no extra charge for queso,guacamole unlike Chipotle). Was yummy and filled me up. Will be returning to use my BOGO coupon monday. YELP
