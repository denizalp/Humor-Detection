I honestly only came here for the hype and to take pictures of the drinks with dry ice because it looked so cool but... they don't even serve the drinks with dry ice!!! -_- How disappointing and the pictures were so deceiving! When I asked them why they didn't, they said they no longer serve with dry ice regardless of the reviews that I saw on Yelp. I got the lemon drink in a huge mug\/bowl\/whatever you call it and yeah it was a good drink with 6 shots of bacardi and lemon candy but I don't think it was worth the money... way too overpriced.
