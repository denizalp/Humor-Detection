DO NOT PLACE AN ORDER WITH THIS COMPANY. I paid $41.75 for overnight shipping and received my part 4 calendar days later. The part did not fix my garage door opener so I requested a return and asked for part of my shipping fee back. They refused my request on the shipping fee but provided me an RMA to return the part. I returned the part at my own cost of $19.44 and after a month I followed up on the status of my refund. I was told that because I waited 3 months since my request for the return  that they are unable to refund me. I am out $118.18 and they have the part and have likely resold it. I purchase a lot of items online and have never dealt with such a dishonest company.
