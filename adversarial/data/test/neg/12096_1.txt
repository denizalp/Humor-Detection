These guys are absolutely awesome. Eddie and his crew are professionals with A1 customer service. I needed a flat bed truck to tow my AWD car to my performance shop and told me 30 minutes and they showed up 15 minutes later. Driver was professional and extremely knowledgeable. To top it off...and this might not sound like much to most but on the ride to my destination I noticed the truck was absolutely immaculate. In a job that can get chaotic and dirty for their driver to maintain a clean workplace was extremely impressive to me. I won't be using anyone else to tow my vehicles. Thank you Eddie for hooking me up. #BestTowCompanyInLasVegas #WorkHardForWill702
