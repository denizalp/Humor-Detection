We ate there a couple of times over the Thanksgiving holidays; once Thanksgiving evening and once for brunch.  Long lines and waits Thanksgiving evening and $40 a head to get a meal.  The food was okay but nothing I would ever pay that amount for again.  Food lines are hectic and people are so rude and can't wait their turn to access the food (not the buffet's fault) but it makes getting your meal like a foot race to fill your plate before someone else grabs that last chicken leg in the pan.  Staff there really do nothing for you, as a diner, except remove your plate but it seems like tipping is expected...for what?   \nBrunch was okay and lots of choices but once again, don't expect a great breakfast or lunch and then you won't be disappointed.  Vegas isn't a great value when it comes to food and because new customers come in every day and don't likely return to the same restaurant, there's no real real reason to change things up for the better.  We have casinos outside of Denver that offer great buffets including endless prime rib and crab legs for $25.  How do they offer better fare for less money?  Because Coloradans will stop patronizing them if the food isn't that great and they rely on repeat customers.  And the casinos there are smoke free...gotta love it!\n\nWe still love coming to Vegas and visit regularly....we just continue to learn where to eat a great meal for a reasonable price and this buffet won't be on our repeat list....sorry MGM.\n\nThe Smiths
