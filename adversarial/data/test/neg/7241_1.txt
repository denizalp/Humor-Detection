In the world of movers, most are crooks. DAS is just slow and stupid. I had left a voicemail inquiring a quote, and the gentleman did not call me back. A week and a half later I called again, and somehow got connected to this same employee. He made no reference to my unreturned, potentially lucrative inquiry and business. He seemed to have the passion of drywall about customer service.\n\nThey picked my car up on June 29 on Long Island. It was in their New Jersey location for... waaaaaait for it... 2 1\/2 weeks. That's 18 days, ladies and gentlemen. 18 days. I truly believe they only began the cross country trip when they did because I got assertive on the phone - that I will have a rental car place bill them for my travels. The woman on the phone said two drivers will drive 24 hours continuously (tag team driving), and that it will get there in 4 days driving cross country to make up the time. That, to me, sounds dangerous.\n\nWell it's 7 days later, and still no car. They said it will be here July 23. They will have my car for a total of: 25 days. They told me it would be here by 14-21 days, and 21 days was an overestimate. \n\nI give them no stars. They couldn't even offer to wash it as a means to make up for it being late. My Toyota dealership washes my car with every $30 oil change. This company is awful, but if you don't need your car, like ever, and you truly believe incompetence is the spice of life, then this is the company for you.\n\n\nNO STARS FOR YOU! (But Yelp makes me have to give them at least one).
