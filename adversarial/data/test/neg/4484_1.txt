Not good to the extent that I feel obligated to revise the rating.\n\nWe came for dinner and ordered a dinner combo for 4 ($40 before tax).  Services was okay, but the food was not.  The menu said the steamed fish entrée used a live fish.  It was most definitely made from a fresh but dead fish.  I was okay with this one-step decline in quality, because this combo only costed $40.  I think they should revise the menu description though.  The jelly fish tasted like \"overnight\".  The worst was that the meat of the sweet and sour pork had gone bad.  It had a soured taste that was not from the sauce.  The only entrée that was good was the vegetable with mushrooms.  I understood the weather was so hot that it was a challenge to keep meat fresh.  Yet it was not healthy to serve meat that had gone bad.\n\nThey served free desserts.  There were 5 choices: tortoise jelly, almond sweet soup, black sesame sweet soup, sweet tofu and one that I cannot recall.  This offering was new.  It reminded me of now defunct Fung Lam Court on Kennedy Road.  I also saw the manager of FLC working here this evening.  Could there be a change of management?
