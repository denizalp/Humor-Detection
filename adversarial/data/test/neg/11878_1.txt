Normally I am not a yogurt fan, but this place got me hooked! While they only have 6 or so flavors at a time, even the vegan options taste like the real deal. The toppings are always fresh and full. It is a little strange first time, trying to figure out what to do, but once that part is done, the yogurt is memorable.
