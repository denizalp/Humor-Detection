Let me start this off by saying I am a fan of Happy Dog. Going to school in Cleveland, friends and I would stop by to get a drink and a dog. After being gone for a year,my friend and I were looking forward to experiencing a little bit of nostalgia.\n\nHowever...\n\nIt took ANY bartender 10 minutes to actually acknowledge our presence there. No one asked \"have you been served yet?\" There were only about 5 people at the bar in total, and many times one female bartender went by us without saying anything (she didn't seem busy at all!)\n\nThe food here...is great as always, but c'mon. It shouldn't take this long to wait on an order. Thank goodness the food comes out fast. \n\nI planned on leaving at least a $20 tip, but after this fiasco, I couldn't bring myself too. Now, the funny thing is, after we got our food a rambunctious group of mid 30-year olds with their significant others came in the bar and sat right next to us. And how long did it take them to get their orders? About 10 seconds. The female bartender went right up to them and played nice.\n\nI get it, my friend and I don't look like the richest, or the most successful of people, but looks...can be deceiving. \n\nMoral of this story? Please, treat all customers the same.
