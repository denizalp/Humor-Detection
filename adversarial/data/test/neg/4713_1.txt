I'd prefer to give Michael their Service Manager 10 stars if Yelp offered. He is so nice, polite, honest, informative, helpful and he made my appointment process wonderful. I had an on line booking for a different Pep Boys location. I called that location to confirm my Saturday needs only to discover they're limited to oil changes and tires on the weekends. I called  3528 W Cactus Rd, Phoenix, AZ 85029 and happily received Michael and his wealth of knowledge. Pep Boys is very fortunate to have him.
