4 stars for the novel Topgolf experience, 5 stars for the awesome service we received for a unique\/slightly awkward situation!\n\nIf your only experience with golfing is mini-golf.....have no fear! I had NEVER so much as held a proper golf club before and I had an awesome time here acquiring a new skill (the fact that drinks are served here didn't hurt, either!)\n\nI should say...you DO have to get over the inevitable crowd of wandering eyes from neighboring booths as you try to perfect your clearly-my-first-time-golfing swing. Once you get over the stage fright and you actually hit a couple balls, you realize why so many people enjoy golf :) \n\nMy group of 5 were having a great time when one of the waitresses came to clear our table of drinks and spilled her entire tray onto the floor, getting shards of glass all over our sandals and flip flops. It was cleaned up very efficiently, but not before we realized my boyfriend had a small cut on his ankle from the glass. Not a huge deal, but it was definitely alarming to see blood, and we were running out of playing time!\n\nBecause of this debacle, we had to rush through the last few minutes of our time to complete our second game. Luckily, we were later approached by management; they offered to refund all of our payments made towards playing time and memberships, AND offered us a round of drinks at the bar on the house. \n\n5 thumbs up for going above and beyond to make sure customers are happy. I would definitely return to Topgolf, if I ever happen to be near one in the future!
