Visiting from Chicago & so many people recommended this place. Good portions, MOUTH WATERING food & drinks. You can sit on the patio and play games (jenga, bags\/corn hole). This is my favorite place we've been all weekend. It's a a great vibe for a weekend date or dinner with the girls. Did I mention amazing service?
