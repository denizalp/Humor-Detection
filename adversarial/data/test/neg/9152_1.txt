Okay the service was very good.  Grant G is very nice.\nDecorations are okay, the place is cute.\nThe food was soooo disapointing!    The corn muffin crumbled into hundreds of crumbs.  The broccoli was beyond salty.  The stuffed potato with pulled chicken was luke warm.  Nothing about it was hot.\nGo to Lucille's at the Red Rock Casino if you want a good lunch special with a barbeque stuffed potato.  Not only is it good and served warm-it is bigger.  After seeing all the awards this place has received I am puzzled.
