Just not very nice to work with. There is a way to handle situations with potential customers and there is a way not to. Being kind of rude and dismissive is not the way. Having dealt with an agent and talked with the manager I just don't think they really care much about anything other than the bottom line. After having to reschedule my appointment with an agent cause she \"didn't write it down\",  the showing was okay and she was friendly enough, but obviously hadn't done research on the property even though I inquired weeks before. When it came time to put in an offer I questioned their high brokerage fee and that killed off all conversation. I talked to the manager and he had the same defensive attitude and arrogance, he suggested I put in an offer with some other agency. Sounds like a good way to build relationships right?  Maybe I was completely wrong and didn't know what I was talking about  but to respond that way seems unnecessary. 2 stars for the agent at least being friendly at first...
