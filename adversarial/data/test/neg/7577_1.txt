Waz came on an \"emergency\" trip to our house...he fixed the problem with our breaker in about 10 minutes and saved us a lot of unnecessary worry. In the time remaining, he also advised us on some other electrical questions we had about our potlights and adding dimmers, and he gave me lighting decor advice thereby saving me $357 (bad Home Depot online lighting purchase). Great electrician! Nice guy too.\n\nFYI - If you want to pay with credit cards it's 5% extra. He does accept personal cheques.
