I am bummed to see a 1 star. I get all my RX filled here while in Arizona and their customer service is excellent.  Not to mention the guy at the window Joe, is super nice. He remembers little things. (Like my 3 year old loves, waving hi from the car and orange is her favorite color, so he gives her an orange lollipop) . I can't imagine bad customer service at this location.
