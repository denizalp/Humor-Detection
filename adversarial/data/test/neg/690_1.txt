This place is firing on two of four cylinders.  Food excellent; Vibe cool; Service surprisingly bad; Prices surprisingly high.  Showed up with two adults and three kids at 6:45.  Food arrived at 7:45.  Total bill was $107 even with free kids meals.  There are dozens of other family restaurants where we would have had a better experience for half the price.
