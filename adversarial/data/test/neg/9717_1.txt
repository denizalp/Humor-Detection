I am in love with this place!!!! Truly a gem. The entire staff is amiable and are genuinely dedicated to your experience here. We both ordered 6 oz filets, medium. They were cooked to perfection all the sides came with the steak wich is not common. I ordered a martini extra dry, extra olives, I almost immediately had a drink in my hands. They were obviously busy and working hard but they did not rush or give the impression that it was hectic. \nThe outside appearance can deter most it can give the impression of a biker bar but the inside is intimate and quiet. It is like most other yelpers have said, a good fellas vibe. I LOVE BEEF N' BOTTLE.
