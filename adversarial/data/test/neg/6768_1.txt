My boyfriend and I are both Venezuelan food virgin. We stumbled upon this place and decided to pop our cherries. \n\nUpon entering, we were asked if we were first timer and we told the guy yes so he explained everything on the menu, everything! He made me hungry just by the way he was so passionate about his food. \n\nAnyway, we tried the tequenos (cheese sticks), pepito, and (I forgot the name, sorry but it was on the very last page). \n\nTequenos were delicious on its own or with some guacamole or lots! \n\nPepito was good too. I got mixed meat, a generous amount of chicken and beef. It was a little messy to eat but it was satisfying! \n\nThe dish on the last page of the menu, my bf got mixed meat as well and the side option he picked fried cassava. He found the beef to be very salty but the cassava was perfect - lightly fried and well-seasoned. \n\nThe service was amazing too. The servers were polite and friendly. I'd definitely go back to try their breakfast food :)
