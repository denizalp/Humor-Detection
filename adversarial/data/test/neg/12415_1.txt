I love this spot! The food is delicious and the customer service is outstanding. The employees take great pride in their business and it shows. How wonderful it is to visit a restaurant and feel so welcome from the moment you walk in! I would highly recommend visiting Bonjour if you are looking for a quiet and convenient brunch, lunch, or quick coffee option. It was a perfect place for me to meet a friend visiting town without the hustle and bustle of other breakfast restaurants. The chocolate almond croissant was my favorite. Additionally the employees were so good with my busy one-year-old, and that alone makes me want to return again and again.
