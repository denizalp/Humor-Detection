Old school charm in Madison, who knew?! \n\nSmall, dimly lit, fresh popcorn, classic drinks poured by a 2nd generation owner in a pressed shirt and black tie, and the Rat Pack is playing from 45s on the jukebox. Oh, and tigers literally everywhere. \n\nLe Tigre is a surprising relic in a town that seems to have a love hate relationship with anything old. I'm glad it has survived. \n\nWhy not five stars? The cocktails just weren't up to par. Yet, I'll still be back next time I'm in Madison.
