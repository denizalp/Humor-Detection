Love this place :) just wish there was more parking but that's not their fault that some students don't want to pay for a parking pass at UNLV like the rest of us so they take up all the parking spots at these businesses  but anyways I love the food, my favorite is the chicken bowl with brown rice although it is a bit more for grilled veggies and guacamole. The costumer service is great too! Very friendly employees!
