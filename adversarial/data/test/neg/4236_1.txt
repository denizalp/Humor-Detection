I am so happy that these guys came to the rescue. I had gotten a general exam done at 9 am and was scheduled to get my wisdom teeth pulled around 2 at a different Absolute Dental location on a Thursday, my first day off. \n\nAfter having left the general exam, I got a call back saying that the dentist fell ill and left work early and they would have to reschedule my appointment to the next day. That definitely wouldn't work for me because I needed one day to recover, at least! I was pretty furious, as the dentist seemed fine when he was doing my exam, and actually seemed to have some gusto!\n\nAnyway, after calling to other Absolute Dentals, I was getting very vague answers. Everyone saying that they didn't know for sure if their general Dentist could pull my wisdom teeth or if I would have to have an oral surgeon take care of them.... My wisdom teeth were completely exposed and I had already had an appointment set up for a general dentist to take care of it so I didn't understand how one general dentist could do it and not another... I was FUMING.\n\nI called this Absolute Dental and spoke with a sweet receptionist that was very understanding. She said that the dentist they had was very good and was sure he could take care of me. I called around 2 and was able to be seen around 3:30 (They had lunch from 2-3, she told me). \n\nMy boyfriend and I were sitting in back, which is very open, watching Family Matters. They didn't look like they had individual rooms for patients but an open area that was somewhat divided.. I didn't mind!\n\nMy dentist came in and was super friendly, watching Family Matters with us, cracking up. The dental assistant came to take my xray, which was PAINLESS and AWESOME, and they started getting ready.\n\nI got numbed up but needed to be shot again because I could feel it a little when he started getting to work... No worries. Another shot on each side and I couldn't feel my mouth at all. It is a little scary, getting your wisdom teeth pulled when you're awake and can tell what's going on but they were very quick about it and made sure I was in no pain! Anytime I started to become a sissy they reassured me and made me genuinely feel better. \n\nIt was amazing, my dentist was so calm! He was laughing at Family Matters jokes when moving from one wisdom tooth to the other. They all made me feel very comfortable and it was SO affordable!! I can't say any other way how awesome they are!\n\n\nP.S. a week since my teeth being pulled and I feel awesome. I actually felt pretty good the next day! Just general soreness, but nothing bad!
