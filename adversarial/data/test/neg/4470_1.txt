I am brand new to yoga and was nervous about my first class so I called ahead to gather some information so I would be prepared.  I spoke with Heidi who was wonderful, told me exactly what I needed to know and put me at ease.  She was also the instructor of my class and did a fabulous job instructing and ensuring we were connecting with the overall experience.  I will definitely return!
