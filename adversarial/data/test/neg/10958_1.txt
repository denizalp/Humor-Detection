Great Thai restaurant with good food that has a different flavour profile than the group of Sukho Thai \/ Khao San Road \/ etc restaurants. I'll definitely be back!\n\nFood & drink - I had the vegan pad thai (kudos to the separate vegan section of the menu!) which I liked. It had much more veggies than most places which was refreshing. Good flavour overall as well! I had the lemongrass iced tea to drink which was like a sprite with a light lemongrass flavour. Most people were drinking buckets, likely to reminisce about a trip to the islands. \n\nAtmosphere - unpretentious with a street style \/ bustling urban centre flair. Fun colours, metal chairs, gold intricate patterns on the wall - there's a lot going on just like in SE Asia!
