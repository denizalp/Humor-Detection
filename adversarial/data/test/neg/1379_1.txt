First time today with my dog bravo.  The entire staff was very nice. And the facility was very comfortable and clean. Took a while to get into the private office to see the doctor but it was Friday afternoon and very busy. So I understand. Very informative vet  and the shots were complimentary for first time visitors. Thank u all.
