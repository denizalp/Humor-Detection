If I could not give a star, then I would not even waste a star.  Me and my boyfriend went to this location yesterday.  The girl and guy worker were not helping us much at all.  They were too busy talking and texting on their phones than to provide good customer service.  My boyfriend really needed to find a good pair of tennis shoes and the workers just basically ignored him, so you know what?  We just took our business elsewhere.   So you guys lost out on over $100 sale!   We will not be coming back to this store and that is a promise!
