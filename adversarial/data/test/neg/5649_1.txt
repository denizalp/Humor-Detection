When we got here we almost left because the line was really long. We waited about 25 minutes, but really wanted to try it. The staff was friendly and helpful.\nIt was definitely pricey ($50 for breakfast), but the portions are HUGE!  My hubby got the flapjack and it was the size of a monster truck tire...he can put away some food and was only able to eat half of it. I got their famous fried chicken and it had a maple reduction on it that I could have done without. The biscuit was big and came with a delicious blueberry preserve. Now, for my favorite part of the meal..the griddle cooked mashed potatoes were hands down the best I've ever had!!!!  Even after I felt like I was gonna need wheeled out on a gurney from eating to much, I ate some more of those mashed potatoes!  They were chunky red potatoes seasoned perfectly then put on a hot griddle to get a nice crust on the outside. Absolutely brilliant. \nI had the strawberry lemonade. It was good, but I expected more from $5 a glass and $1 for refills. My husband got a mint cappuccino and raved about it. I asked to substitute my bacon for chicken sausage and the waitress came back to me and said the chef said no...which was annoying but not a huge deal.  All in all, very good food and big portions. We left overstuffed, and needing to sleep off a food coma. We also left with empty pockets, so we will save going back for special occasions.
