Burbon street stake was sizzling so hard when I got it that it popped me in the face with hot grease. It tasted great after waiting 5 minutes to feel safe to eat it. I orderd it medium rare. It was well done, not even pink in the middle. If that grease had left a mark on me, there would have been hell to pay. that's why you get one star. Though the waitress was very pleasant.
