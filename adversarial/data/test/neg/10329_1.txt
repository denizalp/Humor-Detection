My first time at M salon was bittersweet. \nMy first impression when I walked in was that the place looked nice. But then it was met with a less-than-pleasant desk clerk. She had really unwelcoming attitude, as if my friend and I were bothering her. When I told her I had two appts for shellac manicures, she told me ok and then just walked off. My friend and I weren't sure to just stand there or sit down for like the 5 minutes no one was taking care of us. Awkward. Someone finally appeared and she was one of the manicurists. She was really nice and friendly and talkative during the manicure she gave my friend. But I got a different one who was cold and bitter. She didn't speak the whole time and gave me looks cause I couldn't decide which colour I wanted (the one I originally wanted apparently didn't actually look good because it wasn't \"opaque enough\" so she told me not to pick that one --disappointing). Anyway when my manicure was finally done I really loved it and the colour was lovely. But then I noticed that my manicurist left a huge space between my cuticles and the nail polish. So I'm left to wonder did she do it on purpose so I'd have to come back sooner? Frustrating.
