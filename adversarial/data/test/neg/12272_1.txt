I order from them frequently through UberEats. The large Chicken Florentine is a satisfying, generous portion! The large strawberry crepe was very skimpy. Overall good experience. Recieved a personal phonecall from a friendly, intelligent staff member once-updating me on my order and I appreciated that.
