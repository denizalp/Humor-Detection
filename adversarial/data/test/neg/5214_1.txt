LOVE the Venetian. It's definitely probably my favorite place in Vegas to stay. Rooms are huge, service is great, and it would be easy to just stay in the hotel all weekend and not go anywhere else haha. It kind of has everything you need. \n\nDuring the day, I love the pool and Tao Beach.  It can get a little crowded on Saturdays but Fridays and Sundays are the sweet spot of a slight weekend crowd that's not too overwhelming. The shops are fun to walk around too - they really have an awesome Venice theme going throughout the entire hotel and casino. \n\nIt's around a lot of great hotels too, you can easily walk over to Cesar's Palace to go shopping, the Wynn to check out Encore or Tryst at night, or even the little Chipotle\/Panda Express next to Harrah's if you're broke like us and trying to save your money for clubbing  and drinking lol.\n\nRooms are huge and comfortable - every room is a suite. There's two couches too which is great for some extra sleeping space. Rooms can be pricey but you can usually find good hotel deals online. \n\nI keep wanting to try out different hotels but kind of keep coming back to the Venetian. It's just awesome.
