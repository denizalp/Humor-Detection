My wife and I went there for lunch and I thought it was below fair at best. We were quickly seated when we arrived and greeted by our waitress who took our drink orders. She delivered our drinks and then didn't come back for almost 15 minutes before she finally took our food order. I  had tried to flag her down on numerous occasions but she would never make eye contact with us. I had to get the attention of another server asking if he would please get her over to our table. She finally shows up and asks if we would like to order drinks. I told her she already delivered our drinks bite wanted food. Not a good start. My wife ordered sushi and I had a pulled pork sandwich. The sushi was not wrapped in seaweed but rice paper and extremely dry. She said it was the worst sushi she ever had. Pulled pork usually has a sweet bbq sauce taste but mine was hot and spicy. I enjoy hot and spicy but not with pulled pork. Just not a very good lunch. We have no reason to go back there.
