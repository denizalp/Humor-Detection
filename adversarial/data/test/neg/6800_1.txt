I love Petiquette!!!  I have tried other groomers and I was always so sad!  They seemed to not really like what they are doing.  I just picked up my Dog Brandy, an older Chow Chow, and she is soft and smells amazing.  They treat her so well and were so careful due to her age of over 14.  They carried her in an out to prevent slipping due to her older back legs.  They are very friendly, answer the phone, call back quickly and overall I am very happy with their customer service. They have always been very accommodating and polite to get me in with 24-48 hours of call for appointment.  I can't say enough good things and how happy it makes me to see my dog happy and looking so beautiful - pure joy!
