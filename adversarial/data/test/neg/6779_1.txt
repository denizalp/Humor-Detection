Came to have breakfast with my mom and we both ordered a omelet.  The breakfast potatoes that were served with the omelet were delicious.  I don't even know how to explain it.  The seasoning on those potatoes were BOMB!  Server was very friendly and nice. The coffee refills saved me because it was so early. I would definitely go back to Egg Works when I am craving a good breakfast spot.
