I had an incredible night here. My wife and I were \"guests\", meaning we had our ticket, food, and drink paid for. This was really nice as we have  a 7 month old at home (amazing how fast they can burn through clothes).\n\nHowever, I have to focus on the actual venue and production. I can honestly say that my wife and I had a blast. We thoroughly enjoyed the topic, the performer, the view from our seats, and the food was very simple and tasty. We encouraged many family and friends to go (some did and were equally impressed) which speaks to the impact the evening made on us. I now keep my eye on what is happening at the CLO and look forward to returning soon.\n\nHighly Recommend.
