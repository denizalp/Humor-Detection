I was excited to try this place because of the many great reviews, however I just noticed most of those reviews are regarding the lunch special. I was pleased to see this place is open late, and I ordered a Yellow Curry for pick up around 10 or 11 PM. The restaurant itself seems very nice, interior-wise, there was even live cultural music. The service was nice, the server was very kind and pleasant. Sadly, the actual food was not to my liking. I'm a curry fanatic, and this one was watery and thin in the consistency. While I do prefer a bit thicker curries, this one was also pretty bland. Not only that, but the rice wasn't freshly cooked. It was hot, but I could tell it had been sitting for a while. The potatoes were done nicely, at least. I may give this place another chance when I have another late night hankering, but for now I will be exploring options elsewhere.
