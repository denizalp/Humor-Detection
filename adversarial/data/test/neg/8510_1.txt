Review is for the downstairs only. Did not see the upstairs. \n\nFirst, the host asked for my full name, which was odd. Then asked if I had any food allergies, which I thought was thoughtful.\n\nStarted with the soup of the day, the butternut squash soup. AMAZING... rich creamy, with dungeness crab. Was going to order the white clam chowder but saw that they put bacon in it :( Bacon covers the clam flavor! When will people stop putting bacon in the clam chowder? maybe just a tad in manhatten clam chowder. But not white\/ new england! \n\nThen the uni nigiri (I go through sushi withdrawal) $10 and very fresh but pretty skimpy on the pieces. Next was the black cod. A bit on the small portioned size, as expected and it was good. Nice miso flavor to the veggies. The cod was cooked well, flakey not undercooked like most places. Wasn't fantastic, but it was good and enjoyable.\n\nDrinking the straw hut cocktail. Gin, mint, pineapple... Perfect! Especially with 1\/2 off happy hour 3-7pm. Would drink more if I weren't driving...\n\nPastry chef gave some mini chocolate chip and oatmeal raisin cookies on the house with my check. A bit on the sweet side, but nice gesture.
