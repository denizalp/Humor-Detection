Like the food but very disappointed today. They gave my takeout order to someone else and after waiting 15 minutes they told me the guy was bringing my food back. No way will I accept food some stranger has taken home. Now I'm waiting for fresh food to be made with no offer for concession. This might be my last time.\nUPDATE: the food was excellent as always so rating upped to 3.
