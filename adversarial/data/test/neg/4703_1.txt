Food was excellent.  Waiter was very helpful with reccomendations.  Calamari app was good but much spicier than I thought (and I love spicy!)  We were heare on vacation so brought our toddler with us and it wasn't a great atmosphere \/ speed for him.  We didn't get to enjoy the meal\/dining experience as much as we would have liked, but not any fault of the staff or restaurant.  Would love to go back for a nice adult dinner out :)
