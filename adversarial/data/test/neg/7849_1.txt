I coordinated with the owner to make my husbands birthday cake while he was there for our daughters dance competition. She was friendly,  professional and very precise when responding. She executed my idea exactly how I wanted and in a timely fashion. According to my husband and our friends that were there, the cake was delicious and he absolutely loved it! Thank you so much for everything !
