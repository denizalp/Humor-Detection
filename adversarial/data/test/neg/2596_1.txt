This team is a phenomenal! Really helped me. Great customer service. Thank you Alyssa and Erik for your help. Alyssa was very helpful. \n\nI came here to get a new iPhone 8 instead of the XS. I did not feel pressured to buy the most expensive one. Alyssa showed us our options, gave us her perspective and thoughts on their products. Very knowledgeable. \n\nThank you.
