Don't call Pep Boys for towing.  We waited 4 hours and when we called and complain all they would say is (would you like for us to cancel your tow).  We did finally cancel our tow and called Lenny (Pons Auto Body) and he had us on our way in less than 30 mins.  Put his number in your phone.  Lenny 412-628-4091
