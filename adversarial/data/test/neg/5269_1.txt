I highly recommend the new Aqua Gold Needling and Volbella that Leigh offers at Babyface LLC. I am 29 years old had have always been big fan of the micro needling and the results I get, so I was a little hesitant to try the Aqua Gold Needling. But after the Aqua I will never go back to micro needling. Aqua gold requires no numbing cream and also no recovery time. You leave with a pinkish tint, that reduces in a hour. The best part is that you see immediate results!  Next I tried the Volbella, which is under the same umbrella as Juvederm. Volbella left me with natural looking plump lips, with no bruising. Leigh is honest with what she thinks will work best for each individual and she knows what works the best. Thank you again Leigh, you do amazing work.
