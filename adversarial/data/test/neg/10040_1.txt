Got an order to go and it wasn't bad but it was just a basic meal.  Got the Freshie Roll and Green Curry with extra vegetables.  The green curry did have a good spice to it, but that was pretty much the only thing that stood out for the dish.  The Freshie Roll was very good and the peanut sauce was great!  \n\nI had seen all the reviews about service being slow, which is why I opted to order to go.  The order was placed and filled and I was back in the car within less than 15 minutes.
