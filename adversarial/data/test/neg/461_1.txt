Had a great family outing with Ryan and Victoria from Rappel AZ! Both leaders were extremely patient, knowledgeable and encouraging. We did the Adventure course and had a blast! Safety is definitely their priority and their equipment is top notch. I am scared of heights and was able to do it all - even the Leap of Faith - with the help of Ryan and Victoria. I highly recommend Rappel AZ for groups as well as family fun! Ryan was also wonderful to work with to set up our program, including communicating both via email and phone.
