Beer is fantastic but the bartenders couldn't care less about their customers. I'm here from Chicago so rest assured I do not hold a grudge against this establishment... The bar tenders seemed like robots who cared little for human interaction. 4 of our 5 beer orders were taken with no words. At the end of our evening the bartender was eating behind the bar and checking out a fellow employees new prescription. Weird. Never felt like less of a guest than this. BTW, the beer is pretty good. Just don't expect to be tested like you're welcome. Also, bar back guy is awesome.
