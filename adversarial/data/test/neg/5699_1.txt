The first time I hear the name, I thought it is one of those scam restaurants opened by Chinese that can not make Japanese food. It was a pleasant surprise to find out this little cozy restaurant was runned by Japanese and delivers authentic Japanese food. Strongly recommend everyone to eat the dinner special as it is cheap and delicious. It is a little restaurant located on Baldwin Village, I decided to give it a try because I am sick of going to Kinton. The Chirashi (sashimi on rice) portion was huge and all the fish were very fresh. I was too full to have dessert because the Chirashi was that good, I felt the need to finish the whole bowl.
