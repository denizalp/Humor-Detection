I'm only pleased because it's a couple of blocks away from my house. Other then that, not happy at all. I have an unlimited month to month contract for spray tanning. Only to find out dark is an extra $7 charge? My contract doesn't specify at all, I thought unlimited meant I could get any color I want for my monthly charge. And check this out, I opened the Spray tan machine and there's not even DARK in the machine!!! Just pull the drawer and you'll see the clear solution, medium, and the moisturizer. There's no dark solution.\n\nOhh and their lotions are way over-priced.
