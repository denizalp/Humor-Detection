The atmosphere is nice but the service we experienced was slow\/inefficient. We waited 10 minutes for a latte and a cappuccino, mind you there were only 2 people in front of us. There seemed to be almost no teamwork between the workers. It's a shame because the atmosphere of this establishment is very pleasant, but the service was off-putting.
