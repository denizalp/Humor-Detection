Since we lost our favorite cat, Mr. Bauer, last fall, we went in to see what DMVH had to offer last month.  They had two kitties about 10 mo. old.  We saw a gray and a black kitty.  The black long hair domestic (Candy) was full of zest and we immediately took to her.\n\nShots, spaying, chip and declawing is schedule this next week.  She is a doll and has warmed our hearts as a new addition to our family.  She's now gained a new name of \"CoCo.\"  She has a Facebook page too as \"CoCo's Kitty Page\".  We welcome your visits.  Please \"Like\" and enjoy her adventures.  The folks at DMVH are friendly and the Anthem Pets gal who helped make the deal happen (Angie) was as helpful as can be.\n\nPlease help the pet community and go to a place like this when you are ready to add some more love to your family.
