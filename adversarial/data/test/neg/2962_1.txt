I visited this place twice, and each time, the workers acted as if I wasn't even there. No greeting, but they were sure to greet everyone who came in after me.  I asked one of the ladies a question, hoping that she woud offer some of her expertise, but instead she gave me a short answer, an awkward smile, and then walked away lol.  That was last time I visited this store.  Such a shame becasue this place is close to where I live, and I was ready to spend my money with them.  I find everything that I need elsewhere, plus there's a cool little health store right up the street filled with knowledgeable people willing to help :)
