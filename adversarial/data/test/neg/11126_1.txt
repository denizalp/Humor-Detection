I've worked with Tom and his staff for the last four years when I've brought 30-60 high school students to Pittsburgh for our senior trip. \n\nEach year, Tom has been incredibly accommodating. He has offered great bikes, flexibility with our scheduling, and coordination with the Rivers of Steel staff and guides to put together a top-quality learning activity. \n\nGo visit Tom and his team. Go ride a bike.
