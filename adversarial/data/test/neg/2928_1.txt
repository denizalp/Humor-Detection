I went here because I own a Honda and thought they would know the best maintenance for my car.  I was wrong. I have gotten my oil changed here 3 times and all 3 times I have had to come back to get it fixed because my car was leaking oil. What a waste of my life! I let it go the first 2 times and thought they would eventually figure it out. I never asked for a refund because I paid for a service and thought they would notate the errors they were making.  After the 3rd time of having to come back I thought I was deserving of a refund because of this reoccurimg issue.  The worst part is that they don't even write down when people have to come back with any issues.  They had no idea that I've had to deal with this! Yikes! Why is this? It seems to me that they just didn't care.\n\nI spoke with Chris, the assistant manger for the service department and he said that he would give me a free mini detail the next time I want to come in. The problem with this is, that I never want to come back. Life is too short and I just want to move on from this place. I never got my 30 dollar refund for the hassle. Other family members have bought cars here as well and will not be coming back. \n\nMaybe next time they will notate errors so they will not lose money from customers that bought cars from this very dealership. \n\n If you want to come here for great customer service, you will not get that here. \nService reps will not smile at you or call you by your first name. They will not make you feel good for giving them your money. \n\nI now have a very large oil stain in my driveway to remember the Awful customer service this establishment has brought me.
