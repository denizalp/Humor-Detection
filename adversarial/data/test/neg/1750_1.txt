I went there after a band show with a friend. The guy behind the counter was pretty friendly and helpful. The presentation of the food speaks to casual atmosphere of the restaurant and the quick and inexpensive eats you get there.\n\nThe price for the food was pretty standard for what we ordered, but I've had better tasting shawarmas & hummus around Toronto. I do think they need to improve on the taste of the food, but in all fairness I was there after 1 a.m. and it's not likely that they have freshly cooked foods at that hour.
