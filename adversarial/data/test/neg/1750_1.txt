I called these guys out to do a routine summer check on my a\/c unit here in Mesa. Caleb came out, he was friendly and seemed to be pretty honest. He did the check in about a half hour and came down with some news. The capacitors were testing a little low and 1 was slightly leaking. I sort of expected this but then next he hit me with the price.. Something in the neighbourhood of $130.. FOR EACH! This is probably a standard price in the industry and I understand he was just going by the book. But to plug in some capacitors that cost $10 to $20 each and both in under a half hour plus the $69.95 you have to pay regardless.. That puts their hourly rate at like $250! Probably a good company but I will handle the small repairs myself or find a tech that works hourly.
