I played Little Mountain for the first time today and was almost thrilled with the place. Absolutely gorgeous, challenging, and fun course. The only reason this isn't a five star review is the state of the vast majority of the traps. There were countless sand traps on the course (and I found lots of them), but they were awful. Puddles (and there hasn't been much rain in August) in a bunch of them. Hard, caked, and concrete like. \n\nI will add that it seems like they are working on them with gusto. Some had beautiful white (and dry) sand. Some were under construction. I'd love to play this place again, but only after they finish the trap renovations. Until then, not so much. \n\nStaff was pleasant and helpful. I'm glad I went and it was so close to gorgeous. I think that's what made the traps so frustrating.
