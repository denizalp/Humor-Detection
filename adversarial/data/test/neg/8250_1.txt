I have eaten here because I work on High Street. Both times I have gotten food to go. The decor is pretty and the front door is huge!! It's a huge glass hinge door! \nThe bar is a majority of the space and it's polished. One day I need to get here for drinks at happy hour. Now on to my meals. \nThe first time I got the green chile cheeseburger with fries. It was good. I just wanted a tasty burger. And I got what I wanted. \nThe second time I got the pork street tacos and chicken nachos. They packaged the nachos components separately to prevent sogginess, which I appreciated. I liked the tacos. I got a choice of flour or corn tortilla or even lettuce if I was so inclined. I got 3 street tacos separately wrapped by paper. Again, consideration of the to go aspect. All in all it was a good meal. This place is consistently good. I like to eat lunch here for food, price and quality compared to the rest of the block. The bartenders are who I mostly deal with. Always friendly.
