This is the first time I've ever cared enough to write a yelp review for a clinic. This place is terrible . If you have to call with a question, be ready to wait for long time. I work on the same industry i never seen an  unorganized health facility . \n1.- They set up an appointment for you(under them needs)\n2.- They make you wait for more than one Hr. with appointment. \n3.- last time i was there, seven people were talking just one doctor working.\n The Dr. Estrada  was professional, but good luck scheduling an appointment with the incompetent staff.
