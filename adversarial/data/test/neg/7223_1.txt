The whole staff, specifically Crystal, has been extremely helpful from the application process to the day I moved in. The things I needed on move in day were ready or fixed right away (within the hour). I have never met a leasing office team more flexible and welcoming! Thank you for making this such a positive experience!!! \n\nThe apartment was very clean and seems to have been just recently painted, with few minor areas of wear and tear. They have been remodeling the shared community spaces as well. So far, this apartment is definitely 5-Star worthy!!
