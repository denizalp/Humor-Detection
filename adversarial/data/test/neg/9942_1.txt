First up, if you click on directions on Yelp it will take you to Huntersville and NOT the true location. Click on the address as this is correct.  Just south of W T Harris Blvd. Next to U Haul.\nDon't be scared off by the outside.\nThe inside is full of warmth and hospitality ! Everyone was wonderful and helpful.  The food is darn right good and honest. Super value for money. We will be going again as the experience alone is worth the visit.
