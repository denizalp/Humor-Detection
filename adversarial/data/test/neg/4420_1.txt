A little scheduling hiccup at the beginning, so Vinh didn't actually DJ for us. But Vinh made it right and sent us an amazing DJ. The DJ on Vinh's team (DJ Vinom) made sure we were on schedule and got everything I needed into the itinerary. He hyped up the entire crowd and everyone was on the dance floor all night long. The lighting and monogram service they provided made my minimal-decorated wedding looking super fancy. Thank you for making our special day extra special.
