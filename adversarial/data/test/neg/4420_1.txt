The drinks are EXCELLENT!! We loved the blueberry bourbon drink and the Albert Collins.  They were both delicious and well worth the price.  Drink prices are comparable to others on the strip but the drinks are SO MUCH BETTER at Yardbird.   The atmosphere was very relaxed and we just sat down in chairs and on a couch.  The only reason Yardbird did not get 5 stars is because service is slow though the wait staff is very friendly and helpful.  I would have given 4.5 stars if allowed.  We did not have any food, so this review is for drinks, ambience, and service ONLY.
