This place is located in Chinatown @ Warm Springs Road and Arville at the far left end of a strip mall.  We got there at 8pm on a Sunday night.  I had to drive around the mall three times before I got a parking spot (they have stalls in the back, too).\n\nIt surprisingly was not busy and our party of five was seated right away.  We first went to Jinya down the road, but they had a line out the door. So some quick Yelping got us here. \n\nOur server was very friendly and helpful with the menu.  They have a good selection of ramen and some other dishes.  I wasn't feeling ramen so I had the fried oysters with rice, some fresh veggies, and a bowl of miso soup.  It was delicious. Whenever I eat at a Japanese restaurant, I rate them by the quality of their rice, which was excellent.  The rest of my party had ramen and one had cold soba noodles.  They all mopped up their noodles and said how great tasting they were.  We shared the home made gyoza as an appetizer, which was very tasty.\n\nI love this find and will be back.\n\nPS: For dessert we headed to a Korean bakery located directly above Yagyu.  They have awesome bakery products!
