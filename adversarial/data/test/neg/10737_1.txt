The results of a 24 hour urine test were reported on MyQuest.com. The Microalbumin Excretion Rate(AER) was reported as 3480. That is an alarmingly high number (normal is less than 20).  After some research I found the AER formula, plugged in the numbers and discovered an error.  Quest had used 24 minutes instead of 1440 minutes (24 hours is 1440 minutes). I called Quest to explain the error. They admitted the error but insisted my doctor had to call to get it corrected. My trust in Quest is seriously eroded. They failed to find their error after a seriously abnormal result, and then refused to correct it without following some stupid, flawed internal procedure. I can only wonder at the quality of the results from other tests.
