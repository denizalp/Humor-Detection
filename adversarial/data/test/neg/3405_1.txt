good food, well made, great buffet to go! and all that really healthy stuff. A place that does not sell diet coke! (sounds like a good idea to me)\nIf you like this type for healthy fare, this is a great place --- otherwise the McDonalds will be easy for you to find!\nGo where your heart leads you!
