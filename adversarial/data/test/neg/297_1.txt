Loved this place!  Cool atmosphere and great food.  Several people have referred to it as the \"Indian Chipotle\", which seems like a good comparison.  Its got a trendy, modern style with high quality freshly prepared food.  We got the Chicken BBQ plate with Naan and chickpeas, Chicken Tikka Masala bowl and a Lamb meatball sandwich.  Everything was great - fresh, clean and tasted great with a ton of flavor.  This is not Indian fast food that you get in a mall food court and it was much better than most Authentic Indian restaurants.  Hope this place does well.
