This is the place to be on Friday\/Saturday night in the Dufferin and hwy 401 area. But be warned you will probably be in for a wait.\n\nThey use a very unique (to me anyway) system for those groups waiting for a table. They will text you when your table is ready; however, saying that, today I got the text 10 minutes after we were seated. Can't explain that one.\n\nThey've revamped the enterprise so expect a more upscale experience that remains family friendly. They have new ice cream flavours and new sundae combinations. IMO they seem to have moved their focus away from their infamous waffles\/crepes (though they are definitely still on the menu) and focused on their sundae and hot\/cold drink option. In the corner of the menu my cousin noticed that they also offer ice cream sandwiches but haven't tried or seen those yet.\n\nOn both recent visits, I've created my own two-scoop sundae. Mainly because they offer white chocolate silk ice cream (I have a soft spot for white chocolate) with Nutella, strawberries and dark chocolate sauce. Add the complimentary whip cream and waffle biscuit and you've got a little piece of bliss.\n\nPrice point is on the slightly higher side of reasonable (1 scoop is $9, 2 scoops is $10.75 plus tax) but I think it's worth every penny.\n\nServers are attentive and friendly.\n\nNothing bad to say, except wise this enterprise had more franchises around the city so the place wasn't always do packed.\n\nWe will definitely be back!
