I had dim sum here on a weekend, and it was super packed and busy. It took a while to get a seat, but it is the norm at most dim sum places on the weekend.\n\nSome of the dishes were great; the har gow (steamed shrimp dumplings) were super delicious and jumbo sized. The siu mai (pork) also had a shrimp on top, which was definitely nice. Overall, the quality of food was good; they also currently have a deal where all dim sum dishes are 2.90; which is very reasonable. There were some misses on dishes as well; the fish ball in watercress soup was seriously under flavoured and bland. \n\nThe customer service was average; they were all friendly, however - the food came out really slow (compared to other places). As well, we ordered durian puff deserts, and they didn't tell us they sold out. As such, we waited a long time before they told us.\n\nI would recommend coming here for dim sum, but maybe come on the weekdays when there is less people?
