Dear reader, \nI submit to you this humble comparison of two Gyro joints that sit within spitting distance of each other. But it's more profound than just bragging rights for the best Gyro, this is also a tale of Yelp vs. local word of mouth. You see, I was challenged by a friend not 30 minutes before on the quality of Yelp reviews vs. WOM. \n\nSo I'm getting a ride from a local (thanks Bernie!) to the South Side, and he points out a Gyro joint as being the best in P'burg (Mike and Tony's) and then I see just across the corner another Gyro joint I recognized from Yelp reviews as having 4.5 stars. So it hits me. Let's put his tithe test. \n\nI asked to be dropped off, pull up Yelp and check reviews. Sure enough, my WOM rec, Mike and Tony's has only 4 stars, and Lesvos has 4.5. I see my opportunity to test local WOm vs. Yelp right then and there (and eat two Gyros instead of one!)\n\nI won't belabor the results:\n\nMike and Tony's was a better experience for me, thought neither was perfect. \n\nM&T's - 4 stars\nLesvos - 3 stars\n\nNow, keep in mind this is based on one visit, Gyro to Gyro. Sampling method is not perfect since there was a few minutes between eating each, and Mike and Tony's likely has an advantage since I was more hungry when I ate theirs (although I only ate half to try to control for this).  Here are some details:\n\nM&T - total hole in the wall, but not in a bad way. Gyro came in seconds to my table, piping hot and absolutely piled with meat. It was juicy, and the pita had just the right amount of resistance. The meat was just a tad over seasoned, as another reviewer mentioned, but really food flavor overall. The tatziki sauce tasted like straight sour cream to me, with similar texture. It wasn't bad, but I prefer something a little mote delicate, with some lemon, cucumber, and a bit of yogurt tang. Overall, pretty freaking tasty. \n\nLesvos - also pretty good ( and same price BTW), but just missing on a couple of things. The meat was a little dry, and though tasty, not quite as tasty. There was less meat although still a generous portion. The sauce was a tad more delicate, though still mostly tasting like sour cream. The bread was not bad, but just a tad more presence than ideal for perfect balance - a little too thick and chewy. \n\nMoral of the story? Not exactly sure, but if I had gone by Yelp alone, I would have missed out on the better Gyro just next door.
