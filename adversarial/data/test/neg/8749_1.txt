My friend and I had dinner here during our vegas trip, she warned me that this place is known for its \"rudeness\" to customers. I have a good sense of humor so I said why not. To be honest, our waitress did not really give us as much trouble as she gave the other tables. We were pretty much left alone. She came to our table 3 times in total. Didn't even get those embarrassing hats that everyone else seemed to be wearing. I overheard the treatment everyone else got and it was hilarious. Only reason I gave it 3 stars is because of the prices for food. They are ridiculous. The cheapest thing there was the mac and cheese which is what I ended up having. I wouldn't come here to eat again but I would come back to have a drink. It's a funny place if you have the sense of humor for it. If you are easily offended, don't come here.
