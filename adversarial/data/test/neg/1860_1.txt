One of our most memorable moments during our Las Vegas vacation was enjoying a hearty n delicious breakfast at the Peppermill Restaurant. A very busy restaurant. We were told wait time was 40-45 min but wait time was either less or it went by quickly. Money well spent for the food and ambiance. Be forewarned, a side of their delicious corn beef hash is a full blown meal all on its own.
