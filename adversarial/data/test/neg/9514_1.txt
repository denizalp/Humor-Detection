First let me say, I NEVER take the time to write reviews for anything. However, this experience deserved it! I am super picky about my hair. My hair is my life!!! I have been growing my hair out for a few years and have been trying to get this specific color and cut. While getting other great hair service from other salons, I just have not gotten the \"perfect\" outcome. This time, I got it and I didn't realize what I had been missing! Tiffany gave me exactly what I was looking for! Not to mention the conversation was great, loved the atmosphere and I really don't know how long I was there because I was enjoying myself so much! In addition, she is the ONLY stylist EVER that has styled my hair and I could go out after and feel wonderful. Due to my pickiness, I normally have to go straight home and style my hair to be able to figure out if I even like it. Not this time! While it may be a little pricey on your pocketbook, DO IT! You will not think about it after and I promise, when you think about going somewhere else next time, you will think about it twice and I bet you will make that 2nd appointment when you remember how awesome you felt when you left the 1st time! Great job Salon Twelve26 and awesome job Tiffany!!! :)
