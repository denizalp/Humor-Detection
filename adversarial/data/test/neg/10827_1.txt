I'm not a big fan of Just Fresh as I feel they're just too overpriced for what you get, I mean over $7 for a salad that will leave you hungry an hour later?  Nope, can't do it, which is why I almost never eat here.  They offer mostly salads, sandwiches, soup, etc. They usually offer half off the salads, sandwiches, and cookies late afternoon on Friday's.  I do like that they have specialty smoothies for $2, and that is a pretty darn good deal and is usually the only reason I tend to stop in lately.  Hopefully they will keep this going throughout the summer.
