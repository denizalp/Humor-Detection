I had an experience similar to Rebeca G.  My appointment was cancelled three times by Calli which seems a bit sketchy to me.  And I was also charged a no-show fee for the appointment that SHE cancelled.  I had to dispute the charge with my credit card company and was issued a refund through my credit card company.  Calli DID NOT issue the refund herself as most professional small business owners would, I had to dispute it with the credit card company.  I would never try to book another appointment with her, regardless of how many specials she is running.
