Recently moved here from CA and was dreading the search of finding a new primary care physician, however I came across Dr. Hall and he is excellent. He is extremely patient, understanding, and knowledgeable. He answered all my questions and concerns with confident answers, in words that a former Marine could understand. It is hard to find trust in a Dr you just met, however I feel confident in Dr. Hall and glad he is my primary doctor. I would highly recommend Dr. Hall.
