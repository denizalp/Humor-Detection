Great place to chill and have a beer. We saw this place while walking about in Toronto, saw that it had a great beer selection and stopped in. We kept seeing the yummy food being brought out so we ended up ordering food as well. We got the, Belgian Fries, Garlic Butter Mussels and Cheese Fondue. A lot of food for 2 people who weren't even hungry but our eyes were bigger than our stomach. The fondue was a little too much, it was really good, but it was only served with bread, wish they threw in some veggies or something but the cheese was fantastic. You get sick of it fast because you are just eating cheese and bread. Muscles were delicious, very satisfying and went great with IPA beer. The Belgian Fries was also great! A wonderful place to hang and great friendly service!
