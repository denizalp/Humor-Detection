Yes, yes. The Avenue Club\/Bubble Up Bar really nailed it. I've been here twice and left pleased both times. I really appreciate a place where the bar tenders are dressed sharply. The collared shirt, tie and neat appearance enhance the cocktail experience for sure. \nIt's an intimate atmosphere with superb lighting and bar layout. Very inviting. There are plenty of seats at the bar but the bar tenders definitely ensure you are served properly. \nMy drink of choice is the Old Fashioned but I asked them to modify a few things to fit my preferences. They had no trouble with this and even remembered the modifications perfectly on the next round. It was quite busy so this was appreciated. \nWe tried a variety of appetizers including chips and dip, Reuben sliders, deviled eggs and chicken wings. None of them disappointed. The chicken wings were outstanding. \nParking is easy here as well, always a plus.
