This is the Sugar Factory flagship store and has just about every Sugar Factory product there is (including jeans and swimwear which I thought was a bit odd). They even have a few amazing (and addictive) edible items that you can't get at the other stores. Beware though, this place gets CROWDED especially at nights and on weekends and while the counter staff is good, it gets overwhelming just being in there. If you're from out of town (or not), my advice if you just need a souvenir or a milkshake... Go to Planet Hollywood and get a coupon book from the Miracle Mile customer service desk. For the last couple of months, there's been a 20% coupon in there that is valid for the Sugar Factory store at Planet Hollywood (not valid at the Paris location). It's good for the shakes\/cakes\/couture pops\/etc. Hey, if you're gonna spend $25 on a lollipop, at least get some kind of discount, right?
