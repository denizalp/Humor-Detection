Purchased on Hotwire. You get what you pay for. You have to take 2 shuttles to the location. The check in process is super slow. It took a minimum of 40 minutes. Make sure you check your car and take pictures before leaving. The car I received had a lot of dings on it and stains inside. Don't want to get charged for preexisting damage. One customer's passenger seat was soaked. Would not recommend.
