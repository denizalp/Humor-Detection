Went to the movies tonight and decided to try VIP. We got there a few minutes before the movie so we could not try the VIP lounge or order from our seats (they stop taking orders 5 minutes before movie starts). The seats were comfortable and the armrest goes up so the wife could get closer.\nThe theatre was a bit cold. Also they don't have a lot of washrooms in the VIP section (there was a line up in the men's washroom after the movie. \nOther than a few inconveniences, I will certainly return and arrive earlier next time to  experience all the VIP has to offer.
