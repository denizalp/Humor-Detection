I came in here recently for a quick slice of pizza.  I didn't know what to expect, but I figured that even bad pizza is usually still not so bad.  At around 12:45pm, the remaining pizzas on offer for slices were looking pretty sad, as though they had already been sitting there for hours.  I'd gone far enough to walk in, so I picked one anyway.  It was... not what I'd hoped for.  It had a crust, and sauce, and cheese, and pepperoni... but I feel it may be overly generous to call it pizza.
