Quick back story -- years ago when I lived in Mt. Washington I used ATTC's tanning beds and always had a great experience -- I moved away from Pittsburgh, found spray tanning and liked it a lot! I moved BACK to Pittsburgh only to be disappointed by TWO salons in both their spray and bed services. \n\nEnter -- Groupon. I was hesitant to try spray tanning again considering my last place left me with no tan.... But, since it was a \"deal\" I figured I should give it a shot, especially since it was at a place I already had a positive experience with. \n\nAnd I was right! Best spray tan from a machine that I have ever had. The gal who helped me was super nice, the place was clean, parking was easy, and my tan..... oh my tan! Finally! it's only November but I was already at mid-January levels of pale. \n\nI went with the medium level color, the machine was very easy to use and it was so quick. It even dries you off. No streaking. Even color. I am going to moisturize a lot and hope to extend the color. Will update how long it lasts.
