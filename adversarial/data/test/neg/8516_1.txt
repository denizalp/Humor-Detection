First off the best thing is the lobster Mac and cheese omg !!! Must try... Now it was nice and all but it was too noisy and I would not be going back for the price I would like a more intimate atmosphere and the music was too loud ... I'm a fan of delmonicos at the Venetian ... Nine was was good but not worth going back....
