First of all as a true hispanic, this place was nothing to brag about. The salsa was plain and had no kick to it. I had their carne asada burrito and the carne asada was also plain and was not juicy. Their chips were too salty. The only thing that was good about it was the water so I can wash it down. Finally it was wayyyyy over priced for the quality and taste. If you come here you might as well go to taco bell.The only thing nice about it was the interior of the place and the staff. I will never go back again.
