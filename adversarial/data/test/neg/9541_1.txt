The store is well organized & pretty quiet when I was there. This place has a good selection of shoes, g-strings, etc. It was my first time in there so I spent a lot of time looking at everything (they have a ton of stuff) & the girl behind the counter was patient and helpful. Probably my new favorite store of this kind. :)
