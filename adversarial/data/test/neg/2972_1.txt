Their little stamps station is pretty neat.  They have letters, symbols, and small banner-like designs to personalize your notebooks\/stationaries for FREE.\n\nLike other Muji locations, they sell quality items for your home, kitchen, bathroom, and office.  All of their products are designed to function well and give a clean, sterile appearance.  Yet, it's pretty stressful to even window shop in this particular store because it's so popular and packed with crowds.  The line to the register actually blocks the entrance\/exit.  Hopefully they rearrange the store layout soon to improve traffic flow.
