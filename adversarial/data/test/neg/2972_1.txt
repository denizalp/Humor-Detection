The customer service is wonderful, just a bit slower than I would have hoped as I waited for a cashier (actually anyone) to greet me. Prices are reasonable and the selection and variety of beverages is excellent! The ladies behind the counter served with kindness and professional dedication, and once I placed my order it was ready in about one minute! Unfortunately the registers were out of paper to print receipts, but that was only a slight inconvenience. Atmosphere was nice and the place was not too busy.
