Great little grocery store with a restaurant! Just happened to be driving by and stopped for some goodies and decided to try the food. It was excellent and SO cheap! A plate is $6.99 and that includes a lot of rice, 2 entrees, and half a naan. Our plates were clean and we were both stuffed when we finished. The chicken was tender both in the chicken tikka masala and the butter chicken. I also enjoyed the paneer masala. We'll be back!
