Loved the setting and Dj in the background. Good looking staff, but the service was just okay... It took a while to get serviced (perhaps they were under staff?). I ordered the salmon entree and it was a little on the salty side, but still good. My friend ordered the rib eye and really enjoyed it. We had the Tarimisu was off the hook-- one of the best i ever tasted! We also ordered a bottle of wine. The portions were fair. For two entrees, one dessert, and a bottle of wine... We felt the price was fair (a little below $140). The only reason why we gave it 4 star was because of the service (but everyone was really nice tho!!)
