Beautiful and visually stunning show! I've only seen a few of the Cirque shows but so far this if my favorite of all of them! \n\nI loved the music and when the Beatles shadows come out and you feel like they are in the show too! The dancing, the propos, the colors, the acrobatics.. all of it is just a perfect medley.\n\nMy only complaint is that they need someone to watch people during the show. We had a drunk girl sitting next to us who kept getting up, talking very loudly during the show, etc. -- someone should've asked her to quiet down or leave. They had tons of ushers before and after the show but need someone to monitor more during the show. It was very distracting but no reflection on the actual show as much as the venue.
