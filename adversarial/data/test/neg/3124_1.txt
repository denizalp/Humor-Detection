I would like to start my saying Aloha Nails is a very wonderful play.  Christina has been doing my nails for about a year.  I had been to many salons. I told her what I was looking for and my issues and she addressed everything and did an exceptional job. I enjoy going in every time to see her and her staff.  And please don't let the name fool you.... They do nails, waxing, eye brow tattoo, paraffin wax for hands and just so much more. The staff are just as great! They are so friendly and make you feel welcome. I am sure you have heard so many people go on about \"their\" place they go. I promise you will not be disappointed at this salon. \n\nThank you Christine and all the lovely people who work at Aloha Nails.
