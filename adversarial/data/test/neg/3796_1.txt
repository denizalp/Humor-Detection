New location. Still learning their way around the back of the counter. I counted 9 employees vs the typical 3-5 at a normal del taco location. Clean inside as expected being new. Food was fine no issues other than the wait for the food. They really stuff the tacos with cheese. Did I say cheese ? Seriously. Cheese !
