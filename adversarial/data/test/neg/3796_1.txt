Gaetano's has a very pleasant and relaxing atmosphere.   The staff was very knowledgeable of menu items and provided good service.  \n\nI ordered the asparagus risotto special.  The risotto was delicious and well seasoned.  The restaurant could have stepped it up a little and put a garnish of grilled asparagus or something to make the dish visually appealing.   My husband had the rolled pork special.  The flavor was OK.  He gave me a bite of the pork.  You could hardly taste the pork as it was overwhelmed by the amount of bread stuffing inside.  The sauce should have been nappe and it was overly thick.  This was a little disappointing which is why we took away one star.  Overall though, it was a good experience and we would probably go back.\n\nThe restaurant was a  little pricey for the quality of food served.
