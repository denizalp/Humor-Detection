DAS is the worst company that I have ever used. I shipped two cars and both were over a month late despite being promised a 2 week turn around. They are quick to take your money but after that -no one answers the phones or messages. Our cars were simply \"forgotten\" to be assigned. This was confirmed by a DAS employee. Our cars just sat in a parking lot for 3 weeks after initial pick up. This costed us an extra 4 car rentals since there was no sign of our cars ever arriving. The only reason we even got our cars was thanks to the tow company who initially picked up our cars. They were tired of having our cars just sit there lot and assisted us in contacting the company. DO NOT USE this company.
