so, here is my story . I met the doc thru a friend I wanted my entire mouth to be overhauled once and for all and I have been thinking about it for years . I took the plunge and to tell you it was not easy .... Dr Daccache is a magician he has removed all my teeth in one session ,place the implants  and the temporary teeth .when I woke up it was all done ..... no pain not even discomfort , six month later the final set of teeth were ready and put in , never have I set in a dentist chair with a better caring man ( that is why I call him the MAGICIAN).... now his co-pilot (dentist) rudy !!!! another giant in the field ,he is the one that worked on placing the teeth in the implants ,again ,NO PAIN . I don't know how they do it but I don't care (the no pain stuff ) bless you both .... david
