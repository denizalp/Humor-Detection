An awesome, thorough, and thoroughly relaxing deep tissue massage! Ladies weekend in Vegas should always include a visit to A Touch of Las Vegas. Not only is it well priced, but they also include a pickup from your hotel since they're slightly off the Strip. Their facilities are smaller than others on the Strip but priced a lot better, combine a visit here with a day pass at Qua and you're all set!
