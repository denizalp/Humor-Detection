If your craving some standard Chinese fare this is the place to go, it's not Lai Wai Heen but it's not Ho-Lee-Chows either.  But it has enough diversity that the Chinese or non-Chinese would both find acceptable\n\nWhat makes this place outstanding is that It has two standard lunch specials per weekday that comes with rice\/noodles, entre, egg roll and a hot and sour soup for $4.99+tax.  Can't get this good a deal in downtown Toronto, where most lunches have gone up $2-3 in the past year or two.\n\nNegative: It's not food for the health conscious  but then I've never been to a Chinese place that was.
