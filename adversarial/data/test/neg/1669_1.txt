This palace is exactly that when looking for anything you need. They are open everyday of the week-they always have a helpful, friendly staff. From vapor to cool colored contacts-they have it ALL. I know I sound like a commercial, but as someone from Oklahoma who helped run a smoke shop with everything, this is the best place I have found between Surprise and Mesa. I hope you come and see what all this place has to offer. You will not be disappointed! I would and do recommend this place to anyone who has any needs!
