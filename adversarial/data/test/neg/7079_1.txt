This place is the epitome of a well managed business. I recently took seven kids ages seven through 14 for a holiday party. The kids all had a wonderful time, and as an adult I did too. Safety was a key concern, and the very knowledgeable workers made sure that everybody had a good time and a safe time. Highly recommended!
