I went because JohnJay from Johnjay and Rich talked sooo much about it. I got something simple. Noodles, veggies and chicken. And let me tell you.... IT WAS SOOO GROSS. Johnjay said everything is so healthy... but I am pretty sure everything is microwaved here. The chicken was definitely microwaved. Noodles were so plain and veggies were also very plain, no flavor besides being frozen and thawed.
