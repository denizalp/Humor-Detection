One of my new favourite lunch spots on Queen St W the Tuna Nicoise was SOO delicious, it had everything you could want, admittedly I'm partial to rocket vs spring mix so I'd ask for that substitution next time. \nTried the chicken club (cause he's not the one on a diet) I tried only tried one bite of the sammy but, I couldn't resist the rosemary frites seriously, the BEST fries I've had in YEARS. \nHidden gem, with endless GOOD coffee for $2.75 and freshly baked in-house cookies YUM\nAnd the sweetest staff.\nTrying the burger next time (when I'm not on a diet, if you've seen my more recent posts you'd understand OINK!)
