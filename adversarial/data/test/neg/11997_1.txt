Bangkok Brownie: Thai iced tea soft serve with brownie chunks. the soft serve melts so fast but still flavorful, and I liked it because it is not so sweet. It is not very creamy because it is soft serve. The brownie is just normal. I guess it is the combination that makes it popular.\nSmores on smores: liked this one more than bangkok brownie because I basically love anything with burnt marshmallow! the ice cream itself is not overly sweet, and it is just delicious to taste the warm marshmallow and the ice cream at the same time. loved the cone covered with cookie chunks too
