They have sturgeon and it is always fresh and delicious. \n\nI've never had a bad time here or had anything I didnt like. \n\nMy favorite: fish platter for two, sturgeon and nova.\n\nAmerican style breakfasts. Jewish deli sammies. Soup: very good. The restaurant stays busy and that makes for always fresh foods. \n\nThis is the place for Jewish Bakery in LV. Cookies, cakes. Yum!
