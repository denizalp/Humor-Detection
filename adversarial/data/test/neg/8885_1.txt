I love farmer boys when I want food fast breakfast food! I've tried the soup, French toast, breakfast bowls, and burgers! (Not all in one sitting lol) They were all really good. The bacon burger I had is out of this world if you're a bacon lover! I also had the cookies and cream shake. If you're into sweets it was good. But I had to drink water after drinking the shake because it was sweeter then I can handle.
