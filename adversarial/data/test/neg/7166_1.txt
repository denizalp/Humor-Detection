Bar food and drinks.. nice patio setup.. full bar, good beer selections and small plates.. I'd like to go back and check this place out for breakfast\/brunch .. they had some interesting late night eats\/early morning options that looked delicious.. the chili mac and cheese hit the spot.. a tad salty but satisfying
