I really enjoy coming to this location.. You get to see all of your favorite comedians at a fairly good price. Ordered it ahead and pick it up at Will Call! I probably been at this location like 5x. And the staffs have alway been helpful and caring. It can get a bit overwhelming for them with sooo many ppl ordering and served at the same time.. and they managed to move around without disturbing people's view. Which I love about this place.
