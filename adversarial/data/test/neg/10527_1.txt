My husband loved his Fall Leaves Salad. The service and all of the other food (and drinks) were very good. They serve the local Four Peaks beer including the Peach Ale. I had a raspberry mint mule that was really good as well. We started with a delicious roasted cauliflower with spinach dip off the happy hour menu. My wild chopped salad with chicken, which was not dry, minus the red onions was also really good as a wrap.
