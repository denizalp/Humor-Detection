Stayed here for our son's 26th Birthday. Lovely room and great to have a washer dryer!! We ordered room service every morning and it was hot and delicious!! Great balcony overlooking the strip. Quiet at night and nice to not have casinos to walk through to get to your room. Great valets, very friendly and helpful!! Would definitely stay here again.
