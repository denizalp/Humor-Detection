We ate at Ben & Jerry's every day while in Montreal for the JazzFest 2 weeks ago.  The service is excellent. You get what you want. The ice cream, of course, is wonderful.  It was very romantic to take a stroll, get some ice-cream before going back to our hotel after a long day of being on the go.  The only thing I would recommend is that they be more attentive to wiping  down the outside tables and keeping the place tidy.  This location could be 5 stars. Can't wait to go back.
