Called to ask if they could make a key duplicate. They told me it would take 5-10 minutes, but at the moment they did not have a technician around. I asked what time I should stop by. After a pause the guy said: you know we don't actually copy keys. Try another hardware store. I was confused, so asked why he told me just a few seconds ago that it would take 5-10 minutes. The guy just hanged up.\n\nWell, at least I am glad I figured out over the phone that this was not a good place to have business with.
