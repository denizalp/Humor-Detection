Umm... guys... I just legit had the best nail experience of my life. Kelly is a nail savant! No other place can get my nail length right. They always try to push me to go longer which, while pretty, doesn't suit me. Not here! The length is perfect, the color is perfect and the place and the people are so nice. I live nowhere close to Goodyear, but I will be planning my visits there around when I need my nails done.
