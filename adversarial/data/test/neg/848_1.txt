These guys are intense about their coffee, and I'm sure they'd be the first to admit it. Located in the Calgary Farmer's Market, Phil & Sebastian's created quite a buzz when they first appeared, what with their expensive clover (fancy coffee maker) and their way of making the foam on lattes look pretty...now that more independent coffee places have turned up in Calgary, P & S's is not the only great coffee on the street. \n\nBut, you know what? I'll always love P&S's 'cause I had my first very fantastic americano there, and it's etched in my mind forever...
