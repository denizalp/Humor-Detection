Excellent dining experience.  Our waiter was very nice and helpful.  She was also spot on her recommendations.  The ambiance is excellent and the kitchen is open so you can watch the chef work his magic.  The place is BYOB.  I highly recommend the steak tartare and the duck medium rare please! A wonderful experience.
