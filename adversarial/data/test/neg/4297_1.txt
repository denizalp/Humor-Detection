Service was great and food was great!  We had Fish Fillet w\/basil in Casserole (三杯魚), Dry Sautéed  Chicken w\/Dried Pepper (辣子雞丁)，Sautéed Seasonal Veggie(空心菜)，Stir fried Beef Tripe (爆炒牛百葉), and Smelly Crispy Bean Curd (臭豆腐)。It was full at 6pm on a Saturday.  We decided to take their offer and seated outside (other groups did too).  It got a little chilly at the end and food got cold much fast except the casserole one.  Food came up real fast and tasted delicious.  Our waiter was very attentive and checked on us multiple times.  Highly recommend the Dry Sautéed  Chicken w\/Dried Pepper!
