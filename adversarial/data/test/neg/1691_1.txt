I am not saying the food is bad but service is a important part of it. I ordered 2 dosa today . The website said that the 2 nd dosa is free on Tues and wed. Well the person on the phone says no I am wrong . And then after checking they have to change the website. So in short guys please don't have false advertisements. It reflects badly on the brand. Now I guess I will to take my business elsewhere.
