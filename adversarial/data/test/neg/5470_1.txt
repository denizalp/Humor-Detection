Located off 16th Ave on the southside, just west of Warden, I consider Win to be a best place for lunch during weekdays. Various specials are available form $4.99 to $6.99 ranging from Curry Chicken Rice, Salted Fish and Chicken Fried Rice, Fish Ball Noodle Soup and Hainan Chicken Rice. The special comes with HK tea as well.. Curry chicken is fragrant as they use curry leaves.  Fried rice taste wonderful with the salted fish aroma and is not oily.  Hainan Chicken rice is ok, not as good as Phoenix, though. \n\nMake sure you get here before noon as the place gets filled up very quickly. Service is alright. Trick is to make sure you know what you want and order as soon as Chinese tea is served.  Unless you want to wait forever for change, make sure you leave sufficient amount! You can pretty much get in and out within 30-40 minutes!
