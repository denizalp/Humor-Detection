I have been there twice, about 4 months apart.I am originally from New York and I live 5 minutes away. I'm always looking for a local , close favorite place to eat to add to my list. But, this is not the place. I wish it was, but honestly, not even close, but, bad food on two occasions. We ordered the Fried calamari as an appetizer and we got rubber re fried string instead.  Then the main course came out and was served to us cold again for the second time. Chicken was cold in the middle but warm on the outside, not hot at all. The service is always great though, the ladies are friendly and happy to say hello. I wish i could say good things about this place after two tries, but, no. I would not recommend and I will keep on looking for a local favorite.
