This is a small but packed with people Indian restaurant. Both with indoor and outdoor seats, I like the vibe of it. They have lunch menus that has some limited dishes but they have some platters (called Thali) which includes combo of some dishes as taster. I tried Chicken Curry and my girlfriend tried Lamb Thali, both very well made except the salad and lentil soup were tasteless.  It was like salad didn't have any dressing and there was no salt in lentil soup. The waiter was very friendly. Gotta try their dinner menu too but so far my experience was positive.\n\nAlso if you like iced tea, you may be surprised with their version of ice tea. It is made in house by the chef, has clove and coriander in it which is very refreshing and different. Another surprise was that they charge for soda water which was unusual but waiter took it out of my bill.
