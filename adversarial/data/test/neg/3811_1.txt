We were a little disappointed with our visit to Cielo, a restaurant inside the Hotel Theodore (used to be The Mondrian). The atmosphere is very modern and open, and the hostess was great. Our server was nice, but not incredibly helpful or enthusiastic. I had a few questions about the wine list, but he told us he didn't know much about wine. When the bartender didn't know much either, he mentioned that the manager could help. When he came back, he said the manager didn't want to come out, but agreed that a meritage I asked about was great. It was a great wine, but I was surprised the manager wouldn't take the time to come help in person. We started out with the Tuna tartare -- it was fine, but the portions were extremely small. The appetizer might have been appropriate for one person, but barely (the two of us had two bites each). Both of us ordered Creekstone Beef Tenderloin with prosciutto and white truffle mac & cheese -- fantastic. The only issue was that, again, the portions were small. We were both still hungry, so we ordered the Grilled Romaine which was fantastic. We finished with their \"Coffee & Doughnuts\" dessert at the waiter's suggestion (Krispy Kream donut bread pudding,Hazelnut coffee gelato, chocolate butter crumble). It was good, but very, very small. When they put it down, we looked at each other and actually started laughing. It was a fun moment for us.\n\nIf you're into a modern, eclectic atmosphere and are a very light eater, this might be for you. But if you appreciate great service and a knowledgeable staff, just know we experienced an off night.
