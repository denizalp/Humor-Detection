I'm a green tea fanatic and I have to admit that green tea is terrible here. Granted, I haven't tried any other teas here, but the green tea barely tastes like anything! If I had to describe it, it just tasted like very mild rice water - due to the fact that rice mixed in was overpowering the actual tea leaves. The second time I ordered, I asked for two thirds of the water and it still tasted like nothing. Definitely not worth the expensive price. I really cannot give more than two stars just because of this - it was that bad.\n\nOther than that, their coffee was decent and it has a nice modern interior. It also seems like they have quite a few healthy selections with their salads and meals. Most staff seemed to be pretty accommodating and nice.
