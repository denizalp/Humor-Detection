We used to order take out from here years ago. I finally had the chance to dine in and check out the restaurant. The menu is endless so you are guaranteed to find something for everyone. I enjoyed their hot n sour seafood soup and pork fried rice are my favs. They have really good chow Mein as well. Food is good quality. Service is always super friendly.
