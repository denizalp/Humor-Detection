Prices are insanely high. Nachos were a joke, all the cheese curdled up and fell to one side of the pile that was a total of 10 chips.\n\nThe waiter even COMMENTED that I was with 3 big guys with big appetites and to bring a nacho order to feed 1 person is embarrassing. Especially at $20.\n\nSandwiches were good - but not worth $20 each. Tourist trap. Should of gone to Shake Shack instead and got just as good quality and larger portions for the money...
