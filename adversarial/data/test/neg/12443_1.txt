This place is next to encore hotel so a little off the strip but for the quantity so huge portions for cheap prices it's worth making a trip. They serve breakfast lunch and dinner 24 hours! It's diner type of foods but it's a great steal! Lots of choices for breakfast. Instead of spending 50 for some eggs on the strip, come try this place !
