This year I've been trying to give positive reviews but I can't on this one. I noticed it's a trend amongst most businesses these days not to give way to the customer. If someone's walking people in stores have no problems walking directly in front of you. This is not how I was raised. Yesterday I went to this place and they couldn't break a hundred, that's understandable. First world problems no worries there. Today I go back with the appropriate amount of money, as in I'm walking up to the window the cashier darts in front of me holding a cone without an excuse me or pardon me more like a get the hell out of my way attitude. This is a new trend in service that I'm just not going to let stand without a Yelp review.
