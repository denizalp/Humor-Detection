The sushi was amazing!  We ordered many varieties to try try and the did not disappoint on any!  There isn't a lot of seating inside, but it is quaint for a small group. The Bahama Mamma was suggested to us by another patron and they were spot on on the tastiness. The Ichiban was amazing in flavor. The sushi is fresh and melts in your mouth.
