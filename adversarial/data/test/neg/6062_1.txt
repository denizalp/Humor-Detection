I've only had the single cheeseburger and fries here but they're amazing. I like the thin patty with crispy edges. If you don't like the reg burgers at other places that have hard and chewy fat pieces, this is the burger you should try instead. The fries are good only if you like shoestring fries and the fry sauce really makes the fries better. If you live further than 10-15 min away I suggest eating there bc it starts to get soggy after a while but still well worth the purchase. I have yet to try any deserts.
