We were told there would be a 15 minute wait but we only waited 10 minutes or less.  This is much preferred to the restaurants that imply a short wait and leave you standing for a half hour or more. I guess you can have a beer while you are waiting since they have an open cooler at the front counter.  But not being beer for breakfast types we didn't explore that.  \nThe server was polite and helpful and checked back with us frequently to see if we needed more coffee or anything else. \n\nI had Jack's Omelet which was stuffed with all kinds of tasty breakfast meat chunks.  Sadly, the egg portion was a bit dry, but overall it was pretty good.  The hash browns were cooked just right which seems to be rare in many places.  And they were accommodating by substituting a fruit cup for the bread\/biscuit choice to keep the meal gluten free.  My wife had the Santa Fe Skillet which she enjoyed very much.  There was quite a bit to it so she was only able to eat half.  Come hungry or get something you can put in a box. \n\nThe decor was pleasant enough.  It's only nod to the Lumberjack name was the half log paneling.  I would have expected more of a National Park Lodge setting, but that's important only if you are really interested in decor at breakfast time.
