Paid for a view of the strip...Very disappointed.   Viewed the pool, saw through TI facade, Trump tower.  Not worth the extra price.  Restaurant choices were great, food was good, casino was fun.  Rooms are okay.  Would think twice before staying again.  Customer was excellant.  The staff is out\nstanding.
