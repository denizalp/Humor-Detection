Very good Korean food.  Pricey but good.  This is an off the strip trip that's worth it if you are looking for K-BBQ!  \n\nThis is an odd pairing of a Japanese Sushi Bar with a Korean BBQ place.  I've never tried the Japanes food but I've had a chance to eat here 2 or 3 times for a Korean fix in my regular trips to Vegas to visit my family.  \n\nThe Blu Go Gi, the Kal Bi, and Dae Ji Bul Go Gi are very good.  You have a choice of cooking (i believe) but we've always been too hungry to cook and just had the kitchen prepare everything.\n\nPros:\n+ quality food!\n+ plentiful parking\n+ good service\n\nCons:\n- typically empty restaurant\n- high prices for Korean food (but the quality is good!)
