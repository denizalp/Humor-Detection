Had some very tasty food here.  We had tacos, beans and rice, and huevos mexicanos. Guacamole \"dip\" (huh?). Chips and salsa of course. Margaritas too. Ok, now for the review: the margaritas were served in a pint glass! Poor presentation for sure, but, the margaritas were made well, they were good.\nThe tacos were chicken and were spiced\/cooked excellently. The frijoles were very soupy, could have been thicker but were very tasty. Rice was standard Mexican rice, I always use salsa and\/or hot sauce to make them more interesting. There were two hot sauces, green and red. The green was a mild tomatillo, the red a hot one made with Arbor del Diablo chiles I think, or at least similar to those. Small red chiles. The red was EXCELLENT! It made the rice way better.\nThe huevos had of course onions, peppers and tomatoes and were also excellent. \nOn our visit, we sat inside, and we were alone in there, but the sidewalk tables were just about all occupied. Service was good. I liked the decor inside with the dia del muerte graphic, and brick wall.
