Came with bf to try the fresh founder sashimi dinner which includes grilled fish, salad, assorted tempura, founder, leaves\/lettuce (for wrapping the fish) and some other yummy apps. At the end if you like they serve spicy soup made from the flounder head (my favourite part tbh). Everything was fresh and beautifully presented. Delicate fresh fish no fishy smell. Excellent service the girls were very attentive and we even got some tasty hand rolls as complements from the chef. Would come back 10\/10.
