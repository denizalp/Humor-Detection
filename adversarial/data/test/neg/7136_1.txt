Today, January 10, 2015, I was not only trying to manage a water boiler furnace that did not enjoy the -20 degree temps from the night before, only to then find out that the temps had wiped out the original battery in my car as I tried to go to work - I was not surprised, but when I called Motorcars Honda (where I purchased the car used in 2013) to find out how long it would take that day to get a new battery, the rep could not say - could be 1 hour, could be 4 - so, based on the advice from the guy who jumped the battery I went to Auto Zone on Mayfield road.\n\nCurtis helped me out BIG TIME!!  I bought the new battery in a few minutes, and 10 minutes later Curtis had it installed, including attaching a device to the interior that kept all the computer settings saved while the battery was changed!  Curtis made a very tough morning MUCH better, and while I may be silly for saying this, on the way home it seemed like my car was running better with the new battery!  Probably wishful thinking, but I got rid of one of the days \"dramas\" very fast, thanks to Curtis!\n\nThank you!!
