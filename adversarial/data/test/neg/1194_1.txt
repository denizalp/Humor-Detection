This asian market is the most convenient from my home and it's where I buy my food staples such as banana ketchup, instant ramen, sweet cured sausages (longanisa), pints of mango sorbet and an assortment of familiar snacks. Fried chicken skins, anyone? Not sure if I can call it a Vietnamese market with it's wide range of asian products from Japanese to Filipino. The store is small and may not have everything you'll need in one stop but it's packed to the gills with asian frozen foods, snacks, beverages, pastries, kitchen supplies and even asian video rentals. I haven't experienced the blatant rudeness mentioned in other reviews but one doesn't usually get service with a smile at this place, which is unfortunate for a small neighborhood store.
