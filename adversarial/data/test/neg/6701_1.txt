I have come here a few times and I have had the bone in ribeye and the atlantic salmon and both were superb. Cocktails were interesting and I was unsure but the strawberry thyme martini the waiter recommended worked really well. The only bad thing was the bruchetta was a little lacking.\n\nWent on a date here and had a great experience. Greatly encourage the patio. It's got a good view and it's much easier to hear outside
