I stopped at this Harvey's for lunch. I was on my way to see a friend in Mississauga and cut through Brampton. \n\nThis restaurant is pretty new. It has a cheerful feel to it when you walk in. \n\nThe cashier seemed new. I ordered a pizza burger. I didn't realize that she just gave me a regular burger combo. That's okay. It is typically my regular order!  \n\nThe burger was good. I like relish and there was a decent amount. I had hoped to get guacamole, but the store had run out. \n\nThe restaurant is clean. There is plenty of parking. I'd drop by here again if I'm in the vicinity. \n\n(216)
