I don't know why the post office hire people that have no personality and who are not cut out for the job. This post office sucks. They never answer the phone, have you on long holds, and they give you the run around. The mail men do not read the notes that are left for them and packages end up being missing or sent back. I wish I could give a negative star but unfortunately that cannot happen.
