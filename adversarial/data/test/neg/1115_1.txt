I can't lie...I was a bit skeptical at first about acupuncture but a friend recommended I give it a try and I trust her opinion. Scheduled a visit with Paul Kerzner and let me just say that the \"above and beyond\" part of the name is no joke. Instead of just a routine acupuncture appointment, we talked at length about what was bugging me. A persistent back issue was my main reason but in talking about the power of acupuncture and the Chinese herbs he uses, many other things I was concerned with could be addressed. To say I'm hooked after just a few weeks is an understatement. The herbs have helped me to sleep at night and with other goals during the daytime. My back pain has improved but we are continuing weekly treatments to reduce the irritation even more. My favorite part isn't just the acupuncture (I think it feels very good...from relaxing to stimulating depending on the treatment) but working with Paul on my overall health. His style is about accountability and working together to improve my overall quality of life....making me participant in my health rather than just giving me direction. I am very pleased with the service and results thus far but even more excited and optimistic about the future potential of working with Paul.
