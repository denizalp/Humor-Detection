The meat lovers pizza is TO DIE FOR!!  Just a perfect balance of flavor between meats, sauce, & cheese.  The crust is the perfect combo of warm crunchy\/chewy.  My husband has searched 35 years to find a pizza as good as he remembers from childhood (that doesn't exist anymore)...& he says this is SOOO much better!! \nThe customer service is above and beyond the call.  Recently my dad was in ICU while visiting from MN.  My order was \"on the house\" as we have become regular customers over the last few months and just needed some comfort food in between long stretches in the hospital.\nDON'T HESITATE. JUST COME HERE FOR A MEAL!! YOU WON'T BE SORRY ;)
