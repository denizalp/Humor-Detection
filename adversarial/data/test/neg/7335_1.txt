*****. ++++++++*First this is not s big breakfast if you are hungry do not go here!!!   Got a waffle and two slices of bacon i didn't want and it was 8.99 i couldn't swop for sausage  without a charge. There hot pastrami tasted like they dumped a bottle of salt on it . i went there because of reviews . after spending 27.00 for two people  before tip and walking out hungry i would never ever ever go back or recommend. total money making  R I P!*********
