Let's start,\n\nLocation is great! Very close to freeways, grocery stores, bars and pharmacies.\n\nArea is very quiet, and super clean.\n\nApartments are very spacious. Gated community. \n\nHands down, one of the best management I encountered. All the staff is super helpful and friendly. \n\nWork orders usually are done 24-48 hours, unless it in an emergency (will be right away).\n\nGreat prices!
