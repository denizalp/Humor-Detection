This experience is the reason I am cancelling my monthly car wash service and never returning to this location again. While waiting for the scanner to read my tag, the machine froze up. No big deal- technical issues happen all the time. A kid by the name of Weston came over to try and help, or so I thought. First, he wanted me to give him my card that the monthly fee drafts from. Not gonna happen. I pulled up my bank statement to show it was just drafted two weeks prior and I have used it since them. While in the middle of a sentence, he interrupted me to say \"I'm just over here trying to help you but if you don't want it.\" After a moment of stunned silence, I started explaining again that I didn't have my card and told him the day my account was just billed, he interrupted me again and said \"alright have a nice day\" and stormed off. I sat there STUNNED. This kid wouldn't hear a single thing I had to say and instead was mad that the machine froze. When I pulled around, I asked another employee what his name was. During this conversation, the famous Weston walked into the bay and tried to stare me down. I immediately asked to speak to a supervisor. Nobody came outside to speak to me and I wasn't waiting around. I immediately called the corporate phone number and asked for my concerns to be sent to the regional and local managers. 48 hours later and I still haven't heard anything back. Punk teenagers trying to act as if they have a right to treat customers like crap for something I had NO control in. You just lost the business of my entire household. Way to kick 2017 off with a bang Superstar Car wash.
