I get a burrito every day on my way to work via the drive thru. \"Guadalupe\" is the person at the drive thru in the mornings and she's always super pleasant and smiling. The food is fast and filling and delicious. Occasionally I go inside for a lunch or dinner, and I order other items. They're all good. Way better than Filiberto's AND they're open 24\/7, too! Midnight taco cravings (actual Mexican tacos, not that Americanized stuff at Taco Bell). I recommend the Arizona burrito or Carne Asada Burritos. Both are amazing. Taco salad is good, chile verde, carnitas, etc.. 10\/10
