We stayed at the Westin for a weekend trip for my boyfriend's birthday. We were surprised at how amazing this Westin is. We stayed at the Westin in Washington DC and was very happy with the hotel. However, this Montreal location exceeded our expectations from a Westin hotel exponentially. First off, the rooms were huge and super clean. (Completed with the heavenly beds all Westin hotels supply). In addition, the location was superb. Steps from Chinatown, Old Port Montreal and Downtown. A nice stroll to McGill University and Gay Village. The whole city of Montreal is within walking distance. We didn't even take the metro once while we were there! Our favorite  neighborhood has definitely got to be Old Montreal and we spent a lot of time there. In addition, there is a convention center which has cheap parking to leave your car if the Westin's parking is too expensive for your liking. To add to the convenience, they even exchange money at their concierge desk. Although they charge a heftier percentage than most money exchange places, it was great to have the convenience of it all. Overall, my boyfriend and I loved our stay and would definitely love to come back and stay at the Westin the next time we are in Montreal.
