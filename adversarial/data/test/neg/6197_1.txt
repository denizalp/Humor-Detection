Got my usual large milk black tea with egg pudding $6.99. The egg pudding was harder than normal. It should be soft and silky smooth. Finished the drink but left the egg pudding to show my displeasure...hehe\n\nAlso got the green tea ice cream + shaved ice with red bean and condensed milk for $6.99. The presentation was nice and the first few bites were pretty good but it got boring fast. The shaved ice is like slush after about 5 minutes. \n\nAlso got one of their hot taro drinks for I believe $4.99. Not my favourite flavour so I won't comment about it. \n\nService was fast and friendly. Compared to other bubble tea places I think Ten Ren's is falling behind. I like Chatime way better and there are other places which have much better selection in terms of snacks and dessert like Cha Me Cha. I don't think I will ever visit a Ten Ren's ever again. Its officially on my \"banned list\" BUT not because the snacks and drinks here are terribly bad but other places just offer much better for the same expensive price.
