Don't go with this company. Called and tried scheduling to have my AC unit looked at as it stopped working and it's 112 degrees outside. They told me they cant have a tech come out until Monday next week, and it was a Tuesday when I called. Tried seeing if they could work with me but the guy Victor who answered the phone just put me on hold and never came back on the line. Basically just hung up on me.
