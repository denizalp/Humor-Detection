I was so excited to see Pittsburgh finally have rolled ice cream! I always see these in philly. After hearing so much about it from friends and reading these reviews, I decided to try it during week day to avoid the wait. That was a fail, I still waited forty minutes :( \nIt's absolutely delicious, but I would say the taste is really no difference from the regular homemade ice cream. It's just really a cool experience watching your ice cream being made in front of you. Maybe that's why the wait is so long, but hopefully in a couple of months the madness will die down for those who want to try but don't want to wait :-p\n\nOne thing I hope for is for them to crush the toppings with my Cookie Monster, the guy made my ice cream just put them on top, except the Oreos.\n\nAnyway, overall I would say yes at least try it. $7 is a lot for the amount of ice cream you get, but hey there's more work to do than regular ice cream scooping job :-p
