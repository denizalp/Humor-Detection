There is a promotion until the end of November (November 30, 2017) that it costs $38 for two pots or two people (from Groupon) If you take a picture when you are at the restaurant and put the picture in \"moment\" of WeChat, you can get a jug of watermelon juice or plum juice for free.\n\nEven though it's not all you can eat, it comes with slices of pork, lamb and beef. It also has seafood, like shrimps, mussels, and crab eat. You can choose your vegetables within the selection. They also have a variety of soup base, including the traditional Asian herbal soup base. I chose the herbal soup base. It's tasty, even the herbs are sweet. Everything is fresh and good. At the end, I can't finish everything on the table and I could take whatever leftover home. \n\nI would like to come back to try another soup base.
