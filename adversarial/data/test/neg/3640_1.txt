Let me start by saying...we did not expect this in GVR..what a gem...this is a very sexy steakhouse, the bartenders are on their game.....we started with shrimp cocktail, you want to talk about big shrimp...these guys were huge...4 to an order almost ruined my dinner..but I had to press on...we split a salad between 2 of us, clean, refreshing, great flavors and spot on...there were 4 of us so we opted to split 3 steaks....bone in filet, NY strip and a ribeye...top quality on this meat...not many places with this quality of meat...the sides were mac and cheese, mashed potato and steamed broccoli...not cutting edge, but all sides were cooked to perfection and hot..we ordered a bottle of wine and we had the Sommelier Diego come over and help us pick our wine...this dude knows his stuff,,,we just wanted to get a nice buzz and he helped....to our surprise the chef was cruising the dining room checking on guests, when he approached our table that really impressed us...he is very proud of what he is serving (as he should be)...this place is awesome..top notch service and food...keep it up gang we will be back...look for the hot blonde (my girl) she loved her server Brandon.....
