This is hands down the best Indian restaurant that I've ever eaten at and I have been to several. The Naan was terrific as was the Paratha. We ordered an appetizer called Chopati Chat. Delicious. The Madras chicken was the best I've had. Vegetable Biryani was also delicious. Coming back here for sure
