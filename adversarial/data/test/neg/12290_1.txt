I wanted to get a table at a nightclub for my group. Didn't really know what is good and what is not. Michael Tomes made it so easy. He offered knowledgeable advice that was truthful and helped me made the decision. Someone met us at the club in Vegas. Got us through a long line. Waited around til he made sure we were settled. Every detail was taken care of without any hassle. It was totally worth it and I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't really know which way to go when it comes to the Vegas club scene. Worth every penny! Be sure to ask for Michael!
