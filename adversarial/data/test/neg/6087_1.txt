We checked in for 4 nights. We arrived early and could not check in early which was fine. However check in is at 4pm. And still no rooms were available. By the time we checked in we were assigned room 1204. Which had a horrible smell in the  hallway. Ice machine has a bad build up of mold. Hallway carpets are stained and smelled.  The next morning we woke up to take a shower and there was no hot water.  They gave us keys to a dirty room so we could take a hot shower. Later that evening we still had no hot water so the moved and upgraded us to a bigger room 1901. There were gnats everywhere. I so wanted to soak in the jacuzzi tub. But when we turned it on gnats were crawling everywhere in the jets. I told this issue to the front counter and nothing. It looked like such a cute and romantic place online. Those pictures are not accurate. I've been to Vegas a few times and wanted to stay off the strip this time and had a horrible experience.
