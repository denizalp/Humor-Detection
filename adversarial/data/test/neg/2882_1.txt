We were visiting for Spring Training and made reservations here on a recommendation of a friend. So glad we did! We sat out on the patio for dinner and although the night was not really warm, the heaters kept the temp just right. Food was reasonably priced and absolutely delicious! Lots of different choices. Our server Kevin was very capable and knew just when to check on us without hovering! We were never wanting for anything and he seemed to just show up at the right time. Can't wait to go back when we return to Scottsdale
