If you are looking for authentic Thai food in the West end, I would highly recommend this restaurant. The service, food and ambiance was wonderful! \nWe arrived on a Saturday night around 8pm and the restaurant was full. I asked to be put on the waiting list and waited no more than 20 minutes. We ordered their signature platter, this platter provides you with a sampling of their appetizers. It included their spring roles, fresh roles, mango salad and dumplings. Everything tasted fresh and well seasoned. My favorite was their mango salad, the mango was the perfect ripeness and not soggy which told me that it was made that day. I ordered their red curry for my entree and my boyfriend ordered their pad thai. They are one of the few places that I know that can cook pad thai using tamarind sauce. The flavor is more tangy. The red curry was seasoned well, had a good kick and had equal portions of vegetables and meat. They also have a great selection of asian beers, wine and dessert.
