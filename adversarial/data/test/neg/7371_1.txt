To simplify the long story.... Terrible customer service by the GRUMPY, OLD, MAN,that best grow a set and start treating his customers with RESPECT, before he runs out of customers and ends up with a real reason to be a dick. If you don't like people, then wtf are u doing in a customer service industry?? Avoid spending your money or time here, I'd rather drive a little further and be greeted with a courteous Hello!! Don't bring ur service dog in his store, because before he even gets the chance to see their service jacket, he's yelling at you to leave, wtf is that about, other than illegal. Then when u try to call and discuss the issue with him, he hangs up on you after yelling at you!! Sorry you're so miserable, it must be a terrible way to live!!
