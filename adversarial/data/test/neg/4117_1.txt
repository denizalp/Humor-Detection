I've been here four times now, and each time I've been unimpressed with the food, the decor and the service. One was for dinner, and the other three times were small parties. There is FAR better Italian food to be had, so unless you live in Mt. Washington, there is no reason to make the trip here. Small portions, nothing outstanding on the menu, and mediocre service. I won't be returning.
