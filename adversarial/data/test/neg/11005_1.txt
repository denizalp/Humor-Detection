We've never had a bad experience at Kelly's other than the breakfast was TOO HUGE. Man, do they give you a lot of food! I recommend the haluski and the turkey pot pie soup. The breakfast is served with Mancini's bread toast, a mountain of fresh home fries and perfectly cooked eggs. Fresh-squeezed OJ  to wash it all down, and I'm GTG until dinner! We've always had great service. It's a hole-in-the-wall but worth finding.
