There are many things I like about this location, but unfortunately there are also a few things that spoil many of my visits.\n\nThe food and coffee are great. The patio is great. Some of the staff are fantastic. There is a cashier and a busser who have been there a long time and are exemplary employees.\n\nIt is the baristas who frequently ruin the experience here. Often you will find the barista chatting with staff at the counter or watching the tv, while apparently oblivious to all the people waiting for their coffees. Sometimes the wait time is perfectly fine; but far too often one is left standing for 5 minutes before the barista even realizes there are orders.\n\nUpdate: Go back today and exact same thing happens. Zero people ordering except for me, and the barista just stand there staring at the tv for a full 5 minutes. The cashier sees me still waiting and asks her about my drink. The barista mumbles and scowling the whole time finally makes my drink. Frowning, she plops it on the counter and goes back to the tv. Worst cappuccino I have had in years. Zero foam and could barely taste any coffee.
