Haven't been to Metro in years even though it's just blocks from the house.  We remembered the food being really good. Decided last night to grab dinner there.  First thing that hit us was all the Hawaiian decor and music.  No one ever explained what was going on, but people at several other tables were going to spin a wheel for prizes so we figured it must have been a marketing promo.  The bar menu is awful.  Bud no Bud Light.  Coors Light no Coors.  Craft beers.  I ended up ordering a glass of white Sangria that came in a wine glass the size of a tea cup with ice and a slice of lemon hanging on it.  For $5.95!?  The fresh bread that came was really good but came with the single serve plastic cups of butter you get in a McDonald's breakfast tray.  We ordered calamari (which was greasy) and fried mozzarella which had so much breading and seasoning it ruined it.  My husband's meatball sub was good he said.   Unfortunately my eggplant parmesan was made with a thick layer of ricotta cheese!  Ricotta on eggplant parmesan?  No thank you.  The sauce on my pasta had separated to a big lump of tomato paste and a pool of liquid on my plate.   Took 3 bites and was done.   The service was awful and the marinara \"blah\".  It was a Friday night at 6pm in an area of town with limited dining choices. There should have been a line out the front.  Instead, half the tables were empty.  They need to get rid of the goofy marketing promos and focus on fixing the food.
