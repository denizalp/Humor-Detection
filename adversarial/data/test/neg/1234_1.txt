I had heard some good reviews about the spot and it's super close to home.  When I saw Yelp had a deal, I figured \"why not give it a shot?\"  Upon entering the restaurant, there was no hostess to be seen, so we wandered into the bar area which has multiple tv screens, but no open spots at the bar.  There was a staircase leading down and we could hear music, but were unsure if it was a private party, so we went back to hover near the hostess stand.  When a woman appeared we mentioned we had never been there and she asked if we needed a table.  After the initial confusion, we were seated in the dining room which was where the Rock\/Blues band was setting up.\n\nA male approached our table with 2 waters while the hostess cleaned the table off.  Menus were handed to us and we checked out the drink menu.  I ordered a glass of Zinfindel and my hubs ordered Tito's Dirty which specified a garnish of blue-cheese stuffed olives (one of his faves).  Drinks appeared rather quickly, but the martini was dropped off sans any type of olives.  Hubs asked, \"Where are the olives?\" and our waiter (never introduced himself, but was the water guy) said he would be right back.  When the waiter appeared shortly thereafter, the olives he presented were plain green olives.  I mentioned that the menu stated the drink came with blue cheese stuffed olives, he apologized and brought back 3 of the blue-cheese stuffed olives.  We all make mistakes...\n\nWe wanted to try an appetizer, so we decided on arancini.  It did arrive to our table quickly and was plated nicely, but there were 3 huge balls and not very much sauce.  The arancini were topped with spinach, red onions, shaved parmesan and very little marinara.  While the arancini were warm, they were not hot and the cheese was only at the center of the ball, making for a dry texture.  This arancini definitely would have benefited from more marinara sauce and a cheesier filling.\n\nRound 2 drinks were ordered and my husband asked for a Sidecar (listed on their drink menu) and I asked for Chocolate Cake martini (also listed on their drink menu).  Our waiter had a hard time understanding so we pointed to the drinks listed on the menu.  He nodded, left our table and returned shortly to ask again what my husband wanted.  Not too sure why this was so confusing.\n\nWhen the drinks arrived, the Chocolate Cake martini was creamy.  This was odd since the menu specifically stated it was \"classic style made with clear liquors\".  I pointed this out to the waiter and asked if the martini was really Chocolate Cake.  He read the menu description and left the table with menu in one hand and my martini in the other.  He returned with a new drink and apologized, explaining he had accidentally ordered the drink as a Chocolate martini.  \n\nI am not impressed with this venue, but the Rock\/Blues band was good.  We didn't get up and dance, but there were plenty of 50 (and up) dancers shaking their booties out on the floor.  I'd be willing to try this place out again when the patio is open.
