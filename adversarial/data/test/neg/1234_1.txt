It can be hard to find a restaurant that makes a good traditional American breakfast. If that is what you are looking for, the Original Pancake House is just what the doctor ordered. I order the Western Omelet, which includes three buttermilk pancakes. A large glass of fresh squeezed orange juice helps wash it all down. They have a large selection of breakfast dishes. OPH is a great place to have breakfast!
