Went in on a Tuesday night. Lightly attended back karaoke room. Interior seems like building was used as a hookah lounge previously and never updated. Was expecting more by the outside - being a house flipped into a bar. Felt like the vibe was neighborhood dive bar \/ club \/ lounge? Bartender was friendly and prompt. Maybe we caught Clark Bar on an off night.
