I had previously gone to Lenscrafters...no problem but they no longer carry Maui Jim's.\nA friend of mine had been coming here and she recommended Tempe Eyecare Associates when no one could repair my Maui Jim's.  So my first visit was just a repair.  They did it for free and were very nice about it.  When it came time for new glasses I came here.\nMedicare covered the cost of the exam, which was excellent.  And, they were able to use my old frames for the new prescriptions.  I would highly recommend these folks!
