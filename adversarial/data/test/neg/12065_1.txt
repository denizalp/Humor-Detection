This is a great place. From the moment we walked in the staff was friendly and outgoing. Introduced himself asked our names and even shook our hands!! They gave us some free knots and asked if we had any questions on the menu. They checked on us several times to make sure we didn't need anything and the food was good!\nFood came out quick and was delicious!!!\nThis place is well worth he drive
