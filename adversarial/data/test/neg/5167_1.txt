After coming here after a long walk on the strip, it was  everything that I expected. Quiet environment, great service by our server Lorena. She was very attentive and suggested great menu items. The food was delicious as we had a little bit of everything. The bread & raspberry butter is to die for!!!  I'll definitely be back!
