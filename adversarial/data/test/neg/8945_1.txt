Snakes & Lattes is a great space and a good time ... if you can manage to get in.  And that's a big \"if.\"  I realize it's controversial to criticize a place's overwhelming popularity and slow turnover, but it really does detract from its appeal for me.  If I knew I didn't have to expect to wait 1.5 - 2.0 hours for a table every single time I went, I'd come here a lot more frequently.  What spares S&L a \"meh\" 3-star rating are the sterling service and great fun quotient.  It's more than just a novelty -- it really is a great, workable idea that is an excellent alternative to yet another night of tipping expensive pints, and the perfect option for a cold, boring afternoon.  Just come prepared to wait a really, really, really long time for a table.\n\nS&L has a truly gobsmacking array of games for any number of players, and their knowledgeable staff can teach you the rules and make excellent recommendations based on your preferences.  They introduced me to several great new games.  My recs for 2-person games: Bananagrams, Geistes Blitz (this is *so much* fun!), and Elk Fest.  As well as the classic Set, and Yahtzee.\n\nThe food and coffee are merely OK -- definitely room for improvement on both scores.  Draft beer would also be a welcome enhancement.\n\n80% of the time I've come here, I've been told to expect a 1.5 - 2.0 hour wait.  This means that my nights at S&L have either been canceled on site, or involved 2 hours at a bar waiting for the call.  On one such recent occasion, the guy at the door told me he'd call in 90 minutes, \"probably less.\"  When I checked in with him, not having received a call, he claimed he'd told me it would be about 2 hours, which simply wasn't true.  This issue has made S&L unworkable for anything but the laziest of evenings \/ afternoons and eliminated it as a real Fri.\/Sat. nite bar alternative, and that's kind of a shame.
