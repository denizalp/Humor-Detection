What a yummy lunch time experience!\n\nThey definitely get packed here during lunch and it's a pretty big space too, along with their outside patio area. \n\nCame here and we ordered their lunch prefix menu (i think) and everything just hit the right spot. My favorite (as seen in my photos) was the octopus over hummus dish, so BOMB. \n\nWe also order a round of raw oysters, entrees included the lobster pata and the steak and fries (i think), all and all, it was a great experience and the price was not bad at all. If i could, I would have ordered a few more rounds of that octopus dish.
