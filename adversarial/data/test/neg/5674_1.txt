I went  here with my girlfriend on the Thursday before Memorial Day, during a time when ASU wasn't in session.  Cue Club was one of the places on Mill Ave that wasn't completely dead, but at the same time it wasn't overly crowded, either.\n\nMy girlfriend and I had a seat at the bar and received attentive service from the bartenders.  We enjoyed watching the cheesy videos and whatnot on the TV screens behind the bar. I had a \"Four Peaks\" beer (something I had never tried before), which was quite delicious.  I was very surprised when I was charged only $2.50.  I don't know if it was on special or if that's how much they normally charge.\n\nIn any event, on Friday and Saturday we scoped out Mill Avenue again, and Cue Club seemed to be packed to the gills, so we went elsewhere.  If I were still in college (or still in law school), then this would likely be the type of bar I would go to on Saturday nights.  However, at my ripe old age, I will pass on Cue Club on the busy nights.   Nonetheless, when I move to Tempe this fall, I anticipate coming back here again on off nights to enjoy a cold beer and the lack of pretense that only a dive bar can offer.  I couldn't imagine going on a Saturday night unless I wanted to feel young again (which happens every so often), or unless one of my \"fratty\" friends visits me from out of town and wants to get a feel for the ASU party scene.
