Five stars for Yappy Hour!  1 star for our waitress.   This was my first time attending Yappy Hour.  The event is 6-9 every third Thursday of the month.  Admission was $10 which gives you two drink tickets.  It also benefits the Animal Foundation.  Once you've paid and entered the courtyard you let your dog off leash and hope for the best!  Kidding of course.  Being the overprotective dog Mom that I am I was a little nervous at first because the area is huge, and I don't usually frequent dog parks and when I have I was able to keep my animals in sight the whole time.  Not really the case here but after awhile my girlfriend, who accompanied me without a dog, told me to calm down and we sat at a table and ordered a couple appetizers and used up our drink tickets.  \n\nIt was a fun, well organized event.  Rumor even had  pooper scooper patrol.  My only complaint was our server Chantal.  My girlfriend and I ordered two appetizers  from the Happy Hour menu well before the 7 o'clock end time.  When are unitemized bill came it was $19.46.  I asked why so much and she said we ordered after 7 and we said no, we didn't and not only that the time for Happy Hour is unclear as the event flyer even states 6-9.  So an otherwise great evening ended on a sour note thanks to Chantal. \n\nI do plan on going back next month and hopefully will get a different waitress.  The Courtyard is not extremely well lit as it got darker in the evening.  I think next time I will put a colorful bandanna on my dog or a collar light so she is easier to spot.
