Can't go wrong with this place!! The Meat Jun here is SOOOO GOOD!! It's thinly sliced beef fried with an egg batter.. I don't think you can get this anywhere else!\n\nThe Jun's Special comes with bbq chicken, kalbi, meat jun, bulgogi. It also comes with complimentary sides, salad, and rice. I have to say the meat jun is the best, but the other meats were tasty as well! \n\nMy fam and I also got the Chop Chae and Korean Pancake. I really like the Korean pancake it's similar to Japanese okonomiyaki and has seafood and veggies in it. \n\nService is quick and the lady is actually friendly! This place is a must try. I definitely recommend the Meat Jun!! I haven't tried the Mandoo yet, maybe another time.
