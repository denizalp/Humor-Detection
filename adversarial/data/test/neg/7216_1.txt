Always love the food here. The server today was friendly and accommodating with our toddler. Try the salmon or sea bass. Just watch out for the construction of the courtyard. It might be noisy and no view. Manager didn't apologize and instead acted like it wasn't a big deal upon arrival. Sometimes a little empathy helps. Overall it wasn't bad since the food was amazing! Just heads up if you're planning an occasion before September.
