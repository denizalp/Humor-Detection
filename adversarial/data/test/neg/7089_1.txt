Nice little spot to have breakfast or brunch. They have a huge selection of of omelettes, toast and other breakfast items. Prices range from $8 to $20 per dish which is more than reasonable for downtown. So far I tried a couple of their specials and both were good although a bit heavy (lots of cheese and bacon). Great selection of juices and smoothies as well. \nBoth times I was there the servers were very nice, and we got our food in less than 20 minutes.
