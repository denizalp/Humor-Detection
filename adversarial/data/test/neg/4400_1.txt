WHAT HAPPENED?! I chose this one to review because it is in my beloved Planet Hollywood \n\nAm I a light weight?? Must be, I had the regular Vegas souvenir cup.. is it a yard long?? I think so. \n\nWell, I have been here about 3 times. But one that knocked my socks off was the margarita flavor with an extra shot... maybe because I drank this one by myself too. One second I am walking, upright... having a normal conversation, next... the room and the people I was with are flying around my head!! My night did not end well.. \n\nIf you don't trust yourself with alcohol and shopping, have a friend hold your wallet because the Miracle Mile shops will be even more tempting with your intoxication.\n\nI think every slushy drink here is amazing, but if you get the 190 Octane and you're not too fond of the alcohol taste, swirl it with something else... strawberry would make it super tasty (and pretty too)
