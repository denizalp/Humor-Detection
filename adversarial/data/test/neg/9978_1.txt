Well my aunt decided to take our cousin and I here for supper after I was telling her about the great reviews....well lets just say they did not disappoint  Even though it was really busy we were able to get a table.  It did not take long from the time we ordered to the time we received our food....omg were the portions huge and the taste was divine.  The food was so delicious and fresh....can't wait to go back!
