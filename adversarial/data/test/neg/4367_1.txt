Upscale d√©cor, and except for the bean soup, our meal was delicious. The sweet potato fries were well cooked and fresh.  Salad was crispy and interesting.    We will return again, and there is a lot of competition for food in the Montrose area, but this restaurant is very good.  The manager came to our table to ask if everything was good and asked if we needed anything that our server didn't get for us.  I like the large amount of booths also.
