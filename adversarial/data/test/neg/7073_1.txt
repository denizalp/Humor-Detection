Great new location!  Great lighting and well appointed. You can tell they $pent some money on this move.\n\nHave nothing but kind words to say about the service and the selection.\nIt really is one of the nicest, best stocked purveyors of firearms in the valley.\nEven though I tend to ask a lot of stupid questions, they were patient and thoughtful in their replies.  For those not familiar with guns this is a really comfortable place.  If you are a collector or are well versed it's a great place simply because they have so much to look at.  Also, they had ammo.  That was odd now days and a welcome sight.  Also, the prices were very competitive.  I highly recommend giving them a try.
