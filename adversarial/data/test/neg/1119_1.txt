We went to Cantina on a busy Saturday night. It was loud like others have commented but that didn't bother me too much. The service was about a C- and the food a D. The server was friendly enough but didn't get refills, she didn't clear dirty plates either. It was a larger group so maybe that had something to do with it. I had tacos and they were really bland. Half the table thought the food was just ok, and the other half just not good.
