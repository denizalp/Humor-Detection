The portions are HUGE! But definitely worth it. I ordered the chicken and waffles to split with my 7 year old and he loved it! \n\nFrom the bacon cooked into the waffles and all the sage cooked with the chicken. \n\nI also ordered a strawberry lemonade margarita and it was great! Even got to take my tilted glass home with me!!
