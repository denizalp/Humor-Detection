I was very pleased with my last dining experience as I was introducing 4 new diners to the restaurant.  We were greeted at the entrance by your cheerful hostess staff and seated in the Stamp Room which was perfect for this group.   The noise level was moderate and we could converse without hearing the background noise from the bar and kitchen areas.  Yasiin was our server.  He has a welcoming smile and was very attentive to our needs throughout the dinner.  Thank you for the complimentary birthday desserts!  I do believe you will have 4 new repeat diners from this experience.
