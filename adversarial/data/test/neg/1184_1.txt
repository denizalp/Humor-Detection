I want to HIGHLY recommend Boulder Boats to anyone considering purchasing a boat.  My wife and I are relatively new to boating.  We bought a small Yamaha jet boat last summer, and loved it.  Then we tried surfing on a friend's boat, and decided to upgrade.  After considering the different options, we felt the Axis line of boats (built by Malibu) represented the best value for us - lots of wake, lots of room, great handling, great ergonomics, and best value for our money.\n\nWe began by talking with the General Manager, Mark.  He took a great deal of time to talk to us about what boat might fit our needs, what boats wouldn't (and why), and how to get the most value for the best price.  He took the time to understand our family's needs and abilities and our intentions about how the boat would get used most of the time (do you really think you'll have 17 people on the boat with you?).  I've been in sales a long time, and Mark comes across as trusted advisor, more than guy trying to close a deal.\n\nHe introduced us to Dave Humphries (sales person) and Dave helped us consider the different options, and get out on the lake for a demo.  We ended up settling on the A24, but the A22 and T23 were in the mix, and probably would have been great choices as well.  He offered us a fair price on our trade in, and what we feel is a good price on the new boat.  \n\nHayden took us out for a demo, and helped us select some \"starter\" gear when we got back to the shop.  He was considerate in recommending low and mid-price gear for our mostly beginner family.  Again here, we didn't feel \"oversold\" in an area where I'm sure their margins are good, and they could have pushed products that would have cost us more, and we might not have realized the benefit of.  Thank you, and well done.\n\nOur thanks to all the team at Boulder Boats.  We had a great experience at every interaction.  We felt that we, our time, and our business, were valued.  We look forward to having them help us service our new boat.  And, if we ever decide to look at new boats again - my wife says we're keeping this one for 10 years ;) - we'll definitely feel comfortable working with them again.
