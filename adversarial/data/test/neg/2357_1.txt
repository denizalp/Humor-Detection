I would give no stars if possible. I walked in today, Sunday, at 2:20pm. Waited nearly 10 minutes to be seated in an almost empty restaurant. I was seated and then waited 15 minutes for a server that never arrived. I closed my menu and walked out the door. Nobody offered to ask why and didn't act like I existed. Extremely disappointing for my first experience with this restaurant. I walked directly across the street to sienna mercato where I was immediately greeted and seated. Then my server came over within 2 minutes of being seated. This is where I sit while I type this review.\nWhat horrible customer service at Sonoma. This was one of the places I had yet to try downtown too. Too bad.
