I've been back a number of times now and my love for this place just keeps growing! Today I had brunch there for the first time. SUPER YUMMY. \n\nI enjoyed the BLT on rye, with a caesar salad, while the bf had the un-chicken waffles, with a caesar salad.\n\nMy tofu-bacon was very nicely flavoured and sliced thinly, which gave it a nice, but flexible crunch. As always, the fresh ingredients, and the house-made mayo perfectly accented the sandwich.\n\nThe caesar salad at this place is definitely a favourite of mine.\n\nThe un-chicken waffles were yummy, as always. Both the bf and I found the un-chicken was cooked to a nice denseness, not hard and rubbery like I usually find fake-meats, and the waffles were nice and fluffy. Tasted like a combination of waffles and pancakes with a hint of cornbread.\n\nI've found this is a good place to take skeptical, non-vegans who are afraid anything without meat or dairy will be icky.\n\nWill go back to eat more, and more, and more, and more...
