Really a convenient option on the days that I am too tired to cook\/clean up dinner for the kids.  The food is obviously healthy, fresh, and can be made your way.  There is a large variety of different proteins to go along with smoothies, cottage cheese, salads, salmon, eggs, etc.  A huge plus is they have soy milk.  If you workout early, breakfast is also available, and pretty wide ranging also with many choices.  Service is always super friendly. \n\nWhy the four stars? A bit bland.  Also, the espresso drinks are sometimes a miss depending on the barista that day.
