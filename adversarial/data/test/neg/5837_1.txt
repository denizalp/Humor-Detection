I have been there a few times, not the best location to get to and get out cause of the contrustion on grand ave. There variety of desserts are awesome. There cookies are good but you can make them cheaper. Connolis are baked and not fried but their filling is way too sweet. One of the next things I wanna try is the connoli cake, hopfully it's not as sweet as the connoli's. Overall it's a great bakery. Not as good as my Neldams at home!
