Oh my god - this place is so good! I got the veggie empanadas and chips & guac. Both were amazing.  \n\nSo many great things:\n\nBright tasting & fresh guac.  Chips that I'm pretty sure are made in house.  The option to add in red or green sauce. The empanadas were fresh, full of veggies (I got the veg ones) and had a nice sauce on the side. \n\nCan't wait to go back.
