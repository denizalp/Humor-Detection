I been meaning to go to Cibo for a while now and finally made my way over there. Atmosphere was alright, it was a bit loud (although this could just be the table we were at... which was kind of tiny and right next to the stairs..boo)\n\nOur server was sweet, attentive and didn't seem bothered that I kept sending her away since I couldn't make a decision on which wine to have.\n\nSpeaking of wine, list was pretty good by the glass and everything on the menu sounded amazing.... After some thoughtful planning we decided on a few items to share: Beef Carpaccio, Lamb Meatballs and the Pineapple Pizza... everything was full of flavour and delicious, although I wish they didn't top the carpaccio with potato crisps and just gave you crostini instead.... but it was a new twist to an old fav.\n\nAnd that's all she wrote folks.
