I am addicted to this place! This is exactly what Toronto needs; a non pretentious and fair priced taco joint. Since I first set foot into this place, I went back with multiple groups of friends 3 more times in the same week. It's that good!\n\nService is excellent too! They ran out of tortillas this one time when I went really late and tried to make different things to satisfy my group's cravings.\n\nKeep up the excellent work!\n\nPs. I was a little hesitant writing this review because I love this place and want to keep it a secret :P It's definitely going to be crazy packed soon.
