My family has eaten here several times in 2015 - 2 adults, 1 teenager, 2 small kids. Usually it costs about $40-45 to feed our family of 5. We live in Mesa and twice we've driven over to Tempe just to eat here.\n\nItems we've ordered: fries, onion rings, the char with cheese and bacon, and mushroom char.\n\nPros:\n-Quick and friendly service!\n-They don't charge for ranch\n-They haven't messed up our order (we have picky eaters - no onions, no pickles, etc.)\n-Quality and price are great\n-Onion rings are absolutely delicious every time\n\nCons:\n-Not very many locations\n\nOverall: I prefer to come here than In and Out or Red Robin, but my husband doesn't agree with me. But we'll keep coming to this place when we're in the area!
