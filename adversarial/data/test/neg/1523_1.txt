Took my daughter there for dunch.   I had the tempura and she had the Sakana from the lunch menu  We shared the edamame.  \n\nThe tempura was light and fluffy with a fine mix of shrimp and veggies.   The dipping sauce was a bit on the bland side, but with the addition of soy sauce, it brought in the flavor.   I didn't try any of her nigiri, which is chef's choice.   She said it was good.  The sushi roll she didn't like.   I tried it as well.  I don't know what it was, but I would never order it.  It had some mixture of what appeared to be \"fake crab,\" which is a ground fish mixture and I don't know what else.  Ughhhh.   The edamame could have used more salt.   Rather on the bland side, but a sprinkling of salt would have helped.  I mean, what can one do to edamame??  The tempura doesn't come with rice, which can be ordered for $1.   I debated, and figured I had enough to eat with the tempura, but I am not used to eating Japanese fried food without rice.\n\nYes, I would go back for dinner.   I have been here prior.  I mean, adding the soy sauce to the dipping sauce isn't that big of a deal, and I'm sure not having enough salt\/seasoning on the edamame is no big deal as well.   I normally don't order the Americanized sushi rolls, so I would not have ordered that version of makisushi.   I would imagine other makisushis at this restaurant are good, albeit I have no idea.   Presentation was very good as well as our service.
