Very classy and elegant. Service great and friendly. We had the early dinner special. Large portion of Filet Migon with whipped potatoes, and brussel sprout veggie mix. It was very filling and delicious, the special also came with a choice of a salad and dessert. The specials are $24.95 and the Filet was $5.00 extra. But well worth the money for what you get. Figure you spend that much for a good steak dinner at the Outback and don't even get the dessert . Will for sure go back there for a great meal!!!!
