We are building a new home & visited Kitchenland to get a bid.  Lou was impatient, rude and tried to tell us what we wanted.  Then he didn't even call with the bid when he committed he would!. When we finally reached him, not only did he fail to apologize for not calling, but he started arguing that he has been in the business for 30 years and we didn't need the bid yet since we haven't broken ground yet, etc.  I guess business is so good he didn't need to bid a 5200 sq ft home!
