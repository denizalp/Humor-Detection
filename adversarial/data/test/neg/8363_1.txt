I don't know where to start. Came in with an appointment for a gel manicure and regular pedicure. I noticed how the polishes were very very cheap and ask if I could use a gel polish instead and wait for it to dry. The instruments don't seem sterile and they tried to trick me on the prices multiple times. It's common sense that cuticles should be cut, and the older man(forgot name) tried to tell me how cuticles shouldn't be cut. I told him I didn't cafe and wanted to have them cut. They spent 2 hours on just my toes. Then they didn't take American Express and I didn't have my ATM on me. I told them I'd come back to pay and they literally treated me like a delinquent because they thought I didn't want to pay for the service. So rude. I came back and paid of course. Steven does good work though, too much stress to get to the result though.
