Came here for an early dinner.  After contemplating the burger of the day which had picked beets and ranch dressing on it (among other things which I've forgotten) we settled on the shepherd's pie and the sloppy joe with mixed greens.  Both were tasty and comforting (which is what we were looking for).  As others have mentioned the portions are pretty big.  \n\nThe interior is on the smaller side with cosy booths and a lot of natural light.  It's a nice place to sit and enjoy a meal and have a conversation with friends.\n\nOne thing that did surprise us is that for Saturday dinner the clients were exclusively families with young children.  We ended up sitting near the loudest screamer I've ever heard.  And he screamed continuously.  I think it was his art and his calling and he would not compromise on those points.  We laughed about it because we had already finished eating at that point.  I could see this really bothering other people though.  It would have bothered me if I had to deal with it for more than 10 minutes.
