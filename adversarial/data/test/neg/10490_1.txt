No problems here!\nWe got in a small fender bender, but still, left my little Hyundai undriveable so we needed a rental. This was the closest location to our house, and easily made it there by bike (4 miles downhill!). We reserved an economy and when we checked in, requested if they had anything that was a hatchback or something that could fit two bikes. They gave us a Kia Soul which fit them perfectly.\n\nThe car was clean when we got it, no smells, and only 8000 miles. Service very friendly and fast.\n\nWe rent a lot of cars, and this place may replace my go to place from now on. So close to home and no lines. They also do take debit or credit cards. Some places only take credit. And if you have a spouse, you can add them as a secondary driver for no additional fee.\n\nTip: It's located inside the Buick\/GMC dealership. Enter through the service dept. You won't see any signage viewable from the street.
