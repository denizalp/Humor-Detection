I guess for a burger joint in Markham it's good. Can't touch the Priest or even 5 Guys for that matter. The burger was good, I couldn't decipher if the special sauce was plain mayo or actual sauce. This may be kind of picky but I really didn't like that they toast their bun, it tasted like it was toasted in the oven.... Not my thing... The fries tasted frozen even though I know they aren't, they had no colour and because there was a lack of caramelization there was almost no flavour.
