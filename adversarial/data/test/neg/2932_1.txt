We walked to Jim's this morning for the first time, after living in the neighborhood for 2 years.  The place looks like a diner from the 70's, which was cool.  \n\nIt was seat yourself, and didn't seem very busy.  The place was very clean, and the staff was very nice.  We were waited on quickly, and our coffees were refilled 3 times during our meal.  Our server was very nice, and very attentive.\n\nBreakfast was good, and reasonably priced.  \n\nI can give Jim's a solid 5 stars!  Keep up the hard work, and we'll for sure visit again!!
