Yesterday I went to Hawthornes for the first time because I wanted to try it based upon recommendations from others. My boyfriend and I walked to the bar and were not greeted right away by the bartender even though the bar only had 3 other people sitting there and she was only getting a check for someone. After about 10 mins, we were finally greeted and given a menu. We ordered a 9 inch cheese and pepperoni pizza to share and 14 long island wings to go. My boyfriend ordered a bud light and the bartender was nice enough to recommend a local cider for me that she thought that I was like. It was actually very good so I was glad she recommended that. It wasn't a very long wait for our food so we were pretty pleased with that. The bartender gave us the wrong check by mistake but quickly corrected it after we brought it to her attention. As we left,  she did not thanked us for our time for our business so we did not leave a tip. When, I got home I opened up the pizza box and the pizza looked very oily and was very thin. The pizza tasted unfortunately just as it looked. It tasted very oily and let flavor probably because it was so thin. The crust however was delicious, you can tell it was homemade. The wings did not have enough flavor as the whole thing wasn't even sauced. The wings had a lot of potential to be great as the part of the wings that did have sauce tasted delicious. There wasn't even enough sauce to dip the dry chicken wing parts in. I don't know if I'd recommend it but I may come back and try something different one day.
