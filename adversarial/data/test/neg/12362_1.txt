Ahhh thank the LAWD. This was delicious. We got the chicken shawarma plate, the veggie plate, the lemonade and some cigar baklava. The taste of everything was right on, just like how \"jidd\" used to make. Thank you for restoring my faith in good middle eastern food. \nThe pita bread is something not from this world. People were coming in just to get bags, BAGS of pita. \nOh.....the lemonade? SON. You've made a mistake if you didn't get that, turn around right now. Order 2. GAHHHHH.
