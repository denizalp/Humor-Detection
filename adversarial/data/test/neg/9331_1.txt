We have been getting Kenafa and other Arabian sweets from this place for the past few months and so far it's the best in town. A warm place and a very welcoming owner. Stays late for a late night craving of Kenafa with a cup of Turkish coffee. I recommend everyone to try this place and try their newly launched Shawarma sandwiches. Authentic stuff!!
