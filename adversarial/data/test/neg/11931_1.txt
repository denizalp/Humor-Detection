I am giving this place 1 star because i was not able to post without giving it something but i would have done 0! \n\nI cannot believe how terrible this MOTEL is..... this is by far nowhere near a hotel and spa!!!!!! My sister and I had nowhere to go after our friends decided to leave early from Vegas and we were willing to stay anywhere we could find a vacant room. We were told that this was on the strip and had mixed reviews obviously the people who wrote those \"good reviews\" worked for the motel. \nI would rather sleep on the street then at this MOTEL, i would probably be more safe if I did. DO NOT  STAY HERE! The room was filthy, the second I stepped into the room I knew there was no way I would sleep there, there were dead roaches and the room was filthy. The place is crawling with sketchy people and let's just say it's easy for a guy to have a \"good time\"...... I know its Vegas and I did expect it, but it was really bad!  I would not be surprised if they had cameras in the rooms. Please do not stay here.  I was so scared and freaked out that I did not even try to ask for my money back I just wanted to get out of there as soon as I could. When we got into the cab (after being there for a total on 20 min) the cab driver said to my sister and I...\"you 2 should not be here you could not be anymore unsafe then what you are right now!\" I wish I could have been warned before staying here so please take my advice.
