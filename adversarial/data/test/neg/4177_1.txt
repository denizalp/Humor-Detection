On the recommendation from sister who lives locally I visited here for a dinner.  I had arrived earlier hearing that it does get bus and that was wise advice.   Arrived around 5:30 but by 6:30 there was a sizeable lineup.   Always a good sign.  Service was attentive.  Food was good with some warm sake, and then sushi and other dishes.  A number of rolls and some rice.  I enjoyed and would return.   I have thanked my sister for the recommendation and would recommend to others.
