My AC went out at the end of last summer so with the temperatures we've been having I had to get it recharged. I stopped by Auto Zone this afternoon and had no idea what to buy or how to recharge my AC system. \n\n   Jocelyn came by and asked me if I needed any help. She looked up my car on her computer and told me the exact amount of refrigerant that is required (30 oz). She walked me through all of the steps that I had to do to recharge my AC unit and then suggested that I buy only 20 oz at first to test the holding ability of the system. I did all of that and it worked great. I went back and got my last 10 ounces and put that in also. My AC is working great!\n\n     I really appreciate the effort that Jocelyn put in to make sure that I understood what I was doing. I also like that she was looking out for my best interests when she suggested that I only buy 20 ounces at first to test my system.\nIn a world where most places try to up sell you as much as possible, this was a great experience. Auto Zone is my new favorite neighborhood Auto store.
