Today was supposed to be my first flight with Allegiant. (Price and convenience were why I chose this airline.). I arrived at the airport and was in line to check my baggage.  Then I was told the flight had been cancelled.  No text, no phone call.  I was told no explanation.  There were no weather issues.  There were no other flights to my destination today.  Thus, I am missing my husband's 60th birthday party.  I am heartbroken.  I was rescheduled for tomorrow and given a voucher to stay at the local Holiday Inn.  I was also given a voucher for a $100 off a future flight.  I understand this is standard procedure, but it doesn't help me to be at an event I was flying out of state for.  Needless to say, I highly doubt I will be relying on Allegiant again, nor will I recommend it to anyone.
