Very nice decor and a gem in the center of the Legends district in downtown Phx.  Have lived in Phx for over 20 years and went to the Dbacks game a short 2 block walk from the hotel.  The room was lovely and the only issue we had was the brick they call the bed.  I will admit that I am spoiled with a sleep number bed at home but having been a road warrior for years, I will tell you that the beds at the Hampton Inn's and Renaissance are head and shoulders above the Palomar bed we had.  The staff  was very well trained and professional.
