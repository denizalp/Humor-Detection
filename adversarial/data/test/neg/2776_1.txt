I enjoyed myself here, mostly because, when I went at 4 on a Thursday, no Ryerson students were present. \nInstead, regulars surrounded the bar, and my companion and I got to take in a football match and enjoy decent poutine (although dude, cheese chunks, not curds?). The staff was even kind enough to cater to my friend's OCD and separate out the ingredients of the poutine, so he could just eat the fries, while I got to feel all pretentious with my deconstructed poutine.
