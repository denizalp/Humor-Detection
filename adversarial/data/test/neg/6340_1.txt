I haven't had a positive dental experience since I left Erie and moved to Pittsburgh. I have to say thank you Cynthia Labriola for making me excited to go to the dentist again! I was referred to this dentist by a friend that swore that she was the best. I had my doubts since I loved my dentist back home. \n\nI was mistaken for sure. The front desk people are incredibly friendly and personable. They asked me a few times how to say my name correctly because they wanted to make sure they pronounced it right, that meant a lot to me. They laughed with me when I told them I wanted to make my next appointment later than 8 am, and told me about them trying to drag themselves into work. It was just so friendly that I enjoyed my checking in and checking out experience\n\nMy hygienist Theresa is amazing. Boy, when she told me she was going to really scrap my teeth, she really did scrap, and my teeth looked amazing. She was friendly, talkative, and informative about the new x-rays machine that they were using. I wouldn't change her for the world!\n\nA great office, a great location (to me), I would recommend this dentist to everyone!\n\nLooking forward to going back there in October!
