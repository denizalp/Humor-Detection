Oh my God! This place is a treasure. I found this place actually on yelp, and turns out it is very good. The food is authentic and very spicy- how I like it. I have been to a number of thai restaurants and this one always makes me feel complete. You can rate you're spice  by number one through five. The owner is really nice and always makes our dishes how we want. Definitely recommend!
