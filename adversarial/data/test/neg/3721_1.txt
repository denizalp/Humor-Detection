Terrible experience in the Cafe. Waitress disappeared the second we walked in. Coffee was like jet fuel and undrinkable. We waited and waited and waited. Decided to leave and had to wait while cashier seated people--where is the waitress? At least we didn't have to pay the coffee. Cashier told us it wasn't the first time.
