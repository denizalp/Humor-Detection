What a letdown. I ordered a ham and cheese omelet and a mimosa. They cooked the living hell out of my omelet, the hash browns and the toast which leached every last bit of flavor out the whole plate. The mimosa (which was $13) was maybe 8 ounces and I would estimate it was 7oz of orange juice and 1oz of champagne. My waitress came exactly 4 times, once to take my order, once to give me my order, once to take my debit card and once to return it to me (it was not busy). On the plus side, their bar area's decor was pretty cool and has a decent view.
