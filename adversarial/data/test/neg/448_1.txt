I paid for the wash and it just keeps saying back up before you go inside and it doesn't work! Cashier with her attitude all she says it she can't do anything about! Won't return my money or already the wash! Customer behind me had the same problem and she can't even do anything to help him either! Ask e her what time was the manager getting there and she couldn't even speak she just moved her shoulders like she didn't know! Total bitch!  Bad service!
