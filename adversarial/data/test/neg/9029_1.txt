Right off the bat I have to say this was a disappointment for us. I read the reviews and was a bit surprised after excitedly rushing here our first night in Vegas. We made a reservation for 8pm and the restaurant was not busy at all. We asked to sit at the sushi bar and after we were seated were told we could not order from the chefs directly, which is absurd for folks from Los Angeles. The food should not be called sushi, it it is more of a fusion experience. We ordered - rock shrimp appetizer, Lima roll, lobster roll and a side of roasted vegetables. The food lacked any distinct flavor profiles and was very expensive. The rock shrimp appetizer was good, but comparable to other rock shrimp appetizers with a basic aioli sauce on a bed of spring greens. The Lima roll was so basic, a crab mix over a basic roll. The Lobster roll looked the most exotic but the flavor profile was bland and lack luster. The service was decent but they got very defensive when we asked why we couldn't order from the sushi chefs. Unfortunately, I think folks that do rave about this place have not had very amazing sushi experiences and I was glad we didn't shell out the big bucks for the omasake experience.
