We went for brunch. Kids menu are decent sized portions. I ordered the fried chicken and waffles with egg Benedict. It was cooked properly. But the flavor wasn't my thing. First time I ate fried chicken waffles and egg Benedict. My husband ordered the custom omelette . He loved it. We ordered cheesecake to go because we were stuffed. \n\nThere was no line for a buzzer when the mall opened at 930am. We were seated at our table at 10am when the restaurant opened.
