I went to check out Cadillac Jenkins last week. A buddy told me about it. Met a friend there. I'd been following the word on Instagram and you know what? Finally T. O. has a place like this. I mean, I walk in and I'm immediately greeted by the owner, Tyrone Gayle. He's friendly. Affable. Brings me right to a table. \n\nLet me give you an idea of what it's like inside. Intimate, chic and hip, if that makes any sense to you. Picture a space with toned down pod lights romantically enhanced by candles, a dark, sprawling, mirrored bar with countless beverages decorating it and the smooth soul stylings of D' Angelo on the turntable (yeah, the turntable) and that's Cadillac Jenkins. It must be pretty versatile as I heard there are other nights when the place really hops with a dance floor. I'd seen pictures of the food so I already knew what I was going to have: the fried jerk chicken sandwich on coco bread, a real twist on Caribbean food. \n\nThis is one big sandwich, man. The chicken was fresh, perfectly seasoned, soft and tender on the inside which was directly opposed to the hearty crunch of its outside. Then you taste the jerk flavour on the back end of every bite. Washed down with a cold Red Stripe. All with a heap of creamy cole slaw right on the chicken just makes this, as well as the prompt and welcoming service, something you're going to want again the next time you come. \n\nAnd you will be back. Me? I'll try and pry myself away from the wicked fried chicken on coco bread and, with the very reasonable prices, dip into one of the other amazing items on the menu that I eyeballed as they passed by my table. The roti three ways, jerk pork tacos, shrimp and scallop Scotch eggs, beef patties rammed with jerk chicken and jerk  chicken and waffles are calling my name.
