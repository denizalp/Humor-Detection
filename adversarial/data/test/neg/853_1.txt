You guys really need a new staff who knows what they are doing... I walk in and the place is a mess just to start off I look in the back where bagels are cut and sandwiches are made and there is stuff everywhere... I order 6 bagels and your staff kept giving me the wrong bagels I was ordering. I asked for them to be sliced and I get home and of course they aren't sliced... Get it together.
