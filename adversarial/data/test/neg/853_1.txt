I have enjoyed the food from this restaurant but the service is not acceptable!! They are rude on the phone and have forgotten portions of our order numerous times and then deliver missing items 40 minutes later. We are 5 minutes from their location. I don't think I will be giving my business and money to a restaurant who has such horrible customer service!
