Went here for dinner with the husband. I had heard it was really good and being from NY am always on a search for authentic Italian. I loved the atmosphere and that place does a mean business! The line was out the door for pickup. I went with the Chicken Passion, which was delicious! Chicken and bowtie pasta with broccoli in mushrooms in a marinara sauce. The sauce was spot on and everything was seasoned to perfection. My husband had lasagna which he and I both thought was subpar. Definitely not bad or made poorly just the way they make their lasagna we didnt like. We prefer a thicker lasagna. This didn't have a ton of meat or sauce on it. I am definitely going again to try the pizza and I will update my review. Their pie looked amazing!
