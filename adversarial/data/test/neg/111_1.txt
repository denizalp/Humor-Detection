Service is terrible. Stood in line for 20 minutes, gave him our order twice. Got to the table and discovered he left a pretzel out of the order. Went back and asked for it, he said he didn't capture it, and if we still wanted it, to get to the end of the line to order it; which now has grown ten fold. \n\nLast time I ever visit this brand, they are idiots, and his name tag was scribbled on and unreadable. When i asked for the manager, he walked away and started to take orders again.
