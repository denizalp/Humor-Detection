The first time she did my hair she did a great job. However she took over 4 hours to do my color and cut. I was patient and sat basically in the same chair for the entire service. I'm glad that I had no other appts for that day since I wouldn't have been able to do anything else! She is a great colorist, but my advice to you if you are expecting a quicker stylist keep looking. Also, I had to cancel an appt and reschedule but she has not returned any calls so far. My guess is that she is just not at all flexible, so if you make an appt with her, no matter what don't cancel as she seems to simply blow you off at that point. Another thing, called her 2 weeks prior to my birthday to do what she offered as a free follow up color refresh and she got back to me too late to have her do my hair for the event planned on my birthday. I would call her a one hit wonder (except for the incredibly long time she takes getting your hair done.) \nSo, to amend this review: she's now cancelled her appt with me a few hours before my appt, having waited 2 weeks for the second appt.  The last appt we had she did not even show up. Honestly she may need to think about retiring at this point if she cannot keep her appts. Well now she has one less client to schedule....
