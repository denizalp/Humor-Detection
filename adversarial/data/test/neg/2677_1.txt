Love used to be one of my favorite Cirque du Soleil Shows to attend when I came to Vegas. Yes it was different from other shows in the sense that the music isn't perform live, but then again, no one other than the Beatles could truly do their music justice.\n\nIf you have ever seen the show previous to February 2016, you would be in complete shock of the state of the show is in now. It is almost completely unrecognizable. The show has been redone for its 10th anniversary. It has been \"revamped\" with a new mix of music, change in acts, addition of a few characters, etc. \n\nThe new show has bits and pieces of its former self, but the story is completely lost and hard to follow now. The popular Mr. Kite performance, is more politically charged and the high flying performance is forgettable and a shadow of its former self. The show is disjointed and doesn't flow smoothly. Worst of all, the show relies to heavily on dancing and the use of video technology. Don't get me wrong , they do a great job on some bits, but when you go to see a Cirque show, watching a TV screen shouldn't be your main focus.\n\nThe price is to steep for what once was a great show called Love. Sadly I can give you no more love in your current state. If you must go and see this show, under no circumstances should you pay full price, go to a discounted ticket site or Tix4tonight and save yourself some money.
