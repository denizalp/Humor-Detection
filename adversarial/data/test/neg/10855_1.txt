First time at this fair. We went on $2.00 day which was nice. I would have been upset paying $40.00 to get it this thing. The parking is a joke. We were in traffic and sat there and watched these people change the signs from $15.00 parking to $20.00 parking. I have never in my life seen such a thing. Then we had to pray we didn't get ran over by crossing the street. So we go to the vendor part which is my favorite of any fair. What a joke. No samples, hardly any demonstrations. So we walked around for a few and decided to  pass on all the expensive deep fried food and go eat at a nice place for cheaper. I think I'll stck with the Washington state fair in Puyallup.
