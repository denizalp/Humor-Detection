When I first learned that Pixy Cakes was going to be opening the fat girl inside me was ecstatic.  I went to Pixy Cakes on their first day of business.  I try to watch what I eat, but when it comes to cupcakes the fat girl inside always wins over my thin outer girl. I would have given them two stars on their first day as the cupcakes were dry and not good.  Pixy Cakes then had their \"official\" opening on 08\/25\/12.  I purchased a Groupon and used it today.  So far I have only had the red velvet and the snickerdoodle.  The red velvet was good, but the snickerdoodle was amazing.  I'm optimistic that the other cupcakes I purchased today will be good as well.  Pixy Cakes still has room for improvement, but I wish them luck as they are very conveniently located.
