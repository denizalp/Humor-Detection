It's not often that you come across someone so exceptional at what they do, that you know they're destined to do it.  Over the years I've had a lot of massages, some good and some bad, most mediocre at best.  Some of that probably has to do with me...what can I say, I have high expectations.  I also happen to have some serious muscle issues that your average therapist is not prepared for.  Kenta was recommended to me by one of his peers about a year ago.  Prior to that, I was burning thru several therapists a month, in a seemingly vicious cycle of brutal massages, spending days afterward on heating pads\/taking pain pills.  Thankfully, those days are long gone.  Every massage I've had with Kenta has been a dream.  He's knowledgeable, highly skilled, and almost intuitive in his practice.  He's also personable, pleasant, and even his tone of voice is relaxing.  He has a genuine interest in helping people feel better, which is part of what sets him apart from others.  Even if you don't live close, I promise you, it is worth the drive.  Do yourself and your muscles a favor and check it out...you won't be sorry.
