While working hard through the typical lunch hour, I decided that this would be the perfect opportunity for me to go out for lunch! It was 1:20 when I arrived at Choices which I observed was a great time to show up because there was only a handful of occupied tables. \n\nI got promptly seated and water was delivered. Pretty much right after I made my decision my server came over to take it, which was nice... No waiting! \n\nMy food came out fast and was delivered to me within 15 minutes, I applied my second love (hot sauce) generously and did the chopstick dance, which is also known as chowing down!\n\nI have to say that it was alright. I enjoyed the flavor of the beef but wasn't to crazy about the chicken. The spring rolls were quite \"doughy\" and tasted like they were from a box. The vermicelli and veggies were good (can you ever have bad vermicelli?)\n\nThe portion was pretty big and I was surprised in myself that I ate pretty much the whole bowl! (With some chicken left aside) \n\nOverall I found it satisfying but not great.
