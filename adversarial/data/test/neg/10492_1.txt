Went for a free session as a member had an invitation. \n\nWas so impressed upon registering that they use a white board like registration form that saved trees!!! Love it. \n\nThe staff is friendly and the area is incredibly clean. \n\nThe yoga teacher was good but not the greatest. Although she embodied everything I would want in an instructor physically. She was strong, she was serene and she was in amazing shape. There were no adjustments, no engagement and nothing that left me wanting more. \n\nAfter the class there is beverage station which offers a flavour of tea - yes just one (at least the day that I went) and it was a concoction I can't even remember but not for my taste buds. \n\nMoving on to the change rooms, it was clean, open and everything was easy to find. I did not decide to sign up because I looked around and realized what I would be paying for. I would opt for a cheaper studio with a better yoga instructor because at the end of the day I come for the yoga and not the tea or the facility.
