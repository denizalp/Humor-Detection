Brunch wasn't that great :( dinner was awesome !\nCame in for brunch and for a place like this you expect everything to be very close to perfect. Our table wasn't sat properly so we only had one spoon on the table. I had to ask my (overly nice) waitress for a spoon 3 times. I ordered a coffee and how can you go wrong with coffee. It was room temp and did not taste well . I never drank it and asked my waitress to take it but it was still on my bill. The rolls were dry and stale tasting like they may have been left over from yesterday. Overall I would not return here for brunch. I could get better eats and coffee at Famous Toastery or something of the like. My dinner experience was a 10\/10 so I would definitely return here for that!
