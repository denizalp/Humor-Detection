I came here because my phone doesn't charge. It loses charge rapidly. I got to the store only to be told that I had to wait for an hour and half. I told the lady my phone wouldn't last that long. She didn't offer to help me charge it or anything. She told me I had to wait an hour and a half. I waited the hour and a half, when it got to my appointment it was at 2%   I told her my charge wouldn't last. Now I can't get my info off the phone :\/\/ during the appointment my phone died, now it won't turn back on.
