LOL, I love that I am considered a regular on Yelp here when I was in Vegas for a week. We stayed at our time share across the street and they gave us vouchers for the restaurants. If you couldn't tell by the fact that I am a \"regular\", we went there a couple times because the food was good and inexpensive. If we stay at the timeshare again, I will definitely be back to Big Sur!
