I made fun of a new acquaintance for his love of Whole Foods and of course find myself there the next week. To add to my hypocrisy, I love it. It is well worth the drive and the only grocer in AZ where I have been able to find my boyfriend's favorite beer: Rogue's Juniper Ale. As an added bonus, I also found Voodoo Donut Maple Bacon Rogue Ale. How could I turn it down? I used to frequent Whole Foods by Lincoln Center in NYC years ago and have spent my last years attempting to find another location that uses a machine to make honey peanut butter with no luck until today. Delicious, yummy, amazing happiness. Love the samples, love the produce, don't love the eel sushi: chewy\/gummy eel and found a bone. It was also great being next to Trader Joe's as there are things I like in both. That being said, I don't think it will be too long until I come back!
