Pretty good for what it is. It's a cute little neighbourhood place in the beach which frankly, we don't have enough of. I had the sausage roll for an appetizer and the gnocchi for dinner. The role was pretty tasty. Simple. The gnocchi was a touch on the sweet side but still good. I definitely plan on returning.
