Quantity over quality. I would return but I wasn't wowed. I can't comment on the wait for a table because I sat at the counter\/bar. The service was swift. Not much conversation from the bartender but I'm cool with that. He was very focused and fast!\n\nPros:\nService was quick. Orders were taken, prepared and served promptly.\n\nPortions are HUGE. I had a whole itinerary for food for the day and literally my one pancake made it to where I didn't need to eat anymore... and I can eat when I want to. One pancake at 11:30 am lasted me an entire day. It's basically a lazy susan sized pancake.\n\nThe apple slices in my apple cinnamon pancake were both large and fresh. Not too crunchy, not too mushy. \n\nHot chocolate: So I accidentally ordered the smores mocha instead of the classic hot chocolate (definitely my mistake, I don't even like coffee). However, the large marshmallows, graham cracker and torch they used to melt it were so delicious I ended up drinking more of it than I expected. \n\nCool diner like atmosphere that had the basketball game on at the bar.\n\nCons:\n\nI came there to try the strawberry frosted flake pancake I saw on the online menu but this location doesn't have it. Apparently only certain locations do. No big deal, but it really was the dish that intrigued me to check the place out in the first place. Would have been fun to try.\n\nI like my pancakes soft and fluffy. Some people like theirs with a little crisp on the edges (my wife). My apple cinnamon pancakes were slightly under-cooked even for me. I think with the size of the pancake, it might be tougher to get it to cook all the way through without some parts burning. Inside parts of the pancake had a slight mushiness to it.\n\nI tasted my friends chicken and waffles. I don't eat bacon (yea I know... cue the boos) and these have bacon in them. That said, the waffle was good and the bacon actually wasn't that bad either. It was thick enough to where it tasted more like a piece of meat than the little slither of crisp most places serve. However, I didn't really like the chicken. There was a bunch of extra stuff on it (leeks and sage and whatnot) but the actual chicken itself needed a little more seasoning in my opinion.\n\nAll in all, if and when I return to Vegas, I would go again but it wouldn't be a priority. I want to try the stuffed french toast. My Lyft driver was raving about it and a few of the reviews I read concur. I also want to try the strawberry kiwi watermelon drink they had at the bar. I really wanted one but I drank so much the day before I needed a break.
