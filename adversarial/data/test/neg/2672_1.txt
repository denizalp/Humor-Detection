I love this coffee bean and tea leaf... I was so excited when I moved here and drove by it. I was a little worried there wouldn't be one and i would only get it when I go to Malibu to visit family. \nThe staff is super friendly I always get a iced non fat vanilla latte... Mmm super delicious best out of all coffee shops hands down
