Flash plumbing did a great job! They definitely listened to my needs and took care of me. They came over for an appointment and finished the job within an hour and half. Quicker then I had anticipated. The pricing was also very reasonable. Chris and Mike were excellent and very professional. Exceeded all expectations from start to finish. Thanks guys! I will call again.
