I had a bad experience at this location, but they made up for it in customer service.\n\nIf you have any problems they will do their best to rectify the situation.\n\nThe president of the chain contacted me and was very polite and made a great deal of effort trying to reach me through different channels to discuss my issues. \n\nThis shows me they DO care about their customers and DO care about loyalty.\n\nNot many places are willing to do that these days, so I honestly appreciate that and will now be coming back sometime in the future when I never thought I would.
