Always order Fuji apple  salad  and never get the right ingredients in the salad , no cucumbers, no apple chips, little onions, and one small cup of dressing. The people that works there are not too friendly.  One time I stated no pecans but my salad had a lot of pecans. I'm starting to think Panera don't like me, but I'm a great customer
