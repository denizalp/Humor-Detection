I've been going to this location since it's opened and I've never had an experience like the one I had on Wednesday evening. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars and not 1 star is because I reveieved a call from the store manager, Michael, shortly after the incident. I placed an order on thr burrito boyz app and went to pickup my order. Coincidentally my order was being made by the employee when I walked in. I saw my husband's name and watched in horror as my order was being made incorrect. When I pointed out the error I was met with complete disrespect and ignored. She out very little cheese (not the norm) the added green peppers which was not on the order and ONE LINE of hot sauce instead of one dot. My tolerence for spice is extremely low so I questioned her and was again ignored. Another server offered to make my order and she was pleasant and made it correctly. However, I had to wait an additional 15 mins after it was given to be grilled and could only assume the previous employee had something to do with that. I threw out the burrito because I didn't trust the food that was given to me. I didn't know what could have been done to it. After my phone call with the manager I was assured that was not the case and invited back to the location so they can make it up to us. I will update everyone after I return and we will see if this rating will be updated based on my next experience.
