For the area, it's definitely the best Chinese buffet I could fine; however, if one is willing to travel a little farther, the buffet off of independence will really blow you away.  \n\nThat's not to say this place doesn't have a great selection. You find food raging from sushi, just official Cantonese, and everything in between. You probably will find a few American dishes like ribs or meatloaf also located on the buffet. And the price definitely doesn't hurt this place, because of its affordability, I probably will return.
