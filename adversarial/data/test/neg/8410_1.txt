I had skimmed over a few reviews before deciding that this was where I'd go for lunch. I believe the difference between a medium and large order was getting 2 naan instead of 1. When we first dug into the naan it was warm and soft but as we continued in our meal I could tell that the edges were hard. The amount of food on the plate is was too much for just myself. I suppose if you have a good appetite it would be a good portion for you. I'll admit that I don't have butter chicken all that often but I was surprised when I got my order. It's definitely different from what I've had before. It was good but not what I was expecting.
