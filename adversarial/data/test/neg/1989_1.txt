The food here's AAAAmazing!! Fried green tomatoes are delish! Sweet potato pancakes, home fries, goat cheese grit poppers and more, whatever you order you're sure to be more than satisfied. Even more awesome is the customer service, we had Karlee helping us today, and she's just the best! Love Tupelo honey cafe!!
