Love it. It's my new workspace now. Given that it's in a fairly quiet neighbourhood, also with lots of other cafe options - there was ample space when I got here around 11:30am on a Friday. It started willing up around 1pm with most of the tables taken. \n\nSmall tables and bar stools at the front - with a bigger communal table at the back, more bar stools and a two seater. \n\nCoffee was okay, but their hot chocolate was REALLY GOOD. For snacks, nothing gluten free, but everything looked quite tempting. They have small empanadas, which were ample in the morning and all gone by 2pm. \n\nThey also have a copy of Settlers and other board games, I guess for anyone that just wants a place to hang out, rather than do work. \n\nParking is pricey on the street, but lots of 1 hr options along the residential street, except when there are snow banks that cover everything!!
