My boyfriend and I came here to try their Big Taste Calgary menu which was shockingly available. For $25 you got a 5 course meal consisting of: bruschetta, salad, penne pomordoro, tiramisu and your choice of one of the following entrees: 10 oz New York Steak, 8oz steak with tiger prawns, veal, chicken parmigiana, or salmon sorrento with tiger prawns which came with a side of vegetables and your choice of risotto or roasted potatoes.\n\nIt was very quiet when we arrived, with only a few tables filled but the place was clean and presentable. The reason for my 3 star review is because it felt like the food took forever to come and also because none of the food really blew my mind. Mind you, the kitchen only had one chef working at the time who was preparing all the dishes. I was pleasantly surprised at both the size and tenderness of my steak (I could barely finish my 8oz steak which I'm pretty sure was bigger than that!). The bruschetta was wonderful but I'm not a big fan of balsamic vinegar and didn't enjoy my salad as much. The penne was a simple tomato sauce which tasted like something I could've made at home. The tiger prawns felt like regular prawns to me?? I did enjoy the risotto though, it was creamy and delicious. The tiramisu felt a little too moist to me. \n\nOverall, I think The Garden is a nice affordable place to eat! It is hard to find a steak dinner like this for this price anywhere anymore in the heart of downtown.
