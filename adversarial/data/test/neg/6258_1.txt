I got a haircut from Vicki or Vicky. She cut my hair and she kept bossing me around and being rude. \n She was acting like I'm not a living thing with emotions that can be sad or happy or angry then the next customer came she was acting very nice. \nThis is from my son who is 11 years old. He wrote this.
