Visited the new office on Blue Diamond and extremely long drive for me, they said all new patients are going here, funny office was empty.  Receptionist was rude, badly dressed and thought she knew everything.  Don't even bother with this place, you will sadly be disappointed, they are all about treating patients like cattle, same treatment for everybody, and not everyone has the same problem.  Round 'em up and ship them to the injection room, more money, don't forget the Xrays and Physical Therapy, more money, more money.
