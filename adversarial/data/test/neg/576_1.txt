Absolutely Outstanding! I have 2 children enrolled at KinderCare and they have had some of the best experiences. After new management arrived to the center it really has taken the best turn. Staff are happy, low turn over, thriving classrooms. It's clean and people are always overly friendly at drop off and pick up. Management is always available to help and answer my questions as needed. I will really recommend this school to anyone.
