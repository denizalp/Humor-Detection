being one of the oldest stations on the YUS line, it is the busiest transfer station in the whole system, very straight forward station with a whole bunch of entrances and exits, the stations run crisscross which makes accessing a transfer point Very Very easy. this station is also one of the few locations that has a bathroom inside the station. during peak hours though, this location is a mad house, with people running and shoving people out of the way, just to catch a train. make sure that you keep you're eyes peeled as someone is always running around at all hours of the day.
