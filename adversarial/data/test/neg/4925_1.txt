The customer service is amazing.   I tried various samples of the different meats, all amazing!  I finally decided on the brisket and baby back ribs with the creamed corn and Mac n cheese as my sides.  Needless to say there was way too much for me to finish, so I took it home and killed everything the next day for lunch.  GRUB!
