We moved to vegas from california and need a place to stay for 5 weeks until the construction of our house is done. We checked in here a day after thanksgiving after a horrible experience at EMERALD SUITES!Brandon the receptionist that day is so helpful and even let us check the room before booking.This place is clean, has the basic necessities and very close to everything! We can cross the street to the outlet mall!!! We are here for 4 more weeks and thankful every day that we found this gem!!!
