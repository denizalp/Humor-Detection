This place is clean!  I love that.  \n\nThe techs have all been really sweet.  They call the next day to make sure your visit went well.  (The people running the front desk need to work on their delivery.  They come across as a little disinterested and irritated.)  \n\nThey're a little expensive, but you can't put a price on cleanliness and safety!
