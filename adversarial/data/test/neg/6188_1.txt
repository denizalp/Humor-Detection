I'm not gonna lie. The food here is good. I had the pork belly. It tasted so goooood. However, the portion is really small with that price. You're  better eat something before you get here to feel full when you pay your bill. \n\nThe staffs are nice and friendly.  The service was good. The room is really dark. I had to use my phone flash light to see what was my food look like. I don't know why but it could not be louder. We have to shout to hear each other.
