Dr. Sachdeva has got to be one of the biggest idiots I've ever met!! Pushed my sons dairy allergy off as dry skin\/eczema. Took him in today. He's been sick and I was just diagnosed with double pneumonia. He diagnosed my son with croup. I knew this wasn't true so I got a second opinion. My son has pneumonia as well! You are a god damn idiot!! And I will never be back here. Think twice about bringing your kids to this shitty place!
