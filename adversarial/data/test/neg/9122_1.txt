It's so busy  make sure to order everything at once because all 3 times we've been here we don't receive refills or service after we order until the bill --\n\nI love truckstops, not only for their homemade food but for the curteous waitresses.\n\nI think they are understaffed or just trying to cut corners. Not only did our waitress not offer a refill on our coffee, but she was physically not able to. I am also a waitress and would have crawled into a hole to hide if I had been given the huge section I could see her walking around. WOW For being 50ish she was on fire! \n\nAlso, I like when my food is made especially for me - im the paying customer after all. I feel like the cook is so bogged down because they cut corners in the kitchen as well. Like with the mayo and ketchup on the side instead of on the burger because they cant be bothered. Or the salad dressing on the side rather then mixed throughout the salad. Cheap cheap cheap HIRE MORE PEOPLE! \n\nWeve been here a few times and will not be going back on our own.
