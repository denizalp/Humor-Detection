The atmosphere is Mazie's is nice - and that's about all the positivity I can muster up for this place. \n\nAt first I was thrilled to see how cheap their martinis were ($6), but then I soon realized the reasoning behind that - there is virtually NO alcohol in them!  My lemondrop martini tasted like Sprite (ew), and after 2.5 of them I still felt perfectly fine to drive home.  Just to give you some reference on what a low alcohol tolerance I have, ONE martini at Fez will get me feeling good enough that I won't feel comfortable driving. \n\nMy veggie burger was very dry and bland - even with the tzatziki I was looking forward to.  My boyfriend noted that his \"real\" (meat) burger was also dry and he didn't eat half of his. \n\nEven though the food and drinks were not up to my expectations, I still enjoyed the metropolitan atmosphere I found in Mazie's and I would be willing to try it again for brunch.
