So far, this is a nice cinema to go to watch a movie. Lots of show options. Parking is free and nearby. Popcorn and other snacks area available. Seats are relatively comfortable. I had no issues it complaints with this place. Some other cinemas have assigned seating, but there are no assigned seats here. Also, if you are a student and have ID, special pricing is only Monday to Thursday.
