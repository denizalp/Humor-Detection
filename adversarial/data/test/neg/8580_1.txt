I have tried several pool companies in the valley trying to save a buck. That is not the way to go. Most start out good but eventually will disappoint you with spotty service, failed promises, and eventually a green pool. I have had Blue Marlin for over 2 years and have never been disappointed. My pool is always clean and clear. You can tell that the water is balanced from the way it feels. I never have to worry about scrambling to get the pool clean by dumping a bunch of chlorine in it and crossing my fingers. Top notch service and very reasonable.
