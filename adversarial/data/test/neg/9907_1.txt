I always manage to make a trip to get a FAT TUESDAY when I'm in vegas. They have a wide selection of sizes and options to increase the amount of alcohol (an extra shot = $1, why not?!). They even let you sample flavors if you're having a hard time deciding on which one to pick. Really great drink to sip on as you make your way to gamble at the casino in Planethollywood. My favorite flavor is the mangoberry.
