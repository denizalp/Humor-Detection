With so many great choices in LV it is hard to be a regular at Firkin on Paradise.  Sure it is new enough, clean enough, has nice TVs, and good specials, but it is just not a memorable experience.  Below average food and an unelectric atmosphere.  I'd avoid the nachos as they were small and didn't have much toppings other than the liquid \"cheese\".
