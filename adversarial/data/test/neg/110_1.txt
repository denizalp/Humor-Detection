She stuck the top of the coffee kettle into the coffee she was refilling and then moments later proceeded to ask for a yelp review.\nWell, here it is\nBreakfast food at dinner prices, our service was\nMeh, but saw other servers so still think this place has great service \nAnyhow, overpriced, I'll get a better value and still very  awesome food elsewhere(yes the food here was still awesome)
