A must try! Fish is fresh and portions are quite generous. Location is convenient although finding a parking in the financial district can be a tad complicated. Great service and amazing menu. Great drinks, as well as fantastic atmosphere. I would suggest a reservation on weekends since it is quite hard to get a table otherwise.
