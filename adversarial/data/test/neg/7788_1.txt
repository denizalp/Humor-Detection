Hubby and I finished dinner here a few hours ago.  Having read the reviews before we went, we were not sure quite what to expect.  Since we had already purchased the Travel Zoo voucher, we were already $79 into it.\n\nWe were pleasantly surprised. We went early at 5pm, with reservations, since we had other things planned that night.  The hostess and wait staff were wonderful.  Our waiter Joseph made several recommendations which we were both pleased with.\n\nWe started with the crab cake, which was excellent.  I had the tortilla soup, one of the best I have ever had.  Hubby had the seafood Louie salad, he said it was great, very balanced between the greens and seafood.  He had the Kansas City Strip and I had the New York, both were cooked as ordered and had good flavor and seasoning.  We also added on the grilled asparagus and the garlic mashed potatoes.  We had the churros for dessert, which we found to be light and not greasy at all.\n\nThe prices are on par with all the other high-end steakhouses with the ala carte sides.  We felt that even with the additional costs, along with the voucher, we got what we paid for.  The decor is lovely, especially with the added view of looking out toward the fountain at the Aria.\n\nIt's not an every weekend place to go for dinner, but it was wonderful for a great meal and outstanding service.  We will be going again.
