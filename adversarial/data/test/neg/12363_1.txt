Perfect spot for me on the way home from work when I get a craving for noodles. The rare beef pho really hits the spot and the vermicelli with pork, shrimp and crispy fried rolls is also a solid choice. Unfortunately, the summer rolls aren't great and I've yet to try the banh xeo. But these guys get 5 stars for the noodle dishes and their fantastic, friendly service!
