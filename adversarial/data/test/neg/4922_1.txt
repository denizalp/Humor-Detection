I've had my fair share of the regal village square theater experience. Village is a good way to name the place, since it's never too busy. the stadium seating isn't as comfy as other ones.\n\ni love that this theater plays foreign films and independent films. and actually it's the only one within a 20 mile radius.  it's located in a good plaza next to a bunch of places to eat, so that's a plus. no imax here, nor late night showings (11pm\/12am), but definitely does the job.
