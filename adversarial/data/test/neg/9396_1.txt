This is one of my favorite places to shop for Mens apparel. I had an issue with some jeans I had purchased and tailored here. They just did not fit the way they were supposed to. I understand that nobody is perfect, even tailors have bad days and maybe I caught them on a bad one. Long story short, I brought my jeans back and explained the situation to Kris (evening manager) and Gene (wardrobe consultant) which were more than helpful in resolving the issue. They took care of me in a professional and efficient manner. Their level of customer service is stellar. It's about keeping clients happy to return and do future business. That's exactly what I plan to do. Thank you so much for the resolving everything, your kindness is much appreciated.
