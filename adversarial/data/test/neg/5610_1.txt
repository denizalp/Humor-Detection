Dr. Cornett has been the only reason I can keep playing volleyball at a competitive level. He has helped my through a few shoulder injuries due to his excellent knowledge and treatments. I will continue seeing Dr. Cornett for many years to come. I would highly recommend his services to anyone suffering from aches or pains, or who want to perform at their best. Highly recommend!
