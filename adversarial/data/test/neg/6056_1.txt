We arrived at 11 and missed \"breakfast.\" The only thing available were pre-made (but homemade) sandwiches that were pretty average. Very small location with a regular sized flat top stove. I was actually impressed they were able to run the entire menu from one small 4 burner stove (since the breakfasts appear to be quite involved). We chose our sandwich from the display case and it was pressed for us. Beef and some sort of horseradish sauce with some added greens. Simple. Did the trick to cure the hunger but nothing to write home about.
