I like their food as a healthier alternative when I am trying to be healthy.  I like everything about them except that some tables have a sticky feeling like its dirty.  They told me it is from the laquers for the decals.  I wish they would replace those tables, so I just pick a different one.  Everyone there is nice and I have never had a bad experience (except for the disliking SOME of the tables)
