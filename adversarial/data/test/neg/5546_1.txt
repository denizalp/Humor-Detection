Truly my home away from home. The owners are so welcoming and supportive while never making you feel pressured to take any certain class or buy certain clothes or anything. I have taken SO many different classes here, and I love the variety...it keeps my dance ADD busy! I live the whole way on the other side of Phoenix, and yet I make that drive 2-3 nights a week, even when I might not feel like it, because I know I will be welcomed and I will see not only friends, but like-minded and beautiful, talented women there.\nKimberly and Tiffany (the owners) offer so much more than just weekly classes: there are open jam and dance nights for drummers and dancers alike, Aura (blacklights, techno, hookah, awesome), workshops from some of the biggest names in bellydance, and lots of opportunities for performance watching and participation. Then there is the store. Amazing. Always new clothing that will seriously attract your \"shiny\" attention, as well as accessories and props of every kind.\nCan you tell I'm hooked? Just come for one week of unlimited classes, which is one of their class card specials, and you will be hooked too!
