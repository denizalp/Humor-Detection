This place was amazing from the food to the decor! Very Japanese style furniture from top to bottom,  very elegant lighting, and high class kind of feeling.  My friend's brother is actually the head chef here so we didnt even look at the menu.  He would prepare us special dishes from the menu and some he just made that evenning and the food kept coming all night until we said stop.  We also got a few bottles of sake which complements some of the sushi he made.  But I would have to say the best entree he made was the Crispy Pata(Filipino dish) which was bomb diggity! Highly recommend this place!!!
