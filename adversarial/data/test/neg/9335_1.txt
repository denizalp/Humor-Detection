Ohh Emm Gee!\n\nI finally was able to get try the famous Eggslut and now I know what the hype is all about. Of course we ended up there around 4:00am but hey, when in Vegas!\n\nAt first my buddy and I didn't know what of the sandwiches to order but we were hungry AF. So I ordered the bacon and eggs, he ordered the same, and we decided also split the Fairfax. The plan was to order to go to take it to our separate rooms, but split the Fairfax and eat there.\n\nSo we split the Fairfax and woah! The soft scrambled egg with the sriracha mayo was out of this world! After scarfing down that sandwich it was game on for the other two that we were suppose to be to-go.\n\nIt was soooo good that back to the back of the line we went to get another order of the Fairfax. So another 30 mins or so we had two orders of Fairfax sandwiches and called it a night.\n\nWhen I got back to my room, I can't believe I ate the whole thing.....again! But I went to bed happy! :-)
