I absolutely love this place! I now come here for brunch every weekend. The breakfast sandwiches are the most amazing tasting sandwiches in the world. They usually get sold as soon as they are made, but the staff have made fresh ones for me a few times which shows their amazing service. My favourite pastry is the pear Danish which has the most amazing tasting custard with half a pear on top. I limit myself to one or two on the weekend, but throughout the week I fantasize about them. I have tried their paninis, omelettes, and quiche (the ham and leek is another of my favourite go-to's) and have yet to try something I haven't absolutely loved. I have yet to try any of their salads but they look incredibly fresh and yummy. They are always busy and people seem to love coming here for the incredibly fresh food, grilled veggies, good espresso and amazing pastries!
