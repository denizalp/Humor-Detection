I was a little concerned about trying this, because I loves me some cuppies. I'd injured a disc in my back and had to get two shots in the hind end, so to cheer me up, the Hubbyman drove by Jen's for a little tasting surprise. \n\nHaving never been before, I was immediately surprised to find they had a drive thru! Good to know, for when I need sweets on the go.\n\nI couldn't decide between the Coconut, Praline, and Snow White (apple with streusel crumb topping and a cream cheese frosting with a fondant apple) so since I was sporting three boo-boo areas, the Hubbyman splurged. \n\nThe coconut cake was divine. Honestly, it's hard to find a better moist cupcake than this. I didn't even need all the frosting, which for me was a tad bit heavy (which is why I took off one star). I prefer my buttercreams to be light and fluffy. This was more like pasty. I can see why someone called it too sweet, although for me the sweetness wasn't the issue-it's a texture thing.\n\nPraline was pretty good-also moist and tasty. Butter Pecan cake and caramel frosting. The frosting didn't taste much different from that on the coconut though (except for the coconut). Leads me to believe they mix up one giant batch and then flavor it accordingly. Not a great practice, but understandable. \n\nThe only bummer cupcake for me was the one I MOST wanted to try--the Snow White. In their defense, I waited a day before I ate it (Can you say Sugar Overload?) so maybe that was the issue. The cake was definitely more dry, especially around the edges. The frosting, while sweet, had very little taste. Probably would try it one more time just to be sure.\n\nOverall a decent bakery (and I'm picky!) but a tad hit or miss on some elements. As for service, the younger staff was stiff at first, but we joked with her and she loosened up. We left laughing. I'd definitely give it a solid 3.5 stars. Pretty good.
