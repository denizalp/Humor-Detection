I have to start with a positive and say that everyone was very nice, especially the receptionist. But this is possibly the worst set of nails I've ever had in my life. I needed to remove my acrylics and do a new full set. The tech said I should do gel powder because it's more natural. Maybe if I did a chrome finish and was going for fun house mirror nails for Halloween they would be awesome, but I'm not. My nails are warped in shape, thick, fat, and anything but natural looking. They are just terrible. In addition to that, I had 2 nails done in cat eye. They told me it's $10.00 extra, but since I'm only doing 2, it's $5.00\nHow does that math add up? Anyway, I spent 2 hours and $75.00 there, and have to go get them redone elsewhere, they are that bad, I can't go 2 weeks with warped nails.
