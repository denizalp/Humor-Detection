DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY! I ordered flowers 2 days in advance for my mother's 85th birthday and on the evening of her birthday I received an email saying that they were unable to fulfill the order. REALLY? This is unacceptable. In an industry where delivery timing is critical they were unable to perform or to even call me in time to let me know so that I could choose another option. Instead my mother waited all day for her delivery and I'm offered a credit for their inability to perform the basics of their job.
