I like this place. You have to know the menu a little though. I like the chicken noodle bowl order, and I also like the fried rice orders. It's always 10 bucks and they don't take cards. But it's a relatively fast an decent option for the $ on state street. It's also obviously a family run restaurant, and I just feel like, it seems they are good people.
