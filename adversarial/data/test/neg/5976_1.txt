Me and my boyfriend come  here pretty much every Friday night after work  now we always make sure we either sit at the bar or any waitress but the bleach blonde dummy. We were sat in her section 2 different times and the service was horrible, she kept making excuse after excuse.People  in her section were standing up trying to get her attention as she was not focused and always texting in the back by the waitress stand. We waited forever for drinks, water and just an appetizer, never even got to order dinner as it took an hour to even get her to come back.The sad thing is we love the environment other staff is  so friendly and the wings are absolutely amazing. We had not been back since the last horrible experience. We just went there on Friday and had way better service and our waitress was great food out fast and on top of drinks and water.:)
