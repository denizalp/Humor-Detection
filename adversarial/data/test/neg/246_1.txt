In need of a burger, this was the closest location from work that wasn't your typical fast food joint.\n\nI always like to chose a signature burger so I opted for the Spicy Cajun Burger and combo'd it up with there Beer Battered Rings and a Jones Strawberry-Lime  Soda.\n\nIts a small location with an even smaller patio ( maybe 8 bar stools on a cramped balcony) that looks onto Charles Street. But definitely sit outside if you can grab a seat. Luckily the patio was vacant that late afternoon.\n\nToppings - They Spicy Cajun Burger - Avocado, jalapeños, lettuce,\nJalapeño havarti, tomatoes, Cajun spice & Smokey chipotle & honey mayo. There was ample toppings on the burger, I enjoyed the avocado on my burger, overall not too spicy but good kick from the sliced jalapeños.\n\nMeat - Grilled perfectly, tasted average, but I found it too small compared to the bun.\n\nBun - Very soft, tasted good, but didn't hold up against the burger and all the toppings and at the end I was left with lots of bun and no more burger.\n\nBeer Battered Onion Rings - Very thick batter on these rings, golden brown, crunchy, very filling.\n\nDrink -Jones Strawberry-Lime Soda - Yummy not sour but good balance,\n\nOverall prompt friendly service, quaint little patio, average burger but good for a quick fix in satisfying the burger craving.
