Pistol Parlour is a great place to shop. Not only is the staff very helpful and friendly (which can be rare in the firearms industry), but they have a huge selection. They know their stuff. I told them that I didn't want to spend $500 on EOTech optics they made some great recommendations on some less expensive options. I normally get the \"EOTech is amazing, every else is crap\" speach from gun stores. \n\nI often go in to just look around and see what's new. They are always friendly. Keep up the good work.
