OK this is the best comic shop in the Valley.  First off these people know how to run a  business.  They go out of their way to make sure you find what you need and if they don't have it, they will find it.  It's good to see people who still take so much pride in customer service.  They are so friendly also, I feel bad I don't know their names, I'm bad with names, but they know me by name and I don't go in that much, which is only due to me not living very close to them. \nThey have a great selection of current books, and back issues, and everyone who works there is really helpful.  I cannot recommend this place enough to anyone.  \nIt's also great to see a family run place that makes you feel like your part of it when your in their store.   It made me so happy to see that they had their daughter dusting shelves only to find out that she had to do that because she was in trouble.  It's hard to find people who instill hard work in their children anymore, and it just adds to them having a great shop with a small family feeling to it.  \nIf I loved closer to this place it would be the only place I would need to go to.
