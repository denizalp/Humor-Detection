Talk about unique and fun, this place is so fun and relaxing. I love hot dogs and they turn up the usual boring hot dog into a hot dog 10x power with a little Korean flare. I had the buckeye which is made with a delicious garlic aioli sauce, caramelized onions, BACON, and cheddar and omg! Out of bounds. I'm definitely coming back here.
