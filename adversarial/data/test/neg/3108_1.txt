Never saw a big bar so dead on a Saturday night....but I've been to Lakewood several times in the last month and that pretty much goes for the whole city. People are going to Tremont\/Ohio City\/Cleveland. The leftovers still drinking in Lakewood could be classified as people blowing their last $20 on cheap beers, white trash and ghetto scum.
