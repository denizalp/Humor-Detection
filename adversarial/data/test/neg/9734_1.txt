Norma's eggs caf√© is a great breakfast for the price. The people are friendly and the food is great, the red velvet pancakes are the best and the multi grain pancake is the best as well if you're coming to Las Vegas this would be a place to find it's off the strip a little bit, but the breakfast is good & if you like good black coffee get the house coffee w\/ espresso with vanilla it will wake you up!!:)
