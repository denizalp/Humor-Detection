We had a nice Sunday morning breakfast here.  Service was excellent...our server Diane was quick, efficient,  and friendly.\n\nPortions are big.  My wife and I got a Griddle Sampler and the Tostada omelette. \n\nGriddle had light fluffy pancakes and the banana nut french toast were warm and buttery tasting.\n\nTostada is very hearty and savory and seemed like more of a lunch entree than breakfast.\n\nWe saw a sign that said under new management....nicely done.
