So I've been going here since they opened! I mostly started due to convenience but now I love it so much I can't think of going anywhere else! And I only see Rebecca - she is by far the best esthetician out there. Not only does she actually know what she is doing, but when she does ripping the hair from you it's not nearly as painful as other places. And most the time she has me laughing that I don't notice the pain (as much). She is just so personable and that's probably why I keep coming back. Also my eyebrows always look fabulous! And she gets every hair when doing my Brazilian. Lunchbox as a whole isn't the cheapest place out there but Rebecca is worth it. I'm sure the other people are great, but I've never been to them so I'm not sure. They are always friendly when I call and come in. And lastly, I like the way the salon smells. I'm not sure of the scent but it's oddly comforting that it smells the exact same every time. Highly recommend you go see Rebecca!
