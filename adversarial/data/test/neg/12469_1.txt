My sister in law and I brought our 2 year olds here a d I couldn't have been more impressed. It was clean throughout, had some awesome amenities for adults (massage chairs, walking area with weights, elliptical machine!), and areas to play for all different ages. I was also so pleased to see a courteous, professional staff who actually seemed to enjoy working with young children. Overall, it was a great experience, not to mention extremely reasonable price (Free for adults!)
