One of the better nail spas in downtown Toronto for sure. I went in for an impromptu shellac pedicure and was delightfully surprised with the most attentive service I have ever received. \n\nI was serviced by Shirley I believe and she was very kind and sweet. The pedicure was great, especially the leg massage which was extremely relaxing. They really value their customers and by far the biggest and most appreciated surprise was the neck and back hand massage at the end of my pedicure. \n\nThough a bit pricey (45 plus tax) the experience was delightful and I definitely appreciated it very much, not to mention how clean the spa is!
