PLEASE UNDERSTAND I DONT TRUST MECHANICS BUT........\n\nThis place has the BEST customer service!!!!!!!! \n\nI came thinking I needed brakes since they were squeaking. I spoke with Jesus, and I was immediatley relieved due to his knowledge. He took me to my car and physically showed me my brakes tested everything else at no cost !!! Bottom line I just need a slight adjustment. I was really impressed with Jesus. He was so informative and did not try to sell me something I didnt need. \n\nBilly, a kind word for you as well, thanks for your kindness and professionalism :)\n\nThey took my fear of going to a mechanic away!!
