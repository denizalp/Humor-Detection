We usually dine at The Carlton before going to the theatre and we have never been disappointed. A favorite entre was taken off the menu but when I mentioned it to the server, it was suggested that the next time I came, request it in advance. When I returned last week, I had called prior to the evening of our reservation and asked if that entre had returned to the menu and, if not, could it be prepared. Pleasantly, the hostess checked with the chef, and several hours later, returned my call to advise the chef would be pleased to prepare that entre for me.  When we arrived at the restaurant, our waiter was aware that that the entre was being prepared and told me it would be available. That is what I call exceptional customer service! I look forward to returning in the future.
