Brock is awesome! He was quick to respond and did everything possible to be there when I needed him. He did a great job repairing the chip on my windshield. You can barely tell it was there! The price is very reasonable as well, even lower than other companies.\n\nI hope a rock never hits my windshield again! But if it ever does, I would definitely call him. Go ahead and call him. He'll take care of you!
