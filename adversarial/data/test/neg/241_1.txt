Today was my second experience with the Partners Snake Avoidance training. I called them up this week and told them I had a dog with issues. I was upfront and honest with the staff and asked if they would even consider a dog like my rescue Reggie. When I got him he was feral and had some pretty big issues. The staff asked me questions and it was determined that he could attend. I brought my other 3 legged rescued dog for the training too. We go out in the desert exploring often so this training is a MUST for my dogs. When I got to Partners the staff was fully aware of Reggie's issues (he dislikes women) they handled both dogs fabulously. They really take the time to explain what they do and why. Turns out the dog I thought would be an issue did great! I really think their calm confident attitudes made him feel at ease, which made ME feel at ease. I cannot say enough good things about my experiences with Partners Training. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, you can really tell they love what they do. Part of loving your dog is training, so please listen to the trainers because I got a lot out of today's experience, they really went above and beyond. My only wish is I could come more often, but Maricopa is far away. Well worth the drive!  Thank you Partners for the valuable training, advice, and professionalism. I highly recommend Partners Training to anyone I know!
