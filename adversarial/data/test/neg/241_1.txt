First time ordering, and the pizza was phenomenal!  Ordered the thick crust, so crispy and light, the tomatoe sauce tastes fresh, abundance of delicious toppings!!  Excellent pizza!!\nGot a discount for picking up, nice touch!!  Price is incredibly reasonable, the quality, top notch!!  Will definitely order again!!!
