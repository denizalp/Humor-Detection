If you can stand the wait, you won't be disappointed. My fianc√© and I shared 3 items to make the most of our first visit, two sandwiches and I got the \"Slut.\"\n\nThe sandwiches were delicious but I have to say that the simplicity and overall deliciousness of the \"slut\" was worth the wait. Creamy potatoes with a gentle coddled egg with a sprinkle of chives and sea salt... talk about comfort food-- and excellent for a hangover lol!
