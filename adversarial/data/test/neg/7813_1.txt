This place is great. I had the crispy chicken meal with fries. The chicken wasn't greasy and the ice tea is perfect. My only gripe was the fries. There pretty horrible. Everything is fresh and made to order but my favorite part is that you don't have to order into a little box. You get to speak to a real live person in the window. I'll definitely be back just hold the fries.
