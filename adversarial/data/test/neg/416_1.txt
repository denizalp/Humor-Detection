As a relative new comer to Think and an athlete well versed in the gym scene of Toronto, this is hands down my new favourite place to train. I look forward to each visit and leave feeling accomplished and on top of the world. I am a professional ballet dancer and the team at Think has proven to be beyond qualified to tailor workout programs to my unique needs. I have a history of knee injuries that I'm starting to forget about altogether, now that I've been building strength in the right ways. Not only do they demonstrate a sophisticated repertoire of physical exercises, but the staff at Think consistently creates new and variable additions to the workout that challenge mental agility, which has proven to significantly improve my own craft. The boutique environment encourages focused sessions that are also playful and fun. I've worked with several of the staff members and each one has a 5 star personality and the intelligence to back it up. No exaggeration- I couldn't be happier with Think!
