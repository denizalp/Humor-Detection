A few months ago, my family and I moved to the Phoenix area. We were in desperate need of finding quality barbers in a family-friendly shop. My visit to The Shop was pleasant from the moment we walked in the shop to the end of our visit.\n\nDesiree cut my son's hair and did a great job! I don't like visiting barber shops, but the environment was professional, and I didnt have a long wait. We're making The Shop our family's barber shop.
