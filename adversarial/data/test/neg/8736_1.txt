I waited about a month to try this place after a friend told me about it. He made it seem like it was the best place in the world to get coffee.After the anticipation I finally got to try it this past weekend and I have to say he was right on about it. If anything The best is an understatement. The coffee is delicious, the employees are very welcoming and the setup is very comfortable and home-y. I plan on making Tres Leches Cafe my new \"go to\" coffee spot and I definitely plan on bringing all my friends and family there to help in keeping the business open and expanding. Thank you Tres Leches for that \"little sip of heaven\" I have to look forward to. :)
