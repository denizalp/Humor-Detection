Just once I would love to get what you see on TV. The Culver's fish sandwich  ads I was really looking forward to a great sandwich. I would have sworn that the fillets were almost an inch thick with a good sized bed of lettuce - sauce, but that's not what I got on either the walleye or cod sandwich.  You would think that someone in Culver's management would be responsible enough to at least show in the ad what the sandwich is really going to look like. Doesn't anyone do \"Truth in Advertising\" any more?
