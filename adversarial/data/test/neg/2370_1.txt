I love this place.  Although it is a francise I have memories of Bagel World from childhood with crazy eastern women screaming.  The bagels are excellent.  I really enjoy their salads and eggs there.  Coffee is ok, I've had better but it is drinkable. Husband had the oatmeal there yesterday and the portion was very large and the oatmeal was well made.
