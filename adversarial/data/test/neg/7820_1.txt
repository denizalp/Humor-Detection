Second location of Cheese Garden is at Midland & Finch plaza. I have been to their North York location, that one seems cozier. \n\nCake: I ordered Shiroi Cake, it comes in 3 layers topped with white chocolate. I had high expectation of this cake because I've had their signature cheese cake from Cheese Garden before and that was mind blowing.. but for Shiroi cake I would give 2.5 star out of 5... it is too sweet with no other flavour, other than the white chocolate on the top tastes like white chocolate. In terms of the texture, it is soggy, in a bad way. Nothing really stands out for this cake. I would not recommend people order it...
