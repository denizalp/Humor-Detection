Surrender is my favorite club in Vegas. I have been twice and both times I had the time of my life. I like that it doesn't get too crowded here compared to other Vegas clubs. I also like that it's on the smaller side. Staff is always nice and the music is always enjoyable. I will definitely be back next time I am in Vegas!
