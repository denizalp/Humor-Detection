I've been to this salon before and the service was okay before but I walked in a few minutes ago for a fill on my acrylics because I have a job interview in the morning. I told the lady at the front desk and she looked annoyed that I asked for that. I was given dirty looks (I walked in at about 5:45 pm so maybe that's why?) and I was told to pick a color, she didn't say anything else so I just picked one and sat down. About 15 minutes later, two other women who worked there walked in and looked me up and down and asked me what I needed. Again, I explained I needed a fill on my nails. One of them walks to the back and the other sat down next to me, the lady walked back to the front, looked me up and down again and started to speak to the lady sitting down. They walked to the back together and I didn't even see them for another 10 minutes and even then they didn't offer to help me or take me back to get started. I got so frustrated that I just left. I waited around for 30 minutes. A lot of the other salons are closed now so I'm very stressed lol. Make sure you have plenty of time to just wait around if you go here!
