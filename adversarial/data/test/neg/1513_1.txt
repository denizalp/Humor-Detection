Horrible service. Cheesy outfits. My husband was carrying 5 tuxs to return and the rep went through the door ahead fo him, did not hold the door, did not take the heavy suits out of his hands and stood checking each tux in while my husband held the rest. Then the guy was indignant that y husband was not more greatful. Really? Gross.
