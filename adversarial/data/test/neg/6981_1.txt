Came for a quick bite and a beer in between flights. Started off my interaction with Bill when I asked about them having an IPA on draft. Bills response was \"we have a great one\" and he was right. Beer was served in a clean glass with the right amount of head.\n\nI was, of course, pushing it for time so I was weary of ordering pizza. Asked Bill how long it would take and he said ten minutes. My pizza was served in ten minutes.\n\nBills demeanor was friendly, professional and he was very efficient.  I wish I could have ordered him a beer and a shot! I'll definitely stop here again next time I'm flying through Charlotte.
