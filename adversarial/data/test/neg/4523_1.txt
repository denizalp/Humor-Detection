Food and service was great. Hostess was pleasant and very professional. We loved our server Zach, he was excellent and friendly. He went out of his way for us and we had one of the best customer services experiences. As always, food was amazing! \n\nOn another note, there were no lobsters in the aquarium which was a first for all the Red Lobsters we've been to. Also, they ran out of large to- go containers. Both were not a huge deal but something to note.
