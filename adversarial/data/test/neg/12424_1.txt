I've never been a fan of this place. It's located one floor below the rest of the mall meaning no natural light.\n\nThe menu is big and has lots of options but there's never been anything on their which would be classified as 'crave worthy'. The salads are filling, the ingredients are fresh, they include healthy options whenever possible. But everything I've ever had is forgettable.\n\nOn top of that the place is loud and cramped and despite friendly service, doesn't identify as the type of place where you sit and mingle.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's not that I hate the place. It's clean and the servers are friendly. It's just not the type of place where I refuse to go.\n\nThankfully, Yorkdale has plenty of other options.
