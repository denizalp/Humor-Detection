Have really been missing home and recently had pierogies and haluski shipped all the way to Alabama. Shipping costs were pretty substantial, and the cooling system was VERY borderline in terms of how long it lasts, but everything looked so amazing that I was willing to chance it. :) Price wise, I think shipping is absolutely worth it as along as you order two or more of everything. Everything was so great--maybe even better than my Busha used to make! Will definitely be ordering again and again.
