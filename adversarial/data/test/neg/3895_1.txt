The set up is super awkward first and foremost.  It's almost like a walk a shame to get your food.  I ordered the strawberry harvest salad and clam chowder.  I did not like the chicken on the salad it was pressed chicken, gag.  I didn't mind the soup, it wasn't chowder by any means, it was warm, not hot either.  There was a lot of potatoes and clams, it tasted good.  I would go back for the salad with no chicken.
