I tried Humble Lion again last week to give it a second chance. I ordered an espresso macchiato and my boyfriend had another Americano in store. The macchiato was so sour I could not even finish the drink. We left with more than half in our cups but really, it could not be drunk. Beware--sour espresso!!
