This is the worst Subway I've ever been in-I ordered a sub and wanted a side of rotisserie chicken and was told they couldn't sell it to me unless I put it on a sandwich-really? You have it and can't sell it! St checkout I asked if they accept the Buckeye card and the Mgr said we don't have them-duh I know I do! Wasn't very clean either.
