Went in there to do a return. There was about 5 employees working. No one greeted me. No one looked at me. There were two employees standing behind the counter talking to each other in a different language while looking directly at me. Then finally someone else came forward and asked if I had been helped. I told him I needed to do a return and he said the employee that was already behind the counter was going to do it. She finished her conversation first, then finally took me. I don't like to do bad reviews, but man that was some horrible customer service. I was able to do my return and all, but I don't like being ignored when I first walk in. If you can't help me right away, just let me know.
