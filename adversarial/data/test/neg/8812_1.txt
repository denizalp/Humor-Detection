I have been sewing for years, during my childhood, I could walk to the Hancock Fabric store just a few blocks from my parents home. I would purchase fabrics with money earned by baby sitting. I would make great things from beautiful fabrics, or so I thought. Funny how your tastes change over the years. \n\nThere are so very few great fabric stores left. I fell in love with Walmart because of the large selection of fabrics and their great prices, but a few years ago, they began taking down their fabric isles and if you are lucky to find any now, it's pre cut, with limited selection. That's why coming to Hancock's is still a great experience for me. \n\nThis location is a bit small, has a rotating selection of seasonal fabrics, there are plenty of quilting cottons to choose from and tons of fleece. Now for the more serious sewing bunch, the selection of dress fabrics is limited but it just depends on what you are looking for. And you also have a limited amount of upholstery fabrics. \n\nThe old Hancocks of my childhood did not have any crafting items, but today, there is a small section for beading, knitting and crocheting books with a good yarn selection. The quilting tools and books are fairly inclusive as well. \n\nIf you sign up for the Hancocks card, you will be sent a flyer with the advertised special items, and they will take any competitor's coupon! It's a great place to find friendly, helpful staff, great fabric and crafting items and at fairly good prices.
