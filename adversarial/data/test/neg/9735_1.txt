Mostly 1960s-1980s stuff. A few pieces from the 1940s and 1950s and nothing earlier (clothes-wise anyway, they did have mesh purses from the 1920s). Lots of menswear; suits and dress shirts. The store is about half men's stuff and half women's stuff. The clothes seem to be fairly high quality (ie. not stained or ripped) but you pay for it. They did have some cute outfits, but it was priced too high for me.
