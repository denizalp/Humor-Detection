We really ended up here, because it was the only place that was open on an awkwardly late sunday night. The waitress was very friendly, and really wanted us to get the best drinks possible.  I had the carrot cake cocktail, with cream cheese frosting and all.  It was good, different good, everyone else loved, while i just liked it.  Me being me, thought it was a little pricey at $18 a drink, but hey, YOLO. \nI would want to come back to also try the food, just during a little bit earlier in the day.
