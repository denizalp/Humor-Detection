Hands down best restaurant in Vegas. \n\nPart of me regrets saving the best for last and going to Yardbird for our last meal while in town. I made a reservation a month prior and added people to the reservation twice. The staff at Yardbird was extremely accommodating and helpful. I'm glad we made a reservation because it was over an hour wait to get in Yardbird on a Sunday at 12pm. \n\nNot only did we have the best food of our Vegas trip at Yardbird but we had the best service too. Our waitress, Carolina made our experience five stars. She recommended cocktails, appetizers and entrees. She took the time to answer everyone's questions and requests. We were a big group and she separated checks without the slightest problem (apparently it's a problem every where else in Vegas).\n\nNow for the food.. oh em gee. We ordered the fried green tomatoes topped with thick bacon and it was a culinary experience. The green tomatoes were crisp and the bacon was perfectly cooked. We also shared the chicken and waffles and the Mac and cheese. The chicken and waffles was amazing. I have never had such juicy, moist fried chicken. The syrup was delicious and the cheddar cheese waffle complimented the chicken perfectly. The Mac and Cheese was also killer. I loved the crispiness of the breadcrumbs on top, mixed with the creaminess of the cheese. \n\nAnother highlight of our experience was the baller cocktails. We ordered the Revival, an Old Fashioned and a Bloody Mary. All were equally great in different ways. The Bloody Mary had a nice thin mix to it that tasted fresh and light. The Revival is the perfect brunch drink for a bourbon lover. It was light and had a fresh citrus hint, making the bourbon not as heavy as a normal bourbon cocktail. The old fashioned was also delicious.\n\nLike I said, I'm sad we saved Yardbird for last because I would have gone there everyday. I will definitely be back to this location or the one in Miami in the near future.
