They are pushing the woman owned and operated thing really hard. I hope this angle brings people in the door because the beer most certainly will Not.  I don't much care what genitalia the owners and brewers own. It's the beer that's in my mouth, not their junk. That said, unwashed and infected nethers probably taste better than the brew. \n\nIf I were judging just the beer, I'd be giving Bold Missy one star. I ordered a flight and didn't finish any of them. The IPA was stylistically completely off the mark. The other beers were all subpar. \n\nHopefully this brewery can get its act together. At some point quality has to matter, especially if the location is just so so as this one is. If the beer doesn't become palatable, I'm willing to bet that Timid Missy will be the first brewery to go under.
