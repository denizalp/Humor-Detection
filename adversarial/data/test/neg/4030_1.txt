Is this a cool concept?  Yes. Should anyone need to wait over 20 minutes for their ice cream after ordering?  No.  For me, the taste was good but waiting ten minutes in line and an additional twenty minutes or more before I had the ice cream in hand was definitely much too long.  I understand they just opened this week so I'm willing to give them another shot.\n\nEssentially, if you're paying over $7 for an ice cream and you're waiting almost an hour in total, it better be the best ice cream you've ever tasted in your life and for me, that was not the case.  If they can lower the price and cut wait times significantly, I think I would like this place because their product is good.
