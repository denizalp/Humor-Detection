Finding good, reasonably priced Italian cuisine is always difficult, but they do it right here! Their pizza is good, but I recommended eating it there at the restaurant; whenever I've ordered it \"to-go\" it tends to lose its flavor and get soggy. Also, their chopped salads are fantastic. When I get in late from work I just call in an order for a Tuscan salad with grilled chicken...it's awesome.
