Encore beach club at Encore hotel. 3121 S. Las Vegas Blvd. Las Vegas, NV 89109\nI had a wonderful time at this pool party when i went out with a buddy of mine for his birthday.\nThis place has a feel of fame,luxury and beauty.It is a newer hottest spot, a wonderful play ground.\nI think it out beat hard rock party \"detox\" that once was the place to be on Sunday.\nThe cost of the club cost to mister Wynn almost 68 millions to build that paradise of party. \nThe 3 pools are surrounding by cabanas and bed, dancing poles and palms tree ,you have bars on each side of the pool and a huge selection of liquor and cocktails.\nThe deejay booth is in the center and their surrounding sound systems top notch give you some of the pure sound.\nSome of the world's best deejays come and spin here. \nThe high end clientele give you one of the best fashion show of bathing suit,high heels and fancy purse. \nPeople are very friendly and willing to party their soul away. \nIt is at the level of Saint Tropez and Ibiza parties.\nThe drinks are reasonably priced but if you rent a cabana it will cost you a few thousand dollars.\nThey have a matusalem of Cristal \"6 liters of fine champagne\" on their price list going for $50000.\nLike the Vegas say, it is a fact. No money,no honey. \nI hope you will experience it. Things to do in a life time. This is it.
