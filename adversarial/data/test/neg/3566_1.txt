I have had body work done from 4 or 5 different shops over the years, and I can say that this was BY FAR the best experience I've had.  I am VERY particular and picky about the quality of autobody repair work, and their work is second to none. The owner and staff are professional and efficient.  They are not the cheapest shop around, but COMPLETELY worth it if you want the job done right!
