The wife and I have been coming here for the past year and half and have enjoyed every minute of it. The food is deliciously good. Personally recommend the Potato Tacos. Those things are so damn tasty!! The place isn't over priced either. Also has awesome friendly staff!  All in all great food, great people and a great atmosphere!
