This was our first time at Lagerheads (a Saturday night) and the parking lot was packed - had to wait for a spot to open but we figured that was a good sign. They did not disappoint, food was delicious. I had the prime rib (served Saturdays only) and my husband tried the barbecued chicken. Both meals were delicious including the creamy coleslaw and sweet potato tots. Great service too. We will definitely be going back.
