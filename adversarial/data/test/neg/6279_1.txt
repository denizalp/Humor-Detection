Being from Los Angeles and going to the original Canters so many times, I have to say, this is not canters! However, I have now been to canters on rampart twice and will go again. But, I would love if someone read my review and made some changes.... the omelette was an embarrassing joke! It was sooooo small. Come on, it's eggs.... I have not seen an omelette that small at any restaurant ever!!!! It is tooo pricy.... it's a deli, take it down a notch.... be competitive with bagel cafe (where I am eating breakfast right now, so it reminded me to yelp about canters). Positives.... the best pastrami from anywhere ever, including 2nd ave Deli and Katz's Deli in manhattan! The chopped liver was also WOW! Service was good.... but, restaurant was empty. I got my free black and white cookie, which was good... but fell on the floor... so I need another.... unhappy with the pastrami at bagel cafe and looking forward to my next half soup half sandwich combo at canters...
