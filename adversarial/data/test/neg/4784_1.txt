This is by farrrrrrr the besssssst buffet I've EVER been too! I was so skeptical about going to a buffet at all because they typically compromise the quality of the food to serve in mass quantities but Not here! EVERYTHING was delicious! I could not even try it all. The price was unbeatable (under 30 bucks) for the meal quality especially considering the unlimited wine mimosas and beer on tap with your meal! I went back two days in a row and we did not plan to do any repeats on our vaycay. But let's just say...I may be back for a third round!
