Multiple times going in the employees were rude and not helpful as if they had something better to do. I left for school so I tried canceling my membership by sending a letter in the mail but was still billed for the next two months because my letter was \"not sufficient.\" I then had to send in another letter and after that arrived they billed me still for a \"cancelation time.\" Overall awful experience and I would NOT recommend to anyone unless you want an average gym with bad service.
