Team manager rented 3 vans for out of town soccer tournament.   Arrived to pick up vans to learn that they had no vans.  The Ace service representative commenced to tell us he was the professional and we were customers and that what we did was not the way to do things.   To their credit they found us vans at another rental company.   Crossing fingers to see if they will cover the added cost of the last minute new rentals.
