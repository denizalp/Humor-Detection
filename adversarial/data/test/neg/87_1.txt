Loved La Kabob! Garlic hummus was excellent, everything we ate was fresh, delicious and authentic.  The staff was warm, friendly and checked in on us several times, they are very passionate about good food and good service.   I also noticed the whole place, the food prep area and kitchen were all spotless! We'll definitely be regulars!
