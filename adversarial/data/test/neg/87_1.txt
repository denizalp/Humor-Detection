I WISH THERE WAS A WAY TO GIVE THIS SORRY OF AN EXCUSE FOR TACO BELL A 1\/2 STAR RATING. \n     I am absolutely disgusted, humiliated, and traumatized by the experience I had at this Taco Bell tonight. I was visiting my sick grandmother at the nearby hospital, and after having such a long and emotionally draining day I said to myself, \"hey, let's go to Taco Bell...that'll cheer me up\" \n     OH BOY BOY BOY BOY BOY WAS I DEAD WRONG. \nI ordered my usual. Yanno. My go-to when I'm feeling sad, the double chalupa box. And just as I was wiping my tears of sadness from my face about my sick grandmother, and about to sink my teeth into my favorite meal that was created by the Mexican-American gods........\n     BAM SOMETHING TICKLED MY GOD DAMN LIPS. AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT WAS. BLONDE HAIR. BLONDE MOTHER FUKKING HAIR.  And do you wanna know the craziest part...I HAVE BLACK HAIR. BOX DYED BLACK F-ING HAIR. I DONT EVEN HAVE A BLONDE PUBE ON ME. \n     I don't recommend this place to anyone. I definitely don't recommend it if you're going thru a tough time and need some pick me up chalups. Just drive your face right into the cement and then have someone step on your face American History X style. It will be better than eating a hairy chalupa. I promise.
