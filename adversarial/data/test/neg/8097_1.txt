Went here for lunch and was disappointed.   The menu is prix fixe, which really seemed like eating at a group dinner.  The choices are somewhat meager 3 or 4 options for appetizer and main course and the uninspiring choice of plain Greek yogurt or a sparse mixed fruit plate for dessert.  If you choose some of the better choices (grilled octopus appetizer or lamb chop) there are \"supplemental charges\".   I ordered the Salmon and it came out mushy indicating it was probably frozen at some point.  Was hoping for something much better.   Lunch for 2 with a glass of wine each came to close to $100.  Would suggest for others to check out the lunch menu before seating.   As for me, I'll check out many of the other great food options in Las Vegas and won't return
