I would not recommend this dealership to anyone!  There is no integrity from the employees and if you need any information after purchasing a vehicle, expect to get the run-around from the staff... See my experience below.\n\nMark Kerr did an exceptional job at showing the vehicle and explaining all the features of the vehicle I was interested in.  That was the only favorable experience of this transaction... The rest of the staff did anything they could do to close this deal, and their main focus was \"profit\".  I agreed to a purchase price of the vehicle and the trade-in value of my vehicle.  I assumed that Right Toyota would be honest and ethical in calculating these two values to come up with a monthly cost, however, this was not the case.  When I began reviewing what I actually purchased, I realized that these employees had added nearly $5,000 of misc fees and costs to my \"\"agreed value of the vehicle\", without mentioning or having me agree to them.  The next 3 days, I tried to get answers from several employees at this dealership, only to get the run-around.  I was told from one of the Accounting Managers: \"You (customer) must be a finance major because you are questioning these figures. I (Finance Manager) do not know exactly what is included in these figures...\"  When I was finally able to receive the agreed upon invoice (3 days after I requested it), there was additional fees added after the fact (including hand-written notes) that included fees\/costs of:  Dealer Holdback (this is commission paid from the manufacture to the dealership and SHOULD NOT be charged to the customer), Whsl Financial Reserve, Tint (hand written), Body Side Moldings (hand written), alarm activation (hand-written), and TFS Lease Acquisition (hand written).  Once I saw these figures, I immediately realized that the salesman (RC), sold me on the monthly lease payment and then back-doored into the vehicle cost; completely opposite of what I agreed to (again, I assumed that the agreed upon value of the vehicle + my trade-in allowance would equal the shown monthly cost).  Once I reached out to the General Manager, I was able to get the deal that I had originally expected, but after having to spend 3 days, nearly 15 hours dealing with this issue.  Overall, I would not recommend this dealership to anyone, as there is no integrity shown from their employees in doing what is right for the customer.
