Great place for a date night ! Not very big so make sure you have reservations. We were greeted by a very friendly hostess who hung up our jackets. The food and service was great. Portions are decent and price is reasonable for what you get. My husband had the duck and loved it and I had the scallops, which was filling because it comes it with sides. \nWe will definitely be back. The cocktails were great as well. I enjoyed the nineteeni!
