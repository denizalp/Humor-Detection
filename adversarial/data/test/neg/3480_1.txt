I didn't think this place was that terrible. I came in right before lunch to look for a few items. One thing that was difficult was that some items didn't have price tags. I did catch an employee and asked them the price so it wasn't a huge deal. When I was ready to check out, there were 3 people in front of me and 2 people at the registers. I only waited a few minutes so I can't really complain.
