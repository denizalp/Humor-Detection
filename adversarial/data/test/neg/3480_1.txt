We were pleasantly surprised at how good the food was here after coming for a late dinner.  We started out with the beet salad and lamb meatballs.  The beet salad was full of beets, which I find to be so rare at most restaurants.  The lamb meatballs were really juicy, but I wish they gave more tzatziki with them.  For entrees, I got the margherita flatbread and my husband got the chicken.  Both were really delicious and flavorful.  Our favorite was the foccacia and pesto that we got with our meal, and it was soooooo good!  I want that pesto recipe!  We also got a few cocktails to go with our meal, which were well-priced for the size of the glass.  Next time, we'll save room for dessert because the gelatos looked great!  Loved the ambiance and bar seating in front of the open kitchen too.
