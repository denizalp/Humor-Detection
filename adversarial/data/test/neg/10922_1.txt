I would avoid this Hotel at any cost!!!! Bad Management, Bad service, and bad rooms!!!!!     \n\nThis is my second terrible experience with this hotel. I gave them a second chance hoping the first bad experience was a fluke.  We selected the hotel because of it offered a package deal that included transportation to and from the airport. \n\nWe had several issues that included a toilet that didn't flush and a fan on the heating\/air conditioning unit that did not work properly. The Main issue was with the transpiration from the airport to the Hotel. The first time around it took over an hour to get picked up. We were told the driver was at the grocery store and would have to wait or call a cab if we did not like how long it took. The second time, I was told the wait would be 30 minutes or longer as the driver was busy. This time I decided to arrange my own transpiration back to the Hotel. As I arrived, I noticed the hotel shuttle parked in front of the Hotel. At this point I'm extremely angry. I wanted to speak with a manager but none was available (imagine that).   I was told that the driver was performing maintenance duties and that is the reason he couldn't come for us. Avoid!! Avoid!!! Avoid!!!!
