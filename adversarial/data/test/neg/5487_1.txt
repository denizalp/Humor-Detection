The service was not good at all. Me and my family of 4 waited 20 minutes and all we got was a bottle of warm water that could only serve 3 people. We ordered food and drinks at the same time, 10 minutes later, we could see through the window her on the computer, but not coming out. We left. Sorry, wish it could've been better.
