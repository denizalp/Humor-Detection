I just had a wonderful experience at this FedEx Office Ship Center. An extremely kind woman named Debbie was working today, and went well above and beyond the call of duty to help me with my situation today. I had a long scan and fax to complete. Debbie helped me get it completed and made sure that I was happy and satisfied with the end result. I am extremely grateful for her kindness and generosity today. Thank you Debbie!
