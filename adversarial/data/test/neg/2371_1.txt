Had the California Omelette. It's got kale and I've yet to jump on the Kale Bandwagon but now I have. I demolished everything on my plate. I am not a member of the clean plate club, but damn I ate everything including the orange wedge. I live 35 mins away and was starving when I started my breakfast adventure today but I must say they live up to what I heard. Well done. Dog friendly patio. Breakfast bar or table seating. The line stayed going out the door entire time.
