Let me just say that with the amount that I play I will comped at any casino.\n\nThis is my favorite hotel in Las Vegas.  VIP Lounge is the nicest that I have been to.  They always have fresh fruit, pastries, soft drinks, hot coffee in there for there guests.  I never have to wait long for service.  They are always as accommidating as possible with all the extras I usually ask for.  Cabanas, show tickets, concerts, limos.\n\nVenetian has two of my three favorite restaurants - Bouchon and Delmonico's.  The third is the buffet at the Bellagio.\n\nThe rooms are very nice and quite large.  There is always adleast two beds because the couch folds out to be a bed.  There is usually fresh flowers and fresh fruit in the room waiting for me.  I really like the chocolate they leave when they turn down your bed at night.\n\nI have stayed here adleast 20 times over the past 10 years.  The place to stay in Vegas.
