I never been fitted before and usually just shop for my bras online, until recently when I been struggling more with my sizing. At one point I was trying to fit in to a c cup and then later moved on to trying a double d. I went in for a fitting and found out I'm actually in between F-G depending on the brand. She was super sweet and helped me pick out a couple bras and made sure they actually fit me correctly. I didn't mind spending the amount I did since I've looked around online and I paid either the same amount or less on some of the bras. I would totally give her ten stars if I could!
