I love this place. If you've never been here don't get turned off by the bad reviews.\nIf you are someone that's adventurous and like to try new things then you NEED to try this place out.\nI came here with 5 other friends and 5 of us had so much fun and really tried to relax and enjoy the food. On the other hand one of our friend was just complaining about being scared in the dark whatsoever. \nI would say without that friend I would have given the whole experience a 5 star but since it wasn't their fault, I'm giving 5 anyways.\nVictor was great. It was our first time there and he was very patient with us.\nI got the main and dessert\nFilet Mignon (blue rare)- YUM! I was concerned that I might cut myself but turned out they cut it for you. BONUS\nSurprise dessert- For those of you that haven't tried it before I don't want to spoil it for u but I can say I would rather have the chocolate cake.\nPrices are reasonable, It's the only dine in the dark restaurant in Toronto!\nloveitloveitloveit\nwill be back!
