I'm a Las Vegas local, and enjoy visiting our city's spas with the help of things like Groupon and Travelzoo which brought me to this great place. I'm not a spa veteran by any means. I've only been to three other spas in the city. But the Well Spa is definitely a must go. \n\nI believe Crystal was the receptionist who booked my appointments, which were a Swedish Massage, a Moroccan Mud Wrap, and an Express Facial. She was very friendly, and was so helpful when she gave me a tour of the spa. \n\nI arrived early to make use of their steam room, which was nice and hot when I arrived. The eucalyptus seemed fresh. You can leave your toiletries at home because they provide it all, even a hairdryer and straightener. \n\nIf you prefer to stay away from the coed relaxation room, they have a small sitting area in the women's spa. But I found myself picking a corner chair in the relaxation room as the lighting was perfect, and I was the only one there. Their snack selection is small, but their large tea and juice selection makes up for it.\n\nSarah was my massage therapist, and she was an absolute gem. It was my first time getting a wrap, so she explained the process to me. She was very attentive to my problem areas during my massage, and really listened to my every need. I honestly can say it was the best massage I personally have had, I felt so relaxed down to my fingers and toes. \n\nAnother first for me was getting a facial, and my only disappointment was that I didn't go for a full 50 min. Denusia was so sweet, and the products she used smelled wonderful. \n\nI purchased my massage with a Groupon, but I added the extra treatments because their prices are very reasonable. To top it all off they have a locals discount. From start to finish, you feel treated better than \"Well\". And I am excited to come back again in the future.
