Must visit place for someone craving authentic (or close to authentic) South Indian stuff in Phoenix. After I moved to Phoenix from SFO Bay Area. I had tough time figuring out good South Indian places to eat similar to those found in the Bay. That's when I found Biryani and bites. I usually preferred takeouts because the ambience didn't quite please me. The food is awesome. I tried different stuff each time. The first time was channa masala (garbanzo bean gravy) with naan. It was very good and spiced according to my taste. The second time it was poori+ masala (fluffed deep fried bread and potato curry).It reminded me of the one my granny made back in India. Simply great. It is found under appetisers because of the quantity. It is worth the snack. The third time, I ordered madurai malli dosa. It's basically a rice crepe spread with coriander chutney paste. On that day they gave me a buy 1 dosa and get one free. The taste of the chutneys that came with the dosa was very good as well (especially the sambar). The quantity of sambar which came with the dosa was a lot. I even had it with rice the next day. This place offers a lot of variety of dosas. My colleagues usually order keema biryani from here and they love the taste. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone craving authentic South Indian food.
