Employees here do not pay attention (including the manager). For the second time in a row I ordered a ham\/turkey bagel sandwich on a plain bagel and they messed it up. I was watching them make my sandwich both times and they used a pretzel bagel. They also forgot the ham BOTH times. I spoke to the manager and the first thing he said was \"we have new employees \". I told him this was the second time this had happened. On top of that, he was standing next to this new employee when I was initially ordering. What the heck is that ?!  He said he never heard me. I would not be as upset if it o my happened once, but 2 times in a row ? Pay attention people ! I definitely won't be coming back to this location....at least not for a while
