I really don't have much to say about this restaurant other than after a Hornets game and your staying at the Holiday Inn city center hotel located across the street this open late cheap eats place can fill you up on the cheap. The food was not the best thing I've ever had. It was around 11pm after the game and we had 2 slices of pizza a small salad and 5 wings (garlic salt and pepper) and fries. Everything came to around $20 and it wasn't gross so I'm going to say we chalk this up to a win. Fuel Pizza not great but not bad either. If it's late and you're hungry give this place a try.
