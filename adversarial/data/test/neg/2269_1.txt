Amazing food, super cheap, best sauces, cool vibe, friendly* smiley staff, awesome location...\n\nbut..\n\n...the ginger server tried to take away our plates before we were finished, and basically kicked us out with a forceful goodbye.  \nThere wasn't even a lineup of people waiting to get seats :(\n\nKinda soured the experience in my favourite fast food joint  :(
