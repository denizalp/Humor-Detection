This Magic Moment is awesome!  I found my dress here at a very reasonable price.  They have a great selection and budget-friendly prices.  I had been to similar type of store in another city, but Magic Moment had way more inventory, and lots more types of dresses.  The appointment-only concept was super nice because I got the whole store to myself.  It was a very special morning for me and my family that I brought along.  We were able to take as many pictures as we wanted to the dresses.  The ladies were really friendly and helpful and picked out my dress for me to try on... they definitely have a good eye!  I ended up getting a dress that I hated on the hanger, but it looked amazing on.  Thanks, Lisa!  They also have accessories like belts and veils.  I would highly recommend Magic Moment to anyone looking for their dress!
