I've gone to this Sephora for over six years now and my experience has never been unpleasant. While it is true that this store is smaller than other Sephora's, they still have a good selection of products. It does suck whenever it gets a little busy because it feels very claustrophobic and you have to wait awhile until you can find an available associate to help and\/or check you out.\n\nThey used to have a counter in the middle where you could check out whereas now you have to find an associate to check you out at one of the computer stations scattered on the sides of the store. It always feels haphazard to me however I understand they are trying to optimize the space the best that they can so they can have more products out.\n\nI also see a lot of the employees deep in conversations with each other that when I ask for help with a product, it feels like I'm being rude and intruding on their conversation. I wish they would be more readily available to help. Those who did helped me, were incredibly nice and fairly knowledgable (Michelle and Jasmine in particular.) However in this same store, one of their associates told me the difference between the Laura Mercier oil free foundation and the regular one is that the oil free is for acne prone skin and does not clog pores implying that the regular one does. This is completely incorrect since both foundations state that they are noncomedogenic, therefore both do not clog pores and the difference between the two is actually the finish, matte vs natural luminosity. It's always a good idea to get an second opinion and do some research since not everyone at Sephora knows what they are talking about.
