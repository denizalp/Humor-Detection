Popped in to grab lunch to go. It was warm in this place! While waiting for my order I noticed a few portable A\/C units plugged in around the tables. I don't get it. The food was fine and the service was fine. No A\/C though? Weird and kind of gross considering how hot it gets outside. How can a business stay open like that? Hello? Management? Owners???
