I love the Peppermill from their retro chic Vegas decor to the friendly waitresses. My grandparents loved this place and I can see why - it's a refreshing change from the buffet lines. \n\nThe coffee aroma fills the restaurant and unlike an unmentioned coffee house the coffee awakens the soul. The breakfast is abundant and tastes like your grandma would make (at least for those of us with grandmas that can cook).\n\nAs you can tell I'm a sucker for this place.
