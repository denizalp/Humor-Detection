Delish, authentic, and hits the spot. Pricey for this type of food, but come on, we are in Vegas and at the Venetian. This place would be the bomb for a late night meal after drinking, I'd imagine. I've had the noodle soup, porridge, potstickers...ask for the chili oil to drizzle over your food, this one is super flavorful and good. A gem on The Strip!
