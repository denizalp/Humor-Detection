I use to love this place but they've taken some of my favorites off the menu and everything that loaded with peanuts. I got the Vietnamese rolls and even though I really dislike peanuts I usually can pick them out. There was more peanuts in these two than any other ingredients. They are pre made and clearly sat for a while because the lettuce was soggy and it was falling apart. It's unfortunate those aren't made to order or at lease for people who would like to omit something out of them.
