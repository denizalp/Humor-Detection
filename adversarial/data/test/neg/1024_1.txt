DANGEROUSLY located across the street from my old work, I hold Lenny's burger shop directly responsible for those 5 extra pounds I put on while working there. This place was great. Juicy delicious burgers and seasoned french fries were a staple at this joint, but you would be surprised what else they did well! My favorite was the country burger combo. Killer milkshakes too. And if you work in the area, they started serving breakfast a couple years ago and the breakfast burritos are solid. Conveniently located right next to the Thomas lightrail stop.
