Gia is a hair and lash goddess! I've been seeing her for years and absolutely love both my lashes and my hair. From extensions to color, she knows what she's doing and is all about making you happy with your hairs best interest in mind. I used to be platinum blonde and had multiple bad experiences with breakage and over processing by other stylists before finding Gia. Now my hair is healthier than ever and growing long and strong. I have a few filler extensions that she tapes in and you can't even tell they are there. Thank you G for everything you do! You work hair magic
