Owner called me apologized and literally saved the face of this company which was awesome.  \n\nIt was all it took to suffice my anger and he did it. He also tried reimbursing me a bit for the work however I told him I'd rather pay but it was an awfully kind gesture of an apology. \n\nThanks so much John I really appreciate the call and rushing of my order
