If I could give it a Zero I would!!! I never write reviews but this was by far the worst food I ever had. First I placed the order because I am at work and I had a burger by the way and they asked how would I like it I said well done. I get back to work cut it open and it's red. So I go back and get another burger and loaded fries the burger was cold and waaaaaay over done the fries were cold. Just nasty!!!!!!! I started to go to five guys and the getgo has better food there too
