Excellent service in a good pub atmosphere. The chicken pot pie was incredible. Beer selection was solid and the appetizer choices were exactly what I was hoping for. Whisky selections were good, with a decent choice of some excellent American and Scotch whisky. I would like to see more Irish whisky options. The bar is a bit tall for eating, but great for drinking and leaning. A cozy lounge area in the back is nice for a more casual night out with friends.
