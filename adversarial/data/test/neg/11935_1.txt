The food was incredible. I'll give you that. I requested that our anniversary and one other special occasion be acknowledged. Neither of them were. Our servers name was Jose! He started off rude and ended rude. I'm a server so I have plenty of patience for servers\/ staff as long as they are kind. We asked Jose about the pre fix dinner. We were confused as to how many it would feed because the menu was labeled for two under two categories of the prefix. Jose didn't give us an accurate description of anything; instead he rolled his eyes at my girlfriend when she decided to change her order. Jose was very offensive throughout our meal. I was so blown away by the fact that he treated us like a chore and rushed us through our experience. The food was amazing but didn't make up for the disrespect we were given by Jose that night. I'm saying our servers name was Jose because the host that sat us said that Jose would be our server. I could be wrong though because we were taken care of by servers different servers that night. The server we had was a tall Spanish looking guy with a crew cut and a slender face with dark hair.
