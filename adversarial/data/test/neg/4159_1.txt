I'm don't usually bother to review gas stations, but this particular establishment merits at least a short note.  Why? Well, it's not for the gas, or for the station, even.  It's for the car wash.  \n\nThe wash at this location actually has the old school, touch-free-free style scrubbers.  I know touch-free is supposed to be easier on your paint, etc, but I'm rarely satisfied with the results.  This sort of wash does a lot better.  You're not going to get the same results with touchless.\n\nIf your car is dusty and you're feeling lazy, check out this place.
