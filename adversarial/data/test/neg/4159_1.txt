My absolute favorite Vietnamese-fusion restaurant. It may well be my favorite Asian restaurant. Tonight my dish of choice was the clay pot with beef. The beef and vegetables were perfectly cooked and seasoned. The dish comes with a side salad and bowl of scallion broth. My wife had the garlic noodles and grilled shrimp. For chilled adult beverages we opted for a Lychee-jito. A delicious drink made like a mojito using lychee infused vodka. \nAnother fantastic couple of items on the menu are the spring rolls and shrimp appetizer. \nAnother terrific couple of dishes are the Vietnamese BBQ ribs and Shaken Beef.
