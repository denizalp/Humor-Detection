The Galbitang was tasty. Don't expect good service here. I don't know if it's the Korean culture or just the server (or lack of English speaking skills) but they seem kind of rude.  Also they seem understaffed so they seem to be rushing you to make an order. Authentic Korean food! I loved the broth of the Galbitang. Kim Chee was fresh and good also part of Banchan which is the Korean word for mini-side dishes.
