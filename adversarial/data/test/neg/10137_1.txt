Got a creative bowl with sushi rice based, topped with cucumber, curry cauliflower, kimchi, wakame & tofu and spicy shoyu for sauce.\n\nThere are variety of toppings to choose from, the creative bowl was delicious and definitely would go for it again. They also provide free top-up to make my bowl prettier. However, I haven't gotten to try out their grain bowls and smoothies bowls.\n\nThe atmosphere is cosy and quiet, they have long tables and benches which suitable for studying. One con is the service, I was having trouble selecting the combination of the toppings, yet the people weren't helpful at all :(
