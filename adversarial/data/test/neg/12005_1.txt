I can't see how this place is going to survive! I bought a Groupon ($12 for 1 dozen cupcakes). I placed my order 2 days in advance and requested them to be ready at 2pm today. When ordering I asked for birthday like sprinkles. Today I called around 11am because I was in the area and thought maybe I would check and see of they were ready. Nope-no biggie. I returned at 2:15pm. I walked in to a very unappealing store...not what you would expect from a bakery. There were 2 girls sitting on barstools talking. I asked about my cupcakes and the confused girl went and brought the most un-enthusiastic apparent owner who said they were baking and would not be done until 3pm. She attempted to try and piece together from 2 pink boxes in a fridge (probably from yesterday) cupcakes that had baby blue frosting and another with pink sprinkles...really, I was not going to a baby shower! So I said forget it and left. I am not worried about getting my money back from Groupon...but seriously don't waste your time with this place. If you live in Henderson or near by go to Cupcakery or the new awesome Gimme Some Sugar or drive anywhere else. Both are what you expect from professionals!! Based on the reviews, I am sure a store cake would taste better...glad I didn't have to go through the embarrasment of showing up with garbage from this horrible place!
