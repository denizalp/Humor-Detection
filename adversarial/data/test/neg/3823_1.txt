I have mixed feelings about Kelly's. On one hand, their evening offerings seem to be good. Drinks and late night noms are good, but when I went here for lunch, it was awful. \n\nMy soda was flat, short rib tacos were dry and tasteless, and the bruschetta was weird and had a stringent, bitter taste...too much truffle oil?\n\nHowever, service has always been good and their mules, Arizona or Moscow, are delicious. Also, their decor is really cute. I love the leather couches and the booths.
