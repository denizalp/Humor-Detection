I really liked this consignment shop, a few friends has shared with me that I should try Nouveaux. I'm so glad I was able to make it in today.\n\nI was immediately greeted by the employee in duty. She asked if this was my first time visiting and I explored it was. That a friend had shared with me about their consignment shop but I haven't had the chance to visit. She was very excited and walked over immediately to me and shared with me how their pricing works. Then also provided that they were having a sale of 70% off June merchandise. \n\nThe store was very clean and organized very well, you don't see that a lot in consignment shops so I like that. The fitting rooms were nights and spacious another bonus. It had a nice large chair inside with a shaggy rug and two mirrors... yes ladies need TWO mirrors I the dressing room so we can look at our front and back at the same time lol. Or turn to one side and look, then flip to the other side and look as if paparazzi is snapping our pictures lol. Dang I just gave away why women take so long in dressing rooms lmbo! Oh well!\n\nWith all thy said, I recommend all my consignment lovers and consignment newbie lovers to add this great place to you trendy consignment shopping list!
