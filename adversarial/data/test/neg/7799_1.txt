Thorough. Personable. Courteous. Professional. Responsive. All words describe my experience at Physicians Physical Therapy. There are a LOT of Physical Therapy options in this city, but you won't be disappointed here. I felt like a priority. I felt like a person, not just a case they were treating. If you want a clean office, with a courteous staff, and excellent treatment, look no further.
