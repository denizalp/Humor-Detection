Love this place! We've lived close by for years - passing by it so many times - but never ate here. Until last year. My brother read the reviews on Yelp and suggested it. It sooo reminded me of our favorite Chinese restaurant in CT. I love the Bo Bo Chicken. Its a little spicy with a very taste sauce. As others have mentioned, the House Special Chicken rocks! I found it tasted better when served at the restaurant. As take-out, it was a little dry. I've also found that most of the menu items that are labeled \"highly recommended\" are usually really good. Oh and for starters, the War Won Ton Soup is amazing! My only complaint is that the don't de-vein the shrimp! I've tried several shrimp dishes, including the War Won Ton Soup, and found the shrimp to still have the vein intact! Personally, that is not appealing to me so I don't order shrimp there. But truly everything else is wonderful. The service is also very good. Give it a try!
