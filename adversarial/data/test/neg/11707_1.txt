Dec 16, 2017\n\nWe just had dinner at Chimney Fresh and it was delicious!. Each dish was made to order. We had the Kerala porota, king fish fry, beef ulliyarthiya (beef dry fry), mutton biryani, chicken dosa - crispy, samiya paysam and 2 Madras coffee. \n\nThe fish fry was crisp, with a hint of spice and just fresh and delish. i had read reviews on the porota and have had porota in many restaurants but nothing compares to the flavor here..reminded me of home! Chicken and dosa, not a flavor I expected to go together...the spicy chicken with a hint of sweetness pared so well with the crispy dosa. The mutton biryani, paysam and coffee were all authentic and flavorful. \n\nOverall, the dishes and the vibe here was warm and friendly. The owner, George and Jobi were inviting and pleasant and passionate about the business. George came out to check on us and the meal...he explained that all their spices are made in house including their clarified butter...crazy right in the most awesome way! A night that was a let's just check this place out turned into an amazing foodie delight! Looking forward to going back with more of my fam and friends
