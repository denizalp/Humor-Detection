This is by far my favorite juice shop Everyone, especially the owner Patricia, is so sweet and helpful. All the juices are great but the Acai bowls are even better! The protein acai bowl with vegan protein powder is amazing and has a great thick consistency. Also, the chicken gyro wrap is really delicious and not heavy at all. It's enough to save half for later which is always nice. I'd definitely recommend driving out of your way for this place!
