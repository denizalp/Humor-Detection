I placed an order around 1030pm from Foodora for this place. The reviews seemed good and the menu was just what I was looking for. I ordered the Mac and cheese, the chicken dinner. I got a call saying they were out of chicken dinner so I changed my order to shrimp tacos and a Chilean hotdog and the side of Mac and cheese. My food arrived and the taco's were soggy, the hot dog bun was soggy and the Mac and cheese had a topping of some grated cheddar as opposed to a bread crumb crunch topping as mentioned in the menu. Overall, the food was crap. Not tasty at all. The hotdog was plain. The shrimp tacos were too soggy to even eat properly. And the Mac and cheese had NO flavour. Def NOT ordering from here ever again. It was a complete waste of money.
