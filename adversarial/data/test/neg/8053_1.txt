A-M-A-Z-I-N-G ! ! !\n\nI have been dining at Diego Pops in Old Town Scottsdale for a few years now, and they have never unsatisfied me! \n\nThe food is absolutely to die for; with all of the crazy concoctions they produce. I don't think there is one food item I have tried on their menu that did not satisfy. \n\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant is so amazing. As you walk in, there is a light up board that changes every so often. Throughout the restaurant there are various pieces of art, colorful walls, and neon signs. Music taste is AMAZING! We asked the server for the playlist, and haven't stopped listening to it since! \n\nPrices are reasonable, for a dine-in restaurant in Old Town Scottsdale. Would highly recommend to friends and family.
