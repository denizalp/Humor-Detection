Fantastic food, fantastic service. \nThis might actually be my new favourite restaurant. The flavours are incredible and everything is cooked to perfection. Add to that the warm, courteous staff and perfect atmosphere and you've pretty much nailed it. Prices are very good as well. I'll be going back soon.
