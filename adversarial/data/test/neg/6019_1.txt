I had an appointment with Tiffany on Saturday and it was awesome. She listened to what I wanted and how I normally style my hair everyday and made sure the cut was  dimensional but low maintenance. After several bad experiences at a few hair schools I'm glad I finally found a great salon in Charlotte. I will definitely be asking for Tiffany at my next appointment.
