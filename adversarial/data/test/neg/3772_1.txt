This is a huge spot that's just a few steps off of Yonge St near King subway station and in a great location. What I love about this place is that it is a great spot to work, with tons of seating and fast wifi. You aren't going to find another spot like this nearby. The Starbucks a few minutes walk away, for example, may or may not have seating at any given point in time. Finding a seat during peak hours is like finding a four leaf clover blindfolded. But not at The Croissant Tree! Walk in, order a drink, and get comfy.
