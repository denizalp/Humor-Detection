As someone in a job that can't attend traditional happy hour this place is terrific!  The service and the food are fantastic! \nHappy Hour runs all evening! The manager is very particular in how her patrons are treated. If she thinks something could be better she fixes it without the customer asking. She's always on the floor observing. \nIt's a fun hanging out after work! Can hardly wait to dine here . We have out of town guest coming and this is first place on our list!
