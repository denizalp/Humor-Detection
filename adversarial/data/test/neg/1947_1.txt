Rue 21's are hard to find. I believe the only other location is Oakland. While the that location is convienent to me, its very small and crowded due to college kids nearby. \n\nThe one at Monroeville mall is very large and spread out. Boots and shoes are organized much much better. They seem to have much more here. One day while looking for boots in Oakland i became frustrated because you can't really browse They are on a wall. I literally had nothing else to do and drove all the way to Monroeville mall (15min) to look.
