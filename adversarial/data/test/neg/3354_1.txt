Good as long as you know how to order correctly! For example the sandwiches are good, the pizza, not so much. The spaghetti and meatballs came with ONE meatball...so not great...but the cannoli is good.  So anyways, has potential, but the menu is just too big. It's impossible to be great with so many options.
