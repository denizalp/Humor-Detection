Como En Casa makes some pretty darn good Mexican food.\n\nOutside looks kinda sketchy, so if you're skeptical about it, don't be! Just muster up some courage and walk through those doors, trust me, you won't regret it.\n\nThe interior of this establishment is kind of out dated but the food makes up for it! It's really dim lit and tiny but it gave off a very nice homey vibe to it (probably because the owner is such a nice guy).\n\nOnto the food, I ordered their chicken mole and my friend got their fish taco meal. The price wasn't too bad, everything on the menu ranges from $8-10. They gave a decent portion which was good for my stomach and my wallet!\n\nThe chicken mole was excellent, it was cooked perfectly. The meat just came apart with ease and the sauce had great flavour. The pinto beans and the rice was a nice addition to the meal because it balances the heavy and salty flavours of the mole chicken. \n\nThe fish tacos tasted pretty awesome too. The coleslaw that was paired up with the deep fried fish was really tasty too and I think that really gave the tacos a nice kick to them.\n\nOverall, you better mex your way here because the food here is fan-taco-stic.
