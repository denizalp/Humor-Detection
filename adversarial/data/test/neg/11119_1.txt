I was so happy to find this place!   Real ice cream with real dairy, not whipped full of air.  It doesn't leave that oily film in your mouth like Dairy Queen does, which is like eaten frozen Crisco.    The selections of dips and toppings make it almost impossible to decide.    I advise to downsize- it is more filling than your usual soft serve.     Prices realistic.   The location is small and outside crowded so they lose a star.
