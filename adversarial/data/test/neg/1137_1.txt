Whenever I come to Alchemy I hope to get something new, because all the food looks so good, but I like the sweet potato fries and corn salad so much I always stick to those. If you like sweet potato in any form, the sweet potato fries here are on point. These are some of the best sweet potato fries in town; they're crispy, well-seasoned, and come with a spicy jam that makes my mouth so happy. The corn salad has a tangy, super unique tasting dressing that I love. It's large enough for a full dinner and has tons of protein for vegetarians or those avoiding meat.\n\nOverall, Alchemy is a great place for a quick dinner, especially with a few people. There are usually at least a few tables free and I never wait more than a few minutes even with a slightly larger group. The food is varied enough for a picky group and everything is pretty good (sandwiches, burgers, salads, larger entrees). The beer menu is pretty sizable and desserts are delicious. They have music a few nights a month too in the evening, which makes it a fun evening hangout. \n\nThe only thing I don't love is the space and layout. Some of the tables are pretty close to one another and, for some reason, the space always feels kind of loud and a little difficult to hear people.
