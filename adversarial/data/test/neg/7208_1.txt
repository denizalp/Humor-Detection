This year I will be signing my 3rd lease here. Lori has been great since day one! Super friendly & always greets me with a smile. The original Management was very poor quality. Since new management took over, the place has been a joy. They repaved the parking & painted the buildings. Remodeled most apartments & upgraded the appliances. Revamped the Gym & completely restored the main pool. Any time I have needed repairs or maintenance, Stephen has been professional & trust worthy when entering my home. Angela is another one of my favorites in the office. She is very personable & is eager to please if I have a request or concern. I absolutely love this location. Everything I need is right around the corner. The amenities are wonderful & again, the office staff is phenomenal. The grounds are kept up beautifully & landscaping is perfect. Pet friendly as well.
