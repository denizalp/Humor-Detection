This is my favorite nail spot. \nThe actual store is beautiful and exceptionally clean. \nWhoever designed it truly understood aesthetics. \n\nI love their different pedicure options... The mocha smells amazing. \nThe stone massage is so relaxing. \n\nThey also do waxing and I have been so happy with my results. \n\nLooking forward to getting a facial next week.
