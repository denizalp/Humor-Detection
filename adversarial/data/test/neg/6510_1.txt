Love a business that stands behind it's promises!! Today I came in with a flat tire that could not be patched due to the location on the side! I have always purchased tires at the various Discount Tires in Scottsdale, but so lucky I came to Fountain Hills for service. Kyle showed me the punctured spot and clearly explained why it could not be fixed. When he entered my customer info he found that I had purchased the replacement certificate for that tire & that they would replace that tire free of any charges right this moment! \nAlso,  noticed that while waiting the entire lobby is filled with other happu customers! \n\nThank you Kyle & FH Discount Tire...you have my future business!
