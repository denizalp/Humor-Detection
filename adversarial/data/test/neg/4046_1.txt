I came in for some waxing services, hair color toning, and a trim. I left with a 6-month commitment for UNLIMITED waxing at $45\/month (which I hope will all be with Liz!) and great results from both hair services with Cassandra; I can't wait to go back! Everyone was friendly, professional, and pleasant. Great find in Henderson and very conveniently located off the 215. Plus, I'll always take a free cup of Aveda tea when I can!
