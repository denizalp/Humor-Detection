Came here on a busy Friday lunch for the AYCE with 2 other coworkers. Overall we were quite satisfied with our meal, all of our orders were very accurate. \n\nThe rolls were a nice size, seaweed salad was good, tempura and sauce were excellent and also enjoyed the skewers. \n\nWhat I thought were below average were the sushi pizza and some of the Grilled meat. It was okay, but not a fan of the sauce they used. It was a tad too sweet. \n\nGood experience overall and would recommend anyone looking for an AYCE in that area.
