This shit is the bomb! I love the pitas, with soft chewy pita bread, delicious savory gyro and souvlaki meat, and heavy on the toppings - you need a napkin. I also like the Elatos salad, fresh tasting with big chunks of good feta. The handful of times I've ordered, the delivery drivers are pleasant and arrive really quickly. Woohoo, so glad I found this place!
