What I like about this place is their glazed doughnuts and the kolaches. I tried the green tea pistachio and red velvet cake doughnuts and I really didn't enjoy them. But the glazed are money. But the only thing that will prevent me from coming back is the price. It's up there and i would rather grab a dozen somewhere for the way less. Hopefully maybe they branch out and lower those prices.
