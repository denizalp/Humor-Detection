Bellagio or The Venetian, this isn't. But the hotel is well taken care of, the room was large, and it was surprisingly very quiet. We had a view of the city from the 23rd floor that was really beautiful. We tried for the Bellagio, but the cheapest room was $300\/night midweek, and here at the Excalibur it was $75, including ripoff (whoops, I mean \"resort\") fees, taxes, and whatever else they tack on. But all the hotels do that now, so I'm not criticizing Excalibur. I recommend staying there. We had a great time and will definitely stay again.
