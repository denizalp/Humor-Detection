Four for dinner.  Overall, we liked it.  I had the vegetable biryani which I found tasty but rather \"light\" on vegetables.  I think all of us liked our meals.\n\nI'd break down my rating this way:\n   Ambiance:  3  [sorta average, but OK]\n   Service:  4 [the water was good but rather full of himself]\n   Food quality: 3.5-4  [very good but not excellent]\n   Food quantity:  4.5  [three of four of us did not finish] \n   Prices:  4\n   Value: 3.5\n\nWould we go back there? Sure!
