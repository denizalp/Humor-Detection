I love finding places like this. The place doesn't look like much from the road, and the decor is mostly beer signs and kitschy. But the food! The food is classic deli style. Tasty, fresh and big! They have a large selection of beers from around the world and craft beers too. The service was friendly and attentive. Overall my best deli experience in a long time, and definitely the best in Summit county.
