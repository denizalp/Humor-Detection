Short version: \nTook longer to be seated than expected. \nSushi is fair, too much filler ruins the flavor\nSeaweed cup is too sweet \nVariety of Asian flavors seems limited (disappointed)\nLots of American food (didn't try)\nFruit is really good \nService is quick about clearing old plates and keeping drinks topped off.
