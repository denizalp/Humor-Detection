Great food, atmosphere and service. Signature burger was great. The crispy potatoes are excellent.  HAd the lamb, really good.  This is a great place for supper.  Nice selection of local brews The tiramisu had a layer of chocolate cream, not traditional but was really, really good. Creme Brulee just average.
