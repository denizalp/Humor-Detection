Clutch your pearls...this place is amazing!!! The decor is so cool and welcoming.  In the middle of the day, it still has this speakeasy, smoky effect to it.  I loved it.  So warm and staff member made this place feel like a cool cat's home.   Loved that.\nOn to the food....southern decadence at it's best.  The biscuits with honey butter, the fried chicken with watermelon and waffles, the breakfast biscuits with egg and sausage, the brusselsprouts....all very well done.  Portion sizes are appropriate and appreciated for American standards. Lol.  Had a classic bellini which was good but pretty standard.  \nAll in all, a must try if you're in vegas and searching for good southern cuisine.  A little pricey but hey, it's Vegas! !!!
