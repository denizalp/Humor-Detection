Yet another Groupon alert. \n\nFYI - The Castle of Cakes location is actually :\n750 E. Pyle \nLas Vegas, NV 89183\n\nMe and my girls decided to try another girls days out with our Cupcake Decorating class. \n\nNot really sure cupcake decorating is for me, but it is a fun and interesting class if you have the attention span for it. There were plenty of stay at home moms there who have many kid's birthday parties to decorate for whom this would be much more useful for. \n\nThey also have classes and Birthday Party \/ Cupcake Decorating parties for kids of any age that I would recommend. \n\nDefinitely for a specific demographic, but fun and creative activity for all age groups.\n\nI can't speak to their pastries and cakes, but I had to say based on their samples, pictures and a tasting of some of their cupcake flavorsI wasn't entirely impressed by that aspect of the business. Stick with the decorating classes.
