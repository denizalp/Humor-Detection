I'm giving this place a 3.5! (and that's a good thing)\n\nWhenever I'm craving Korean BBQ and don't have much $$ I go here strictly for the price. It's a lot more affordable than other ayce places which will cost me (+ tip) around $30 for dinner. The meat and banchans are pretty good, not crappy at all. They do lack desserts but so does Sura. I guess desserts aren't highlighted in Korean BBQ because people are too stuffed with meat and ran out of room for anything sweet afterwards. Everything they serve on the buffet may not be an A+... maybe a B- \n\nThey have at least 4 different marinated meat selections and another 3 or 4 \"dry\" meat which includes beef, pork and chicken. They also serve seafood such as shrimp and squid. They have all sorts of \"salads\" or cold dishes, along side other appetizers? Such as pot stickers and grilled fish. They also serve sushi rolls but I never give those any attention. If I want to eat sushi, ayce Korean BBQ (or any buffet in general) ain't the place. I go to ayce sushi joints for that. They serve rose tea and I'm addicted to it. I'd drink like 5 servings lol\n\nI know there are better places, but you can't beat it for the price. It definitely satisfies my meat cravings ;)
