My husband and I came by here two Thursdays ago for lunch. I had this place bookmarked for a little over year and have always wanted to come and glad that I finally did.\n\nAnyways, when we arrived, I didn't really know what to expect. From the outside, this place looked a little sketchy. The sign has graffiti on it and the little strip mall this is located in just seemed kind of small and not in the best of neighborhoods. Anyways, when we walked in, we were acknowledged by a server and she told us to pick a table to sit down. When we sat down, we were given 2 cups of water and a closed styrofoam container. Wasn't too sure what that styrofoam container was for and thought our server accidentally put it on our table and that she boxed up someone's leftovers at another table.\n\nInside the styrofoam container is cold boiled peanuts so we started eating that as we were deciding what to order. Our server came by pretty quickly and we ended up ordering:\n\n2 orders of Bibimbap in a stone pot- delicious! Just as good as any other place I have had bibimbap. Loved the crunchy rice as well (the benefits of ordering this in a stone pot\/ bowl). \n\nChicken Musubi- Delicious! I didn't know musubi could be made with chicken since I have always seen it only with spam. The only thing is that the chicken was a bit oily, but that's expected at a down home place like this.\n\nSpam Musubi- I didn't get a bite of this but my husband liked it. The size for this musubi and the chicken one was a pretty big piece. \n\nOur meal was also rounded out with some banchan. We got 4 little plates and my favorite was this one with broccoli. One man, whom I suspect is one of the owners (or maybe the manager) refilled our banchan throughout our meal. Our server was great at refilling our water. This other guy (I guess you can call him a server to?) also refilled our water and was really friendly. Service was very attentive, quick and very friendly. I will definitely come back here again the next time I am in the area. Oh and real random, this place has fast (ask for the password) wifi.
