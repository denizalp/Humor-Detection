Minecraft party. Those words sent my head into a spin. You can't find much Minecraft out there! So, I began to call place after place to find someone to make a cake. I called one well know place that said ( what's Minecraft ) really my soon to be 8 year old grandson and 16 of his closest friends it is a way \nof life! Then I called the Amazing Sweets Unlimited. \"\" sure we make Minecraft cakes \" would you also like some gift bags for give always? The entire staff was a pleasure to work with. I had to call and add to the order. When I went to pick it up, it was done on time, with all the changes I had phoned in, and last but not least..... I could not have pictured a more magnificent cake. As far as the quality, countless people were surprised to see their child eat the cake along with the icing. The adults who ate cake, said it was one of the best cakes they have ever had. I found myself putting out the flyer and post it  so the parents could write down the number. So, my had work and Sweets Unlimited mad fir a fantastic Birthday party. I will use them for all of my events. They also have pastry cases filled things to eat. It's a must do. It's in the shopping center along side of Home Depot on Northsight. See you there;)
