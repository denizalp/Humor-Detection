I had a great experience with Triggs Plumbing yesterday. In the space of little more than an hour, the plumber, Lance, had replaced the cylinders in a leaking bathroom sink, given a toilet tank all new \"innards,\" installed a beautiful new Kohler kitchen faucet, (preselected for me after I gave over the phone a description of the broken faucet I wanted to replace) and cleaned out the inside of a slow moving bathroom sink. All needed parts were already stocked on the truck, including the faucet. No need for another service call! Highly recommended!
