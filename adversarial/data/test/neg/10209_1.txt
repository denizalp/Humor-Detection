Special occasion perfect... if you are a wine lover, you will adore the fact that Bonterra (good earth) has the largest number of wines by the glass in the city...  a tasters delight. I took a large group for a corporate function and everyone had a wonderful time. Everything was lovely and the service was superb, an impressive date place and a great romantic experience as well. They have a lovely private room for group dining upstairs and the staff even totally moved our tables around at the last minute when I showed up and asked for them to be moved to the balcony area, they snapped right to it. I was very impressed.
