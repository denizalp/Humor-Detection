Love it, they have a big selection of food here. Their little specials they make are why I come back such as the mango rose. ! so delicious and sweet and their Mango Yoghurt! \nJust make sure the # of what you order you double it because they never give the amount you order. It will always be less or sometimes the food doesn't even come. When this does happen just make sure your waitress\/ waiter is aware and they usually will bring you it out immediately after you've noticed them. Make reservations if you plan on eating at dinner time, the wait is 20 minutes++++
