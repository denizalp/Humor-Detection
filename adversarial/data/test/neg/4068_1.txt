Food was wonderful, but the service was AWFUL.\n\nPlace had only 2 or 3 other tables of customers. She took forever to come take our drink order, took forever to bring us our drinks (while we watched her stand around drinking and chatting with all the other staff) then finally asked if we wanted menus. Kept coming right next to us to serve the people there, but ignored us when we'd try to get her attention. Finally took our order. Then awhile later came and took the order of the people sitting next to us. Brought their order very quickly (which was exactly the same as ours- pizza and wings) and we waited another 45 minutes for our meal.\nShe had no idea what the game special was, told us of the days special after we had decided what we wanted, didn't tell any of us the drink special, and was totally rude. Not pleased with this service whatsoever.\n\nIf you're ordering to go, great. The food is awesome!
