Another great experience at half moon this Sunday. Mitch took great care of our large group and we took full advantage of the owners party at the next table where they shared fireball shots and birthday cake. We tried the champagne bucket for $12 and the triple starter for $20 deal. The chi fries and chicken strips with garlic fries were great and super filling. Reasonable prices, great drinks, tons of large tv's help make this one of our favorite places to watch football on Sundays
