Vanessa and Haul'n'Ass Productions were absolutely wonderful! We booked them through our venue (honestly, having a beer burro at our wedding was a huge selling point of our venue...), and couldn't have been happier with everything. \n\nThey contacted me a week or so before our wedding (which was right before Christmas) with the option to have our burro wear holiday attire, rather than the typical wedding attire, which we thought was adorable and perfect. \n\nI have been around horses and other equines my entire life, and our burro (Burrito, which is the cutest name ever) was the sweetest, best behaved, and best trained miniature burro I have ever seen, hands down. He was fine with guests loving on him, our photographers adjusting him for great shots, and would not move once I stood next to him in my wedding dress (i.e., so he wouldn't step on my dress). \n\nMy fiance and I also had a couple odd requests--we had Burrito interrupt the beginning of our ceremony to bring us beers, so we could cheers with our officiant and with each other. Vanessa never blinked an eye, and organized everything with our venue coordinator, so she was right on top of our cue, and everything ran perfectly. She was also right on point with the other requests we had made (e.g., taking group pictures afterwards, and couple pictures beforehand with Burrito). Burrito was unconcerned by camera flashes, other lighting apparatuses, and crowds. \n\nHe was a huge hit, was so sweet, and Vanessa was great to work with and so on top of everything! We'd love to have a huge party just to have another beer burro visit!
