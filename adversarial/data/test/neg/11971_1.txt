I've been wanting to try this spot out for a minute. We got there and it wasn't many people there but took forever to get drinks. Hence only 3 stars the service was subpar, I understand the aspect of group serving but they fell short several times. Our appetizers were brought to us and we still us no utensils on the table. When the server finally came back to our table she said she didn't notice. The food was good I ordered the kalbi and the kids opted for sushi. The food was the highlight of the experience for us.
