D&L Press has REFUSED to print a poetry journal that is supposed to be ready for sale tomorrow. They have already completed a first draft print, accepted payment for a one-time setup fee of $50, and confirmed they could meet the deadline of 5pm tomorrow. The exhibition of the journal is at 6pm.....their reason for refusing to do it. \n\nThey are a christian-based company, and the journal had lesbian references in it. It also used the word \"Fuck\", which is apparently enough evidence for a christian to fuck our project over..... \n\nDO NOT SUPPORT THIS COMPANY! They are close-minded and unprofessional. I highly recommend using other companies, and letting this local travesty-of-a-business sink into its own small world. Hopefully their congregation needs tons of print jobs done because they can mark ASU off their list of potential clients.
