Shakes are sometimes made with the improper amount of milk, management is not very personable and in fact are often rude. You feel more like an intruder than a customer, let alone family. The team members are very friendly and remember you and make meaningful conversation.\n\nWhen placing orders online, if I leave allergen specific requests (such as no mushroom, no tomato) in the additional details section, food is still improperly prepared. This has happened on 3 separate visits. Additionally I was assured I would be refunded for a food item I paid for that was not included in my order, and it has been a month with no results. This store has so much potential and unless there is a change in management they will not get the positive feedback that I know they are capable of earning.
