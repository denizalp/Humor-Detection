I had a very nice 1st experience and will definitely go back. I made a 10a mani\/pedi appt. Was greeted and quickly set up to get started on my pedi. I believe Kevin was my nail tech. He did a great job and was helpful in finding a holographic regular polish - as I didn't want acrylic or gel. He was also very nice and funny.\n\nNailPolish - DareToWear\/Stellar Stars & Orly\/Ablaze
