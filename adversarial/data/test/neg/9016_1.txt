My husband and I went here for our date night. We got seated right away (reservation was on a Saturday night at 6:30). We checked in for the free corn tamale and holy moly it was good. I have a sweet tooth so I really enjoyed it. It was like having dessert before dinner. Our server Autumn was great and friendly. She always checked in on us and made sure our water was refilled.\n\nAppetizer: Plantain empanadas- very good not too sweet\nMy entree: Vegan Relleno (I'm not vegan) it was delicious! I loved the sauce \nHusband's entree: Chicken Enchiladas- Hubby said it was really good and plan on ordering it again when we come back.
