Great experience. Make sure to ask for Cyrus he was amazing and made my carpet look brand new. He took his time he was thorough. I was pleased even before he left. The pricing is very reasonable the customer service is amazing was able to call and schedule a cleaning the next day. All in all it was a great experience. I will definitely be recommending carpet monkeys to my friends and family. When you call in ask for Rich. He is very friendly and wants your experience to be nothing short of amazing.
