Sooo.... the last two times I've come here, the service and attention to detail has just disappeared. It's so disappointing because I just paid $35 for a car was that included pet hair removal and they never even opened the trunk.  I just left there, went to the grocery store and this is what I find when I go to put my groceries in.  I could go back but, it's such a waste of my time and I have groceries now to deal with. I'll be looking for a new place to have my car detailed.
