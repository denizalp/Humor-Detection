We ordered a couple of pizzas last night for dinner. The Hawaiian pizza was terrible, tasteless. Not sure what happened, the sauce tasted horrible, we paid for extra jalepenos that had maybe 10 peppers on a large pizza?? They really skimped on the toppings, very little cheese, not enough pineapple and ham. Inedible, had to throw out. Not worth the money we paid!!
