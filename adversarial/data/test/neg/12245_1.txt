Okay. Wait for a Saturday night wasn't terrible: 30 mins. Beer is great, and tons of options. My favorite thing we ordered was the Pierogi flat bread, so good. We got the corn dogs and the pretzel as well, which were good just..not as tasty as the flat bread. My friends got the sausage flat bread and loved it and also really enjoyed their tacos and calamari. I think my least favorite thing about the place is how small the portions were for the prices. Everything is supposed to be shareable which...I don't like to share so... haha.
