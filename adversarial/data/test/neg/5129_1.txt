Been going here since I was small enough to play on the Panda! Look forward to fit every time I'm in the area and there's times I make the 30min commute just to satisfy my Chino Bandido craving!\nJerk fried rice is a must *it is a little extra $ but just change \nEvery main dish is great and the beans are so smooth and flavorful. I rarely like my food to touch as it compromises individual flavor. Any dish here you could eat items individually or all mashed together with er way it phenomenal, it's a little restaurant in a questionable strip mall but they produce magic food that's will bring joy to your tastebuds! If it's your 1st time I recommend you go on a weekend so you can get their chocolate cookie, Yum!\nIt's a little pricey but in comparison to the portions, I can eat on my bowl w\/ 2 meats for 2 days. I just have to tell my brain to stop eating or I stuff myself it's soooo good! \nStaff is always friendly and never seems unhappy to be there, very nice energy in this place. Life long favorite of the valley
