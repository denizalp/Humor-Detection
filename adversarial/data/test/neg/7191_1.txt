I came not knowing what to expect. I've been to a few of these types of Japanese dinners - omakase, the sake pairing was really good. I can't even decide OMA favorite as the majority of picks were amazing. A few that I remember- the smoked bonito, the tuna and toro, mackerel, and egg were AMAZING. I would definitely go with the sake paring. The Dasai 50 and the plum wine were my favorite. They ran out of nigiri tonight which was too bad. \nMove talk a great meal. Way cheaper than going to Kaji.
