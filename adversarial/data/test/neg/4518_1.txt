I'm so happy to have found this company! They cleared out my patio in less than 20 minutes! Eric did everything he said he would do and then some. He was fast, professional and courteous. It was an effortless and transparent transaction. I would highly recommend Super Junk Removal to anyone needing garbage removal.
