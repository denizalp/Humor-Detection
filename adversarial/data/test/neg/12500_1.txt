The food is somewhere between ok and good, so I rounded up to 4 stars due to the friendly service at the register.  I had the spicy avocado and lime kale and grain bowl.  As with other raw kale dishes, chewing the kale was a tiring experience.  There was a lot of it and it is not the easiest thing to chew.  I guess I wasn't expecting it to be salad-like, but it had good flavor.  I also sampled the strawberry banana smoothie, which tasted as expected.  Tried the baked french fries as well.  Eh, I guess this is why people don't bake them.  Overall it is a perfectly fine lunch stop.
