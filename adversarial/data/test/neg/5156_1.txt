We've been with this co. for 2 years in our rental and have had great experiences with Linda Wong.  Will be buying and moving out mid May  so we will update the review at that time as I see some people have had bad experiences getting security deposits back. So far so good though!  Highly recommended working with Linda and 1st Priority Realty!
