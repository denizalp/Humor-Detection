This Hyatt is located right off the airport in a convenient location. The hotel was available for $89\/night. This hotel also offers complimentary breakfast from 6 - 10am daily.\n\nThe check in process was fairly smooth and the front desk agent was friendly to greet us in. While walking in the hallway, we could see signs of wear and tear. Into the room, the things were well organized...no complaints there. The room setup was a little skewed. The TV was placed to the side and it was very difficult to watch it from the bed. The bathroom was showing signs of extreme wear and it was in real need of renovation. Now it made sense as to why the room was available for $89!\n\nThis hotel definitely needs to be renovated before it comes on par with other Hyatt hotels. For a nights stay for $89, it wasn't bad. But it kind of pulls down the Hyatt name.
