Had high hopes for this place but unfortunately it fell short. I mean don't get me wrong it was decent food but not a place I am able to rave about or even a place that I would try a second time. I had the chicken shawarma bowl. The chicken tasted pretty good but was overshadowed by way too much lettuce and my bowl was filled with a lot of the bitter pieces. Overall, not a bad place to go but I've definitely had better
