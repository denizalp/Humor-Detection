I've been trying to find a place comparable to Troy Mediterranean Grill after they closed down two years ago. The food here is good. This is my second time coming here. I wouldn't come back though. Although the food is good, they give you small portions for the amount that they charge. I can go else where for larger portion and same price. Nothing really strikes an interest for me.
