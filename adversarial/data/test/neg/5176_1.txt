3.5 stars\/5, I was literally in and out in 15 mins. Gel manicure- $28. The price is pretty decent. The lady that did my nails was very quick and didn't pay too much attention to detail. I'm not usually fussy when it comes to my nails because no one's going to stare at them but if you're OCD about them, I suggest going to a different place. If I hold my nails up to the light, I can see inconsistencies in the polish with each nail and my left thumb is half matte because it wasn't cured properly under the UV light. I only noticed it when I went outside (it's very dark in the salon) and she had already taken another client, so I let it slide. I would come back again though because of the price, the rewards program and how quickly it was done.
