This place is always good, chopped liver and potato pancakes are my favorite thing. The variety of the menu is great the bagels are good, the cream cheese selection is great as well. I'm not a fan of the service as it's inconsistent, one visit it's great and other visit it's awful. \n\nThe cookies are not good, black & white cookie is more like cake and the chocolate chip big cookie is beyond dry I could probably break drywall with it.. but the cakes I've tried are pretty tasty. \n\nOverall, avoid the cookies, everything else on the menu is good and beware of inconsistent service
