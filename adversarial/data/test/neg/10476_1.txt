This is a very long overdue review, but I wanted to share the experience I had with them. This place preys on desperate people with bad credit who wouldn't typically get approved from a traditional dealership. They will approve ANYONE in my opinion. They have very limited car options. I'm talking like 4-5 actual cars for sale. The cars are insanely overpriced and they mention how the cars are 4 times the Kelly Blue Book value, due to them selling you credit improvement services, vs just selling you a car. They film you when you sign the 2 hour long contract. They forced me into automatic payments from my checking account. I paid $1k down, plus $250 every 2 weeks for a 7 year old  vehicle that had a kbb value of $4K, but I was going to pay $24k after 4 years of payments and OUTRAGEOUS interest rates. The car broke down within the first 2 weeks of owning it, and when I went to make an appointment with the service department to get it fixed, they told me they were really busy and it would take 2-3 weeks to start working on my car. I had my boyfriend's Dad fix it for me instead. Another month later and the car broke down again. They masked the odor when it was on their lot. Once you started the ac, the car would overwhelm with the smell of urine. It was very embarrassing and impossible to remove. There is no grace period for late payments. I ended up removing the tracking device and enjoying the car for another 2 months before the piece of shit broke down again, and then I parked it out front of my house, and it was gone within an hour. I was parking it elsewhere before that. They would have fake detectives call me and my references, telling them I could get charged with grand theft auto for tampering with the gps device when I signed a contract saying not to. They never reported anything to the credit bureaus for me. Not at all for the 6 months of positive payments that I did make on the car, nor did they report negatively to the credit bureaus when they repossessed the vehicle. So, no repo on my credit. It was an interesting experience. I personally think this company is a scam. Go to Aloha Used Cars, I highly recommend them. They have nice cars there with low mileage and quick payment plans, plus cheap service fees.
