This was recommended by our sushi chef from kabuto. I love the interior of this place! It is 12 seater tea place and this is good for intimate conversations with your friends.There is also a section for ceremonial tea! Don't forget the dessert thats is made from roasted sesame seed( if im not mistaken) . This place is good for after dinner tea.
