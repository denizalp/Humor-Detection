Decided to give Fernando's a second try last weekend after leaving one of the campus bars.\n\nThis time I opted for a steak burrito.\n\nI was a little disappointed that they didn't have or were out of pastor\/pork, I really liked my pork taco last time I was in.\n\nThis time was a little better, the burrito was better than the taco I got last time. The steak on this burrito was actually steak, and not ground beef, so that was an improvement.\n\nUnfortunately the burrito comes at a cost of $7. I think this is too expensive. For $7 I think I could get not only more food, but better quality food at Chipotle or for even less money, Maize.\n\nNot bad.
