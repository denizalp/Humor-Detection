As Elaine M. wrote, good things come in small packages! We found them on Yelp! as well, and as of now, could not be HAPPIER with this AWESOME husband and wife Team! I've worked in Construction Management before and understand how Sub-Contractors can be, I have ran across a few I wish would fall off the face of the earth! But not these guys! I wish they would go around and Train other Sub's!!\nThey have a GREAT showroom, not terribly big, but great! Great selection of tiles, wood, laminates and carpeting. There's not a whole lot different from them and others product wise. And their pricing is awesome. But what makes them AMAING is their Service. On point. On time. Always pleasant and fun. And just a great sense of honesty and pride!\nHere's what I also love about them. Just because they may not have what you want or unable to obtain it for you, they will refer to where you could find it and if they can, they will offer to buy it at the Contractor's price. They won't make you feel bad for finding product somewhere else and will still install it for you. Which is awesome, cause if their work is anything like their Service, our floors are gonna look AWESOME!\n\nI'll post pictures once we're done.
