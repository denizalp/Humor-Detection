I recently had a miss-understanding and an unfortunate experience at this location. I went home and sent a note on the subway website. This location has an incredibly high rating and I understand why. I got a call from the franchise owner within 7 hours. It's apparent that this restaurant is committed to excellence and serves its community with dignity and honor. Thank you for the call, for what it's worth, it ment a lot and I felt compelled to share with the community.
