It is a small showroom: capacity capped clearly at under 1000. \n\nIt has a reasonably decent soundsystem. I always protect my priceless hearing with \"true-to-the-ear\" hearing plugs. It can get pretty loud in here for a rock show, especially when considering how small the room is, so protect your hearing. \n\n-----------------------------------------\nPublic Service Announcement: Hearing loss is permanent and currently irreversible. \n-----------------------------------------\n\nI have heard Foghat x2, Mitzi Gaynor x2, The Osmonds x2, Robert Cray, Lee Ann Womack, Paula Poundstone x2, Frank Caliendo, Billy Gardell, Kevin Nealon, Bob Saget, Rob Schneider, and seen an international magic convention competition in the Orleans Showroom\n\nBox office is fast to distribute tickets; ushers are quick to seat you; and, for the shows where people want to stand up near the stage, it is permitted. Plenty of space in between aisles: unless that is, you are Manute Bol. \n\nRestrooms are outside of the venue, to your immediate left, upon exit on the Southern-most door (in the Keno area). \n\nThere is a bar, but I have never partaken. Don't drink and drive. - E
