This place is so cool!\n\nThe owners are great. The guy told me the place was Creole inspired, he's from Nawlins. I minored in French, I was a little excited thinking I'd get to use it. \n\nI got free samples of their baguette and a locally made goat cheese. \n\nI got one of their Cinnamon French Toast marscapones. It was really good! \n\nI came here during their soft open. Their grand opening is July 9th. \n\nI'd definitely come back!
