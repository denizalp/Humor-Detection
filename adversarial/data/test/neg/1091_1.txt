Had a frustrating experience the last time I dined with this restaurant but Bruce (owner) convinced me to return and give it another shot. Staff was phenomenally kind and understanding of the previous situation. Food came out hastily and hot. Waited no more than 10 minutes for a takeout order. Food tasted absolutely delicious and exceeded my expectations.  Will definitely be coming back again! \n\nDefinitely made up for my previous visit.
