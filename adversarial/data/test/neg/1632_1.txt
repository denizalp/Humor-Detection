What an awesome little restaurant.  We sure loved the ambiance here. Their burger is very good too.  We ordered three Tamago burger combo and a Kinoko combo.  The tamago burger is excellent.  The egg, the fine onion strings, great patty, delicious sauces and soft bun worked really well together.  It was love at first bite.  I took a bite of the Kinoko burger which had shitake mushrooms, pickled red ginger, and the same sauce as tamago (terikyaki and wasabi mayo) it's okay.  The realy winner here is the Tamago.  Note that the burger is pretty big and if you are not a big eater you can share it.  If you are a group not everyone need to order the combo as the serving of fries is huge and can be shared.  They ask you for a fun unique nickname for your order...how cute it that? The d√©cor is very hip with art for sale but an incredible artist.  See the photos I posted.
