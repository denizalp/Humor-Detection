I gotta say this place was delicious. From Burgers to Hot Dogs and Chilli Fries and their Custard!! Was So good. The Sirloin Steak they used for their burgers gives them a unique taste and theres a nice crust from the grill so it gives the burger their distinct taste. Shoestring fries were different like super skinny mcdonalds fries. So i will be back to eat here for sure and i put this burger up there with In n Out. Still In n out has a slight edge with grilled bun
