This starbucks is great! I come here all the time to study or just chill out. The staff at this location is friendly, and they commonly will have free samples to give out :)\nWhat I love most is the seating, theres a lot of different chair varieties,  and you'll pretty much be guaranteed a spot to sit in if you're looking to stay!
