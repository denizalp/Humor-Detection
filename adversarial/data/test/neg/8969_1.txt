Was just in the office.. told I didn't have mold and made me feel really bad about having them stay a whole 17 mins pass 5 like get over your self you two! Mold or not don't make your residents feel like a jackass. Worse office people around and couldn't say anything better about the people who supposedly run the show AMC. What a joke
