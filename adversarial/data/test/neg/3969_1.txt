My favorite airport I've ever been too. Flying in and out of LAS is so easy. I love that they have Uber\/Lyft pickup. Makes traveling 100% easier and more fun. Stay away from the taxis= expensive\/unfriendly and the bus, buses that run to the strip are frustrating to get. Took under for my first time and I loved it, great way to see the strip.
