We had dinner there on 10\/15\/16 at about 515pm. The place was packed inside and out. Friendly staff and  reasonably good service. I had the meatball dinner\/appetizer which cost $12. It was OK as far as taste but really was overpriced for the amount you get. It was more expensive than a dinner.\nI also had the Meatloaf TV Dinner to go. IT was a disappointment even though it was priced right $11. Meatloaf\nwas very below par with little taste and a bit dry.\nI was hoping they would be special and they arent. New booths and new high top table and chairs and a few more TVs in bar and dining area. The dining and bar is the same config as Whiskey Rose. Whats different is the entrance location comes directly into the dining area which opens it up but at 5pm or so the sunset blinds everyone near the entrance.. Also the patio is open directly into dining area. Two garage doors enable the patio entrance to be opened or closed which is nice.\nHopefully they upgrade their food. \nI may give it another chance but no meatballs or meatloaf dinner.
