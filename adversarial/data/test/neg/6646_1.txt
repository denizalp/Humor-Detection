The service here was fantastic! The person on the phone was very friendly and helpful.  When I went in to pick up the generator we reserved, the counter help was the same and the person from the phone recognized my name (from 3 days earlier) and came over to say hello.  When I got the generator,  I realized I hadn't reserved the right size. They didn't have what I needed, but within 5 minutes they had found one nearby from another company and had it held for me - and did so happily.\nThe didn't get my actual business, but they totally got my respect. They will be first on my list next time I need a rental.  Kudos to them!
