Passed by the restaurant many times. Did not stop in because the name of the restaurant and the on line menu did not look good to me. I was wrong! I really enjoyed eating here. The Lunch was fantastic. I had the Bison Enchiladas. It was so good. I will be back here for lunch and dinner.\n\nDay 2 for dinner. I think I like this place
