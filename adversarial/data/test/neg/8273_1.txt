I have had Eric work on my living quarters horse trailer and a used pop-up camper that I just bought. Eric is super responsive, called me back with some \"things to try\" before he came over and had parts in hand when he showed up exactly when he said he would. I would give Eric 6 stars if that was an option. I would recommend him to any and all for any trailer repairs or maintenance. His prices were very fair and reasonable. Such a relief to find such a nice, reliable, knowledgeable, fair technician. You are one-in-a-million these days Eric! Thank you for your fantastic service!
