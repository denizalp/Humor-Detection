Breakfast is the most important meal of the day!!  \n\nI normally always order the same meal, eggs benedict & the potatoes are my favorite. Yes the restaurant is usually busy inside and outside seating, I normally try to order my food-to-go. So if you decide to come in, be there early or be ready to wait a few moments till a table clears up. I think another location is needed near Chandler, Az area-- just sayin.....
