Yay cider!!  A couple of different kinds of cider!!  Patio dining is available at a table or at the bar, and the bar is strategically designed to allow for people watching. We didn't eat here, but the menu had several nice offerings. We just came for cider-and it was delicious. Don't ignore the wait staff! They are chatty and knowledgable, not just about Old Port but also little areas to check out in neighbouring villages. So all-in-all, fun, refreshing, and informative.
