We had a blast as always! But our bay host\/ server CHANDLER was by far the highlight of our night! He was super attentive and felt like one of the crew as soon as he welcomed us! He also made sure we were being safe and had sober rides home! We love you Chandler!! And Adrian was a top notch 2nd in command!
