Hubs and I used to frequent this place when we lived closer, but now that we have moved, it's rare for us to visit....but every time we visit, we are never disappointed.  We actually have never ordered sushi there but have come for the korean food.  Their kalbi is always meaty and flavorful.  We also order the mandu gook soup which is a dumpling soup with noodles and a delicious light broth.  Their \"free\" side dishes are always delightful, too.  My favorite are the fish cakes and potato cakes.  The little man for some reason, always loves to eat the soy bean sprouts.  We also will usually order the dolsot bibimbap - the korean fried rice in a stone pot.  Oh so delicious. Now I want to go there and eat some Korean food.  The service there is always awesome.  I think it's a brother\/sister that work the front and the parents are the cooks.  But both siblings are super nice and always remember us even if it's been a long time since we've been back. Maybe someday I'll try the sushi if I'm not always craving the Korean food so much!
