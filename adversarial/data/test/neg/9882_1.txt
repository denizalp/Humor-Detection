I originally came to Dr. Meyers for general dentistry at which time I came to find out I still had a metal filling in my teeth from when I was young. We talked about the long-term effects of this on my overall health and I felt understood. He really is an expert in the holistic field, which makes him a dentist and so much more. After this discussion, of course I wanted this taken out safely and properly and Dr. Meyers was the perfect DDS for the job. Right off the bat he made me feel safe and comfortable. His office is clean, light, friendly, happy and the staff was incredibly kind. All in all, I would highly recommend him and the whole Millennium Dental Team!!!
