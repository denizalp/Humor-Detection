This was a nice and clean room and so was the exterior. The neighbourhood is sketchy though! \nThe annoying thing is they claim to have a microwave and fridge in the rooms. We got there and the room didn't have either one. I called the front desk and was told it's an extra $30! \nSomeone's review said the cleaners chit chat loudly in the hallways...they were NOT lying! We stayed there for 2 nights and each morning around 8am we were woken up to ladies chit chatting loudly across the hall while cleaning..despite having a do not disturb sign on our door!! \nThey did have a coffee maker and coffee in the room.\nIt was a nice place but for that price, spend your money where you can get free breakfast included! Breakfast is only included in the breakfast package which is way more than just the price for a room!
