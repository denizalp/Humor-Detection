Wow! Worth every penny!  Flawless performance and amazing choreography!  The acrobats were amazing and the band was just unbelievable - especially the drummer!  I saw Mystere years ago and I don't remember it being this good!  My kids and I were just mesmerized the entire time. Lots of eye candy going on everywhere the entire time!  My new number 1 show in Vegas!
