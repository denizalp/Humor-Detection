My second time here. Always been great. Was expecting it to be super crowded for a Sunday at noon, but I hardly had to wait. \n\nHad the Chipotle breakfast burrito which was great, accompanied with a great cold brew coffee. Sat around and read a book for an hour in a lively environment. Definitely coming back. Turn up!
