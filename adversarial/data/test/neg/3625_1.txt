This my second visit to Sabai  in less than a month! Why? simply because it is better than over a dozen Thai places I  have had in Phoenix! On my first visit, I ordered the Green Curry, plenty of flavor with the right consistency of sauce. I could tell they use fresh ingredients. On my second visit, I was more confident in their food that I ordered the Pad Thai. It was delicious!  The service is excellent and the restaurant is clean.  So if your picky about your Thai food like me, give Sabai a try! FYI:  Sabai has two location one in Tempe (broadway)  and one in Phoenix (Thomas and 42nd)
