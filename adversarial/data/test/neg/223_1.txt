I wanted to love this place but it wasn't all that great.  The interior wasn't inviting or comfortable in anyway. I got the sense it's the same regulars that occupy the bar top.  The patio is where it's at but you're SOL during the summer months.  I thought the beer selection was lacking as well, I've heard its pretty stellar but maybe we came on an off day.
