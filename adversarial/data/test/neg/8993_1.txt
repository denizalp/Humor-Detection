Wow.  To say the least, I was overwhelmed by the size and selection of this place, but I mean overwhelmed in a good way!\n\nAny bottle of alochol that I have even seen featrured on the internet as being rare or different was in this place.  Bacon vodka, PB and J, a wide and endless variety of wine.  They even had wine tastings right when you walked into the door.  \n\nI already cannot wait to go back.  I don't think my local wine and spirits store will ever fulfuill my needs after going here.
