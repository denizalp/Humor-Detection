the menu here is not as extensive as it is at D's, but the quality is better and the options are plenty good enough. get the pittsburgh hot dog (with pierogi and cole slaw) to really embrace the local flavor. \n\nalso: the hours are really meant to serve to downtown business crowd (10-3 on week days only), but there's free wifi and a friendly staff to serve you your dog.
