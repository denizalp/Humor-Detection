I feel like being review #796 is a bit overkill, but what the heck.  Part of the reason why I got suckered in to this brunch was the fact that it had so many reviews.  Maybe I'm helping to sucker in someone else.\n\nI'm hoping the fact that I was not here on a weekend is what explains the mediocre food.  Yes, there is a large selection, but I was not truly impressed by any of it.  I also asked for a glass of champagne, since its not included in the $19.95 weekday buffet, only to be warned by the waitress that a glass of champagne is $10!!  $10?!?  Are you kidding me?  Don't worry...if you want to add a splash of OJ and make it a mimosa, its $15!!  I thanked the waitress for the heads-up and stuck with diet coke.\n\nThe service was by far the best part of this buffet.  Our waitress was right there to pick up our dirty plates, and fill our sodas.  Don't worry, I still stuffed myself silly to get my money's worth, but next time I'm heading over to the Mirage for Cravings Buffet.  I ate there a couple years ago, and remember being much more impressed.
