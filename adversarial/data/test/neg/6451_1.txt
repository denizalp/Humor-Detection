We got there at 5 we were only table there, should have been a warning sign. We were a party of five. We had spinach artichoke, ok I think costco ' s is better. Also calamari, the calamari should have been tossed from freezer 6 months ago. It was dried like jerky. One person said her chicken was ok. My wife got the beef stew pasta. To much sugar she didnt even eat half. My son got the clams with pasta. He ate the clams. My daughter and I had the lasagna. OK we were only table early, my sauce on the lasagna was covering the the plastic wrap they cooked on it. When we left the host asked how was it. Really bad,. The service was outstanding not the food. No plate cleaners nobody even got passed half way.
