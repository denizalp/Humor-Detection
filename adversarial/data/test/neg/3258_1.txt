Savatore's is still our favorite pizza place in the area. Hands down the best. \n\nWe stick with the Fat Uncle Tony. Enough for two to share with some left over. Fresh, local ingredients. We have both eaten in the restaurant and done pickup and delivery. We now live in Sun Prairie and thankfully are in their delivery area. \n\nThey get busy, so it used to be an issue calling to place and order. But, now they have a new online system that we will have to try. And, the new location is great.\n\nBut realize, that your dining options are limited in Sun Prairie. Plus, this place has a great reputation. So, if you are just showing up for dinner you may have a wait. :)
