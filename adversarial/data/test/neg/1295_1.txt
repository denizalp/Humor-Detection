I had to meet someone at this Cracked Egg location a few weeks back. I had already formed an opinion of the chain based on another Cracked Egg that I visited. HOWEVER, I was blown away at the entire experience. \n\nThe servers are funny, personable and engaging, the food is great and the decor was perfect. I had such a positive experience that i went back several times on my own since the first visit and even had a meeting there. \n\nAfter having been there several times now, I can say that I have had the same great experience every time. The management must have a great system in place to train the servers and cooks to provide a consistent high level of customer experience. \n\nI just cannot say too many good things about this Cracked Egg.
