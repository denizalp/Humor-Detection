Last time I was in town my family tried to go to Momocho without a reservation (duh..) and the friendly hostess recommended we try SOHO.  I'm so glad she did!  We all enjoyed our meals and will definitely be back for seconds another time.  The special veggie menu made my heart smile and my belly happy.  My sister was especially pleased with the low country boil.
