Chris came out to our house and impressed us with how open and flexible he was to all our ideas. We then met him in their well appointed showroom and walked us through all the features available. We never once felt pressured or like we were being sold anything we didn't want. In fact, Chris kept up with all our design and detail changes with a smile and engaged information about color, design, wear and value. Very happy with their service and would absolutely recommend.
