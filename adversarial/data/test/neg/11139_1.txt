I came here for the prix fixe lunch and I can say that I'm not impressed. Their prix fixe lunch comes with two options for appetizer, main, and dessert. All in all, not at all impressed with the food. The complementary bread basket with the hummus was quite tasty but this was probably the best part of the meal. The gnocchi was mushy and in the Arabbiata that tasted like canned tomato sauce. The presentation was not at all appealing and I felt like I was eating a pasta dish you'd expect to find on an airplane. The creme brulee was soggy, didn't have the crisp top, and overly sweet. Service was also extremely lacking as no one came to check up on our lunch and we had to flag down another server to get our bill because our original server was no where to be seen.
