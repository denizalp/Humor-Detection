$12.99 for their weekend breakfast, or as they call it \"champagne brunch\" even though we didn't drink any champagne. The Main Street Station was the cheapest weekend Buffet I could find in the Fremont\/Downtown area. It was ok... Good for the price, but just ok. The scrambled eggs were on the soft side, no other style eggs available; potatoes o'Brian, no hash browns; I didn't eat any of he meat but saw bacon, sausage, and fried chicken. They had pancakes, French toast and cheese blintz which were good. I even tried the fried-rice and shrimp-stir-fry which were surprisingly good. I also tried the bread pudding for \"desert\" and it was pretty good. Service was a bit lacking. We arrived around 10:30am and waited about 30 minutes in line and another 10 minutes after paying to be seated. We had to wait about 15 minutes once we got to our seat to order coffee, the cups were small and the staff wasn't attentive at filling the drinks (they may have been understaffed, not their fault).
