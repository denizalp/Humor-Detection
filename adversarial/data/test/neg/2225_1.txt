Excellent service. Quickly sat us down and gave me suggestions of food and drinks to try. We had this rib tri like appetizer and it was yummy especially with the blue cheese sauce. Fried chicken with the honey hot sauce is mouth watering. And the collard greens and Mac n cheese are delicious. My favorite was the peach cobbler. Must try!
