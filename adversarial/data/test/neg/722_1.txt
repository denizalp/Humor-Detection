Hi, I went to Bulk Barn today and waited in line to pay. When it was my turn, I was not acknowledged by the cashier. So I said hello to the clerk and she clearly heard me but did not even respond back. I was taken aback as this was extremely rude. She then muttered the amount that I had to pay. I gave her the money. She threw the change back in my hand and still did not say thank you or even acknowledge my existence. Since this is a retail store in the customer service industry, I was shocked at the extremely rude service. As a paying customer we deserve to be treated better!
