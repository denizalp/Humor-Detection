I always turn to Not Just Noodles when I'm too lazy to cook at home and want Chinese food without spending big bucks. It is steps away from my home so I always get takeout from there (I'm always lazy).\n\nI've only eaten in at the restaurant once as their decor isn't really flattering to their food. They have pretty good dishes there but I would not recommend getting dim sum from there, it just does not feel authentic. Other than their dim sum, everything else is pretty good. With their price, its a steal!\n\nNote: They accept credit cards but charge a small handling fee.
