I've recently moved to the West Tropicana area, and I just wanted to drop a few lines to say thanks to Vinny and the crew at Payless Pizza #2 and Ribs for consistently going out of their way to make sure I'm happy! The food is super tasty, the ingredients are quality, and the prices are VERY reasonable! Whether you're in the mood for Pizza, BBQ\/Roasted Chicken, Fried Fish\/Fried Chicken, or Burgers. Payless Pizza #2 and Ribs is by far the best in The West Trop area! Also, lookout for Vinny's Combo Meals!! Here's just a few: Chicken and Ribs, Fried Chicken and Ribs, Fried Fish and Ribs, and Fried Fish and Fried Chicken. All of these come with Fries, and a side dish.\n\nAlso, if you really want to try something different, and you like things like Collard Greens and Kale. Tell Vinny to add a side of Broccoli Rabe (Rapini) to your order. It's seasoned right, garlicky, and just a little spicy. I order it every time I'm there!
