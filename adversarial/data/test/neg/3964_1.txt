My friend always orders from here but I have yet to have a good experience. First tome we ordered from uber eats and the second time we sat at the restaurant. As for uber eats, let's just say that their sushi doesn't travel well. Their sushi pizza (which is supposed to be crispy rice with raw salmon on it) had soggy rice and the salmon had cooked because it was out on the rice when it was still warm. The other sushi just was nothing special. When we sat there it just got worse. Their servers have no idea what is on their menu. I pointed at a picture that was not marked as an item and the server couldn't figure out what it was. Then I asked the difference between two salmon sashimi options and they had no idea. When the salmon did come out I literally had to spit it out. Was not fresh at all. I'm going to avoid it here.
