So I hadn't heard of Fat Tuesdays and when I brought it up my friends acted all surprised as it was supposedly a pretty well known thing. We decided to go here to try it out since we were on the Miracle Mile shops anyways.\n\nWe somehow decided that it would be a good idea to order the gigantic portion (I think it's 100 ounces) where it's so huge you get a strap to hold it. It cost about $36 and we added 4 extra shots to it for $1 each.\n\nI got the strawberry and mango mixed together and my friends got the peach Bellini. I liked mine but after the first quarter or so it got to be way too sweet for me to handle. My friends was much better as it wasn't overly sweet and so it was easier to keep sipping.\n\nIt ended up being way too much for me and even when we shared it, it didn't end up getting finished. Overall though it was a lot of fun and lasted for a long time, though my stomach was pretty full for a while.
