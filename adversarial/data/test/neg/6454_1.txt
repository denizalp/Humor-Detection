I ordered 2 large pizza's because they have a great deal going. My boyfriend and I eat pizza about once a week. I'd like to think I'm a connoisseur of pizza. Decided to order Dominos for something different. Pizza was doughy almost raw. Nasty tasting sauce and no flavor. Took a big bite and spit it out. I've never done that with pizza before. My boyfriend tried to put ranch, and hot sauce to make his taste better. Honestly was the worst pizza we've ever had. I immediately called the manager back. He kindly asked if I wanted something else. We decided on an order of hot wings, Italian sandwich, and a Philly. I was a bit reluctant to try anything else. The wings and sandwiches were alright. So this dominos can make mediocre sandwiches, wings, but horrible pizza hmmm? I was pleased with the manager and his attempt to make things right. This is the only reason for giving two stars. Will I order from them again NO.
