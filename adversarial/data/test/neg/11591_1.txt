We arrived after 9p.m. so got the 2nd happy hour! basically ordered appetizers (Ahi tuna tacos,barbacoa tacos, mahi mahi tacos and Queso Laredo) and Margaritas,Everything  we got was very good and perfect for a late dinner. Still had to take home leftovers and didn't break the bank! The Hostess Devyn was also our waitress probably due to the time of day. She was extremely friendly, attentive and helpful
