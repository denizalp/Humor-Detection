This is my favorite commercial movie theater.  The biggest draw for me is 1) location and 2) hot cinnamon and sugar donuts!  They always have a large selection of movies due to the many many screens.  A big plus is that, unlike the Point, they take debit cards at the ticket line AND at the treat counter.  Make me wanna buy lotsa candy.
