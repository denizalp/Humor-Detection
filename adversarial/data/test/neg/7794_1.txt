I've gone to this place before and had great service but tonight was a different story. The young guy that was serving us changed our coals once, during at two to three hour stay, after we asked and reminded him several times. He had an attitude the entire time and when we tried to make some conversation with him, he gave us short blunt answers. We watched him service ever single table but ours for at least 30 minutes. I would normally recommend this place but this visit is making think about different places to go.
