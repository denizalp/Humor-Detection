Wow! What a pleasant surprise! First off, if you aren't looking for this gem, you'd pass right by. The staff is incredibly welcoming and it's definitely a family environment. We ordered a carne asada burrito and the Chicago fries. The carne asada was also fresh and so tender\/ juicy and the burrito was grilled to perfection. The Chicago fries had fresh fries that were cooked to order. I'm just blown away by how amazing and fresh their food is. Please stop by, you won't regret it!
