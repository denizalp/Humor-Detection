I was fasting from midnight to 8:30am they were supposed to draw my blood then give me the glucose drink but they gave me the drink before drawing blood making my test invalid so I have to come back Monday and retake and my sister gave me a ride here she's at school until 11am that's what time my appointment would've been over because I was supposed to be here for three hr glucose and my mom is at work so My choices are be stranded here for three hours or pay for an Uber to my moms job (28$) so I can get our house and her car keys. This is my first pregnancy it's been very stressful due to having gallstones , hg and anemia I lost 14 lbs in my first trimester and my baby is measuring two weeks ahead and he's already weighing 4lbs so if I wasn't already stressed enough they add messing up my glucose test to my list. This all could've been avoided had the nurse read my chart to see what blood test was being ordered .
