This place is very good. Prices are on point and you get a very big hot dog. They have many varieties of dogs including your favorites. They have sides such as fries, deep fried pickles and other things. The hot dogs are large in themselves and I believe are Vienna beef dogs. My only complaint that could turn these great dogs into fantastic dogs would be to do away with the grill and charbroil the hot dogs.. that would make the flavor go from like a 7 to a 10\/10
