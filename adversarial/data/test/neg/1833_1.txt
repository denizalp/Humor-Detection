The server was nice. I had small chocolate yogurt with mochi topping, and my boyfriend had flying monkey boba. My boyfriend says his boba is alright. I like that the server put a lot of mochi toppings on mine, but I wish they had more flavors to choose from. My boyfriend likes it here because it's cheap... Duh! I like the yogurt place in Town Square more, but if we're lazy to get out of the neighborhood, I guess we'll go back here again.
