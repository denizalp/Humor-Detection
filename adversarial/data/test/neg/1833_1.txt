So, I found the cheesecake truly exceptional.  I got the carrot cake cheesecake and my friend got something with white chocolate.  Both were phenomenal and we will both be going back to try their other cheesecakes. \n\nNow, as for everything else we tried, they were good.  They have all the regular fare that you'd find at a chain restaurant and some fun items. My personal favourite appetizer is the southern fried chicken slider.  They were tender and juicy, and all of the topping really complimented the chicken.  \n\nNone of the entrees I tried were mind blowing but nothing I would complain about either. \n\nThe drinks and the service were the cherries on top for me. My cosmopolitan was made perfectly and the servers were tipped well, thanks to their attentive and thoughtful nature. \n\nI will be going back to this location to try out some more of the menu. \n\nLastly, I went at around 4:30 on a weekday and got a table right away.
