Agreed - the butter chicken is superb! I came here for a quick, solo, late afternoon lunch (2PM) and had their lunch buffet. It was still stocked, though (of course) not as fresh as it was at 11AM when it opens. Still, I saw them rotating the dishes, so they seem to keep it as fresh as possible. All varieties of dishes - vegetarian, beef, chicken, I may be crazy, but I think I may have seen pork too. Anyway, it's imperative to try to the Butter Chicken. Best ever.
