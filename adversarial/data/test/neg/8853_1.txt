This company advertised that they will give you training on many accounting programs and there will be job opportunities for those who do well. However, the job opportunities is not real and they only say that to entice customers to enroll with them. Their services is not worth anyone's money, it is better to enroll in school than spent your money with any of their \"training courses\".\n\nThey also said that there will be 40-60 hours of real work experience but this is not the case. They will only give you documents of their past clients and a computer and you can do whatever you like with the documents. \n\nI enrolled on one of their \"trainings\" and study really hard to get \"good grades\" because of the job opportunities they offer to excelling students but I end up being yelled at and threatened that they will not recommend me to any employers because I could not follow simple instructions. They forgot I am a paying customer. If I could not follow simple instructions, it is their job to cure it not terrorize me.\n\nDo not spend a single dollar with any of their \"trainings\". It is a complete rip off.
