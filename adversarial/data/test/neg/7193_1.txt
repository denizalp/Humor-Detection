I was born and raised here in the valley and have had the opportunity to see many shows and this by far is one of the most AMAZING shows I have seen on the strip. \n\nFirst .. This theatre is wonderful in that there are truly no bad seats in the house. You hear this sentiment all the time but in this case its 100% true. \n\nSecond... There are always really good deals for this show. Between vegas.com, half price tickets or even Mandalay Bay themselves there are always deals here and there which a great deal always makes me happy so.. Score one for discount pricing.\n\nThird and Final tip... The way they interpreted and executed some scenes from the movie to the stage were just wonderful. The masks, the costumes, for the adult were just abstract enough to really look artistic and spot on for children to still enjoy the show.. I was mesmerized..
