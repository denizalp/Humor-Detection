It was pretty empty when I went in today, around 2 pm, but seems like a nice place - decor is sort of southern jazz music and food is a mix of chicken and waffle centric food and mexican food. I had the chicken and waffle dinner with the fried chicken breast (boneless, but it was not dry at all). It was about $11 and also came with a waffle and some coleslaw (you can get coleslaw or mashed potatoes), and some peppery cream gravy that was quite good - when I go back I'm going to replace the waffle in the chicken dinner with the mashed potatoes and I would go ahead and ask for extra cream gravy, right from the start. \n\nThe restaurant was empty when I was there (I was the only patron about 2 pm on a Sunday) - so I hope that is not indicative of the usual crowd level. While the food is good a crossover of a southern focused chicken and waffles and Mexican food feels like an odd cultural mishmash, just due to the decor - and they need to turn down the fans a bit as it was a bit windy at the table due to the high speed of the fans.\n\nI don't know the sales of this place but I would encourage a bit of a menu make over - put a chicken fried steak on the menu (the place already has the cream gravy and the flowering and wash for the chicken), I would also emphasize the cocktails (they have a full bar) and promote some vintage ones - and add some more Southern themed items - fried green tomatoes, cornbread, hush puppies, maybe even some catfish - an all you can eat Friday catfish might not be a bad idea. I would encourage management\/ownership to look at the menu of Southern Rail and I would also look to Mrs. White's golden rule cafe. There are plenty of places for good Mexican food in Tempe but you have to travel a bit, from my experience, to get good Southern food. \n\nHere's my question for the owners - who is your target audience? Based on the menu, I'm not quite sure they have that answer down.
