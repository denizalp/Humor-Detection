This place was highly recommended by my neighborhood group so my expectation was high. Sadly, I did not find this to be an exceptional restaurant. Both my and my husband's filet was ordered medium and both came out so well done it was like chewing leather. The twice baked potato was burnt to a crisp at the bottom as well.The drinks are so overpriced too.  Luckily our out of town friend's meals were ok but we won't be going back.
