This is based on one delivery...\n\nI ordered a cheeseburger to split between my kids and some orders of french fries for them. The fries were great. The burger was good enough it seems. The fried chicken maybe comes down to preference. I liked the breading choice they used but some may not. It's hard to put into words until you've had it. Salad was adequate and fresh-tasting. Will try again. Heard the pizza is great....not a huge pizza fan though.
