I made an appointment online to bring my tablet in to resolve a couple of issues. I received a friendly greeting from the \"solutions manager,\" Catherine, and was seen right on time by Austin, who resolved my problems cheerfully and quickly. He even installed a tempered glass cover on my device.\n\nI really appreciate being able to make an appointment for service at the store.
