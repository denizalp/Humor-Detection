Ate here two years ago love it! Was craving this place and pho hit the spot! 6 bowls of pho please! \n\nOverall, great Vietnamese food (we only ordered the pho FYI) \n\n3 special pho one with extra tendon: 5\/5 the server swap the pho bowls and realize their mistake and glady compensated the person whom didn't get their extra tendon! Love how they made it easy no complications. I do have to not they did forget one regular special so while the rest of the family ate one person didn't get their bowl they after we informed them and were almost done eating already. \n\n2 pho meatballs only: 5\/5 for the kiddos they love it! \n\n1 special pho with egg noodles: 5\/5 love how they allow for easy switching of noodles! \n\nThey were great checking in on us and refilling water! Quick and easy will always stop by this place for pho when in Vegas! The pho broth is phenomenal! I would have to say in my top 3 fav pho broths!
