You cannot go wrong with this place, yummy Indian buffet the ones who like quality buffets !!!! Service is polite and efficient. When I ask for the finished items they were able to provide more immediately. We regularly go to this place. It is around 14-15 dollars plus tax on weekend dinners, lunch and weekdays are cheaper. Great value for this price !!! not a huge buffet but it is good enough and all the dishes keep their original taste, all yummy !! when our friends and family come out of town we always take them here and they all love it, highly recommended !!! My favorites here are butter chicken and curry mutton, I make sure that I take some yogurt cucumber as side dish to cool down when the food becomes more spicy, they bring fresh warm naan to the table, it has 2 sweets but good enough and variety of ice creams, good to have a bit if you still have space after eating this great meal !!
