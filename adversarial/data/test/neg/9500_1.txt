The first thing is that I am actually not a huge cider fan... the first is always great and the second is too sweet.  The second thing is that I am now.  We put ourselves in the hands of the server and got a whiskey cider and Pinot noir cider, which I will admit I didn't even know existed.  A fantastic start the the night.  The space is warm and cozy, loud enough to feel like it is happening but not so loud that you can't hear your dinner date... who is patiently waiting for me to finish this review.  The Caesar salad was perfect.  The butter chicken was everything you want butter chicken to be.  The lost star (4\/5) was that naan was basically a warmed up pita.  Come here, ask for recommendations, have a flight, and a great evening.
