I was excited to bring my sister and mother here for our Mother's Day Vegas get-away after seeing the amazing chefs on Top Chef. We were not disappointed! My family doesn't really eat fish, but they loved the fish tacos. Embarrassingly enough, we even went back the next night after we couldn't stop talking about how great everything was (especially their chips). The atmosphere was great, and the menu selection looked good as well. The only thing that could have been improved was when the server knocked a glass of water on me and soaked my dress. Accidents happen, and it wasn't a huge deal-I did have to go back to my room and change, but no apology was even given. \nI would recommend this restaurant, and wish a location was in my home-town.
