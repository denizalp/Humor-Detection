I've not taken a lot of time to find a solid Chinese restaurant here in Arizona.  My wife and I recently moved to Peoria and this establishment has popped up on my Yelp feed a few times.  We ordered take out because that's how Chinese food should be eaten. \n\nFirst, the entire Grand Ave. x Peoria Ave. exchange is just bizarre and really missed up.  Unfortunately, the restaurant sits kitty corner to Wendy's right on the corner. \n\nWe walked in and the restaurant is very clean.  We were greeted instantly and handed take out menus.  I went with the Spicy Orange Chicken combo and my lovely bride went with the Sweet & Sour Chicken combo.  In less than 10 minutes, our food was produced to us fresh and piping hot. \n\nNext, we got a ton of food.  It's a solid combo guaranteed to put you in an Asian food coma.  For my Spicy Orange Chicken combo, my main entr√©e came with a scoop of fried rice, a solitary piece of fried shrimp, a few pieces of sweet & sour chicken and an egg roll.  That's a lot of food for $10 as far as I'm concerned.\n\nI liked that the orange chicken was spicy as it should be and not caramelized in a candy coating of orange syrup.  The egg roll was delicious as was the piece of fried shrimp I was given.  The few pieces of sweet & sour chicken I was given was also quite tender and flavorful.  The only part of the combo I didn't care for was the fried rice.  That's all it was... fried rice in some shoyu.  No tiny morsels of pork or green onions or carrots or anything.  I love fried rice, but it was bland and sort of lackluster. \n\nIt was still a good experience and they made a great first impression on me.  A solid 4-star contender, indeed!
