I just tried this for the first time and was fairly impressed. They had a surprising number of homemade items like Kimchi (spelling?) so be sure to check out the refrigerated cases. I agree that common items are cheaper elsewhere. The lady working there was really friendly and helpful. Location is great. \nThe only other reason I didn't give it 5 stars (besides the high prices) is that I went there for Indian groceries and they were missing a lot of commonly used dals and spices like dried or fresh tamarind. They did have the dried spices I needed like black mustard seeds, but when I had to make another trip to the Indian market in Cuyahoga Falls, I found that the Indian shop had the same spices for less and fresh curry leaves instead of frozen. That said, I'll go back because it's really close, friendly and really well stocked with Asian goods except Indian.
