The sign is old fashioned and decor is old fashioned and so is their pride in making quality good. On a chilly day, stopped by for a soup and sandwich for lunch. What could have been a generic and pre made meal was clearly made with love. Chicken noodle soup - think noodles, fresh broth, chunks of chicken. And a BLT with generous, crispy bacon. \n\nThey have several in-house smoked meats that will make your mouth water. That's what I'm going to pick up next time....
