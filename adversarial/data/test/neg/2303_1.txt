Oh my goodness!   This place was fantastic!    My daughter and I walked in at 9 PM on a Friday night, store had a nice crowd but we were welcomed immediately by the gentleman working behind the counter.      There were about 15 fresh flavors.. many of which I had no interest of trying.. the gentleman encouraged me to try a variety of mixtures.. and OH MY GOODNESS.. they were all fantastic.  Service exceptional, choices and flavor exceptional and price.. very very fair.
