This was only our second time visiting as we come from Vancouver Canada but yet again it was AMAZING! \nThis time hubby had the chimichanga and I chose the 3 tacos with rice and beans. I had a super hard time deciding on which 3 to choose as they all sounded better than the last. I finally decided on a carne asada, pollo asado, and the tecate fish taco. The fish was by far my fave with the carne asada a close second. The waitress was friendly, attentive and helpful in giving me the low down on the tacos. Next time I will order al la carte since there was waaaaay too much food for me to eat. \nWhen we are staying in Scottsdale in a few days we will returning to have the churro sundae since there was no room to eat it this time!
