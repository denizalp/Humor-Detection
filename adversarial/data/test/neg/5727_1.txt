I cook for my husband almost every day. I do like to cook but when the process becomes a routine I need to take a break and go out some fine restaurant.\n\nThe Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite food-places. I am dying to know the recipe of an appetizer \"Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes\". It is incredibly delicious. Sometimes I just get this dish and cheesecake on the dessert and I`m full. \n\nThis place is really busy on weekends. You should be able to wait a twenty or thirty minutes but it is worth it. The waiter stuff is very friendly and they are serving very fast. \n\nI have never been dissapointed with the Cheesecake Factory and highly recommend this place:)
