While Fuego may not have the most \"authentic\" mexican food in the valley, they do, in my opinion, have the tastiest Mexico\/SoCal\/Baja fusion.\n\nService is always quick and friendly, the complimentary tortillas and salsa are top-notch, and seem house-made, and every entree I've tried is full of flavor and very well plated. \n\nThe atmosphere is on the trendy side, and the location could be a little more convenient, but in a way, I like that it's sort of a hidden gem!
