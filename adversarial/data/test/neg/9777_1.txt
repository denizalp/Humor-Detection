Good Breakfast spot in Charlotte to bring the family.   Their regular scrambled eggs and their egg whites are both excellent.  The coffee is strong, which is great because that's how we like it!  The French toast is good but just ok.  I think the food came out a little cold instead if fresh and hot from the kitchen, so I think they can do a little better with timing.   The service was pretty good, no complaints there!
