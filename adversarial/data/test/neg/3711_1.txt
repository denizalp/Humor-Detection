Went here 3 nights ago and this is one of the better hotel \/ casino restaurants that I have been to.  I ate dinner at the bar and they served the full menu at the bar.  The bartender recommended the osso bucco with the saffron risotto and it was really good.  Generous pours of good Italian red wine too.  If I return to the Mirage again, I will definitely return to this restaurant and try other dishes.
