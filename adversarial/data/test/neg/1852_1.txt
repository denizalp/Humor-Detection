Was handed the happy hour menu, ordered solely and repeatedly from the happy hour menu, including drinks that were only on the happy hour menu. At the end, expecting a bill for about $50, I received one for about $85. It was only then that the bartender saw fit to mention that happy hour had ended just before we had arrived. Any other bartender I have ever encountered would either have mentioned that during one of the rounds of orders, or not given us the happy hour menu in the first place. Food was adequate.
