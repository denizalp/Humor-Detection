This place is a complete sham. Somehow hotwire rates it 3 stars which is beyond me when it is a 2 star hotel. I stayed this past weekend with my boyfriend for two nights while going to Osheaga. \n\nFirst off the area is disgusting. To the left it is the highway and salvation army in a very dingy area. To the right is the Concordia campus in a very desolate and isolated area. The closest and nicest metro stop is guy concordia but that (as are the other 2 nearby metro stops) are a good 15 minute walk. \n\nThe hotel itself of the exterior looks menacing, run down, and dingy- nothing like their \"boutique hotel\" website. The entrance and lobby area are run down and very cheap\/depressing looking.  The weirdest part is that there are tons of random people always hanging around with taxis at all hours of the night that smoke cheap cigarettes and make the place even more unwelcoming. The whole hotel is very cheap and low class with noise at all hours of the nights.\n\nAs for the rooms- there is much to be desired. The beds are comfortable and seem fairly new. However, there is faux hardwood floor which amplifies all the sounds in the area. You can hear everything from the surrounding rooms and hallway. For some other bizarre reason there is a desktop computer in the room which is allegedly equipped with internet. I never actually made it that far because it had issues running and all i had was weird codes then made a constant buzzing sound. The wifi didn't work on my phone either which the front desk told me was due to my phone then the story changed to my proximity to the front desk (I was on the 4th floor of 7). \n\nIf you need a last minute hotel this is a good option. If you're planning a trip you can definitely find better options
