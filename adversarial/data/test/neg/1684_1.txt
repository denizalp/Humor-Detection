In my recent trip to Vegas we dine at Milos, I love the atmosphere, we started with the appetizer, most delicious Hummus appetizer I have ever tasted, the olives and the tomatoes, however as vegan the entree was totally wasted and had to take it to go, it seems strange to me that with so many Vegan and Vegetarians, they did not came out with a veggie plate, like portobellos or something like that, because for the price and wasting the food like that is throwing money away, next time I'lol just go with the appetizer.......if I can because \"Absolutely NO substitutes\" stated in the menu
