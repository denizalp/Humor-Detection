We went there on our last full day in Vegas and weren't too impressed. If you'd like to be rekindled with soda that came in bottles back in the day, then this store would be for you. I was hoping to come across some novelty candies from the 70's or so, but their selection of candies was sparse to say the least. Needless to say, we left empty handed...............
