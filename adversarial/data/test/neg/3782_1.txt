Went this restaurant last weekend for a late breakfast. Had SUPER Sweet with TONS of whipped cream triple chocolate cappuccino, tasted just okay Egg white omelet, and weird sour flavor smoked salmon Benedict. The place is fancy, however, the food is not okay and the price is a little bit too high. Maybe I should just order liquor or dessert over there next time.
