Saturday night is my husband and my pizza and wings night! During the summer we don't like to use the oven, so we purchase pizzas. We had been going to another place very close to home and usually ordered a sausage and onion pizza. While it had great flavor, we both prefer a thin crust (not available), and there was actually too much cheese (if there can be such a thing!).  So, we decided to give Fired Pie a chance. A bit farther to go, but easy to get to and access out to University Dr. easy by going behind a few establishments and exiting on Farmer with a stoplight at University.\n\nWe loved the pizza from the get-go!!! This has been our 6th time back to Fired Pie! We get the vegetarian pizza but do add sausage and exchange the red onions for the roasted onions. The crust is a perfect thin crust, and sauce, toppings are fresh and tasty!!! I pick it up early, and then keep it on hold in our oven until supper time. It's delicious! Next time I go, I want to ask to sample their spicy sausage as my husband is not into spice but I would like a little bit of a kick. So glad we found Fired Pie! \n\nSo the pizza is definitely a 5 star!!! What about the folks who take my order? Have had only the best of folks. The first young lady who helped me two weeks in a row was very helpful in explaining how to order. After a couple of weeks, I downloaded the Fired Pie app, but had no idea how to use! My last two visits, Kris was working, and she was such a help in how to use the app. More importantly, on each visit she has been friendly and helpful. I love how she checks with me that the pizza looks good before going into the wood-firing oven, and then shows it to me before boxing it up. While Kris is friendly and helpful to me, I see her give the same kind of service to others who come in. So service is also a 5 star rating!\n\nKind of thinking when summer is over, we will still get our pizzas from Fired Pie!!!
