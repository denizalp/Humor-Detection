So now that they're even closer to my house is a huge plus. 'Old' Henderson did not have many choices when it came to Hawaii(an) desserts, and even when they were 10 minutes away on Warm Springs, I'd be there twice a week sometimes.  I find myself having little willpower on most days to not drive by there and get me some malasadas. Because it's never just malasadas, it ends up to be a plate lunch or a piece of cake too. I love the fact that they are experimental, especially with their breakfast items. \n\nReally hoping that since they now share space with Islander's Grill, instead of having to worry about things like huge rent, they can continue to focus on being able to experiment, and are able to continue focusing on their delicious treats.\n\nWelcome to the neighborhood!
