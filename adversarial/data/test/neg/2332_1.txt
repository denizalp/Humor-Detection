Good decent food, don't go here if your a sushi snob or know your obscure or good Japanese fish. . American-ized, tamed down sushi, a lot of the fish are cooked, so you can have a whole meal with cooked fish. Fun atmosphere, good drinks. great for beginners  and those who are somewhat new to sushi.  Not authentic, buts that is what they are selling, new modern sushi with lots of fun and alcohol.
