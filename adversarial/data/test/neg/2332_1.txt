Waited for over half hour for table for seven to become available. No coordination between hostesses. When a table that was to be used for us one of the other hostesses gave the table away. When asked to be put out side we were told there wasn't enough servers to put us outside. I will never go to this business again. Maybe if there was an adult manager present something different would gave happened.
