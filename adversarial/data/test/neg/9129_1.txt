great hidden gem!  not the usual 'car't service' but they do cook the dim sum real time, so it's always warm and fresh.  they have great deals and prices are perfect!  nice, clean restaurant.  Food was awesome.  They took care of me any my family and guests of 13 for my bday last week and we all had a great time and were very full when we left.  the chinese food is also good, including sesame chicken and pan fried noodles.  we will definitely be back.
