The night started off great for us! We were there an hour before showtime to make sure we got good seats bc it was opening night. When we entered the theater, the seats we purchased did not exist! We had seats for an area not in the theater! We were so upset bc we were there early & now we can't even sit down bc the seats DID NOT EXIST! We went to management to let them know what happened & were turned away! And on top of that, it was an 18 year old - emo looking kid with acne on his face! He wasn't even old enough to drink! He was rude & unprofessional. So instead of continuing to deal with him, we saw two associates at an another register. They immediately listened to our concerns & tried to rectify the situation. Jhoseleine & Marcel were extremely helpful & understanding. Good thing your company has those two bc we would have never come back to the establishment otherwise.
