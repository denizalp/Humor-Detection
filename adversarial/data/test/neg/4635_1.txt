Would it sound weird to you if I confessed to having a bit of a paper fetish? There's just nothing like stationary shopping, especially when you love sending snail mail as much as I do.\n\nThis having been said, Paper Roots Studios is heaven to a stationary snob. They've got unique cards, beautiful paper and some of the coolest designs I've ever seen.\n\nWhen I'm sending someone I love a surprise in the mail, I like to ensure that I send them nothing but the best. I want every part of my letter to speak to them, right down to the paper. That's why I frequent Paper Roots Studios because they've got the goods that deliver.
