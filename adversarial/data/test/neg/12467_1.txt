I heard about this place through some friends and decided to go one sunday morning.  I ordered the english muffin breakfast sandwich, which had canadian bacon, egg, tomato and pesto of course. I also ordered the croissant breakfast sandwich which was well worth its price.  The pesto and the perfectly cooked egg made it taste so fresh!! My fiance at the english muffin sandwich and loved it.  I ordered the berry smoothie and that was very good as well.  The staff is very friendly.  I suggest if you want to get something to go you should call ahead because they make everything to order and it took a little bit.  I will definitely be back on a weekend to have a reasonably priced, high quality breakfast.
