Went back to check out their Curry and their French toast.\nThe place was packed when I got there (2:10pm, Sunday). I ordered the Curry Beef Brisket. It is not the normal kind of beef brisket you get like the rest of the HK style restaurants, which sometimes is rough. Theirs are in small chucks, chewy and soft. (the person at the table beside us ordered the Beef brisket with noodle soup....and he got the same kind of brisket too).  The curry tasted differently from last time. Because this time their chef sprinkled some Lemon grass into it. Totally changed the taste, I prefer it plain like last time. Anyway, still good.\nThe other dish we got was the Fried Pork Jowl. The sauce tasted like teriyaki. While the meat was sliced thin. Lean, yet very moist. \nThe French toast is something to die for. Cutting it into smaller chunks makes more crispy surface area. While the inside is super soft and chewy. And they use condensed milk other than sugar syrup. Just awesome.
