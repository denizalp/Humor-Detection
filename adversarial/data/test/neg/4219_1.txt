Excellent food. I'm a regular, at least once a week for breakfast.\nHowever... go on the weekend for breakfast and the service is terrible. Last time it was 40 mins to get coffee and 1.5 hrs from time of order to get our food. Needless to say, that was the last time i would ever invite guests to go there or take my family on weekends. However, during the week when it's dead at breakfast, great food, great service.
