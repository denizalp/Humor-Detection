This place is weird.\n\nThey are known for being rude and they definitely got the job done. It is really quite startling when you first get there. I got yelled at cause I had my hand on my hip while waiting for a table, I got yelled at for them getting my order wrong and I also got yelled at for wanting ranch with my chicken tenders. The wait staff (if you want to call it that) cusses at you and makes fun of you. Its very provocative, but all in all fun. \n\nThey throw your silverware and napkins at you. And the Menu is pretty small and posted up on the wall. If you are starving and\/or in a rush I don't recommend you come here.\n\nDo NOT come here if you don't have a good sense of humor or if you are at ALL an up tight person. This place isn't for you. \n\nThe food was decent, I give it a 3. \nThe decor, acting, etc. gets a 4. \nThe bar gets a 5! \nAll together I give it an overall 4.\n\nAfter eating lunch and then hanging out at the bar for 2 hours my friend and I left feeling pretty good!!!!
