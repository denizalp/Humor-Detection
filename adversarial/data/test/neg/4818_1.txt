I had a good time here. It's totally a young crowd -- you'll probably get pushed and have a drink spilled on you, but that's pretty typical at a tiny little club-like establishment. It is very loud, but there is a small outdoor patio to escape the nonsense. Drinks = super cheap. Like cheaper than water. The bartender was awesome and super entertaining!
