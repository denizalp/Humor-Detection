They do a good job with their hot dishes. Skewers, Japanese fried rice, baked mussels, short ribs were yummy here. Ramen had a foul bamboo spout taste (eek). Found the portions too large. \n\nSushi dishes were a miss for me.. they were poorly assembled and packed with tasteless rice. Eel was dried up. Tataki did not taste fresh. Sashimi was not bad tho. \nSlow night but the kitchen was super fast. Servers just pile on the dishes.. as typical ayce sushi does.\n\nOrders are made on the iPad which is always a plus. Beautiful modern renovations, comfy booths.
