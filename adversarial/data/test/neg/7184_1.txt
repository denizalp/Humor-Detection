Stayed in the presidental suite it was incredible. What I loved most was the bathroom which had a large jacuzzi, shower n steam room, his and hers bathroom. It also had a entertainment room like your very own movie theaters. You can order almost anything for room service. The hotel is beautiful. Tao night club is one of the best clubs i've been to. Went to Tao's  twice in a row gotta hang out in the vip section if you go in a group. Its a large club didn't realize it until I went the second time.
