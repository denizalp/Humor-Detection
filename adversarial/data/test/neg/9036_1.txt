I called in today and Ahmed helped me order what I wanted over the phone. Ahmed was extremely helpful and did a lot of explanations for me. We was professional and patient. \n\nGot my order done within half an hour and called the supplier for me other phone with my questions. Emailed me back this afternoon with the good results. \n\nVivid has competitive price and great customer service. I'm from CA and will be ordering from them from now on. \n\nThanks a lot
