This casino is ok...nothing spectacular. The restaurants are ok - not great. We just moved into the area and it's close to our house. My husband and I do enjoy gambling and tend to end up here because of its location from our house. After the last couple of times going though we are thinking of going to another casino. Our major complaint with this casino is the cocktail service. We have sat there gambling and not getting any service at all!! The waitresses were sitting by the bar talking instead of taking care of customers. I'm not sure they understand that the more you walk around and take care of the customers the more money you make! Sorry to say even though it's the closest - I don't think we will be back for gambling.
