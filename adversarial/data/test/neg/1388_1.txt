Absolutely delicious food and a very nice gentleman behind the counter. I had the bamboo shoot stirfry and it was quite good. My brother had the oxtail soup and it is to die for. It's like a Taiwanese oxtail soup mixed with Tom Yum, a heavy meaty flavor cut with kefir lime, basil and lemongrass.\n\nThey don't have a sign, but they are tucked in behind Voodoo wings next to cash1 on Cheyenne. Very easy to miss! But so good!
