An amazing show.  We finished up a business trip by taking about 25 people out to see \"LOVE\".  Wow.\n\nComplete sensory overload... there's so much going on you can't keep up with it all, and it's all amazing.\n\nWonderful performances and display of skills by the artists, (of course) great music, and non-stop action.  We sat about mid-way up and I actually recommend sitting up in the higher seats so you can see more of what is going on.\n\nThe performance is technically brilliant and well done.  Highly recommend this one!
