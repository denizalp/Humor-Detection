No line when we got here, but a few people sitting at tables inside. Ordering was easy, and we sat down at a half table half booth near the front. They are going for the industrial feel with cement floors and a brick wall. Food took 35 minutes to come out. One pizza was enough for 2, but if you're hungry, count on eating your own. I agree with other commentors about the \"drizzle\" of oil on top...too much.
