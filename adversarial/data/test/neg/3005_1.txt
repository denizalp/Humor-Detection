I've visited here twice in the last 2 weeks. They're one of the only places open late any day of the week. Their kitchen is open until 11pm while nearly all neighboring restaraunts this side if 15 near the base close at 9-930pm. Staff is friendly and up front of the service is slow. Seat yourself atmosphere. Large TV in the main dinning had news on, I'm sure u can ask them to change it though. Food was delicious and satisfying both times. Willing to add or change things upon request. Recommend the quesadillas but ask to add veggies!
