Oh, Coronado. You never fail to please and I never fail to come back for more. This is my 5th...7th.. 12th visit? Who knows but it's not my last! The Cauliflower Tacos - my fave - were top notch tonight. Not sure who was in the kitchen but I can usually finish all 3 tacos and had to stop at 2 cause FOOD COMA. So good. The Nolce Dulce was creamy and deep, perfect combo beer for this meal. See you next week Coronado! We love you!
