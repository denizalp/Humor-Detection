Came for my boyfriend's birthday. The seafood was really good. We had the surprise seafood and I had shrimp risotto, they had a reaaaaally nice charred barbecue taste I loved it! The wine recommended was amazing as well. Our waiter was really nice too! It was kinda difficult to eat not knowing where everything is but it was an interesting experience. The only downside was waiting over 30min for the main course, I was starving!
