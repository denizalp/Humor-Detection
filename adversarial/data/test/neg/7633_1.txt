2 stars because the Food wasn't horrible but the service was TERRIBLE! I sat near the bar area and there wasn't many people dining meaning it wasn't very busy. The waitress was kind of clueless. She didn't know much about the ingredients in the entrees. We had no silverware on the table before being seated so we had to ask her for some when our food first came out, but we had to remind her that we were still waiting for silverware the second time she came to drop off the other meals. I ordered a Drink & I could see the Bartender making it..... Then it just sat there- for like 10 mins...... And I can see all the other staff just standing near the bar, taking shots of Beer???!!!?? And the waitress finally bought it over. :-\/ Management needs to up their team or train their young staff to be more professional. Probably don't plan on ever returning to this joint. It's too bad, the architecture of the place really fits the name which makes it a cool hang out.
