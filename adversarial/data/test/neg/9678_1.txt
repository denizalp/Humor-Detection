Meh. I really want to like this place. Beautiful interior. Staff really tries good service. I felt like they are still knowing the ropes. Food: we got the fig and prosciutto pizza, expected figs, guessing it was fig sauce. Arugula was overkill overtook the prosciutto. Chopped salad: needs contrast. It was all fatty texture and crunch. I'm saying it.. Bland. Charcuterie plate: it was all bread. 2 meats 5 slices each. Deviled eggs: nothing new, just add very crispy bacon stabbed on top. The only redeeming thing I would go back to is my drink: Player's cut. Just add more luxardo cherries.
