What a great concept! Especially if you're a soft-serve ice cream fan (like myself. I much prefer soft-serve to regular ice cream or gelato, which I find too heavy and rich). This place is the cutest, with tons of options for toppings (not so much for the soft-serve base itself). I really like how they have a \"mini\" size cone, which is perfect for me (and for everyone else in my party of four, apparently!). It really is the perfect treat. \n\nI chose a vanilla base of soft-serve with the salted caramel dip and it was delicious. We all thoroughly enjoyed our treats, sitting at a table in the rear courtyard on a hot, Montreal evening, with the string lights on. So pretty! Nice touch, too, that they have some games and toys there for children to play with.
