There are a few things that I liked about this hotel: cleanliness of the hotel and the Grand Lux restaurant! \nMy co-workers and I booked our rooms here to attend a 3-day convention. After a long day of working and rushing to catch our flight, finding our suite was a very tiring adventure!! It was a maze walking through halls just to get to the other \"lobby\" and then walk through another set of halls just to get to our suite. Tiring. \nThe suite was not what I was expecting as fast as size and decor. We had the Bella suite with 2 queen beds and a living room with a sofa bed. The bathroom had a bathtub and separate shower stall. The toilet had its on enclose area which was good to have. This was the \"basic\" suite so I shouldn't have expected anything grand. The beds and linens were comfortable. \nThey have an exercise room that was well equipped. My friend and I were able to find an area to do our own HIIT workout. It was a busy morning and we weren't able to use the treadmill but there were other options. Getting here was also a journey. Lol \nThe hotel employees were kind and helpful. We called for extra blankets and they delivered within 30 minutes. For room service, we ordered breakfast and although it took longer than expected, the meal was delicious! We had ordered omelette and hash browns and the portions were good to share between 2 people. \nNow, would I return....maybe not. The hotel was built for those who wanted an adventure just to find their rooms, the pool and the exercise room.
