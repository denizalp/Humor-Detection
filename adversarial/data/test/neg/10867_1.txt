This place has the best burger ever! Small draft beer selection but the fresh cut french fries and amazing burgers make up for it. You have to try the Rick burger!\n\nMy only complaint is that they charge 1.00 every time you use your credit card. I work with credit card merchants and the most they would charge is 5%. To me that's just a dishonest way to make more money.
