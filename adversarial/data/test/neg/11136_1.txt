Love Rubio's at home and was happy to see it at the hotel food court. Ended up stopping by for breakfast because I was in a hurry and there was no line. The bacon breakfast burrito was good, love their salsa. I wish it had potatoes in it. They didn't have decaf coffee which was a bummer, the Starbucks line was too long and I really wanted a cup of decaf.
