If you order based on what you've seen on the website, ask many questions.  what I ordered was the same plant but nothing else.  I ordered the money tree which is braided with square planter, deerfoot moss and black and white rocks.  I received a single stalk in a metal bucket planter with spanish moss.  two very different looks.  The person that received the plant was happy enough but my expectations were not met.  I felt rushed when ordering and when I called to express disappointment afterwards, I was merely told they could not do what I had expected.  I'll try elsewhere next time.
