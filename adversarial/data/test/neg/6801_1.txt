Had a 30 minute wait.. But played foosball (sow) to pass the time! \n\nThe brisket nacho were really good! \n\nThe bacon Mac-n-cheese burger was good but not great! \nThe Motley Cue sandwich was rally good. Lots of mean.. Could probably split between 2 people\n\nThe wings.. Cutest presentation. \n\nStaff was eh.. I mean the place is busy. No time to be too friendly to all the damn tourist. Can't say that I blame them. \n\nNeat experience. Def worth a trip.. \n\nNext time will def try the desert.. This time we were too full!
