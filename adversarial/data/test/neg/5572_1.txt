Of all my years living in Richmond hill did I know that this little Korean restaurant existed within my neighbourhood. It's a great place to come to if you're craving Korean food close by. \n\nThe environment is a small yet spacious restaurant that can fit small groups of 4-6. The food portions are decent and well made. I ordered the bimbimbap and boy was it good! Very decently priced and bang for your buck if you wanna be full. \n\nWhen I came it wasn't that packed so you're bound to get quick service!
