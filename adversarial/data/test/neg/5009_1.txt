Okay so how I stumbled upon Q Bistro, I felt like having Korean food with my girlfriend but late at night the few places I'm familiar with are closed. This place is great, food is great, service is great. Woong our server was delightful. We ordered the bulgogi fried rice, tofu soup and spicy beef noodle soup. All 3 were delicious, definitely need to explore their menu some more. They even have some fusion items that seem very worthy to give a shot. So to finish absolutely deserves the 5 stars I gave. Service, quality of food and atmosphere.
