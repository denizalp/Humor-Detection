Do yourself a solid and go somewhere else, perhaps a place that values their customers. We came in to town for work\/play. Upon getting in we noticed blood stains on one of the bed skirts, so we removed the skirt. It was 115 outside and we checked in at 3pm. Room was hot as hell. Turned the ac up and left to go to a music concert. Made a comment to the front desk about the room. Come back after being outside in the heat to the room still hot and no hot water. Went down to front desk as soon as we got in to see if we could change rooms, clerk said no rooms to be had and all their fans were loaned out. The clerk suggested turning the air on low and then that may reset the system. She also mentioned that a manager would be back in the morning. So I went back up tried the suggestion and then that's when we tried to get showers...ran the water for 20 Minutes, air had been running for 35 at this point on low per clerks suggestion. We were thru. We had not slept in the beds nor used any towels. Turned in the key and asked the clerk to give my contact info and list of complaints to her manager in the morning. Clerk was dumbfounded. We left at 1230am to go to another town 15 minutes away to another hotel. Complained to Wyndham staff via email and twitter. We were told to wait a week for the hotel staff to get back to us. Well today they issued a $20 refund. To a company that prides itself on customer service I'm done with this brand. Stay away.
