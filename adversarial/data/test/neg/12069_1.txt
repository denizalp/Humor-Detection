Very interesting fusion of Korean and Mexican cuisine. I was impressed with everything we tried, and really found that there was a perfect balance between the two cultures. There's a daily special coming out of the smoker, and we were lucky enough to get the pork ribs on our visit. Tender, smoky and meaty. We also opted for the grilled calamari on a bed of kimchi, braised shortrib tacos, fried fish tacos with kimchi slaw, and the carnitas pork tacos with bulgogi spice. We were extremely happy with everything, although some of the spice levels were a little high for a few of the diners. Fresh, flavorful, and fun. Definitely worth checking out if you're looking for something new.
