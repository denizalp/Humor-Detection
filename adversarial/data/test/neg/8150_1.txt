I've been going to bowlology for awhile now. The things I like about this place is that they have a lot of healthy options. Smoothies, fruit bowls, and they even have lunch\/dinner bowls! Their menu does change every now and then. I usually get the ocean bowl, with açaí. You can get pitaya, which is dragon fruit as a base if you don't like açaí ! It is pretty tasty, especially in the summer time because it is nice and refreshing! The tartness really wakes you up in my opinion. You can also change fruit on top if you don't like the toppings.\n\nI also like the fact that they have a stamp card, for every 10 bowls you purchase you get a free regular bowl, because the amount you pay for a bowl or smoothie is a little pricey. Which is why my review has 3 and if I could add a half I would, so 3 and a half stars! Also if you work in the plaza they give you a 10% discount, because ya know. A dollar is a dollar! They also do call ahead orders, so you can call and order your bowl before work if you work around the plaza and you just go in, pay, and pick up! Quick breakfast idea if you are in a hurry.
