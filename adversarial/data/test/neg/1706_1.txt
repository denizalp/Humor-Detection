I hate to be the black sheep, but I was simply unimpressed with Mancini's. They have a great reputation in Pittsburgh, and after 5 years in this city, it was about time I see what all the fuss is about. Although I will never experience one of their famous Pepperoni Rolls (being a vegetarian has its downfalls), I figured the next best thing was the Spinach & Feta Roll.  It turned out to be a huge letdown. Aside from tasting a bit old and dry, it could have used a lot more filling. The marinara dipping brought it up a notch, but I don't understand why they must charge an extra $0.75 for half a scoop of marinara that clearly came out of a $1 jar. The real killer was the unevenly baked bread. There were corners where it was just RAW DOUGH. Why Mancini's?! I'm really hoping this was a crazy fluke because how can a bakery beloved by all of Pittsburgh be that bad? However, I can be forgiving. The next time I hit up a Mancini's, I'm hoping for redemption.
