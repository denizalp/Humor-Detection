I live in the Seattle area, but I make a point of visiting Let's Take a Seat every time I visit my friends and family in Champaign!  \n\nI've tried several Thai places in and around Seattle, but the food at LTAS is simply the most delicious I've ever had.  My favorite dish is the pad kee maow with chicken!  The noodles have the *perfect* texture.  According to LTAS's Facebook page, they grind their chilis in-house, so the spice is always fresh and extra KICKY!  The spice levels go from 1 to 3, and I generally find that level 1 has plenty of zing.  \n\nThe restaurant itself is bright, airy, and comfortable.  It was the perfect setting for my wedding luncheon.  Our guests had a wonderful time!\n\nWhen I visit Champaign next month, I'll most certainly return to LTAS.
