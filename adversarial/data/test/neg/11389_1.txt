I have GOT to update my original review. Went here in a Saturday night and there were tumbleweeds in this joint. Unfortunately, we soon discovered why! The server was slow. The bathroom was gross. The food is decent. I ordered the italian sub. It was aight. Just okay I say. But to their credit I wasnt expecting Thomas Keller level at a sports bar. They had a beer special i ordered that came out in a child's size cup. All petty things aside what really would have made my meal more enjoyable would have been better service. And a better atmosphere. Back in the day you could barely get a seat at the bar. I don't know what happened to this place! Duckworths South Park you had soooo much potential. Please go to rehab and come back to me when your clean.
