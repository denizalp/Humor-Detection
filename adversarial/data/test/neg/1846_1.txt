We visited this place for the first time and loved the atmosphere. I went to ASU many moons ago and would have loved to have this place as a go to. I ordered the Hatch Chile beer, the soft pretzel and the roasted garlic burger. Everything was delicious and the service was great! The beer especially gets 4 thumbs up! It's the first time I have had a Chile flavored beer and want more . I highly recommend McFate for those looking for a chill atmosphere good beer and knowledgeable servers.
