I am absolutely addicted to this place.  I work in CityScape so it's an easy walk for lunch, and I have to admit I've been eating here about three or four times a week.  Just really good, really convenient, very friendly, and I'm obsessed with their \"forbidden rice\" - it's actually purple, full of antioxidants and healthier than processed white rice.
