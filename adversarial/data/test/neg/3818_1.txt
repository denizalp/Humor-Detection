Recommend by my Persian collegue and I can say it was a good reco.  I really enjoy the kabobs and rice they go well together, got the combo 3 so you get a variety of meet to try like barg, chicken and koobideh  (ground lamb and beef).  The service was okay they are very busy and short of staff it seems but I didn't have hight expectation for service going in was there for the kabobs.
