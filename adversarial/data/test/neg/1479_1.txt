This place just popped up in my neighborhood, and I stopped in after not being able to get an appointment with my usual place. I was shocked at how beautiful it is! Everything is very tastefully decorated, brand new and impeccably clean. I have since been back a second time and was treated wonderfully, even offered a glass of wine- which I sadly had to decline since I'm pregnant, but am looking forward to being able to take them up on that offer soon! Prices were reasonable, and they did very good work. I'm definitely using them more often!
