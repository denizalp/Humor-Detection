Phenomenal service here!!! The manager came to greet my mother and I at the table and learned that it was just a special mother daughter vacation and my first time off in MONTHS. We were comped wine for the evening. The food was tasty, the atmosphere was fun and the wait staff was prompt to keep your area clean. Let's face it- plates of seafood it's bound to get a little messy while you're chowing down. Don't forget to stop by the dessert section! We will definitely be going here again on our next vacation.
