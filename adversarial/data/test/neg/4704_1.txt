Found this place thru the zip code magazine ad\/coupon for $13 fill and $23 pedicure. So i said, why not? My boyfriend and I went together, while we both got our pedi together, we also both got manicures, his was a regualr manicure, mine was the gel fill.. They were nice and attentive and no wait!\n\nWill go back soon =)
