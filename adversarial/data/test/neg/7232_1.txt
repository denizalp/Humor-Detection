It's true, you can't judge a book by it's cover.  Hesitant to try a place located in a small strip storefront.  Shows what I know!  I agree with all the other reviews, good food, wine, atmosphere & service.  Expected glorified bar food but was pleasantly surprised to find a creative menu.As a pescatarian it's hard for me to find something on the menu at the places my husband likes to eat (heavy on burgers, Mexican, chicken and fries) but I had a number of choices and my husband loved his chicken salad sandwich on a croissant.  PLEASE EVERYONE GO THERE, as I want them to stay so I will have a place to eat that I actually like.\n\nAlso, my server Kyle (?) was as nice and accommodating as it gets.
