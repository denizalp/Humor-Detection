If I could give this veterinary emergency clinic 10 stars I would. Waking up in the middle of the night with my cat having seizures I was panicked. Thank God the veterinary emergency clinic was six minutes away from my home. I walked in and gave my information and I waited for the doctor to see us. \nDr. Kinzi came in and I told her the situation she was calm and understanding as I cried in her office. She explained my options in detail with the cost  in a cool calm collective way and I really appreciated it. What a fabulous Dr. she is. I ended up making a second trip to the hospital that  same night and she was there to greet me and Comfort me through the whole ordeal.          \nWhen you're going through stress with your pet it's nice to know that someone has your back and is on your side and that's how I felt with Dr.Kinzi. She is a Gem!! Thank you Dr. Kinzi You are awesome and I really appreciated it. She even did a follow-up call with me. \n         \nUnfortunately if your pet is ill and you need emergency services I would totally recommend this place. I'm sure all the Doctors are awesome but Dr.Ellen Kinzi sealed the deal for me.
