This was my second time visiting this location.  The first time I filled out a card that would give me a free meal on my birthday.  However, the server never turned in my card and when I was there on Aug 4, 2017, I was told I should just filled out another card.  I think they should have a box for customers to dropped their own cards because I had to write down my personal information and it would put the responsibility on me not the server.  I did receive a birthday waffle.  The server was friendly but we waiting 40 mins after we ate our waffle before our meal arrived.  The customers around us arrived after us and received their meals ahead of us.  We had got up and started to leave because of the long wait for our meal and was told by the server she waited until we were finish with the waffle before having our meal cooked.  I explained to her that we had a busy day and wish she would had ask us first.
