Great place to stay right on the strip. Arrived on a Thursday night and check in was swift and even received free upgrade to strip view. Rooms are clean and nice. Elevators are fast and miracle mile shops and earls are right on casino floor. Will definitely stay here again. Only thing is I wish the rooms had some other type of music player besides alarm clock radio Lol
