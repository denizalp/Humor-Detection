This location rocks - excellent food, excellent staff.  I expect awesome food from Black Bear, every time I have been (around 6 times at various locations) the food has been great.  The staff at this location almost make up for my bad previous experience.  Based on this visit alone, I would offer them a 4.5 out of 5 stars (minus .5 stars due to playing country music - yucko!)\n\n**Please note - we only went this time because my inlaws wanted to go.  I am glad we did but still confess to feeling conflicted about giving them my business.\n\n***Update: Since this review (below) was posted, management contacted me and reassured me they were appalled by our bad experience.  This occurred within hours of posting the review below...which was a very pleasant surprise.\n\nWhy the 3 stars you ask?  The last time previous to the reviewed visit (2008 Beaverton, last weekend in was in Avondale) I had visited a Black Bear, we lived in Oregon and were at the Beaverton location.  My wife and I had both visited Black Bear before, and both thought they were the bomb.  \n\nOur 2008 visit in Beaverton changed our perception of this chain though.We were asked to \"clear the table because we were interfering with the waitresses' revenue stream\".  WTF?!?!   I have been really out of line when I was younger, and never been asked to \"move along\" like that.  We were enjoying a cup of coffee after a satisfying breakfast doing absolutely nothing out of line.\n\nOur table had the only latino customers in the restaurant, and the only latino staff on the premises was in the kitchen, all other on duty staff was white - just like me.  We were speaking Spanish (my wife and friend were helping me practice).  We were getting lots of crusty looks from other customers - all of which were white.  Three tables were waiting to be bussed, one party of four was waiting for a table.\n\nYou tell me what was going on here.\n\nManagement on duty claimed the waitress had a point, and when I raised  stink, offered us a free meal, which we declined.\n\nUpon raising my concern to ownership via email, I was told my concern was not legitimate, because the restaurant manager (who was not present) was latino.
