STAY AWAY!!! they advertise \"best price or it's all free\". i specifically asked melissa - the manager - about the policy, she said they were so certain they had the best price they could give that guarantee, NO MATTER WHERE YOU FOUND THE PRICE: local store, amazon, online etc. guess what! i found the mattress i purchased cheaper, (within 30 days) went to speak to melissa. she got snarky, rude, condescending, and said she was not allowed to deal with my issue and i had to speak to customer service.  of course their only customer service person is kayla. she gave me some double talk over the phone about how the cheaper price didn't apply, said look at the back of my receipt.  FOR OVER A WEEK, i emailed every day asking for the information in writing but SHE OR THE COMPANY REFUSE TO REPLY.  LIARS!!!  plus they do not have a very large selection.  the other people who were so excited about next day delivery - so what! they all do that.  go to MATTRESS FIRM!!
