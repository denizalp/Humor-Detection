We've been here twice now, and both times we were unimpressed with the service. The first time, the bartender was arrogant and disinterested in answering our questions. He also criticized the skills of his co-worker, who was a bartender-in-training, in front of us (and the co-worker). It was rude and unprofessional. The second time, this past Saturday night, the host gave us attitude for asking to sit outside, even though all of the outdoor tables were open. When we said we wanted drinks only, he seemed incredulous that we would have the nerve to sit outside AND only have drinks. Overall, we got the impression that we were inconveniencing him, so we left to go to Heritage where the drinks and service are always excellent. We're willing to give this place one more try because we want to like it and the drinks *have* been good. But the staff ruin our experience every time.
