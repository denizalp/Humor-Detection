We were given this recommendation by our decorator and David did not let us down!  We had two chaise lounges that desperately needed to be repaired.  David came out the next day with multiple samples to choose from.  Not only did he take the chairs that day, but returned them within the week and they looked great.  David provided excellent customer service, was knowledgable and reasonably priced.  Would highly recommend.
