CLICKLIST! Love it, the Clicklist crew is always on time and ready to load my groceries. I have done this at least 10 times and cannot help but advertise for them because it is so convenient. You can use your coupons, you can pick up right after work on your way home or even have them deliver. It is reasonable at $4.95 considering you can use your coupons and digital downloads, there are even clicklist coupons for you to take advantage of. Try them out and they give you one pick up for free.
