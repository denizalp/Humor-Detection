Went here for a nice night out celebrating our honeymoon and couldn't have had a better evening. Gavin, our waiter, was attentive, funny, and accommodating to all our questions. He made excellent recommendations from wine to dessert. In addition he went above and beyond to recommend fun things to do during our visit here in Montreal. Will certainly be coming back in the future, thanks again Gavin and staff!
