Nice staff, very poor quality clothing. I used to shop at Talbots for all my summer work clothes. In those days they had nice cotton sweaters and well tailored blazers in nice fabrics. Not anymore. While the staff are pleasant, the quality of the clothing has declined to the point that it is abysmal. The cotton and wool fabrics has been replaced with itchy polyester and other synthetics and the tailoring of the clothes is very poor. No professional women would be caught dead wearing these blazers. Very sad.
