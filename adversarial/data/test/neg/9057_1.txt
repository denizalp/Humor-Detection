Had a blast til someone broke a bottle and they didn't take me seriously for how bad the break was. There were shards everywhere and women with open shoes on! The bottom of the bottle was extremely dangerous because if anyone stepped directly on it they woulda had a lawsuit. The security shrugged it off at first but I didn't give up because I was trying to think about their business! Had they not cleaned it up, I woulda taken further action. But I just wanted to have a good night out. Just wish they woulda been more concerned about it since it is a dancing place!!
