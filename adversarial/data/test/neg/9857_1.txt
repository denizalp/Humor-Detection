As you can read by my reviews, I don't give many 4 stars. I absolutely loved this place. I'm from LA and have been going to Trader Vic's for many years, Shameful is a very cute tiny version. I don't usually go west of Duferin (not a fan of the neighborhood) but glad I did. I found this place on blog TO, they don't usually let me down. I told my boyfriend we would drive by first to scope it out, I'm glad I didn't base my decision on the exterior, it looked closed. I had to convince him to park and go it, he was happy. Good drinks, not overly sweet. Food was pretty good too. Good crowd. The only 2 things I would change are, add a touch more lighting and lower the music a bit. I don't say this because I am 50, lol, but really think the overall experience would \n be better, heck maybe gain the 5 star. \n\nHope you all enjoy it.
