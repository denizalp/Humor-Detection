Tried to book a ride with them on their web site.  I intentionally did not put my credit card number in because their site is NOT SECURE. Right after I booked my appointment I sent them an email letting them know that I'd be more than happy to give my credit card but let them know their site wasn't secure so I didn't feel comfortable booking it this way to let me know how to contact them.\n\nThey sent me an email making me wrong for not putting my credit card in and letting me know they were going to cancel my reservation.  I responded nicely letting them know why (again) and to provide a phone number for where I could call it in (and I had a couple more questions).  Never heard back from them again.  Went on Living Social and cancelled my voucher.\n\nI don't know if they are or not, but the way they handled this makes me feel uneasy and that they are shady.  Would not recommend based on my experience.
