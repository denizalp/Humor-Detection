We had spent the day in Cleveland, we were tired and we were at the mall just to kill time.  We happened upon this place and decided to try it.  It was not a bad find at all.\nIt's an unassuming place that is low key decor that feels a little upscale without being uppity.  It has a great tap line with a great selection of beers to choose from...I believe I had the Lake Eerie Monster for the first time here and now have a new favorite IPA because of it.  I wish the beers were served colder but when you get a great flavored IPA you can get by.\nWe had a basic burger and it was great, cooked as ordered and juicy.  Like others I'm not necessarily a fan of skinny fries but I liked these fine.  If I were to find myself here again I'd be more than happy to eat here a second time.
