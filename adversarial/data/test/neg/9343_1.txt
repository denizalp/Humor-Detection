Red Ember, a quite Japanese sushi restaurant located on 14th Street NW. \n\nI've always wanted to try something new when it comes to sushi besides any AYCE location and Li-Ao (located in Bridlewood SW) so I took the liberty to see what people have reviewed on Yelp and here I am. \n\nI checked on Facebook for their menu and was so stoke to try their 44 piece Party Tray A for $35 but when I got there I was upset because they don't offer that anymore so I got their Sushi & Sashimi combo instead since it was similar but a lot cheaper. Keep in mind that I've only been to AYCE sushi and Li-Ao so what I experience there is really different from what I experienced in Red Ember. The sushi and nigiri was fine but when it came to the sashimi I was like \"what is this\" and \"why is my portion massive while my salmon sashimi is tiny?\" But nevertheless I enjoyed it. Yes I know the server explained what each individual roll and sashimi was presented but I think I wasn't paying attention but I was starring at the sashimi and questioning the size. \n\nThe only downside is that the service was slower than usual and parking was such a hassle. I just notice you can park at the back instead of parking 3 blocks down on 14th since at the time I went the parkade machine was out of service. It's unfortunate that there's no street parking.\n\nRed Ember is a great place to dine if you're tired or want to try something different. A definite +1 in my books and would love to visit again in the near future.
