I have been a patient of Dr. Burns for over ten years. I see her for my yearly women wellness check ups. Last week I saw my primary care doctor who recommended I see my OBGYN as soon as possible. I called Dr. Burns office and they wouldn't fit me into their schedule for a week. But I took solace in knowing I was seeing my doctor who has treated me for so long, I trusted her, especially since my diagnosis may require surgery. I showed up for my appointment only to be turned away, as they stated I was a half hour late and the doctor already left for the day. I showed up at the right time, I even got their voice mail confirming it! I asked to see her partner who was still in the office treating patients, and was refused! They don't see each others patients. I explained how this was an emergency. They told me I needed to go to the ER or a quick care, and the women had such a smug look on her face. I was so disgusted and tired of arguing to people who obviously do not care, so I demanded my records. Which they wouldn't provide to me for another week. I have never been so displeased with a physicians office. Especially since I work in the field, no professional courtesy, let alone they could care less about their patients. If this is the support staff that Dr. Burns wants to depend on and surround herself with then I can no longer trust or rely on her as my physician.
