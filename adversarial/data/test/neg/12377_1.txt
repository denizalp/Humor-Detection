$5 Sun -Tues !!! You can't beat that price!!! I must admit after 5 minutes of waiting there I was contemplating leaving.. It was so awkwardly quiet, there was only one lady working and she didn't even acknowledge me when I came in.. But I'm glad I waited because my eyebrows came out nice! So if you don't mind the wait which for me was about 15-20 minutes definitely check this place out! \n\nHot tip: don't forget to sign in when you get there !!!
