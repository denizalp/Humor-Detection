Just finished our meal at Daddy's. Great oysters! Our choice if scallops and crab cakes were a good introduction to creole food if lacking in a touch of distinct flavour. My partners blackened catfish and rice flavoured with jalape√±os was an excellent choice. My mixed seafood platter was naff. The lobster was obviously frozen and broiled with no pleasant flavour or texture. It was stuck to shell. The shrimp were not broiled to a delicate texture or flavour - they were gnarly and dried out. The scallops were fine and the blackened catfish and mixed veg were great. The service was super and the ambiance pleasant. Just a thought, if you go to a hands in meal of fish, then surely your hands should smell a little of the food? Fresh in Florida is still the best
