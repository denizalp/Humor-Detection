Service was really slow, however we were there on lunch midweek. I can look past those kind of things, next problem was our food. My buddy ordered a hard taco and two enchiladas and I ordered Mexican story fry. Food comes out and his \"hard\" taco is SOAKED in grease and juices from the enchiladas. My meal was alright, really greasy though. Just based off of this experience since it's my first time, I won't say I won't come back. It will just be quite a while until I give it another shot. Would not recommend to anybody.
