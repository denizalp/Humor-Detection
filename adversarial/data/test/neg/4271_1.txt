Cakes On The Move has done 3 cakes for me now and every time I am blown away with how wonderful they are.  The owner is easy to work with, doesn't make promises that she can't keep and always delivers the most beautiful and delicious products.  Not only will she deliver on time, she will set up the cake for your event to make sure it looks perfect.  The flavor and design options are amazing and I have never had cake left over at the end of the night!
