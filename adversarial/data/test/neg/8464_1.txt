Finally a clean movie theater ! I really hope it stays clean, somewhat quite and comfortable ! Seats are wonderful. Bathrooms were spotless . \n\nThe only downfall : parking. Pretty pricey parking garage near theater.. but beats driving around forever to find something decent . But that's Tempe for yah ! Bring exact change or charge to ur credit card. $12 for two hours. \n\nOur new favorite theater for sure!
