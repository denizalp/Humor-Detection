Academy of Scuba Rocks!!! \nAll the staff  and instructors at PV and Metro are helpful and knowledgeable, Dominic, David, Marsha, Mark, John, just to name a few.  My son, boyfriend, and I just started diving this year. I bought my own equipment after I got my open water certification. So I have a lot of questions. Everyone is more than willing to help and don't mind me picking their brains for information. \nThere is such a family atmosphere whenever  I have gone into either shop and also at the scuba socials that that we have attended. \n\nAcademy of Scuba has been a positive experience in my new found love. I will be diving for years to come. \nThanks Academy!!
