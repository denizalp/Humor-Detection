The food alone deserves five stars. We had the steak skewers, 3 cheese mac, lobster ravioli and crisp chicken sandwich. Oh em gee! The wine list was also very impressive. What really made the experience excellent was the service we received from Reylin and Jordan. They were very attentive and friendly, they also went out of their way to acknowledge my birthday. I highly recommend to anyone visiting Las Vegas!
