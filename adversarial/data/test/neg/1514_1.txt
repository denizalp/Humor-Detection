One of the very few Dim Sum places that still offer morning special (before 11am) on week-ends. Nice Variety of special dim sums on the menu, one of my favorite dim sum and dinner place for Chinese restaurant. For those who struggle with the parking, the underground parking has tons of space, the entrance is the north west corner of the plaza.
