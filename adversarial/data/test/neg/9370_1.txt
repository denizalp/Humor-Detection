I was staying at the Marriott hotel next door and they recommended Sonoma so I went there for dinner.  I returned again for lunch the next day and then dinner again that night!  That's how much I enjoyed it.  Unique food combinations, great service, cool atmosphere and a reasonable price.  I will definitely return here the next time I am in Pittsburgh
