If you're interested in getting soups or sides I suggest calling and asking ahead of time what they have since it changes daily. Their cauliflower soup is the absolute best!! They have a monthly vegetarian sandwich that can often be made vegan and their sides and soups are clearly labeled vegan. They also usually have vegan chocolate chip cookies that are incredible! I haven't had any of their other desserts but they look amazing. Just be aware if you go at peak lunch time it can take a bit to get your sandwich (sides, soups, and desserts are ready right away).
