Great Italian comfort food.  Terrific staff.   Friendly service.  Fun experience.\n\nLots of variety among experiences of fellow Yelpers regarding Italian Restaurant.   I have been a Bianco fan for decades and will continue enjoying Chris' restaurants if this one is any indication.\n\nThe friend I had dinner with is as picky an eater as I am, so we each had the same dish:  the eggplant spaetzle.   It was excellent.  Homey and well seasoned.   We confess to spying on other diners.  Not only did all of the other dishes look very nice, the comments we overheard were all enthusiastic.  \n\nThe atmosphere was busy, but well managed.   It is a fun, funky trattoria, the kind of place you would find in an Italian village.   Well, almost.   I was delighted that some of my favorite servers from Pizzeria Bianco were serving here as well.   Chris must be doing something right to maintain such a loyal and competent staff for so long.
