Once again, I have a conversation with a friend that leads to, \"have you been to Scratch yet?\"\nIt's easy to wax on their - best brussel sprouts I have ever eaten, or the incredible chicken and biscuit but this meal is memorable from start to finish. The ever changing cocktails, the fresh local inspired specials all the way to a few choice perfect deserts. Head up the hill. You will be glad you did.
