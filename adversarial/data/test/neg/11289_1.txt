Our family loves North Scottsdale Pediatrics!  We primarily see Dr. Gerlach and couldn't be happier with her.  She's very knowledgeable, patient with my 100 new mom questions and she's full of great advice!   What I love most about this practice is they can always get me in for a quick appointment if needed with whichever doctor is available and they always have a doctor on call to answer any questions I might have during non business hours (I've used this service too many times to count).  I feel really lucky to have found them!
