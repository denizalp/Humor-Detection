Absolutely some of the best BBQ that I've had anywhere in the country. It holds up against the best in Texas and across the South. In fact, the only spot that I've had definitively better barbecue is in Austin. \n\nThe service here is fantastic, even taking time to greet you in the line while you wait. Supposedly the line can get ridiculously long around noon, up to three hours on the busiest days. We were able to sneak in with a 30 minute wait around 2-2:30 pm, and still had the choice between a few kinds of meat that weren't sold out yet.\n\nWe settled on some of the pulled pork and chopped brisket, with potatoes and beans. The beans were insanely good, as was the meat.\n\nThe Nutella pumpkin pie was delicious and was highly recommended to us, while we waited on the line. It definitely didn't disappoint! Not sure if it's a seasonal special for the fall, but get it while you can!\n\nWe'll definitely be heading back to this place soon!
