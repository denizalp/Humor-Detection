I have tried a few Mexican restaurants in the area, and this one is my favorite. I have been there twice now and both times had good service. The food is sooo good. There is a burrito there called Noreno Burrito and it has pulled pork and chorizo in it, it is amazing. The salsa is really good, it tastes very fresh, and has pieces of cilantro in it, which I love. The ambiance is pretty typical Mexican restaurant, nothing special, but nice. The food is very good.
