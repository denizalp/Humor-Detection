Although there are already multiple locations around town and have been long established in California, my first two visits has been at this location since it has recently opened up in the airport area.  Initially the prices here a sort of high for a fast food place and the food is comparable to Denny's, but not necessarily sit down since you order at the counter.  However, they do serve you the food and the employees go around asking the patrons if they need anything else with their meal. On a brighter note the quality of the food makes up for the price and I can say you get your money's worth, which would make me pick this place over Denny's. They also have a yelp check in burger combo for only $5.50, which I have yet to try. In addition, they have daily specials, which also makes it more affordable.  I like the decor of the inside which is definitely a step up from all fast food joints because it gives off the country vibe and homey feel. Farmer Boys will indeed be seeing more of me and I have already started recommending them to my family and friends.
