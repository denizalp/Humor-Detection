At a convention here in Vegas and decided to eat at the Wicked Spoon as we were eating several people that we knew came to eat as well and sat near us at the bar table. The staff harassed us practically the whole time saying they couldn't sit near us unless they paid an 18% gratuity. Ruined the whole experience for everyone. The food was ok the atmosphere is great.
