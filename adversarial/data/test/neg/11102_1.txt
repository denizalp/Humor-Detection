I like this place a lot. It's extremely reasonably priced and all of the ingredients taste healthy and fresh. It's almost a fast food price but with proper restaurant type food. The atmosphere is also enjoyable. I like the interior design of the place very surfer type vibe. I also like the bar there as well. Great price for great food
