Holy holy holy cow!!! This place is a hidden gem! We came here as a large party for my sister's birthday and everything, I mean everything was excellent!! The female server was very accommodating and was running all clientele arriving promptly and appeared effortlessly. If I can give the food ten stars I would! The fried wings and chicken are superb. Spicy rice cakes!! Omg go with the noodle addition it makes it perfect. Everything we had was delicious, even the kids corn dogs and fries. We will be coming many times for sure. Thanks
