I've tried most of the buffet places in the strip (bacchanal @caesers, Arias buffet, Bellagios buffet, Monte Carlos,.....) I still think wicked spoon is one of the best buffet wise.  Not as many varieties as bacchanal but quality wise the food is good.\n\nMy suggestion go eat buffet for brunch. $10 cheaper than dinner price and go to a nice restaurant for dinner.  So many high end restaurants that you need to try at least one.
