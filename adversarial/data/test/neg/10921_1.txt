Incredibly slow service. It took 15 minutes for 2 orders to be placed before I could order, another 10 minutes to get my order. \n\nI ordered the roast beef and turkey sandwich. Contrary to earl's slogan, this was definitely not the best sandwich I've had. In fact, I'm sure I've enjoyed subway sandwiches much more.\n\nThr only redeeming part of this experience was the cashier. The cashier was so friendly and welcoming which made the wait feel less bad.
