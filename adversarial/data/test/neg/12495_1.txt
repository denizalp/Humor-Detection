My second visit to Evoke, this time for colour, was equally as pleasing.\n\nHonestly, the best highlights ever!  Look completely natural, like my own natural highlights.\n\nDee did a fantastic job.\n\nWas a little dubious about the colour we chose to go with, but now that it's been a few day, am really liking the new look.\n\nWill definitely be back.
