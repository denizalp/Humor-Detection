My friend and I went to check it out and I was very disappointed. The restaurant is very small space. They were running behind and we waited for our food for 20 mins. Obviously short on staff there were 2 girls making the food and the man that was a cashier and also talking to customers a lot. It was annoying waiting for so long mean while there were 2 couples Infront of us waiting for their food too. It felt unprofessional. But I will give a 3rd star for the food. It was good. But I expected more of the portion. The prices do speak for the portion. I won't go back to sit down and wait for my food but if I would go back I would recommend take out.
