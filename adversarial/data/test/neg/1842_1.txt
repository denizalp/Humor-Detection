Totally neglects the Sunalta\/Bow Trail lot. Often find beer cans, vomit, etc. All the lot lights are always off (except the pay machine of course). So good luck if you are a female walking to your car alone at night. Many complaints about this. No one ever calls back. They rarely plow the lot. Especially over the weekend. So if you need to come in on a Monday morning be prepared to park elsewhere and pay day rate. There's no way you are getting in!
