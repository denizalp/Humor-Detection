When I shopped at this store I was not that impressed , maybe it's because I went in the evening and the store was a mess with clothes on the floor and it looked unorganized but I do like  there selection with there home goods in decorating your home  and there are some really wonderful smelling candles . There prices are good so that's a Plus , I'm only giving them a 3 Star based on the  way the store looked when I walked into the store because they do have many nice things.
