Very overpriced! The pizza was good, but everything was \"an add-on\". They did not have the crispy crust listed on the menu. They forgot to give us the prosciutto on our pizza and the artichokes on the salad after paying extra for them. This was all at dinner time. Lastly, when you pay that much for pizza, they should at least deliver it to your table.
