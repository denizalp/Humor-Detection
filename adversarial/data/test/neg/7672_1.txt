Dropped in here with my girlfriend late on a weeknight, and found it totally empty, which we didn't find surprising. We were greeted with excellent service, and we enjoyed having the place to ourselves.\n\nI had a glass of Chianti and a pepperoni pizza (really great combo), while she just had a pasta primavera, which she found truly exceptional. She is picky with her pasta, and still will cite this dish as one of her favorites ever. We were surprised to find out the family who owns it is not Italian, but they cook like they are! \n\nHighly recommend Jz's for your Italian cravings. The service is kind and professional, the food is delicious, the pricing appropriate, and the ambiance is nice for a casual family outing.
