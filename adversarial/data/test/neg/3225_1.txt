Open later than the nearby shwarma places so I go here when the better places around have closed - ie donair kebab house on yonge\/gerrard by the big slice.\n\nI suspect the restaurant was better before changing names from my experiences with the restaurant and what the other reviews suggest. Service was \"ok\" as was the food. I'll be back but the other places have to be closed first.
