I ordered cold noodle and pork stew, but so disapponted with the taste and quality. I know they are offering cheap food but hope they can do better. The cold noodle is not cold enough, and the broth taste bland. pork stew tastes like they put alot of MSG. I'd better go to another place to have Korean food.
