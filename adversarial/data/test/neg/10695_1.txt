John is the nicest most professional individual I have ever met.  As a single mother I frequently get taken advantage of by mechanics, so I am a wary and skeptical consumer.  John saw my daughter and I struggling along on the road late this Sunday evening as I had the bad luck of running over two enormous screws and completely flattening my tire.  John went out of his way and asked if I could use any help.  He should wear a cape, I didn't have a spare so I was really stuck!  In record time this wonderful man patched my tire in the TWO gigantic spots the screws left and I was good to go.  To top it off, he refused to take payment for his hard work.  I honestly didn't even know people like John existed anymore.  I am completely humbled and grateful.  If there is any doubt whether to contact John for services, DO.  He will really take care of you and is a trustworthy and caring individual.  Thank you so much John, I am sincerely a customer for life and will recommend your services to absolutely anyone I know in need of a mechanic for any reason.
