A quick update on my feelings towards this Matsuda. \n\nI went there yesterday with a few of my friends  because we were craving sushi so of course Matsuda is our go-to place. \n\nThe food was great, always fresh and hot\/cold (whichever it needed to be). \n\nThe only thing I need to comment on is the new servers that they have hired. They are oblivious to their surroundings. I witnessed a server look and walk around aimlessly, confused and full of worry. She had no idea what she was doing. (This didn't bother us because she didn't need to serve us) Another server comes around and starts clearing plates off of people's tables. She came to pick up one of our tempura baskets and realized there was still one in it after she picked it up. She immediately said sorry and put it back down... and laughed it off. She did the same thing to the table beside us. Moments later she came and took the basket without even looking at it... We haven't touched it yet but ok.. take it i guess... I would also like to comment that this server smells really bad. She has insane B.O. and is in need a breath mint. \n\nNow our bill payment was kinda difficult so we required some extra assistance. I went with 3 others so 2 of us were paying individually and the other 2 were paid together. None of us had the exact change (we all had $20+$50) combinations. We required change, but separately. Now the server (with the b.o) came by to help us with is. She asked us if we needed to split it so I said \"if it would make it easier then yes can you do that for us?\" She immediately says \"no\" ..... what? You did not just offer a split and then say no... LOL WTF. \n\nAnyway, still a really hot spot for AYCE sushi and it is still recommended. There's always people who come and go in businesses so I'll let it go this time.
