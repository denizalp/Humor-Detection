I was originally a walk-in with a kinda unusual request to have a micro tattoo on my finger... I was lucky to find Colin!  Colin got exactly what I was looking for. Colin was amazing  in giving advice about placement, color, etc.... Colin is an amazing artist. I look forward to going to see Colin to get more great tattoos.
