I love all Big Lots overall for their reduced prices and awesome deal. I have been to many across many stares. This specific store exceeded my expectations by having the absolutely BEST services from all their employees. Mac, Dean, Q and Sandy all have gone above and beyond on several occasions. Dean and Mac are absolute lifesavers in the furniture department and super accommodating. Manager Sandy makes sure she is always there to help and is as pleasant as possible. Q is at checkout and has to be the friendliest, kindest and happy cashier I have ever encountered. Thank you to this wonderful team at this location!!!
