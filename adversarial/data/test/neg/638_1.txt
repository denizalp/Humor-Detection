First time to this place was great !! Service was amazing !! I had the chicken & waffles it was really good!! I'm from New Orleans and it tastes like home. Only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 was the watermelon they should leave watermelon as it come sweet they added something to watermelon and it's horrible!!! And the syrup for the waffle was a nice touch as it's mixed with bourbon. And omg the apple butter spread with biscuits was bomb lol !! Must try !! I hope they 86 the watermelon other than that everything was perfect.
