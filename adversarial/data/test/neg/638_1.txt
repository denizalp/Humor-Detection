Went there tonight for a date with my wife. We ordered drinks, apps, and entree right away. Received our drinks after 10 minutes and after 45, still had NO FOOD. Everyone else seemed to be waiting a long time as well. The bad reviews seem warranted by our experience tonight. Waitress was nice and very apologetic but the kitchen must be a mess. Who knows what the food is like.
