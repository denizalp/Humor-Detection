Great bar in a great city. Went out there this last Saturday night. Huge games, great decor, expensive drinks(vegas!) bartenders knew there stuff and from what the wife said they were strong but tasty. Downtown vegas is thriving and this is just another option, I would make a point to come check it out if your in the neighborhood. If I could come up with something bad to say it would be that the bathroom lines where long at times but that's just a bar that's doing great business. Happy partying. Cheers
