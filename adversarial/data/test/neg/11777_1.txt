If you from east coast you need to try this. This is truly west coast eats. The sandwich i ordered was the fairfax and i added turkey sausage and avocado to my sandwich for an additional $5. The sandwiches are little in size however the taste is out of this world. The sandwich is made right in front of you and done in 5 mins.  No long lines. Great flavor. Organized clean location. Id order two to really be filled if you are very hungry. They dont have any fries or side orders at this place. Overall spent $14.61 for this.
