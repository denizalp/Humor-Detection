CenturyLink is most difficult Company to deal with that I have ever experienced.  Overcharges and very bad Prism connections MOST OF THE TIME, difficult time seeking help with customer service and hangups when I needed more answers to my questions.\n\nI finally got rid of Prism but kept the internet because the company would charge me $200 if I quit the internet per my contract.  After speaking with a very nice gentleman in the Retention Department I received discounts on the internet portion of my new bill.  I expected the new charges to show up on my bill as I had a confirmation number.  Not so!!!\n\nCenturyLink continued to charge me the full amount of my old bill and I have not been able to get a conclusive answer as to why this was happening until today.  They owe me about $130 for which I will receive as credit on my account.\n\nBe very careful if you sign up with CenturyLink.  They don't know what they are doing.  It's not worth the hassle or the hours on the phone to solve problems.
