Waited so long for a frozen yogurt place on Coventry! Very cool that they vegan options of yogurts too. Went in for the first time and was excited to see gorgeous decor inside and a delectable array of toppings for my cup of yogurt. I chose vanilla and was disappointed at the consistently because it was runny. They were also out of cup so they improvised with cheap clear plastic cups. Overall, the concept is good. I am going to wait until this opening period is over and give it another try.
