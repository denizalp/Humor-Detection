These folks are amazing--my iphone died unceremoniously, and both Verizon and Apple 'geniuses' told me it was kaput for good. not only would i need to fork over money for a new phone, but my plan would change and goodby to unlimited data (plus the privilege of paying 30 bucks more for less service).  In a last-ditch attempt to subvert this damage to my wallet, i tried Ubreakifix. Lo and behold, an hour later they emailed me that they fixed the iphone! And all for $30! Now i can keep my longstanding unlimited data contract and avoid purchase of new phone.\n\nThe moral: don't believe your phone provider or seller when they tell you your phone has died. Get Ubreakifix to take a look at it--chances are they'll raise it back up from the dead for $30 bucks. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!
