WOW, simply put, this was one of the best meals I've ever had.  I had the pan seared salmon.  The salmon itself was excellent, very juicy and perfectly seared.  But the surprising part was the garnishes... there was some kind of garlic butter spinach on top, and the plate was lined with a pesto sauce (can't remember what kind).  The tastiest part of the meal, however, (besides the salmon) was the creamed white corn that the salmon rested upon.  I've never liked creamed corn (from the can) but this was VERY good.  It had the consistency of Cream of Wheat, and not the nasty, slimy creamed corn you used to eat as a kid.\n\nGreat, great food... I will definitely go back, I'd like to try one of their steaks next time I go.
