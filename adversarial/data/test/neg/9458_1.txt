I have been here twice to get a regular wash cut dry. I can't recall who my stylist was for the first time, but Ricky helped me the second time.\n\nBoth times, I left the salon feeling happy and satisfied. The artists know what they are doing and they do a very good job at it. I have thick, long hair, and each of my visits have been over an hour - stylists take their time and get super detailed with the layers and shape. Even the hair washing lady was super nice. Can't say enough good things about this place.\n\nHighly recommend Ricky! Call for reservations!!!
