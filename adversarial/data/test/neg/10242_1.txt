This place is fabulous!  I have ordered multiple times from here and am so glad they now have a dedicated kitchen so they can more even more delicious creations.  Most recently they made me a lemon raspberry cheesecake that not only looked super cute, it tasted amazing.  They were very easy to work with and accommodating of my special request.  You must try them for your next occasion!
