This is the older outlet mall in Las Vegas and it's not as shiny as its newer counterpart downtown but judge a book by it's cover! It has a number of stores that offer incredible deals because they have new competition a few miles away! One of my favorites is the Sean John Factory Store (only one in Las Vegas), it has the same product you'll find in the department stores at unbelievable prices! When you're next in Las Vegas, visit the Las Vegas Outlet Center and the Sean John Factory Store!
