We ate here as part of a dinner party after a wedding. We sat in the Pope Room, which was perfect for this situation. It had a giant lazy Susan on the table so you didn't have to pass around hot dishes to get food. Our waiter was attentive and nice and prompt. Very similar to other Buca restaurants I have eaten at, which is a good thing! Makes it predictable! It was a great place for families and large groups of people\/parties.
