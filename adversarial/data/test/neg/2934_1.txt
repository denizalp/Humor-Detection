Do not hit this place!! Be careful with your bill! The first few times we wrote it off to mistakes...after that it seemed deliberate. Ask some of the regulars in there..consistent overcharge. We will never go back after 5 times wrong bill. Drinks are terrible! Bartender has a really bad attitude every time we have been in there. I feel like they assume that you are \"too drunk to know\". It's really frustrating!! We will never be back.
