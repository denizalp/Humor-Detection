I pay a lot of attention to other women's nails in Cleveland and always ask where they get them done.. after hearing about Fantasy Nails 1000 times, I thought I should give them a try. Why did I wait so long??? There were numerous techs on hand and my gel manicure was done in 30 minutes. And the quality? Unmatched by any salon I've gone to in Cleveland before. I highly recommend this spot.
