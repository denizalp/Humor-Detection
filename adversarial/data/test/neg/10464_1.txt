One of several antique shops on Main Street I must say Medusa's is probably the most innovative, but also the most cluttered.  Featuring two long rooms full of odds n' ends plus several hand crafted pieces of furniture and art there is a whole lot to explore here for those willing to take the time.  With friendly, informative, yet unobtrusive owners and a great soundtrack playing during both of my visits there is always something you WANT here, if not exactly something you need.  Sure prices trend a bit higher than other antique shops, but so does the quality.
