Came here on a whim while browsing the local sports car dealership. Thought about buying a Ferrari but got hungry so I came to this restaurant. Just so happened to come during this special buffet that yelpers are talking about. Was pleasantly surprised with how good the food was. I took a decent amount of everything and thoroughly enjoyed it. Indian food at other places can be overly spicy or overly dull. The food had great taste and perfect spice mix and the food had a nice quality taste to it. Definitely recommend it to others who are in the area purchasing Ferraris. Or just if you're hungry.
