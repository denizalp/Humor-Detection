It was pretty decent a bit pricey for a cone and soft serve. There are alot of choices for different green tea treats. The place was packed when I went there of course it was like over 100 degrees outside. The soft serve was good it tasted just like regular green tea ice cream but in a soft serve form. Great for anyone who loves green tea.
