Went on a quiet Sunday night.  Staff was very attentive and we sat at the picnic table on the second floor.  The room had a cool feel to it, and the lighting was just right.\n\nThe food was amazing.  Everything we had was spectacular, especially the sausage bites.  The flat bread pizzas were also very good (we had the duck).  Next time I might go for the $200 have every single tapa in the resturant deal.  Beer selection was great and bartenders were really friendly.\n\nAll in all a great addition to Charlotte's uptown restaurants.  I will be going back time and time again.
