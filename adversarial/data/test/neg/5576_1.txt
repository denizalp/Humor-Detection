I have mixed feelings about the beach club because there were high and low points. While I want to give it four, I have to say my review counts as three because of the music and the eye candy. I'll elaborate further.\n\nThe high points: Beautiful outdoors area, with roomy cushions and cabanas to kick back in if you don't feel like dancing or want to socialize (but socializing is a little hard due to how loud the music is, even outdoors). The beach club is designed well, with two huge bars on opposite ends, and even some stripper poles by the poolside cabanas for some entertainment and laughs! We were able to get one of the cushoned beds by the pool, and also was hooked up with two bottles of champagne. Also, it was Wednesday night, that meant it was Industry Night and open bar! Awesome!\n\nThe low points: The music... I wasn't really feeling it. While they did play House, it was House that seemed a little difficult to move to (sort of like Dubstep, beats that were difficult to flow to). I\"m big when it comes to DJs and music that spin stuff you could flow and find rhythm to, and I couldn't seem to find any here. I was getting annoyed at one point because if there was a song I knew the beat to and attempted to dance, it would end up dropping some other awkward beats into it that would mess the flow up (that's just me though!) Also... MAJOR lack of eye candy (for the ladies!) There are plenty of beautiful women EVERYWHERE here, but for the ladies... where are the beautiful men?! This also leads to the whole social vibe of it... again, not really feeling it.\n\nAll in all, I personally feel like its a good club to roll through in to check them out, but I've been to better ones in the aspect of good music and a better social scene.
