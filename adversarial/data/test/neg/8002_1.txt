I've seen Carolina Beer Company on many occasions as I ran from one terminal to the next, never able to stop. Based on the reviews, good reason; but on this particular occasion I had about 45 minutes before my next flight and I was starving\/craving a salad. I sat down at one of the cleanest tables (there were not many), and waited for my server. She came over promptly and I asked if I had time to eat before my flight in 45 minutes. She said I did so I gave her my order for drink and meal. She wrote down the order and proceeded to go to 3 other tables to take their order. \n\nFifteen minutes later I received my drink order. The clock was ticking and I was squirming as I knew that if it took 15 minutes to get a drink, it will most likely take longer for a salad. The server (who was very pleasant) came back to my table and asked if I needed another drink. I told her no but because I only had about 15 minutes before my flight I needed my salad to go. She came back about 5 minutes later, I paid and left. \n\nWhen I got to the gate and opened the container I was not impressed at all. The tortilla chips were minimal; the lettuce slightly wilty (not all of it, but enough). It looked like a nice, hearty salad but I realized that they put the salad in a 3 divider container sitting on top of a liner, making it appear to be a large portion when in fact it was not. \n\nWould I go here again...not for food. Drink only with ample time to spare. \n\nAlso, clean your tables and hire more help.
