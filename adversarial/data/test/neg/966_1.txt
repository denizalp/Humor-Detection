Went there today for the first time.  I never saw the doctor because when I walked in his practice and saw all of these people laying on tables, I decided it wasn't for me.  Who wants to see people getting treatment while they wait in the waiting room?  Not me.  Then the doctor called me back and there was a man in the same room that he was going to adjust me in.  No privacy, so I left.  It was like a chiropractic mill.
