I absolutely love this store.  I've lived in Kensington for 6 years and wish I had spent more time in the store.  Really disappointed that the store is closing in March of 2016.\n\nThe staff is friendly, knowledgeable and very helpful.  This weekend they set up my girlfriend with her first pair of cross-country skis.  Jim took nearly an hour to ensure that she was fitted properly and was outfitted in the best (not the most expensive) equipment specifically for her needs.After buying her skis, I looked around MEC and other stores to price compare, the prices at Lifesport were far more attractive for the same gear.  I was tempted to tell fellow shoppers to go to Lifesport for better price, selection and service. \n\nAs an avid disc golfer and cyclist I love this store as well.  Truly will miss it when it's gone.
