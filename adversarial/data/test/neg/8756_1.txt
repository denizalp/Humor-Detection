Our server was nice, but food sucks. I ordered cream pasta, but They gave me the wrong dish.  They didn't apologize and didn't offer me discount. I tried to eat what they gave me wrong instead of cream pasta I ordered, \nbut I couldn't eat even a bite. Food was terrible. Now I understand why they serve food in the dark. I'll never go again.
