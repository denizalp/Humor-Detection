Great spa and poolside service!  It was a busy spa day but the place is so big that it wasn't annoying.  My aesthetician did an amazing job and recommended a product that I bought for skin brightening. \n\nUsually at other spa pools, the wait service is barely there for food\/drinks.  Let me say the 3 people that worked on Sunday, June 26 were amazing, nice and attentive.  I've never seen people that work so hard in this heat.  It made the entire day enjoyable!  Also, the food and drinks were awesome!!
