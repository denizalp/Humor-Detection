Came here with a group of 4, decided to come here since we were staying at Luxor.  Started off with a nice selection of sourdough breads and ordered a (overpriced?) Merlot, which wasn't anything special.  Ordered the Kobe meatloaf with foie gras and truffle which was decent but definitely couldn't make out any foie gras or truffle.  Bill came out to 200+ for 4.  One of the members of our group found rocks in his food and they tried to play it off as it was uncooked rice which was a pathetic lie and didn't even apologize for it.  The food is way overpriced and the service is average at best. Go somewhere else if you want a good dining experience.
