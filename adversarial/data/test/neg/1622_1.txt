Cool place - but I was there for a school\/networking event so I do not think I got the full experience.  With that being said, if I am ever in the area again, I'd stop back there and try out dinner.  \n\nFood.  The food was good, but not crazy good.  However, we only ordered 5-6 appetizers to share (versus getting a meal).  We tried their truffle fries, a few flat-breads, and potato chips.  Like I said, they were definitely good.  Just not anything really unique or outstanding.  I think I liked the flat-breads the most.\n\nThe waitress was very attentive.  She was always coming around checking in ensure we were ok.
