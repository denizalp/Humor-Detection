Great products at affordable prices.  I like the style and quality.  The line to checkout though is abysmal.  Spent as much time looking around as waiting to pay for 2 small items.  I would come here more often if I didn't have to wait almost 30 minutes just to checkout.\n\nThe restaurant is good.  I like the chocolate cake, meatballs, and mashed potatoes.  The line is quick at the restaurant.
