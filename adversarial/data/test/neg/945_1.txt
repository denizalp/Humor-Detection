+\nONLY $20.00 for dinner menu!!\nawesome variety mexican\/american\/asian\nloved their mashed potatoes and mac n cheese\nthe desserts were well portioned \n\n-\nour server wasn't very nice, and by the time we were all done our table was super messy because she hardly came around to pick up any plates. she was also very sloppy when refilling our drinks. ...maybe she was just having a bad day?
