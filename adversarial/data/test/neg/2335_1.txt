We had an amazing meal here about an hour ago before the game. We looked up healthy places to eat in Pittsburgh and this place came up. They have a wide variety of options for meat lovers and vegetarians alike. All their food is wood fire grilled. The service here is so kind. I'm definately going to recommend this place to everyone. We will be returning very soon
