super great food! great prices for the amount of food that you get. we got the crab puffs and garlic edamame to start (HIGHLY recommend). then I got the crab fried rice for an entree and loved it! I got a whole lot of it too, so there's leftovers :) other good entrees are the evil jungle princess and the pad see ew!!
