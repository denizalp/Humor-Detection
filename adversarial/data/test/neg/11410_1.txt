This place is great for groups, has a warm atmosphere and the owners are really nice. Food is decent to pretty good pub food. In the summer the patio is the place to be. Great Lake view. Service is a little slow but the atmosphere is worth it. Rent a paddle board and come back for lunch :) perfect summer. Winter has a great outdoor rink out front and after a skate a specialty coffee or beer is order. \nCheers!!
