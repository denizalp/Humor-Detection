Enjoyed our meal. We had the Kokomo, a meatloaf sandwich w a crispy baked mozzarella cover, tasted like a meatloaf parmigiana. \n\nWhat stood out for us was the excellent service from our server, Laura from Kentucky. She was very professional and experienced. She provided things to us without us asking, for instance an extra plate. I always ask for suggestions when I'm at a new place and she was so helpful. Hubz ordered a beer and didn't like it. She offered to substitute it with something else, but he declined. Love when we get great service!
