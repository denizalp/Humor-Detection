On the plus side, the food itself was good.  I enjoyed my lobster\/pasta dish (decent amount of lobster, interesting flavor with the pea grass, or whatever the correct name is) and my husband's lamb shank (Mission Impossible) was good.  By the glass wine selection was also good (and hard to fine usually at nicer places).  Service was pleasant and fast.\n\nMy issues with LuLu, though, were varied:\n- Various menu items didn't come as described (and we weren't told of any changes).  For example, the \"polenta\" for the lamb dish was really grits and the pate was described as having 3 types but only came with one.\n- It was incredibly loud inside.  To the point where it was impossible to have a conversation and ordering included a lot of pointing.\n- While that great by-the-glass selection was appreciated, the wine that came for my husband's first drink came from a bottle that had been opened too long.  Bottle selection was a bit limited.\n- And I know this is not the restaurant's fault but just seemed to top it off: when I went to use the ladies room I found a man in there, using the facilities, with the stall door open.  And yes, I double checked that I was in the right place.
