Very very small portions for the price. Food was very basic, not anything to brag about or even bother going a second time. Service was ok. Priced wrong for the salad but didn't have time to point it out. Salad was not flavorful, turkey sloppyjoe was plain and the turkey sandwich was just ok. Spent about $45 for only 3 people and left hungry.
