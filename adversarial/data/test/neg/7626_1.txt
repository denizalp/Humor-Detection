I have a bad experience here first of all I pay a lot of money here and I was supposed to get a root canel and then a crown but they say I didn't need it so now I'm in really pain so I have to come back to get it and pay 690$ which I saw in the websit it say 380$ so I tell Monica she told me that is 380 and up but I didn't see the up in it so becareful don't go there they mislead the price and rude too. I regret to pay over 9000$ for this place . And they rush u in and out too I don't think is. Honest place . The only doctor is nice there is dr Robert but all the other doctor is not good. So I will never come back here again. The other doctor that did my teeth he no longer work there but after I got the vaneer it fell off I didn't think he have experience at all. Next time they shouldn't do false advertisement I'm really disappoint about this place .
