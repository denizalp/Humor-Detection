Such caring management. I had the Facebook QR code and I guess the numbers weren't working and he managed to work his magic and hook us up. \n\nUsually we get margaritas when we come for lunch but it's dinner time haha. \n\n\nThe bowls here are jam packed with delicious veggies and fresh cooked meats. \n\nMy absolute favorite chipotle :)\n\n\nHeads up, the lines get loooong!!
