This place is great if you can handle waits. First on a waterfront in AZ. Ok it's only a canal but gives you atmosphere. Second you eat with your eyes first so peruse the deli while you wait. Third decor was very eclectic. A lot  of ideas for the home. \nLet's get to the good stuff. Menu drinks did not impress. If you have a fav I'd order it. Next the bacon wrapped dates were yummy! Salads we delivered quickly. Our meals comprised of the spicy shrimp risotto and big eye tuna was excellent. The dessert menu was simply, but I'd head back to the deli for a pastry and to people watch.
