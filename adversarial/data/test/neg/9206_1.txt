Ordered delivery and ended up massively disappointed after waiting over an hour for our sandwiches and wings. We ordered two Italian subs, both had an inexplicable amount of dressing on them... as in, the entire wrapper was filled with dressing and the bread was soaked, too to bottom, like it had been dunked the stuff. My sub also had several brown, slimy pieces of lettuce to top it all off. Gross.
