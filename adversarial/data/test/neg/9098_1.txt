Loved N9NE in Vegas.  We went here bc a friend works at the one in Chicago so we got the hook up.  We had espresso shots to start....SO GOOD!!  We then ordered the Mediterranean salad and the lobster potstickers for an appetizer.  It was freaking amazing.  I could have ate like 12 lobster pot stickers.  I got the salmon for a main entree.  Sooooo good.  They then brought out this flaming smore dessert.  It was like a little campfire.  This N9NE was much smaller than the one in Chicago, but I really liked the food.  I would definitely go back.  They didnt rush us and were super attentive.
