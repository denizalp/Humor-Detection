I go to a few craft stores. Michael's, Hobby Lobby, and Joann's. I don't go for the fabric but I do swing by when I'm impatient to order pens\/watercolors\/sketchbooks\/brushes\/pencils online. You get amazing coupons from this place. The usual 40% or 50% off regular priced items is a deal I use constantly. If you have the app you can get really good deals such as 55% or even 60% percent off an item. As a student this saves me a lot of money. However, this store has probably the most locked up merchandise I've ever seen. I can understand why, considering how small and expensive certain merchandise is but they don't have any sort of way of contacting help (such as the buttons they use in Michael's). So it leaves you with trying to hunt down an employee which is very difficult. The place is understaffed and that's just a usual circumstance in most retail and food industries now a days, but it leaves you feeling frustrated. Usually the single cashier (sometimes two) are so busy that you don't want to interrupt them and if anybody is at the fabric station they're usually busy too. Some of the employees are kind, and others just obviously don't enjoy being there which makes me nervous to even approach them. I'm shy enough as it is and the standoffish attitudes just make me feel bad after the conversation. If you're going in this place for something quick and easy to grab then it's painless, and you get to use their amazing coupons. If you need something that's locked up (which is quite a few items if you're someone who specifically enjoys drawing) it'll take awhile to find the help, and even when you put in the request you can find yourself waiting awhile. Overall good deals, decent customer service, but definitely in need of ways to contact employees when you need something that's locked up.
