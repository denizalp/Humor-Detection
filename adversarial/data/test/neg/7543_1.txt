Honest diner food at a fair price. I am a big fan of their sausage and they have some of the best pancakes in Pittsburgh. A nice, family owned business. Yes, the service can be a bit slow at times, but if you are in that much of a hurry, hit the McDonalds drive thru.\n\nWant to correct an earlier reviewer... there is an apartment above the restaurant, but the owner does not live there.
