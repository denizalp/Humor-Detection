Well??? Let's see???? Where to start??? Had a reservation for 3, myself, my girl, and my mom (she was celebrating her birthday), So, Sat, 6:15 reservation, we show up prompt at 6:14. They seat us right away, and I'm excited, as is Kiri my girlfriend as we have already read the menu. The place is way tricked out cool, in d√©cor!!! but strike #1 very high celling's, making for an extremely loud dinning experience. However the booths are nice, the lightings very cool, but oh yeah strike #2, my eyes are pretty good as far as sight & I'm somber, but even w\/readers & my led smart phone flashlight, it's still very hard to read the menu??? Now you must understand that I have an onion allergy and if you do??? listen UP!: Starting with the apps, everyone of them contains onions of some sort & can not... I repeat CAN NOT BE PREPARED WITH OUT? WTF??? On do second course salads: every dressing is made with onions and your ONLY options is oil & vinegar??? Oh yeah!!! YIPPIE!!! I'm having a blast! strike ###3, but it got better, now I digress, Assuming now that our sever knows the allergy exist, we attempt to move on to main course: first up chicken scaloppini I order, Kiri orders scallops, and my mom, like me, chicken scaloppini, 10 mins pass, server comes back, and states that my dish has onions in the sauce, I say ok....what can we do??? she shrugs... IDK???? I ask her to please go back and ask the Chef what they can do??? 5min later, she comes back and says: \"the chef say's all the sauces, puree's\/grays have onion\", but still no word on what we can do??? I ask again, she say's IDK??? I'm like WTF??? please get me a menu so I can try and make another selection??? DuH! Now the table has been held up at least 30 mins??? Finally, she tells me I can have the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin on a bed of spaghetti squash!!!! YUM!!!! I ORDER! YES!!! 10mins later the manager walks up and says \"hi I guess there was a problem??? I say, no we got it worked out. I'm allergic to onions, but the server got me on track with the pork tenderloin!!! He said \"NO\" It has onions in the squash???? WTF!!!! many mins go by, he gets it straight w\/a potato puree instead, which I was told had onions, GEEZZZZ anyone still keeping up? Because only now does everything go down hill. Plates all come, my tenderloin that I ordered mid well (that slightly pink about 160deg internal temp inside, is all pink and bloody juice on plate....NO! Kiri's scallops are4 tiny scallops the size of a .50cent piece three seared only on one side and one not seared on either side and chilly cold in the middle???? WTF!!! we have to send our two plates back for do over.... \"RE-FIRE\" meanwhile, they leave my moms on the table for 15min and she waits for our food to return, only to have her's go cold....WTF! YOU THINK A PLACE LIKE THAT WOULD HAVE PULLED ALL THREE PLATES AND RETURNED THEM ALL HOT TOGETHER? I'm in the business and just call them as I see them???? SAVE YOUR MONEY!
