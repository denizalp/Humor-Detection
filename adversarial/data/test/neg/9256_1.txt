This was the first - and only - place I went to try on wedding dresses.  So glad that I went!  Trisha was wonderful and made me feel right at ease.  She did a good job listening to my likes and dislikes and encouraged me to try different styles and silhouettes to ensure that I picked the right dress.\n\nI'm thrilled to say that I found my dress!  I'm also glad that I went on a Sunday afternoon.  It was slow and I enjoyed the stress-free environment along with the individualized attention that I was hoping for. \n\nIf you are looking for a beautiful, new, designer dress at a great price, paired with great customer service I highly recommend that you check out Brilliant Bridal!
