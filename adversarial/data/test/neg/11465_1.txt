US Californian review here !\n\nWell, this was our final place to eat before heading to the airport. Sad, but what an enjoyable breakfast. \n\nYou can spot the restaurant from the street but the entrance is actually inside the shopping center. You will get seated by a hostess. It's spacious and it does have a table to fit 6+ right in the middle if you have a big party. \n\nI ordered the breakfast burger with French fries. It comes w\/ roasted potatoes so if you want French fries, you have to specifically ask. \n\nFood was delicious. No complaints at all. Great breakfast place to stop by if you're looking for one. I would definitely come back if given the opportunity.
