One of my favorite places in Vegas. I love the decor, the food, the service & their yummy drinks. This place hits the spot! The downside? the tables are WAY too close together! It makes things weird at times and some of the hostess are bitchy. Maybe their spanx is too tight? Maybe the loads of MAC makeup got in their eye. Whatever the reason is it's so not cute. But forget them and have a drink & a roll! ;)
