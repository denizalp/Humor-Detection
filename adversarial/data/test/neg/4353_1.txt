I've had him come out to my house twice prior to selling it - to fix a crack in garage wall, a corner bracket sticking out in the bedroom and the area around the washer\/dryer where the valves were replaced.  He does a fabulous job every time!  Shows up on time and reasonably priced.  And it's so easy to get an estimate and he gets back to you quickly.  Top notch service. I just moved and I'll be contacting him again.  Highly recommend.
