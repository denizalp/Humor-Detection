Our experience at this olive garden was mediocre at best. \nThe only reason they received a two star rating is because our waiter Tyler P. was absolutely fantastic. Let me start by saying they were ridiculously busy, however we couldn't have been sitting at the table longer than ten extra minutes when they kept coming by and asking if we needed anything else, as if to rush us out. Finally, we took the hint and went to sit outside on their benches. Can you believe at least four different servers went outside to ask us if we were waiting for a cab or needed anything else (our server included)? So I asked if we were not allowed to sit there and Tyler said he didn't care what we did because he was off the clock, not rudely though. So we continued to sit there and talk, when a heavier set white woman walked outside and asked us if we needed anything else inside because she was about to lock up. We said no, then about ten minutes later my friend asked if she could go inside because she just realized she lost her key and this woman wouldn't even open the door to let her in to look. She spoke to us through the door as if we were criminals. The staff was rude, unprofessional and happy to take our money but annoyed that we sat OUTSIDE on the benches to talk. I was visiting from out of town and had not seen my friends in almost six months and won't see them again for another year or so. They ruined my experience and when I come back into town I'll be sure to let everyone know this particular location isn't worth the time of day.\n\nUPDATE: I called the manager the next day to tell him about my experience with his less than professional staff, and his exact words? \"That Sucks\".  He seemed like he didn't care so I took the gift card he offered with all my money back since I can use it at any location.  Maybe losing business will help them care more.  All in all, I could not care less about $20, I just need them to get their act together.
