Ive gone here 4 or 5 times over the last few years  and really the only reason i'm writing this review is due to several of the negative reviews. I've never had a bad experience  there. One person commented on their beans being canned - i know what canned beans taste like and its so not anything they serve. I always get either just beans and cheese or honey. I Think their beans are amazing.  I even asked the owner how he made them and he was very gracious  to tell me how to make them in great detail.  It's silly easy, so easy and cheap it doest even make financial  sense  to use canned. I like this place and the owner was very passionate and friendly.  I will be visiting  again.
