So I wandered in here based on the yelp reviews.  I have never been let let down by my fellow yelpers and this restaurant is no exception.  The reviews rate it head and shoulders above the other eateries in the airport and I agree. In my opinion if a restaurant can nail the service, food and ambiance then it's all good in my book.  When you step in here you wouldn't know that you are in a airport anymore.  The ambiance is relaxing with a cool green interior.  Sitting at the bar with my back to the airport, I feel like I stepped into a cozy neighborhood restaurant.  The wine selection is excellent and there are plenty of delicious items on the menu.  Friendly and super fast service is very appreciated at the airport and I was thankful on both counts here.  I will definitely come back and would recommend for anyone interested in tasty food with a relaxing glass of wine that takes the stress of travel away for the time you are here.
