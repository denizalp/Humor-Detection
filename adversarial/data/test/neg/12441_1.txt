Had to use this place because of my home warranty.  My upstairs unit was broken.  It took them 2 visits over a period of 6 days to fix it.  A few days later my downstairs unit isn't working.  They caused a problem with my downstairs unit on purpose knowing that they will be called again to fix it, and make more money.  Bunch of scam artists and thieves, and they think it's ok because \"the insurance\" covers it.  Well the insurance doesn't make up for the fact that I have to live with no AC in part of my house for days.  They don't make up for the 75$ service fees either.  Lowlife scumbag company.  Will highly recommend to my insurance company to not do business with them in the future.
