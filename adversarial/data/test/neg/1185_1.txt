You don't order Chinese delivery if you are looking to eat healthy, but this place takes greasy into a whole new realm.  I seriously question their deep fryer, or perhaps their chef - I squeezed an entire paper towel's worth of oil from a solitary chicken wing - and needed another paper towel ...\n\nSome of their dishes are okay, the prices are cheap and they seem nice enough, but there's just no justifying a meal this unhealthy.
