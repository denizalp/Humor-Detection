This review is for their pizzas only. Its delicious! \n\nA piece of advice. If you tried calling them to place an order ... good luck with ordering.... it would take lots of patience not to yell at them for keeping you waiting on the phone for over 15 mins just to order food. SOOO... do yourself a favor and order online on Yelp.
