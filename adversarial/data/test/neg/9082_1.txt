Had a birthday dinner with ten friends here recently.  Everyone raved about the food from start to finish.  Our server was friendly and accommodating and offered good suggestions whenever we asked.  The port room is a nice venue for a private party - just keep in mind that it's a wine cellar so a tad on the cool side!
