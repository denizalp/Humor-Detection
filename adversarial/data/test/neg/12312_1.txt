This is my go to when I'm wanting pho & warm comfort food.  Especially good on a cold fall day or when you have a sore throat and can feel a cold coming on.\nThe broth in the pho is incredibly good and the ingredients are fresh.  Considering it's made to order the food comes out quick. This place is full for a weekday lunch at 11:30.  Service is quick and friendly.  Restaurant is clean and quaint.
