I like this CVS store as it is convenient location right off of Peoria & 35th avenue. It is a very clean and well organized store. Items are easy to find because there are signs posted were their items are located in the store. A lot of the time when you go in to buy things they have things on sale, which is great. Since right now we as a nation are going through a tough time, and if can save a little money it certainly helps. I also like that they have a Red Box located right outside the store. So if I would like to rent a movie, I can on my way out. My only complaint us that when you go to check out, there is never enough cashiers. There is always a long line when you go to check out. Other wise this CVS store location is nice.
