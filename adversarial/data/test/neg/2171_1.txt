If you are into the Avengers, this is the place to go especially with young children. I brought my 9 year old son who loves anything Marvel and he enjoyed it very much. He loved the idea of him having his own device where they can take pictures, answer questions for each station and at the end, purchase their own ID card\/credentials. \n\nRight now, the following specials for the store are as follows: \n\nPlush toys - buy one, get one 50% off\nTshirts\/tanks - buy one, get one 50% off  or buy 3, get one free\n\nThe workers there are very pleasant as well.  You don't need to purchase any tickets if you just want to go to the store
