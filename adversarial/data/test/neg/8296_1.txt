I found this place on Yelp and it was highly recommended by most people, so I gave it a shot. I was very pleased with the customer service and thorough approach Jeff has. I brought my 2003 Mazda Protege 5 in for an oil\/lube\/filter and tire rotation and it was only $30 without any coupons (which turns out they don't offer; on another note he was kind enough to give me a 10% student discount on another service I had there for a more costly front brakes job). Jeff is very professional and honest from what I have gathered for the few times I've been there. He even had my car on a lift and proceeded to show me some things that were off-kilter, but not imperative to address. I also had a coolant leak inspection while there and he suggested replacing the radiator cap to see if that would help before replacing the whole unit, which ended up working which was awesome (and saved me over $400!). Talk about great business practices by not screwing me over (unlike Purcell Tires tried to a few times at a Gilbert location). It's nice to have finally found a worthy establishment that I don't have to be skeptical on each time I make a visit. Thanks Yelpers for recommending!
