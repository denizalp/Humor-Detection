This is my third or fourth time coming to Barroco Grill and I keep wondering why I don't come here more! I had originally planned on going to Chipotle but the line was wrapped around like three times. Then the lightbulb went off and Barroco was in my head. \n\nThe food is so fresh and the homemade arepas make this place worth the money. For what I get at Chipotle I would have paid around $11, and I paid $12 here for fresh, authentic food. I really need to stop forgetting about this place!
