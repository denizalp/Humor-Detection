My Husband and I went here on our last trip to Vegas. We got the Prix Fixe and let me tell you, it was delicious. Our plates were clean and we couldn't wait for the next course to come out. On top of the great food they served us a nice bottle of red and white wine with our meal. The staff was friendly and very attentive. I was afraid since we got the Prix Fixe they would not be very concerned with us, but treated us as if we ordered a more expensive meal. The place had a great ambiance and was a romantic setting.
