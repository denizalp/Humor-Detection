My dad and I come here weekly to sit at the bar and have wings. The wings are.. wings, but the real reason we come back every week is the customer service. Before we even sit down, be it Amber or Dave doing the bartending, they already know what we're having to drink. Always super friendly, talkative and attentive, you know that every time you go to Native - the waitstaff will make sure you're treated right!
