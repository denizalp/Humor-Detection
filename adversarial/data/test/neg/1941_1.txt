I'll start off saying Hugo was always professional and understanding throughout the whole deal. I just gave up. I held off writing this review because I was giving them the benefit of the doubt but, at this point I have found enough wrong that I feel like I was robbed. I was referred by family. They did a great job on my father in laws house. I was not so lucky. They were supposed to start painting on Monday and finish Wednesday. It rained and was windy so they didn't get started until Wednesday and the whole job was rushed and done terrible. I was charged extra for them to scrape and prime the Eve's of the house. This was my primary concern for having the house painted. They never got scrapped and I had to ask multiple times to have the nails from the previous owners Christmas lights removed. They only did the first story. The Eve's on the second story are peeling already and look terrible. There is overspray everywhere. All over my patio and front door. I had to clean it off the handle. Even on my cars. I had to remind them to paint the stucco wall (which I was charged extra for) They had to come back 4 times and I just got tired of being a pain so I gave up. The final straw is when it rained and my front door paint faded from the water. After further looking I have found large sections that were not painted. They left a pile of trash in my backyard the size of a car. Which my dogs got into. They did terrible work and charged the normal price per square foot as any other painter so just find another company. There are plenty out there. They did knock $100 off my $2900 bill for my troubles. Yay.
