Awesome Agent!  I hope my agent on way coast was more like him.  He gave me excellent full service and provided with what i needed.  If i needed a handyman,  he would introduce me to a good one.  I needed him to negotiate between multiple offers we got (Thanks to big contribution of him) so we settled on highest offer than what we expected.  He walked us thru the whole process and made sure receiving went smoothly from open house,  appraisal all way to closing.  2 thumbs up buddy!!!!! Thank you and I will always use your help for real estate in Vegas
