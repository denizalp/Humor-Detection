How Moxie's has so many restaurants I'll never know. They brand themselves as a family friendly restaurant but we all know they are just a more refined Hooters. \n\nThe combination of horribly overpriced and lackluster food plus not so great service made for a very unmemorable experience. \n\nOn fridays they have some drink specials. The G.T. (their take on gin and tonic) goes for $5.99 and it's pretty decent. The Bad Boy Beers are something I've only seen at Moxies. They are essentially oversized bottles of Corona and Heineken and go for $7.99 on Fridays.
