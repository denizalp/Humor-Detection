I wouldn't bother coming here. There are so many good food places in town. The server was very attentive and provided great service, but the food was just mediocre at best. I was lucky enough to have coupons, but I would have been very upset if I paid full price for this food. I had the sirloin steak and it was lukewarm by the time I got it. The sides were unimpressive.
