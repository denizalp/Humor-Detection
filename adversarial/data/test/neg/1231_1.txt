This was my 4th trip. Every time I am treated like a valued customer. The lady that I believe is the owner always comes out and checks several times to make sure everything is to your liking. \nAs always we get more in an order than you can eat. You can't get better value anywhere. Two can eat from one meal. This makes the outing very inexpensive if both people can agree on what to eat. They have a great menu. I especially like the house chicken. \nThe quality of food is excellent. Everything is fixed fresh while you wait. The rice is a very good quality. Cooked correctly, never mushy as in many other places.  You can't get a better quality anywhere in the area. Go see them!!\nYou will be back often.
