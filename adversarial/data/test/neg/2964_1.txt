Amazing job done quickly and efficiently. Staff was great with the exception that the front desk clerk could have a bit of a better attitude. Other than that I would recommend Las Vegas Collision Center to anyone needing body and paint work. I received my car back way quicker than i had anticipated. They did a fabulous job and provided a lifetime warranty on their work.
