This place is a legit 5 star place.  Lots of beautiful people.  I never realized the beautiful people of Arizona hang out in Scottsdale.  Chopped salad, pork belly pastrami, short ribs, scallops, dream jar, coffee, and the wife's sangria.  All well prepared, with quality ingredients, presented artfully and timely.  Frickn Scottsdale, had no idea, my boy TR3 would love this town, lotsa tall white people.
