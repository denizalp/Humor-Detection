This is one of the first times I am in concordance with other PGH Yelp reviews. This place is pretty awesome and has good service and value. For about $4.50 you get a 'small' chicken burrito, which is actually huge. The chicken is really well-seasoned (obviously) and juicy. Their smoothies are great as well and the spicy cilantro garlic sauce they give you is really tasty without being too garlicky or spicy. The thing with the burritos and quesadillas is that with all the fillings, the flavor of the chicken doesn't always come through. I keep meaning to just order a big 'ole whole chicken some time, but it's hard to not order a burrito when a burrito is on the menu. In summary: this place rules.
