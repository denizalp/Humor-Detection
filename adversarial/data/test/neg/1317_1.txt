I waited one hour after having an appointment.. my friend was brought back then I waited they said a few more min and then it was like I was forgotten about... then once they figured out i've been waiting for an hour they try to rush me to get my nails done.. no thank you. I will not spend my money at this establishment.. and you should never over book yourself. Horrible customer service. Absolute crap.
