A huge fan of Joey's Seafood, I was worried about the change to North and South.  How could a restaurant double their menu and maintain their quality?  Well, they did!  I've continued to enjoy the good seafood, especially their Monday Night crab legs special, shrimp, and hush puppies, and I finally broke down and tried brisket from their smokehouse menu. It was delicious!  I enjoyed their sweet barbecue sauce, too. I'm still a fan!
