Friendly staff and good authentic Chinese food. Sustained me for a couple weeks before exams. The tea part of the bubble tea is great and better than the other options in Uptown. However, the boba is consistently hard. \nWould not recommend the smoothies though--they have an odd blender like metallic taste.
