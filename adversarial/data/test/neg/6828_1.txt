Its not hard to find sushi in the Phoenix area though finding a locally based sushi spot is a bit tougher.  Finding local, high quality sushi?  Tougher still.  Finding local, high quality sushi at a reasonable price?  Yeah, good luck.  When people ask me for a recommendation for a good local sushi restaurant, the first place I always recommend is Hana.  A small comfortable neighborhood sushi spot with good product that won't totally crush your bank account.  Chain sushi places can deliver good sushi too, though often at a premium and in a fancy environment requiring requisite attire.  Well ladies and gentlemen, I didn't think I could recommend anything better than Hana.  Until today.\n\nAs I write this, Harumi Sushi is currently ranked as one of the top 10 highest rated restaurants in the Phoenix metro area on Yelp.  Seriously, check if you don't believe me.  There's five star reviews aplenty for this place even though they have almost no social media presence and no website.  I live just a half mile from Harumi so this place has been popping up on my radar for awhile.  Today I finally took the plunge.  The restaurant is fairly plain on the inside with a little bit of artwork around food prep area, but otherwise just simple tables and chairs.  Seats about 30-40 folks from what I could tell.  The owner (and head chef) Juno and the waitress on duty both greeted me and seated me immediately upon entering.\n\nTo start, I used the Yelp Check-in freebie for free miso soup and edamame.  Yes, they honor it and both dishes were excellent.  For the main course I was going to go with their staple, the Harumi roll.  The waitress gave me a look like \"that's all you're gonna eat?\" so I quickly sprung into action and got their Oh My God roll too.  Crisis averted.  First, the Harumi roll.  Shrimp, crab, purple rice, and avocado wrapped in tuna and topped with a spicy mayo blend.  Fantastic dish.  Rich flavors but not as heavy as I thought.  Next the Oh My God roll.  The first OMG about this roll is the presentation.  They bring out the roll wrapped in tin foil while the tin foil is on fire (I'm dead serious).  Don't worry, the waitress unwraps the foil for you, revealing a rainbow of colors.  Ingredients on this one include crab, shrimp, avocado, purple rice, eel, and tobiko (almost like a caviar) topped with eel sauce and that spicy mayo.  Oh My God yes.  Not overly spicy (though it does have some kick) and the two sauces smooth out the flavors perfectly.  The rolls were both huge (10 pieces each).  Somehow I had room (or motivation) for dessert so I decided to try some of their mango mochi ice cream.  Essentially a light mango rice cake with mango ice cream in the middle.  It came as four little bite sizes on the plate.  Clean, creamy, delicious and capped of the meal in spectacular fashion.\n\nAll together the free miso soup, free edamame, fountain drink, OMG roll, Harumi roll, mochi ice cream, and tax totaled $35.  I tipped the waitress $10 as she was super attentive and friendly the whole time (even though she scared me into ordering a second roll).  I enthusiastically thanked her and Juno for a wonderful meal.  Between the food, the service, and (most astonishingly) the price, Harumi sets itself apart from a saturated sushi industry in Phoenix.  I don't live next to major body of water, but Juno could've fooled me.
