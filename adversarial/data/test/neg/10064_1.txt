My boss and I were out in Phoenix on a business trip and stumbled upon the Arrogant Butcher while looking for a place to eat. It was during Phoenix's restaurant week, so it was perfect timing. The place was very busy, but they were able to immediately seat us - awesome! \n\nI ordered off the Prix Fixe menu and got the following: artichoke hummus (amazingness), beef short rib stew (heaven in a bowl - great mix of spicy bold flavors), and blueberry cheesecake (excellent - the buttery graham cracker streusel is out of this world!!!). I went in with no expectations and was blown away by my dinner. The flavors in each dish were simply perfect. Service was good; our waiter was very friendly and the food came in a timely manner. This place is a must try! I am sure I will be visiting the Arrogant Butcher on my next trip back to Phoenix.
