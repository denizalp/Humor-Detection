First time at Wong's definitely won't be our last \nwe gave 5 stars because we had substitutions and special requests ( no shell fish and make everything except the orange chicken super spicy ...even dishes not normally served that way ) everything was great . The place was clean  . The food was fresh . Service was great  \nYeah we will be back
