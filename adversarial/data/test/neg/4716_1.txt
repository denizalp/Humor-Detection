We ordered take-out as we were headed back home to DC.\nYup...dinner in the car. Anyway the Shrimp with Broccoli was good. The Singapore Noodles was okay.\n\nBut we asked them to leave out the MSG so that undoubtedly effects flavor. Either way it was a satisfying dinner as much as one can expect in a car anyway.
