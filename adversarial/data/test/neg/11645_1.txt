The MOST AMAZING steak of my life! And I'm not even a steak person! I had the sampler with an American steak and 2 Kobe\/Wagyu steaks. I have never tasted anything like it in my life! It literally melted in my mouth!! I had the signature salad, which was so simple, yet incredibly flavorful. Our waiter, Brian (I believe) was THE BEST waiter I've ever had in my life. Incredibly personable and attentive. He was extremely helpful with my food allergies. This was one of the best meals I've ever had in my life!!
