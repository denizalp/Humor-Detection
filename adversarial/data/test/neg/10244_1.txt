It was my first time at Melt on an early Thursday afternoon. The wait wasn't long. I expected a bit of texture from the Peanut Butter and Banana sandwich. Overall, it was bland in terms of the peanut butter and cream cheese, the bananas were mushy, and half of it had herb cream cheese on it. The mixed berry preserves were good and dipping made my sandwich taste like a jelly donut. The pop was pretty flat but the service was good. I will give it another shot with a different sandwich, I don't recommend the Peanut Butter and Banana one. My sister loved her Northcoast Shores sandwich. The fries were average.
