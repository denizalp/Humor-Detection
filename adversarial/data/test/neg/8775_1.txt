The employees got all mad because i wanted to try the clothing on before buying it.  Above the shelves it says to see an employee to try things on but you dont wanna let me when i do?  I apologize that i dont know my size with the particular brands you sell here before coming in.  Prices are good and all but they made me look through racks of clothing to find similar clothing to try on instead.   What a joke this place is.  Youre a clothing store isnt it more of a hassle for me to take it home unwrap it and then having to log returns then just letting a customer try on clothes before buying them?   Horrible customer service\/policies
