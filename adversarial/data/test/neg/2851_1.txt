I love breakfast foods.\nAnd it's not that hard to screw up.\nAnd when you do screw up breakfast an angel loses its wings.\n\nWe stopped by Vegas, coming back from a roadtrip from Colorado to California, so you can imagine the exhaustion we all were feeling, hoping that a good meal would revitalize us.\n\nThis place had some high reviews and it's labeled \"American Traditional Breakfast\".\n\nOnce you step in the place it has that Vegas ambience with slot machines out in the front, then you actually walk into the restaurant and it's like a blast from the past, tacky 80s decor. Neon lights, dark dim lighting, tacky carpet, tacky lamps, everything is so tacky. It's not even a nostalgic, retro tacky. It's like that horrible decor your estranged aunt on your mother's side uses. Bleh.\n\nWaitresses and busboys were generally polite, but also kinda ignored us... they were busy, wont hold it against them. Plus they have to wear these awful uniforms.\n\nI ordered an omelet, I forget which one, but I remember it being HUGE and full of scallions. They could have chilled out on the scallions...\nMy cousin got the biscuits and gravey, and it wasn't anything special. Just two biscuits and a heaping pile of gravy. The portion was too big for such plain flavors.\nMy mom ordered the eggs benedict and her face of disappointment made me not even want to try it. She said it wasn't bad though, but my mom is usually too nice for her own good.\nI also got orange juice and I never imagined being disappointed with orange juice... it had a weird flavor to it... like they added sugar to a fresh squeezed OJ. Why would you do that if that is what you did....\n\nI left pretty angry and dissatisfied.
