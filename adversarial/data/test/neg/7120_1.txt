To Gary and his wonderful staff,\n\nOur boring backyard has been transformed in to our own little oasis!!!\n\nNeal and I can't begin to express our appreciation for a job \"very well done\"!  The entire project ran like clockwork.  The planning and execution was seamless.  Your work crews are craftsmen, very skilled and meticulous.\n\nGary, the project started with your creative design.  You listened very closely to what features we wanted and you incorporated those ideas into a masterpiece we now proudly call our backyard.  Throughout the project, your team was very responsive to any concerns or questions we had.  As our daily point of contact, Mike was wonderful to work with.  To say that you and your staff went beyond our wildest dreams in the quality of work and customer service would be an understatement.   \n\nOur backyard project also included a spa built and installed by your company, Spas by Design.  The quality of your spa is untouchable.  Also, I can't say enough about Bob Campo, your sales manager.  When, as new spa owners, we were having some concerns about how to maintain the proper water quality, he came right over to help with a big smile and words of encouragement.  \n\nGary, this is what we learned about you during our backyard project.  You LOVE your work.  You're very good at it.  You run your company with integrity.  Your word is golden.    \n\nWe can't thank you enough!\n\n\nNeal & Lori
