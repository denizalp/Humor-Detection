Was ignored when I came in... ended up seating myself. Was ignored for 10 minutes (the place wasn't busy) before someone had to ASK if I had been helped... with what 10 tables and 4 servers... you should be able to keep track of who has been helped. Got ONE cup of industrially bad coffee... food took forever to serve, and I never even GOT the potatoes that were a part of the meal (this is a common complaint if you read all the reviews)... Food was not even that good... the sausage gravy is commercially bought, not fresh or the least bit authentic.  Sat for another 15 minutes waiting for someone to take my bill (again, another common complaint) and finally ended up going to pay it at the register (where I was also ignored for a few minutes).\n\nOn the bright side, it was dirt cheap.\n\nWent to Amelie's Bakery (the annex on Tryon) where I was greeted with smiles, great food and wonderful fresh coffee. Shame they don't serve a full breakfast there!
