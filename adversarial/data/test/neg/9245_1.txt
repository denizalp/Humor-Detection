I'm not sure where the reviewers Robert R. and Ken C. formed their opinions, but it was not about Mahomet IGA.  Brooks Marsh and all of his managers are some of the kindest, customer-focused people I know.  IGA takes it's role in the community very seriously while contributing to the local economy.  Their commitment to hiring local students and taking their extracurricular schedules into consideration is astounding.  The bakery is the best and the store carries a good variety of foods.
