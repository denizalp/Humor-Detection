My review is not about the service at the Spa but about their gift card policy. I wish I knew this so I'm posting it for others. If you don't use your gift card within a year they deduct $10 every month there after calling it a maintenance fee. I have never heard of such a ridiculous rip off policy before at any establishment. DO NOT BUY THEIR GIFT CARDS!
