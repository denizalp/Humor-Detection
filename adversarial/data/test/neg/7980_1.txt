I'm sure Drais was a fire hazard with the amount of the ppl packed in the venue.  NO ROOM to breathe.  DJ sucked ass kept stopping in the middle of songs only to play another song.  Played snippet of some songs 4 times in one night just TRASH \n\nCan't vibe out when the best part of the song isn't played. And please please ladies if you ain't cute to get in for free, or missed the guest list window, or if you can't pay the money to get in then please stay out the damn line   This is Vegas Have some damn money!!\n\nDrais can do a better job of indicating transitional humps from the walkway to the dance floor as well.  Truly a lawsuit waiting to happen.  Spilled drinks all over the dance floors and walkway.  Totally unsafe for ladies with heals.   No one seem to be maintaining the safety hazards of the venue on a continuously basis.  However, security on the other hand is everywhere.  \n\nDrais totally have room for improvement Sound system was great and Ladies bathroom should be manned to expedite flow and cleanliness as well. when there's a long line you can't see which ones are available in case the ladies in front or too tipsy or blind to notice.  so basically you're waiting for no good reason
