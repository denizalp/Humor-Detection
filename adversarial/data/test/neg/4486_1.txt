Today I went for my first appointment with Jennifer and had a great experience at the Mount Lebanon location. The salon was clean, the staff friendly, and I was taken on time.  The place was relatively busy on an early Saturday afternoon, but still maintained a welcoming atmosphere.  Jennifer took the time to ask me all about my hair, and also made some good recommendations. The prices were reasonable--cost me less than similar style at another salon--and my hair looks great!  I'll be back.
