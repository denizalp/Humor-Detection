I have to credit Burberry and Amanda for going the extra mile. I was looking for a sale item that although sold out in the store was available on line. Amanda guided me through the on-line ordering process, called me when it arrived and had a fitting room set up with other sale pieces she thought I might like. She even had water ready and correctly guessed my shoe size! Thank you for making my day.
