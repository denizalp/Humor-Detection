Great dinner experience!  First time at the restaurant and will visit again.  We had: Agedashi Tofu and Tuna and Avocado tartare to start, Crunch Roll, Yuzu roll, o-toro sushi and uni sushi.  The fish is fresh, O-toro melts in your mouth ($20 for 2 pc) and the uni is delish.  We sat at the sushi bar on a Friday night and were literally served our first few dishes within 4 mins of ordering, literally.  Great service, yummy sushi, good place!\n\nMost rolls are reasonably priced to boot!  $10-14\/roll..
