I thought the Deuce Lounge was  really nice inside - just like any other high end Las Vegas joint. It is much bigger than the Gold Lounge on the second level.\n\nThe ladies who work here are very attentive but again, like Gold Lounge, this place is not a club. There's really no one dancing...most people just lounging\/sitting around with drinks in hand.\n\nThe drinks are okay. Typical mixed cocktails - nothing out of the ordinary.
