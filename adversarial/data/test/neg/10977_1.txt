I absolutely love this place on all points. I went to Body English in the middle of Vegas' dead season (end of Fall\/start of Winter) and it was still the best place to be. \n\n-There are many attractive people there so it's a great place to people watch. \n-They make strong drinks, so it's a great place to get drunk. \n-They have an amazing venue where you enter on an upper floor and walk up to a hopping dancefloor which you get to by walking down a wide grand stair so it's just a great place to be. \n-and last but absolutely not least, they have the best DJ i have seen in a very long time. Classics are updated and mixed in with new jams seamlessly and the DJ certainly knows how to keep the vibe up with the right music selection and sequence.\n\nI highly recommend checking out Body English the next time you go to Vegas. I went there after a crazy\/no-sleep\/work conference week and still had a great time.
