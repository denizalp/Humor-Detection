The owner Agatha said I could come finish up paper work then at last minute things changed. After I was hired I was then told that I was no longer hired because they were \"implementing a new process\" and I could interview again for the same position I had already been hired for. I paid for training and was trained by the owner herself. I was welcomed aboard as a new B.S.T. Her words. I waited about 5 weeks for my paper work to go through and when it finally did I was told to come in and sign the final papers and that I'd be given clients.\n\n\nThat is what I mean when I say misleading. I had high hopes for a place named Agape.\n\n\nThe unprofessional part comes from that fact that I actual decided to \"interview\" with the owner's sister and she canceled on me while I was already in the office waiting for her. I mainly wanted to understand how a business would hire someone, then not hire them without any wrong doing on my part. I believe it's because my potential referral didn't have the right insurance plan. That is very unprofessional seeing as I had already been hired by Agatha but all of a sudden after it was clear that my potential client referral didn't have the right insurance things changed. I hope this more detailed review help others. If I had read a similar review about this company maybe I could have saved myself the trouble.
