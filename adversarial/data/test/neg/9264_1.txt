Moving is tough and hiring good movers can be scary. Some moves are good and others are bland and you end up with carelessness.  We bought a house and I was scared to hire movers after a past experience.  A Wise Move was recommended by my realtor so I tried them. Mike was awesome from the start. Process and prices are right up front and no hidden crap. Team showed up and worked hard and had me out of the apartment and into the new house all in 5 hours. They charge by the hour and work the whole time. They take time putting furniture back together and they cleaned up everything. I would hire them again over and over for another job. Truly an honest and hard-working company who knows how to take care of the customer!
