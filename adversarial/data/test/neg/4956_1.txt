Jessica Usher our Admissions Coordinator was a GEM!  I stopped in here completely frazzled and in tears on a Saturday after getting a distress call from my Dad at another facility. I wanted to make sure that I wouldn't be transferring him from one terrible facility to another. She was so wonderful even though I was a mess that it was reassuring.  She toured me through the facility.  Showed me the actual room he would be checking into.  Introduced me to the Occupational Therapist (on a weekend which I was told by their competitor was not a service offered by any Skilled Nursing Facility).  She prepped me for the discharge process from the place he was at and even provided me with her cell number in the event I had any issues.  I had tons of issues upon discharge because the other facility wouldn't release him until Monday. She gave me her personal number in the event that I just needed to talk. She also told me who would be covering for her when she was out of the office. She made sure Lacey the Admissions Director knew the full scoop so I could get my Dad out of the other facility as SOON AS HUMANLY possible.  She was extremely patient as the facility he was at didn't complete the proper paperwork resulting in an unnecessary medical transport being scheduled.  When we got to the facility they had just finished installing a new bed for him and his call button was working (seems like a basic amenity but it was one that we didn't have at the prior place). We got him all settled in on a Monday and the Dad I hadn't seen smile in days was finally comfortable enough that he would be getting the proper care that he relaxed.  He was immediately assessed and was scheduled for OT and PT.  I thought he should be getting more time with them then he was because of the paperwork I had received from the surgeon.  However, when I inquired the nurse and the amazing Jessica were able to show me that the orders they received didn't include that information.  They worked with their professional staff to ensure that he got the services he needed and he was on the road to recovery. Laura Shepherd was the insurance case manager and she was able to assist us through the check-in, services and discharge process properly even getting the items he needed to continue his recovery at home coordinated.  This isn't the ICU ward of a hospital where the nurses run every time a buzzer is pushed but they responded to my Dad in a timely manner and gave him the care and attention he needed to recover. They even arranged transport from the facility to my Dad's cardiologist for a follow up.  Their transport company Dignity is so great. They were patient, thorough, personable and safe drivers. La Estancia made it very easy for me to assume care after he transitioned to my house.  They provided me clear and accurate medication and post-discharge instructions. Everything Jessica told me was accurate, honest and compassionate care.  Anytime I had questions with this process, medicare, etc. they were patient and informative.  I haven't been through this before and having someone help me to navigate the process was truly priceless.  La Estancia has great PT\/OT services scheduled as needed so if your needs require some time daily you can arrange it.  I would consider this facility again should the need arise.
