This was our first dining experience here and it was a Saturday lunch. When we walked in the door the interior of the restaurant was very very loud. Obviously chain management must like the feeling since we noticed the same sound level at the 7th street Culinary Dropout.  Blanco isn't as loud. We sat outside to avoid the noise despite it being 107. The shade and misters mitigated the heat a little. Our waiter was prompt and attentive. This was a day when brunch is served and we had a heckuva time working out available pastries. We finally got our intended \"appetizer\" less than 30 seconds before the main course. My wife enjoyed her breakfast burrito. I had a chopped chicken salad which included blue cheese and it was great. The muffin and scone were good too. As this was an anniversary lunch we got a free peanut butter and chocolate dessert. It was great and reminded us of what was lost when Modern Steak closed.  The brunch wine list was puny but we asked for the full list which is still small but included an Argentine Torrontes which is a wine we enjoy. There was also a good looking  Sancerre. Finding our way to the restaurant was not easy. When you get there you have to pay $6 for valet parking plus a tip, of course. We had a good lunch but are not sure if we will return.
