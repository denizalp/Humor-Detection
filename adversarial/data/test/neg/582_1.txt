Wasn't impressed. Probably my least favorite Hampton I've stayed at. The room was clean but very worn. The paint on the tub was chipping, the refrigerator was so loud  like it was overheating or something that I had to unplug it just to go to sleep, I only took the stairs because the elevator sounded like it was on its last days and took forever to open, move, and close. My room was also right next to the exit door so I could hear whenever that heavy big door was being used. Everything else was fine and that's why I give it three stars but I travel a lot and there are plenty better Hampton's than this one.
