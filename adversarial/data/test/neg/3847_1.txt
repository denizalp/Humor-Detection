The hype about Moxie's is nothing really. They are an overrated franchise chain that tries to disguise as an upscale restaurant where the prices are higher than average. The service is generally slow and of average quality (possibly due to the high stilettos and short skirts the waitresses have to walk in - definitely not a family restaurant). As for the food, the appetizers are all this restaurant can serve up best so leave the real main course meals to other gourmet restaurants.
