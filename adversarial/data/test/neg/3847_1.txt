I'm giving 4 stars because the food was good (had Kalua pig and cabbage) but the wait was ridiculously long. I had a Groupon that was expiring soon so I waited. I ordered takeout and the server brought out two malasadas for us to try while we were waiting. They were really good so we ordered some to take home as well. They make them fresh to order so beware...it takes awhile and just added to our wait time. Had I known this I may have passed on them. They ended up throwing in 4 extra malasadas for our troubles, which was nice. Next time, I will call on my order so it's ready to go.
