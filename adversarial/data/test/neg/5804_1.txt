We were looking for something quick for dinner and realized there just aren't many Chinese food restaurants in the area.  We'd already tried our closest one and wanted to try something different.  Then we remember Wok In Express on Gibson.  \n\nWent on a week night and the restaurant was empty.  Nothing special looking, but there are a lot of dine-in tables, which is surprising for your typical chinese food joint. \n\nI placed my order while my husband was still mulling over what to get.  He orders a teriyaki bowl and the man shakes his head no.  For a second we were wondering what this meant.  \"No\", as in \"we can't order that\"?  Finally he says, \"I can't let you order japanese food at a chinese restaurant.  I have to have it on the menu but it's just not as good.\"  This was puzzling.  I mean, why have something on the menu that you don't want to serve?  Still, my husband appreciated his honesty and opted for beef and broccoli instead.  The man threw in 2 veggie egg rolls and I got a free fountain soda for checking in.  \n\nThe food was ready quickly and the portions were large.  We both enjoyed our meals and especially loved the chicken fried rice!  The prices were OK.  I liked that they marked the takeout boxes to let us know which was which.  We'll definitely return when we're in the mood for Chinese takeout.
