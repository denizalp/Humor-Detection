Pretty darn amazing honestly.  Hate that it took me so long to check it out.  If I'm ever in the area I'll be grabbing a shrimp po boy with fried okra.  Although, I am curious to see how all they prepare such beautiful seafood.\n\nGet the shrimp poboy, have it breaded however you like.  Get some fries or fried okra and grab a tea while you're at it.  Thank me later.  That's it.  That's more than enough food for the first time trying this place.  The poboy is huge!  The shrimp are perfectly cooked, the bread was about exactly what I was looking for.  Spot on, one of Charlotte's best restaurants IMO.
