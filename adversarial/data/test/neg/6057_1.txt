I do not recommend this hotel (closer to a motel) to anyone unless you like being treated rudely and paying for it.  The entire staff was incredibly rude with the exception of a blond woman at the front desk who checked us out.  My husband booked through Expedia and when he called the hotel to confirm everything he also requested an early check in.  The staff not only gave him attitude they also decided they were going to charge him a $300 deposit.   This was not the policy of the hotel unless the guest paid cash, which he did not.  We should have known then to change hotels.  There are many options in the area to choose from.  Next time we know not to stay here.
