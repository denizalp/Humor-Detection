My Sister's Kitchen is like the new and improved Three Sisters.  They've renovated the inside so it is much brighter, cleaner, and nicer than it was before, but it is still a 100% old-school, cash-only, traditional American diner-type of place.  Pancakes still the size of your plate, coffee as you expect at a diner (fast and refilled quick).  Totally nice people running the place.
