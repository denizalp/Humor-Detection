This is very close to my new workplace and a great place to grab a yummy lunch and baked treat.  Yelp check-ins score a free cookie!  (Yesterday, mine was a crunchy snickerdoodle.)  I appreciate the gluten-free and vegan options and enjoy supporting a business with friendly staff people.  On my visit yesterday, I selected the grilled cheese sandwich (comes with bacon, turkey, or ham) with chips (the good, thick kind!).  My sandwich was filling and satisfying, loaded with cheese, avocado, tomatoes....In fact, I was so full that I didn't need dinner.  The cafe is comfortable with plentiful seating and cozy; I've spent a good hour or so on another visit where I happily read a book and drank a coffee.  The pastry case offers a good variety of treats, including vegan cupcakes!, and one can order items for pick-up.  Come support this local business and enjoy some great food.
