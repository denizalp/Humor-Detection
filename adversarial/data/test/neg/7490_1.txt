What's not to like about this place? From the cocktails to the friendly service to the mod atmosphere, this place is fantastic. I ordered the Field Table Burger which was very tasty and perfectly cooked. The bartender also recommended a good sparkling Chardonnay which was not too sweet but not too dry. And finally, I also tried the chess pie for dessert, which was absolutely delicious!
