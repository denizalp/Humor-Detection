Went for the lunch buffet while visiting the Bellagio. The spread was quite impressive, with many different types of food, lots of vegetarian options and tons of desserts. It was refreshing to find sugar free and  gluten free options as well as a variety of other decadent treats! It was totally worth the price for all of the amazing food they offer. \n\nI ate many different things, such as vegetable chow mein, a delicious chicken alfredo made with shells instead of penne, szechuan style green beans with vegetables, cheese pizza, cold orzo salad with sweet peas and a whole grain croissant that blew my mind. \n\nFor dessert I tried peach and raspberry sorbet, a chocolate dome (similar to a mousse), a butterscotch cookie and a mini vanilla eclair. \n\nI know it sounds like I over-indulged, but I don't regret a thing! Vacation is meant to be enjoyed and this was an amazing start to my trip!
