I was very pleasantly surprised with the food choices and artistry in presentation of many of the dishes at such a low price compared to other buffets. Great choice selection (not so big you spend you time walking around for 10 minutes trying to figure out what to have).  I loved the comfort food options, like bread stuffing and sweet potatoes and of course prime rib.
