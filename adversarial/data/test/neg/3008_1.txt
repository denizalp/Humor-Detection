I absolutely love this place! So many amazing things under one roof! Unfortunately, the only good vintage store left in Glendale but maybe that is why he has just opened his new location on 7th Ave. Which, by the way, is just as wonderful as his Glendale location but a little less saturated. No matter what location you choose to go to you will not be disappointed.
