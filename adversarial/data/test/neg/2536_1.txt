Ordered the BBQ Ribs and Chicken, jambalaya,  Butternut squash soup, dirty banana martini,  and Orange shake up.\n\nThe only reason there are two stars is because of the food (probably 4 stars and 1 start for the service).\n\nWe had to wait for our drinks.  The soup came out almost immediately after the drinks. \n\nThe ribs were fall-off the bone tender and the chicken was just as succulent. The jambalaya had generous portions of large shrimp,  andoullie sausage,  and chicken.  It contained nice chunks of green peppers,  celery, and rice. \n\nMy gripe is that our server failed to mention the specials to us once he finally arrived at our table.  We were made aware of this when the waitress at the table next to us named of the food and drink specials.\n\nOur server never came to our table once during our entire meal. My partner made a comment that it was a good thing we didn't need anything. \n\nTip: sign up for their VIP rewards program and only go when you have coupons for free apps or $ off your bill.
