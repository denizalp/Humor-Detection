There customer service is top notch. As soon as you enter the cafe they greet you warmly. The decor is pretty modern and contemporary. Everything was clean. We only stopped for tea and shaved ice. We enjoyed the mango mason jar tea very much. The taro shaved ice with pearls and jelly was delicious as well. I wish they had one in Greensboro, NC. It sure would thrive. We will stop in again in the future when we are in the area.
