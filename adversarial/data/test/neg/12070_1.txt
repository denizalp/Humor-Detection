My three friends and I decided to stop in for a bite during Port Credit's Busker Fest!  It was a beautiful, sunny, Sunday afternoon and it was so worth the 45-minute wait to sit out on the patio.  You can just sit back, relax by the water and watch the boats go by - such a laid back vibe.\n\nThe restaurant was modern and very clean.  Prices were excellent, given the location and our server, Aimee, was very friendly and attentive.\n\nI had the grouper sandwich with a side caesar salad - fish was fresh and cooked to perfection and served on a perfect soft bun; caesar salad was alright but nothing to write home about.  One of my friends ordered the fish tortilla (fish tacos), which I would have gotten but, the way the menu described it, I thought it was a wrap.  Anyway, she loved it!  Next time for sure I'll get it.  We saw a lot of customers ordering fresh oysters and they looked so delicious.  We passed on it though because we were all driving and figured oysters need to washed down with a lot of martinis!  Again, next time.  I would really recommend the french fires (with gravy) as they were just out of this world and had a longer life span than your typical 10-minute french fries - so great for sharing!\n\nIf you're looking to just hang out with friends, a romantic date or even have out of town guests, I would seriously recommend coming here.  We had such a great time!
