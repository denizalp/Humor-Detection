My sister and I stumbled upon this cute little kitchen while walking around downtown Concord. We stopped in for lunch and both got HUGE salads. The menu had tons of healthy options with fresh veggies and yummy sandwiches. While we were there, I also noticed a bakery corner with lots of cupcakes and pies. I ended up ordering a dozen cupcakes for a friends baby shower and was very happy with how they turned out. Leslie was so friendly and easy to work with, the cupcakes looked and tasted fantastic, and they were reasonably priced.
