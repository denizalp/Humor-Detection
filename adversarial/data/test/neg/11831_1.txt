Was introduced to Buldogis via their food truck at a recent foodie fest. After learning they had a physical location as well, I recently stopped by to check it out since they had even more to offer. Nice location, near Chicago Brewing Company. They have a great selection of unique hot dogs, burgers and sides. \nService and food were great. I had the Angry Dog. I'm sure I will stop in again another time and try something new.
