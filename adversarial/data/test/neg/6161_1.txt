This was one of the worst experiences I've ever had at a hotel. I booked a king room for 3 nights for work. I decided to extend my reservation by 1 night and tack on an extra night before my original reservation started. I booked the extra night through a 3rd party website. I assumed I would be able to link reservations when I got there. When I got there I was told that I could not stay in a king room the first night because I booked through 3rd party website. I asked for a manager and was told that a manager was not available and would be 20 minutes. 3 minutes later a manager showed up. I was told that no king rooms were available even though we could see that king rooms were available when we looked on the hotel website. When we finally got up to our room the carpet was completely wet. Please consider staying elsewhere if you are visiting this area. Customer service is not a priority here.
