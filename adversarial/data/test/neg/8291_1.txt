Second time I have eaten at Honey Salt and have loved it. The atmosphere is sort of antique meets retro with lots of eclectic items and mirrors on the walls. Adrian our server was fabulous and turned me onto the monkfish special. Had lots of fish growing up on the coast but never monkfish! We all enjoyed our food and the scenery. I know friends who come here just for desert and cocktails so I knew they would not dissapoint in this department. The \"Brookie\" is always a good desert choice and a glass of port or bourbon to wash it down completes the package. My only dis would be the entree portions could be a bit larger, otherwise would have given them a 5. Come here you won't regret the choice!
