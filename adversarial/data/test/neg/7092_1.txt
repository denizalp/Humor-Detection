This place has been on my \"want to try\" list for a while now and after reading some of the reviews on here, I became a bit weary.  Let me tell you, I am glad I tried it!  Not the best chicken I have had but definitely good.  I really wanted to try their monthly sandwich, the Chicken de Mayo, a fried chicken sandwich with chicken nachos, salsa, chili lime sour cream, cilantro and more on top.  It was a mess but also delicious.  I did take my time eating It though which made the chips go soggy but that didn't bother me too much though.  The meal came with fries which were great, a tiny thing of ok coleslaw, and a drink.  All of their pops are apparently homemade which is pretty cool.  I tried the black cherry, a personal favorite of mine and it was top notch, the ginger ale which was just ok, and the cream which was darn good.  I also got two wings on the side.  Although they were $2 a pop, I believe they were worth it because they are \"whole\" wings, with three sections.  I honestly found these better than the sandwich and didn't feel like they needed any sauce or flavored honey.  The meal was relatively cheap but when you go a la carte it gets pricey.  I was super full after eating everything and was completely satisfied.  If it were closer to me I would definitely come here more!
