This place is AWESOME!\n\nDefinitely the best experience that I have had while wedding dress shopping. The staff here was incredibly friendly and very low-pressure (which is so rare!). My situation is kind of a pain - I need a dress fast - and they did everything they could to accomodate me. They have a great selection, and this is a great option for buying off-the-rack since all the floor samples are very new. The staff is so nice, and they have great taste, they helped steer me in the right direction!\nPlus they give away the most adorable little gift bags at the end.\n\nOverall, a must-visit for any AZ bride!!
