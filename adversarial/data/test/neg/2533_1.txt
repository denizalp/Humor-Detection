This place is so cute and the prices are very reasonable for downtown Scottsdale. They have a cute interior and I am sure it even better atomsphere at night. If you have choice between chipotle or here come to this hip spot. I came in to place an order and their manager was super nice. He let me go home with one each sauce.\n\nI had their Brussels sprout nachos, shrimp taco and the guac and chips.\nThe best vegetarian nachos ever!! Loaded with perfectly roasted Brussels sprout, corn, melty cheese. Topped with an egg!!! Delicious!! The shrimp taco was loaded with fresh corn salsa and moist shrimp. The best sauces were salsa verde and avocado pur√©e. The were both on the milder side. But the other sauce were just as good, but too hot for my whimpy taste buds. Everything is great except for one down fall, what kind of Mexican restaurant does not have a side order of guac for their tacos and nachos! You guys could easily make money selling a little side of guacamole. So I ordered the guacamole app because this California loves her avocados. The appetizer is a generous portion of guac. Will definitely be back soon and not just for a lunch order to go.
