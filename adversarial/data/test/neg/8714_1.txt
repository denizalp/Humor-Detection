Rude people especially the customer service front desk girl, no formal manners, no formal training on customer care. For those that have spoken to the so call manager, I am pretty sure it is just one or two people who actually have manners. for those few reviews that say this is a wonderful travel agent, I am convience they must work for this place.  My story starts back in 2013, when I received my certificate after a timeshare presentation in my current living area, Las Vegas. I paid the Holding Fee for the trip, but unfortunately was not able to take the trip, so they were nice enough to cancel it and return my money back.... Fast forward to April 1st, when I receive a \"Final Notice of Credit\" letter. This surprised me because I assumed after I cancelled my trip I would not hear from them again. The first time I called, the front desk customer service girl took down my name, and said \"someone will call between now (noon time PST) and 6pm\"... she did not mention her name, she did not sound happy or friendly, nor did she even say good bye after the phone call, just hanged up... So I waited for the call and around 5pm I figured maybe by now I would speak to someone. No luck, same girl answered my call, told me the same thing \"some one will call you by 6pm\", in which I replied 'so by 6pm than?\" and she replied with a \"i told you before between now and 6pm\" and the phone went dead. I assume she hanged up on me. \nI finally called AGAIN today, got the same RUDE\/PLAIN\/Unfriendly girl on the phone and with out telling me she was transferring me to anyone or letting me know what was going on with the phone, I get a male voice that just said \"yes?\" I had to be the Operator and telling \"Hi, my name is Jenny and I am wondering if you can help me?\" his reply was \"um, ok?\" He told me that the letter was for me to tranfer over my credit to a VEGAS trip...Seriously?? I live in Vegas. When I told him no thanks, he said \"ok\", and befor he hanged up I asked for his name, he had to think about it and just said \"um, Aaron\"?\nDon't accept anything from them, not until they learn manners.
