Okay... was here again just getting some goodies for Easter\n\nand the chocolate-covered almonds are amazing!  Way more amazing than normal stuff you find at the grocery.  Try the almond bark, bring it to a party, and watch people just swoon over it.   I feel like this is a hidden gem in Cleveland.  I wish more people knew about this place, please try it and spread the love!
