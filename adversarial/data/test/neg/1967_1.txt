Went to Las Vegas last weekend and heard about the Marvel Avengers Station so i took my kids to check it out. My kids loved it i thought it was pretty cool too. Our tour guide was funny and excellent in explaining everything and was very helpful and respectful. It is a must see if your in Vegas it was well worth the ticket price.
