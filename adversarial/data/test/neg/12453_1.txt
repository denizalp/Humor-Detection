Service was great! Beer priced very well if you are okay with domestics! Had the pretzel which was awesome!! The cheese was not what I expected but good but the honey mustard was excellent! The atmosphere is definitely 'club' scene. The music was extremely loud and I'm not sure anyone is drunk enough for that volume of chaos at 4pm... but all that said, I would go back and hang out at the tables in the street and people watch!
