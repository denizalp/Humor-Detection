I had my implants done at Layman Shirman and Associates. Always a pleasure to work with Dr. Shirman and their staff. They do make sure the patients are aware ahead of time of when their appointments are and everything is ready before you come. I have always referred everybody I knew to this Dentist office and always received positive feedback.
