My wife and I arrived around today (Sunday) around 5:00 pm. for an early dinner.  The sign on the door read open Sunday 11:00 am - 10:00 pm. and the red neon sign read \"Open.\"  As we stood waiting to be seated my wife and I read the day's specials on the white board.  Then we were told that they could not seat us because they were closing.  We could get an order to go if we wanted - we did not.  I suggested that if they were closing so early that they should change there sign.  As we got into our car, the read neon sign went off.  This was not our first time eating at this Mayflower, but it was disappointing that they closed early with no explanation.  We went on up W.T. Harris to Harbor Inn Seafood and had a delightful dinner.  I suggest before your waste your expensive gas or put forth the effort to try this Mayflower that you call and make sure they are observing their posted hours!
