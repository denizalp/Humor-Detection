Very cool old school pinball and video games. Prices are good. 0.50 to 0.75 cents per play. The majority of the machines are in great working order. Would have loved to have given 5 stars but the old man who works there kept yelling at my kids for walking too fast and being too loud. Doubt we will be back.
