Ok we hit the jackpot again. All thanks to Mike who works at Pizza Rock. We came in a bit skeptical because the location is a bit out of side. But I'm glad we took the bus to the Encore stop and walked a bit. Ordered Chicken Korma, Mutton Biryani  and naan. The food was spot on very authentic, tasty ,good temperature and came out fast. If you like hot food this is the place in Vegas. Would recommend this place to anyone and I will be back. I only wish this that the owner would consider doing a ones a week buffet to experience the dishes. Overall I give them 5 stars. Keep on cooking :)
