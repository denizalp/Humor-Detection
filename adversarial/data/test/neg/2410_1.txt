Had tint done there last year and they did great. Bought a new vehicle and emailed twice over the past two weeks to get a tint Appointment and no reply. Guess they are too busy or maybe a change of ownership?\n\n\n5 stars for last year's tint\n0 stars for not replying to appointment\n\nI'll give 2 stars
