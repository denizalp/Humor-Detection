Absolutely wonderful. We just brought our newborn in for family\/newborn shoot. Brianna L is an amazing photographer..... she was so accommodating and really made us feel at home. When my husband and I were going through the pictures she had taken at the end of the session, we were shocked at how perfect they turned out. Really sweet girl with amazing photography skills. We will be back very very soon!
