The actual  attraction was entertaining and creative. The down fall was the staff, I waited thirty minutes to print my photos and then another thirty to pay. This was not due to a large amount of business. I watched a manager and another four employees stand around and gossip about life while two other employees handled photos and the pay counter. My girlfriend who was buying a shirt from the store got sent to three separate pay stations. When finally she was helped the girl said \"Oh yeah I am on  the store check out tonight.\" I would definitely tell others this is a great attraction but would gear them away from the Las Vegas site.
