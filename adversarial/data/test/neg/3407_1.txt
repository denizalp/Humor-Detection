It is not often that you get several \"BEST I EVER HADS\" at one restaurant at one time but my husband and I had that experience at Taco Dilla. I had the bean burrito which was the best and most flavorful I had. My husband had the All Thai'd Up quesadilla and proclaimed it the BEST EVEr. Then he had the churro which he said was the BEST he ever tasted. Fabulous food, fun decor a real hidden gem!
