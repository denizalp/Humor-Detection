Overpriced and slow. The two ladies didn't speak very good English and I'm guessing is what led to me getting the incorrect order. I may have possibly gotten someone else's order. Not a good system for keeping orders straight. I was on the plane before I found out that it was not what I ordered. I called when I landed and was told I would get a call back within 48 hours. That did not happen. Food was fresh and made to order or they have prepackaged food. I would not recommend due to incorrect or and no recourse or customer service and price.
