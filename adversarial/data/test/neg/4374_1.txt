I don't remember going to many Malaysian restaurants in the past. So I tried this on my first visit to Elizabeth neighborhood on one rainy night on a Friday. It was worth it! I really liked the roti cani. The roti was cold but the perfect and spicy gravy compensated for that. I would highly recommend everyone to try roti canai, at least one time. This is a nice appetizer.\n\nI had a curry flavor from the Chef's Specialties. It was perfect. Very well cooked vegetables in the curry, made me happy. The meal was big for me after I had roti so go with the big appetite. I have to pack the left over but I know it would taste yummy next day. Any spicy food taste delicious next day. That's the fantastic fact about spices. \n\nAs per my visit to this restaurant, it was favorable. The staff was friendly. Although I wanted to sit on a high tool or a high chair in the bar area but they made me sit at the short chair area in the bar area. That's fine. No harm done.\n\nThe food made all the difference. The menu looked really great and it was hard for me to decide as everything on it seemed worth trying. I went for a simple (according my gut feeling) and predictable (as one can think) dish which was Curry Flavor. I have become very picky since I become pesceterian. Instead of trying sushi or seafood stuff, I went for pure vegetarian. I can confidently say that many vegetarian folks would like this place. They have few items on the menu for vegetarians.\n\nOverall, I like this place.
