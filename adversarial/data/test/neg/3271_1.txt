What a mixed bag of experiences.  The store was very helpful in directing me to service center dispatch.  The dispatch center scheduled a tech to do an evaluation.  The tech arrived on schedule and provided me with an estimate.  The service dispatch then had a comedy of errors over the following 5 days with miscommunication between the tech, dispatch center and local store.  It took 2 weeks between the initial Call and when the tech was finally onsite to do the work.  \n\nThe tech (Robert) was great.  Did the work, cleaned up, and came in under budget.  Overall not a bad experience but the dispatch center is not very good.
