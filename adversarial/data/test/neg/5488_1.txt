I have being coming here and it's been a pleasure until you get rude service. Plus I tried to pay with $100 bill and she points to the sign saying we don't expect them. I then pay with my card (no pin btw) and she never asked me for my ID. The same  sign saying no $100 bills also say \"Please show a valid ID on all credit and debit card transactions\" so not only are they rude they also don't know how to do there job.
