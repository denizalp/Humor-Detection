Went here for the first time based on a promotional deal I had purchased off of New Times.  Got a spa pedicure and a shellac manicure.  I hadn't made a reservation ahead of time (as instructed to), but the gal who does nails was kind enough to stay late and squeeze me in.  She was professional, kind and sweet.  This is the place you go to when you want to splurge (but not spend quite as much as you do at Dolce salon in Scottsdale).  They have lots of promotions and deals when you go in, and you can also like them on facebook.  They have cute jewerly and cards also for sale.\nGreat selection of colors and I love the shellac manicure in particular!  My nails look amazing.  A note on the prices, again, not the cheapest place in town, certainly not your quick corner nail salon.  The folks who work here all have licenses and have gone to actual nail school, esthetician school etc.  A shellac manicure and spa pedicure runs about 100 dollars before tip to give you a sense of the prices.  Oh and its right next door to a nail salon that is unrelated and not owned by them.  Do not do what I do and walk into the wrong place, super embarassing!
