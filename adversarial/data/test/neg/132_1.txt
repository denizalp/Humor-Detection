Skip the BBQ, get the beer can chicken. A half or quarter of chicken roasted on top of a beer can. Great with the different sauces and fixins. All of their sides--mac and cheese and green bean caserole--were delicious. A little bit of a culture shock--Lake Norman preps with khakis rolling up in their Lexus to a biker joint, but great food non-the-less.
