Giving them 3 stars because I have had some great experiences here in the past. Brianna, if you need a perm or even just a cut, is great and I wish I could continue to go back and see her, but, alas, I will never return after this last experience.\n\nI have had my hair permed twice at this location (both times by Brianna, who I now trust with my hair...which is harder than trusting someone with your life) and 7 months since my last perm, the curls are mostly fallen out (it happens) and take a load of styling gel to look even semi-good most days. Add on 4 inches of new growth and it was time to get a new perm. \n\nI had to have it done soon, preferably this weekend, because of a family trip next week so I called to make an appointment. Brianna, I was told, was not going to be available until Wednesday afternoon. I had some anxiety about having a stranger do my perm, but it had to be done. So I booked it. \n\nNow let me make it clear. I had explained to the woman who booked my appointment  (With Liz I believe was her name) that I had had my hair permed there 7 months ago, I needed a full perm because the curl was mostly gone, etc. \n\nI get there this morning and I'm told by the stylist that I have \"plenty of curl left\" (I'm not sure how to attach a picture, but trust me...that's not the case.) even though I let her know that this was my hair fresh from the shower and that had temporarily refreshed the curl. It would be gone once it dried. She then pulled on some strands of hair, towards the end of my hair, and claimed there was too much breakage. Oh right, big surprise. I have at least an inch of split ends after 7 months, I'm lazy about getting trims and I needed one, but above that inch or so my hair is plenty strong. \n\nShe requested a consult from management, who was very condescending towards me and barely listened to me at all. Continuously talking over me and making claims about perms that are outdated and did not apply to my situation in any case.  \n\nIf they didn't know have someone on staff for that day who was competent at performing perms, then they shouldn't have given me an appointment. Now I have to make a new appointment at a private salon (where the price is, oddly enough, the same as at Great Clips) that will force me to take a vacation day at work before my trip. If they had simply told me they couldn't do the perm with their current staff I would have booked elsewhere in the first place and not wasted my morning.
