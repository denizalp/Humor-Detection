Fun music and lots of people. Me and a friend were just talking to a security guard and a girl who didn't like my friend threw a drink at her and kicked her in the back. When we said \"are you gonna do anything ???\" He said \"I believe that was an accident....\" Left right after, I'm insulted and will never go here for lunch or a night out ever again.
