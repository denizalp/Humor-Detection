Really sad to see this place go downhill. It was phenomenal at a point in time, but not making this a regular stop anymore. \n\nAte here when it first opened and a few times since. Noticed many aspects of the food and service were off last time, hoped it would improve. \n\nMade a reservation online and showed up on time. Table wasn't ready and we were refused to be seated for ~10 minutes after our confirmed time. Not a biggie but noticed many tables were open. \n\nPrimary concern was the food. Food took almost 30 minutes to arrive. Some of the chicken was under seasoned and soggy. Biscuits were yeasty, doughy, and undercooked. Surprising for their signature dish. Mentioned it to the server and no resolution was offered. Service was at best 15 minute refills, never came to check in on the food. \n\nTook 15 minutes to pay the bill. It was apparent at that point they were understaffed. \n\nReally unfortunate but will never eat here again. All the guests were bummed as I had set expectations high.
