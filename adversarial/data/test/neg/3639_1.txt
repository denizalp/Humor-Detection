This was probably the worst car wash I have ever been to.  Went thru the machine and when I came out the other end the panel to my gas tank had been ripped off. They did not seem to care much. Told me that they had seen this before from there drying machine and that my panel must have been missing clips.  Even if that had not happened it was a pretty shitting wishing job. I paid $22 for the super.  Car still had many dirty spots on it when done.  Finally insult. The was to include wash of rubber mats but of course that was not done either.
