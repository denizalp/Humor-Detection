This place is very nice and convenient to the strip at a reasonable price.  Perfect for a long week in Vegas!  It's a couple blocks off the strip but you are able to walk to the strip if need be and not feel as though you are walking to another state.  The rooms are super spacious, we had 4 people staying in our suite and never felt as though we were on top of each other.  There is a pool and exercise room as well as a lounge.  The lounge has an awesome wine reception, aka free wine consumption starting at 4.  You can sit in the lounge and enjoy free wine, have complementary house made chips or order more munchies.  The rooms are also equipped with a full kitchen.  Would definitely stay her again if I'm in the area.
