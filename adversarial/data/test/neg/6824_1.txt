Worst company avoid!! I have 2 young children under the age of 3 in my household and have had no ac for 2 days now. Tech said they would order the part and be out Tuesday at the lastest. Called today and now the soonest they can come is Friday. Lol what a joke of a company. Save yourself the headache and call legacy ac or anyone else! \n\nSo they finally fixed my ac after a week and guess what... it broke again! We will be looking at another 5 days without air again! Jon the supervisor claimed to own the company at first then quickly changed his story when I called bs. Why can't I leave negative stars!
