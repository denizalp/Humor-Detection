At first I thought that \"man this line is too long,\" but thankfully I decided to stay in the line. It moved pretty quickly and a few short minutes later I had ordered my fresh biscuit, sausage, egg and cheese sandwich and a cold brew. This was an awesome breakfast experience. The food was fresh and very tasty! I'd highly recommend checking this place out.
