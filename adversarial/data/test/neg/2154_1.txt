This place is really close to my boyfriend's house so we decided to stop here one night to satisfy our sweet tooth cravings. We were the only customers inside at the time but was impressed with how many choices they have as well as their beverage selection. We had a few samples, all fantastic! I honestly can't remember what I ordered but remember it being delicious! They have a lot of sorbets and fruit flavors too if that's more your style. Girls behind the counter were helpful and gave suggestions for flavor combinations. Oh and the place smells wonderful!! The waffle cone pieces they give you in your gelato are good too!\n\nWill come back!!
