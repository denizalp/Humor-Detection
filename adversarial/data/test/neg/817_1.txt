If I could give this place negative stars I would give them the negative 5. Their service is horrible. There was no greeting and every employee seemed so focused on drive through that my boyfriend stood in front of the register for over 2 minutes and even though the crew made eye contact with him and even passed by in front of him a few times no one acknowledged him. He finally asked if they were still open and the crew member passing by said no and kept walking toward the drive through. I couldn't believe the attitude and bad service. I love KFC and sometimes even stop by just for the busicutes and mac and cheese which was the case that night. My boyfriend walked out and I asked to speak to the manager. She too was working the drive through and had me wait at least 3 minutes before she came forward. I told her what happened which I'm sure she knew since she was in the room when it happened. I asked her why she allowed such poor service. I asked her why all her employees were in the back working drive through and the front was being ignored during open hours. All she said was she was sorry it happened. I want to mention her name and the rude boy in this review but I just honestly think she and the entire store crew needs to get retrained
