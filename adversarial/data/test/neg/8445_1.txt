coffee, wine or cocktails? this is where you need to head especially if you are with friends and they have different tastes and coffee for those who don't do drinks. sounds about right!\n\ni went here tonight and initially i thought the place was closed. the street even though was close to Queen is very quite and the lighting inside the store was very low which gave a different feeling.\n\nas soon as you enter - the ambience is what anybody will notice, it is so neat and clean yet very sophisticated baristas who knows what they are doing. they are very knowledgeable as I asked them for what kind of beer is preferred and spoke a bit about drinks. \n\ni am giving 5 stars even though i don't see any food item on the menu appetizing, only because their drinks that bloody good. :)\nlove the paper plane cocktail of all so far
