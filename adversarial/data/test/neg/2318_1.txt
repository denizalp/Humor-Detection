Hostess was an old, rude white lady who wouldn't seat us cause we had our swimsuits on. We had just come from a pool party. Mind you, we had dresses and cover ups over us so you couldn't even see anything. We were starving and decided to go somewhere else where they had no problem seating us. Would not recommend and will never return.
