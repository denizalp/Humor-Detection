I stopped here for coffee and a sweet roll just to kill time while waiting to go to my appointment . When I came in I was seated by the hostess I think, and told her I wanted a cup of coffee and sweet roll. She brought me a bear claw wrapped in cellophane and plopped it in front of me . I have eaten here at different times, but this was the worst service ever. While trying to unwrap the claw my real server Alexander  came over and asked me if I would like i\n\n\nt heated, he said they were really good that way . When he brought it back to me, it was on a plate and had some butter with it. This I call good service, thank you Alexander. \nThis experience will not stop me from going there because the food is really good no matter what time of the day you eat and the servings are huge. I will however watch for that lady hostess and not take that kind of service again.
