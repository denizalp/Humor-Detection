Relaxed and classy atmosphere.  Fresh look and great eats.  Lunch orders were quickly taken and service was very attentive.  Pear salad was a perfect pair of sweet and savory.  Interesting and delicious take on fish dishes, as well.  A great addition to Kamms.  Happy to enjoy a meal with my father and have such a pleasant place to visit.
