This Planet Fitness is pretty great. It's not too busy, it's pretty clean, and the workers are really friendly and most of them seem like they genuinely remember you. At one point, I broke my ankle so I was unable to come, but they were really awesome with helping me to keep my membership while staying on a budget. I've brought in a couple guests, and the staff never acts like it's too much work. The hydro-massage is definitely a plus. Great place, I'll be keeping my black-card membership for a while :)
