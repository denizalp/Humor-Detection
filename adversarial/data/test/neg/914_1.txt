Ok for an airport restaurant but their food cost a lot! Their food and the cost doesn't match... on other hand staff are unprofessional with each other. Once, we were disturbed by a group of waitress standing beside our table, talking and laughing loud. We also witnessed some of them kissing each other... so i prefer not to go there but there is not many options in that terminal.
