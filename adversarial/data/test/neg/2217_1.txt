As soon as we walked in we were greeted by a very friendly staff offering bread samples. Ham and swiss on sourdough was fresh and delicious. I love ham and their ham is delicious. Swiss cheese was excellent too. You pick from their signature sandwiches or build your own. They offer a daily soup as well as breads and cookies. Will definitely return.
