This was my 3rd time here.  First 2 times were awesome. Great waitress, great manager, just the whole staff was amazing.  TONIGHT- not the same at all. Awful waitress!!  More concerned with talking with other wait staff.  Forgot us. We asked for water, she went to get it and within a moment started talking with other waitresses, then turned around after at least 5 minutes, and looked at us, and you know the look she had.  Then came over to check on us finally after I think a long smoke break.  We had to ask for a check.   \nWe go out to eat a lot and my daughter is a waitress,  so I tip very well. Tonight I tipped her but not like I usually do.  If fact I didn't want to tip her. And I never feel like that.  Our table was right in front of her the whole time, and it wasn't crowded.  I have thought of everything that could of cause her being a bad waitress.  But I can't come up with anything.  We are the easiest people to please.  All we like is friendly attentive attention.   \nI don't think I will be going back for a while.  \nMy first time was 3 weeks ago and 2nd time a week ago and now tonight.
