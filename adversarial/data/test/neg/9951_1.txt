The best way I can describe Honey Salt would be a beautiful place with so much wasted potential. We had a party of three go for brunch right when the doors opened and were seated immediately. With only a handful of tables having patrons, we thought we would have no trouble getting served and our foods and drinks but we were mistaken. We had to wait over 20 minutes to get water at our table after I had to go to the hostess stand to ask for water and service. We were then approached by the manager I assume and were offered monkey bread and a fruit bowl on the house which was definitely nice of them. Unfortunately the monkey bread was very chewy. Once the manager departed, our \"original\" server came to us and apologized saying \"she woke up on the wrong side of the bed\". Next came the mimosas which had a pungent almost burnt taste to it. Luckily the entrees we all got were good as we all enjoyed them. The service again was very poor as we needed to wait what seemed like another 15-20 minutes to see how the food was and if we were ready for the check. When the bill arrived they had charged us for the monkey bread and fruit bowl which we had to get resolved as well. Being friends with the Yelper elite who gave them a 5 star rating, I don't want to give up on this place but today was very poor and has me wanting to go to other local restaurants.
