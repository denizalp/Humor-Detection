My husband was getting spots on the sensor of his Nikon DS7100 that he bought Oct'2014.  Nikon had recommended that since C.R.I.S. is an authorized Nikon repair facility and that they were local, to try them before sending into Nikon, which is what we did.\n\nC.R.I.S. assessed that the sensor was dirty and said it would be $65 and that was something that the warranty would not cover.  So we paid the $65 and they cleaned the sensor.  They verified it was clean with images taken afterwards, but I never saw those.  Took the camera home and within a few pictures, my husband was still seeings spots on his pictures.\n\nCalled C.R.I.S. again about this and they said they would clean again for free, which they did.  After the 2nd cleaning, they took a bunch of pictures and though initially right after the 2nd cleaning, the pictures had no spots, upon taking more pictures still at their shop, they now saw dark spots that were highly noticeable.  \n\nSo then a 3rd cleaning was done and a bunch of pics taken afterwards with no spots.  We only paid the first time for the cleaning.  2nd and 3rd cleanings were on C.R.I.S.\n\nNow, a couple or so weeks after the 3rd cleaning and some intermittent, but little use of the camera, my husband began seeing spots AGAIN.  C.R.I.S. had said that there is a space between the sensor and something else that creased an air pocket.  When the aperture is moved (which on a DSLR, you definitely move this to take pics), dust particles that might have been there during manufacturing could be sucked into the sensor area.  Really?  That's pretty bad.\n\nAnyway, we called Nikon this time and they said after 3 cleanings and we're still experiencing this problem, we need to send it in to Nikon.  \n\nAll my dealings with C.R.I.S. - Angela, Mike and everyone else were super nice to me.  They were polite and professional.  And right now, I can't remember the main guy's name that did the cleaning, but he was very thorough in explaining to me what happened.  But, I cannot repeat what he said because it only partially made sense to me.\n\nThey worked with me\/us on this issue and they expedited our cleanings.  I see some of the negative reviews are from out of town people, so I cannot speak for them.  But, seeing these people face to face, dropping off and picking up my camera, talking to them over the phone, I had no issues.  \n\nI felt good about the information they gave me, and that they did their best to resolve our problem.  Now Nikon has to take over, though.
