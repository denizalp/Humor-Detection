This was our first visit To Mary's Diner for dinner on a Monday.  Being a local resident and looking for \"bargain\" meals we thought this was a thumbs up.  No required points on your player's card or being a \"senior\" balances out the 'two for one' deals in other larger casinos.  A decent prime rib special for $8.99 (includes soup or salad, vegetable, and choice of potato).  The prime rib was tender.  There were numerous other \"specials\" and entrees hovering around the $8-$10 range which will probably make us repeat diners!  The staff in both the diner and casino floor were very pleasant.
