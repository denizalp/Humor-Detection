The food is good, but I don't recommend going here if you're on a scheduled lunch break. They're very busy right now and still working out some kinks. Today, for example, the ticket didn't print out for my wrap and I waited 30 minutes to find out my food wasn't coming. The manager made my order, and after all that, it was also wrong. The owners are really cool though, and they gave me a card for a free meal. I'll keep going back for now, but I don't know if this is a viable lunch option for downtown Pittsburgh.
