I should have came here first before going to the National on 10th street and then my review won't be so biased.\n\nThis place is still worth the visit. The patio is nice and large and right on 17th. The food is delicious. The beer list? lacking compared to the new National on 10th. \n\nCame here to grab some lunch during the weekend. It was nice how busy it felt and the people watching was great.
