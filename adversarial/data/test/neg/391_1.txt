Went there for a fundraiser for my daughters school. It is a poor attempt for Mexican food. The taquitos tasted like they were made from frozen. There was a salsa bar which sounds good in theory but cell short with salsas from a jar. The service was ok but with the food being so bad I can't ever think to go back there. I would suggest staying away even for fundraisers.
