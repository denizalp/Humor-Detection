Clean Dairy Queen and friendly enough cashiers but my cookie dough blizzard didn't have cookie dough, so the worker in the back came to fix it. He didn't seem very happy to remake my order. The worker took the wrongly made blizzard and threw it away. I understand discarding the item if it was incorrect, but I think it is nicer to let the customer keep it considering it was a perfectly good blizzard that I could have given to another person in my party. When he came back, he didn't flip the blizzard upside down (if they do not, call them out and your blizzard is free)! Considering he already looked pretty pissed off that he had to redo my order, I didn't say anything... However, the cashier was sweet\/apologetic even though I don't think she knew what was going on. Mediocre experience, not worth anything more than 3 stars.
