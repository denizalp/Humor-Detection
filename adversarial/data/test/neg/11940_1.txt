Just had dinner here again! We visit every time we are in Las Vegas. The chicken Alfredo is by far the best! We recommend to share the Alfredo and get a side of meatballs on the side because they are delicious! (Keep in mind, to share there will be a $13 additional charge). Also, the cappuccino as always is AMAZING! Thanks Battista's for always being dependable for a great meal. We will continue to come back again and again!
