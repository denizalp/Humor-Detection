I ordered a fruit bouquet for a co-worker of mine for her birthday. I called to confirm after the order was placed. I waited until nearly the end of the day, no bouquet. So, I called again to see when they estimated arrival. I was told \"so sorry, the florist didn't receive your order, it will arrive Monday.\" Same thing happens on Monday. I wait nearly all day... finally the bouquet arrives and, not only is it very late, but it is a horrendous mess that doesn't look at all appetizing. Such a disappointment and so embarrassing to give it to my co-worker, who deserves much, much better!
