Chuseok is coming, folks ... the songpyeon and other delights are here!!!! The classic pink, green (mugwort) and white tteok (sweet rice cakes) await!  This place has been in business for decades and they have maintained solid standards. Mmmmm yuuuuuum!!!!!!!  The songpyeon I purchased today were not overly sweet and had a perfect \"chew\" factor.
