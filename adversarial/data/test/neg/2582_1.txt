love this place.  we showed up with a party 30+ and ryan took amazing care of us!!  she and chris were amazing.  patient, hilarious, friendly and not annoyed with our huge group and special requests.  the beer is great, the food is insane, everything was perfection.  so good i considered going twice in our trip to vegas.  can't wait to go back and get some bbq chicken nachos and the daddy hefe beer.  highly recommended.  special thanks to ryan and chris!!!
