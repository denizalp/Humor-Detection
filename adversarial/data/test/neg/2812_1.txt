Romp is by far the best dog groomer I've found yet!! They took great care of outlets wheaten terrier Olive!!! She went in looking like a hood rat and left looking like a billion bucks!! They gave us an update and eta and was right on schedule !! They really care about our fur baby ! We make a long drive from Gilbert, but believe me.... ITS WORTH THE DRIVE!! Mathew and his staff are doing a phenomenal job!!!! Amanda did an amazing job on our pup and had great communication!
