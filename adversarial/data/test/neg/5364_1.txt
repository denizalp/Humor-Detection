Back from work and now I am in the mission to find Korean restaurant & grocery shopping. \nThis place had lower reviews but I wanted to try my own. \nVisited on Thursday night which it was pretty quite & kind of empty. \n \nI ordered Kalbi tang (Kalbi soup) & my guy ordered spicy pork. \nLady brought ban Chan & rice. \nI want to know why this place is not over 4 stars???!!!\n\nCall me an old lady but their ban Chan has very shigol (country side) flavor. I asked the lady why not so busy when her food reminds me of country side food in Korea. She said her popular customers are elders.  If you know Korean food, the flavor is different depends on territory in Korea.  Their radish kimchi was really good, other veg I dishes were really good too.  But surprisingly, cabbage kimchi wasn't that good. \n\nMy Kalbi soup was pretty good. Spicy pork was better than the soup. I have to say the pork was better than I expected.  Better food than Hodori Korean restaurant.  \n\nSo good I went back on very next day for lunch.  This time I ordered saum jok tang (beef tendon soup) & my company ordered Tuk-mandoo kook (dumplings & rice cake soup).  The owner brought out few more extra ban chan for us to try.  \nBoth dishes were so good.  I asked the owner lady if they have a mackerel & radish dish, she said even it's not on the menu but I can still order it. \n\nShe also sell ban chan if you ask for it. Her ban chan was far better than the one I buy from the market.  \nThis restaurant will be my first place to go.
