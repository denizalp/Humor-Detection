I LOVE this place!!\n\nFirst off, the decorations inside are very relaxing - all white and light everywhere. There is a carport in the back that was converted to a dining room and a pretty sizable garden in the back with seats. You can order at the front counter or at the bar (once you've made your initial order at the front counter). My friend and I split a number of dishes and they were all SO GOOD.\n\nWe started with the Kanapki which is esentially a few different spreads on toast. My favorite of these was the roast carrot pure which was so delicious!!\n\nThen we moved onto the Boczniaki z kapusta which was beer braised cabbage with butternut miso and rye crumb. OMG that butternut miso was SO GOOD, we were practically licking the plate. That whole dish was probably my favorite.\n\nNext was the Salatka with smoked chilli, burnt carrot, sunflower shoots, and burnt sunflower seeds. I had no idea that so many burnt things could add up to such a delicious dish. I guess I need to burn my food more often. \n\nFor dessert we split both the apple tart and the yogurt bilberry. The yogurt was made of cashews! I've never tried nut yogurt before so this was really exciting! I liked both dishes a lot though the apple tart I liked more. We also each got a fancy soda (I had the wildflower soda and my friend had the poppy seed soda).\n\nAfter all that each of us only paid $22! Such a deal for such an amazing meal! I will definitely be back next time I'm in Pittsburgh!
