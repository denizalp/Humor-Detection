Hydrocare Carpet Cleaning Services did a great job cleaning my carpets. It has been seven years since my carpets were installed in our vacation rental property and our first carpet cleaning was long overdue. Most of our issues were normal spots, dirt and stains, except for the damage that my puppy did that we brought along on our latest Phoenix visit. Two rooms I was really expecting to hear that nothing could be done from the technicians, and was expecting to have to replace them. I was shocked to see that the carpet cleaning was able to remove every single stain on the carpet, and overall the carpet looked like new when they were finished. I am now going to clean my carpets at least once a year and I look forward to seeing Hydrocare Carpet Cleaning Services back next year!
