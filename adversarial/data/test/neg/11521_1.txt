After waiting in line for 30 min to get our car at Fox and still only halfway through the line, I decided to see if any of the other rental agencies could be our price; they couldn't. But David was able to get pretty darn close and upgraded us to an economy car; which was a lifesaver cause we would never have fit our luggage in a smaller car! He also threw in free liability and had us out the door in 2 minutes!
