Came here for lunch with co-workers as I'm always excited to have the lobster and crab soup that is topped with puff pastry.\n\nBaked Lobster and Crab Soup w\/ Shot of Sherry ($9.49)\nThis has always been good and is consistently delicious. The soup is very flavourful and there are generous chunks of lobster and crab. The puff pastry is nice and flakey making it the perfect combination.\n\nLobster Americaine ($29.99)\nI normally get the ribeye here with duck fat fries but there fryer was broken and I didn't want to have mashed potatoes so I tried this lobster pasta. It was terrible. The lobster was a generous portion but was so mushy that it wasn't fresh at all. It also had a few random clams and mussels that weren't advertised on the menu on a bed of fettuccine. The sauce was very oily and didn't have any flavour at all.\n\nBelgian Double Chocolate Mousse Cake ($7.99)\nThis cake was actually pretty good. Moist, not too sweet and had a delectable chocolate taste.
