If you like seafood, you will enjoy the buffet.  I indulged in fresh crab, steamed mussels, classic clams in white wine sauce, shrimps, sashimi, scallop salad,...   Their salads are great too.  Other than that, the food wasn't stellar.  There is a huge variety, but unless you're seeking a meal where you're over stuffed, it's not worth the money.\n\nOur vacation stay at the Bellagio came with a daily credit for the buffet, which is why we came here at least once a day for dinner or brunch.  After one meal here, we kind of wished we didn't have the credit.  It would have been better just to try a larger number of different cafes and restaurants.  I suppose we could have just not used the credit, but we are savers and way too conditioned not to pass that up!  \n\nWe visited in late Feb, and at most waited 15-20 min in the line.  Most of the time, it was shorter than that.  Service is inconsistent.  We had one server who was really attentive and the rest were mediocre at best.
