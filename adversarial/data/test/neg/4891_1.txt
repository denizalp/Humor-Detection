Unbelievably good taquitos and dirt cheap.\n\nGood range of meats, tongue, pastor etc and all tasty, plus bonus of self serve salsa bar with some spicy good stuff.\n\nStaff are really friendly and place is always very clean.\n\nLove this place! No kidding, the food here is as good as the street tacos I've had in Guadaljara and Mexico city.
