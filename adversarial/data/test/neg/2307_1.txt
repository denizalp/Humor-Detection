Delicious food! We wanted to try a few things because everything sounded so good. We got the Lox sandwich, the traditional breakfast with sausage and animal style home fries, a side of chorizo sausage, a side order of the red velvet pancakes (which was very generous). We also got the special juice which was tangerine raspberry, fresh squeezed OJ, and earl grey tea. Everything was so delicious, and even though we ordered too much we ate everything because it was so good! \n\nThe atmosphere, decor and music were really cool too. This place is cool and trendy, but cozy and comfortable, and not pretentious at all. We will definitely be back! Best brunch we have ever had!
