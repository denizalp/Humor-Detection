The salad served to our table had a huge bug crawling around inside of it.  After notifying our waiter of the discovery, the manger came to our table and apologized saying they were having \"lettuce issues\".  The manager said the meal would be comped because it ruined our dining experience.  We were very appreciative of her concern and thought all was well, but...  When the meal was complete, the waiter dropped off our bill.  Shockingly the manager only comped the cost of the salad.
