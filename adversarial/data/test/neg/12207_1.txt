The food is so good here! We came in late night and enjoyed the ribs, baked potato, Mac n cheese and philly fries... A half order is a heaving pile of goodness that will fill up a whole table of four! It's such a big portion and it was 1\/2 off too!! They have a lot of great specials and I can't wait to go back to try more food!!
