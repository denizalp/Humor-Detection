DO NOT use this company.  They replaced my windshield in my car several years ago.  It was at least three years ago.   Since then they have called me on average 1-2 times per week.  I have repeatedly asked them to remove my telephone number from their registry and they have not done so.   Each time they call I ask and each time I am told they have done so.  Stay as far away from them as possible.  Find a company that will respect your wishes when you let them know to stop calling.
