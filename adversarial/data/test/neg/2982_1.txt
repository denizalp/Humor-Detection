Went here for dinner on a Saturday night around 6:00pm. Thought we'd have to wait for a seat but the restaurant was busy but we got seated right away. Luis was our server and got us some water and took our drink order right away. Menu is a little light and the pricing is typical for a Mexican tourist area. Free chips and salsa. I was hoping for more shrimp dishes but found something to eat. \nFood was okay, atmosphere was nice but the room was very noisey. Luis and another server were very attentive and friendly. I had a Groupon so all in all had a nice meal and the service was great. No complaints
