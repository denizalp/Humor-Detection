Feeling peckish, went in for a healthy snack. Had the Vitamin Sea Bowl (see what they did there?) which was quite average, there was nothing dazzling about it and, for $13 on rice and shredded carrots and cabbage, i was expecting darn dazzle.\n\nThere you have it, happiness again turns out to be reality minus expectations. The latter did me in.\n\nI recommend you keep walking past this place and go for slightly better grub at Fresh or Queen and Dufferin.
