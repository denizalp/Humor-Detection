*Not a good place for groups*\n\nI went to another location last Mon and was super pleased, so when my friend said thats where we were going for her bday I was excited.\n\nNever again. Not to this location anyway. When it came time to pay the bill, our table of 12 received an adding machine tape w\/ a total of $300 at the bottom. Fine. The waiter (or rather the guy who had been standing against a wall in the dining room all night texting and whispering stuff to the waitresses) refused to tell us what amounts were what items. \n\nThats not how you run a business. If it hadnt been our friends bday we wouldve had it out w\/ them. But in the interest of keeping her happy and having no conflict, we divided the bill evenly among our credit cards (he even came back and asked \"No one said where to put the .66.\") and couldnt get out of there fast enough.\n\nThe only reason this review is 2 stars instead of 1 is becuase the quality of the food was still superb. The service however, could use an overhaul.
