Pretty good poke. This spot lets you pick if you want a bowl or a wrap (more like a burrito) which I liked. I went with a wrap because I hadn't tried one before. \n\nStandard poke format, you pick your protein scoops (you get 2 at a base price here) then select sauces, toppings, dry toppings, and you're good to go. I opted for salmon and tuna, house dressing and a little spicy mayo, cucumber, pineapple, red onion, seaweed salad. \n\nThe guy who made my wrap and the one who rang me up were both nice. It was a little odd being the only people in the restaurant at 5pm on a Saturday, but overall I had a good experience. \n\nThe only downside to the wrap was if you take the paper off of it, stuff falls out of it pretty easily. Not a huge deal but can be a bit messy if you don't eat it strategically. My total was also a little more than $10 and for that price. \n\nCute atmosphere and I'd return to try their desserts. \n\nUpdate: came back to try a bowl. I have to say, I enjoyed this more than my burrito (personal preference) and I think its the better value. Fresh food, friendly service, and large portions!
