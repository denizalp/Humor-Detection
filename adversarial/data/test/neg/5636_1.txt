Pretty nice breakfast spot. Went here at around 10:30am and it was busy, but not packed. Waitress came to me right away for drink order and gave me the special of the day. I ordered it. It was delicious and came out pretty quickly as well. Menu options are pretty typical breakfast. I contemplated the salami egg scramble but was worried about quantity. I did not really browse the lunch side but looked to have burgers, sandwiches and salads. It's a consistent good place to eat. Last time I was here was a few years ago at the downtown location.
