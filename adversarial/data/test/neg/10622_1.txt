The food is good, not great! Priced decently and busy but that's where the issue comes in! First the positive... the waitress did a great job, food came out sorta promptly. We had a large party 11 folks, the reservations were attempted on line, but because the group was over 6 people we were required to call the location directly. We were told \"the entire party had to be there before being seated\" ... we initially had planned for 5pm but told 6 - 6:15 was best they could offer to seat the entire party together. Everybody was there by 5:45 and the reception area was n9tified we were all ready... we were still on track for 6pm as a large party had just been given the check... so it wouldn't be long. Surprisingly another large party of 13 were told that the table was being held and would be given to the next in line if they were not ready. Not everybody had yet arrived, and the restaurant seated 5 of the 13 and the rest wandered in later. (Contrary to the \"all must be present before party seated\" rule..... special circumstances or they were buddy buddy with someone)  when one of the managers was questioned about lighting a fire under the party \"that had been given their check (now 6:05).. the manager said \"We figure an hour to an hour fifteen\" so they would ask the folks relaxing after another 20 minutes, and we'd all be seated at that time.\" \n  When we did get seated (for a birthday dinner) instead of being seated together, the party was split between 2 tables across the busy aisle exiting the kitchen.....Los much for being seated together!  One would expect if they couldn't seat the entire party together in the first place they would not have taken a large reservation in the first place! \n My serious recommendation if your party is under 4 people, make reservations by phone and still anticipate 20-30 minute wait. If your party is 6 or more, consider another restaurant such as longhorn, or outback first! At least you won't be appreciated as a patron. The initial service received by the 2 managers and reception staff along with seating arrangement spoiled the evening and dining experience! \n In the future, I may try a different location, but like others in our party will neither recommend or go to this location ever again!
