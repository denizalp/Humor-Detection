This place is really small, but we went before noon on a Saturday. We both got the BBQ on a recommendation from a friend. So far, this is the best BBQ I've found in Charlotte. The vinegar-based sauce is the only choice, which is just fine with me. It could have been spicier in my opinion, but it wasn't bad. It was relatively inexpensive compared to the other menu items (especially dinner items).
