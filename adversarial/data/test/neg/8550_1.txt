I love to fine dine whenever I can. My boyfriend and I decided to go to Flemings on Valentines Day ( made reservations way in advanced) and the dinner did not disappoint. Easy tied for the best meal Ive ever had with Flemings competitor Johnny's Italian Steak House. I honestly cannot decide who is better. They both are THAT good.\n\n\nMy BF and I both order different cuts of steak. He had a ribeye and I had the NY Strip. Because the steaks doesn't come with a side, we shared an order of fries. Honestly, the steaks alone were enough because they both were gigantic. They had so much natural flavor and beyond this world tender. \n\nBefore our meal came out, we were served bread as a starter and we ordered some shrimp from the menu.  I believe you get 5 medium sized saut√©ed shrimp for roughly $14. Even though we didnt get a lot in quantity, the quality was superb. \n\nFor dessert, we order this short bread cookie with vanilla ice cream and homemade freshly whipped cream. The whipped cream alone was good enough to eat solo. I have never tasted anything remotely close to being THAT fresh. I could not stop talking about how good it was. Same with the cookie. \n\nService was top notch and the drinks were very strong. \n\nThis is a fantastic place to go to do adults. Even if there isn't a special occasion, dinning here comes highly recommended. There was not one thing I could complain about. All around a 5 out of 5 star restaurant and experience. \n\nYes, they are very, very expensive but that's the price you pay for a 5 star restaurant.
