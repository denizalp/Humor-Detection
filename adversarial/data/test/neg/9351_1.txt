Dropped by this place at around 8 pm after a movie and was met with quite a line. When we got to the front, the cashier was super nice and even threw in extra icing for free because of our long wait! I grabbed a classic cinnamon roll aa always and it was deelicious as expected. The deliciousness of the cinnamon rolls and the awesome service will definitely have me coming back for more.
