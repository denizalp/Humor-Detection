I was there last week grabbing some picture frames and while they have an amazing assortment of products that staff is not very helpful.  Customer service should come first and foremost.  Also every time I go there the lines move super slow.  I think they need to improve their check out system.  It is also very annoying that they are closed on Sunday.  Most people that would go to a craft store would go on the weekend.
