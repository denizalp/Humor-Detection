One of our favorite hangout spots. Tortilla chips and salsa made fresh daily. Roman street tacos are yummy. Love to go on a hot summer day cause the A\/C is ice cold in the bar area. Sure, the place is worn but it has character. A pitcher of margs and some DosXX and you won't want to leave this place!
