We had just moved to town last month and we wanted good chinese. We were so displeased by this place! First of all the portions were ridiculously small for what they charge. Our noodles were greasy and our chicken was cold. Then we all ended up with horrible food poisioning for 3 days straight!!! Stay far away from here!!!! It was the worst experience!!!
