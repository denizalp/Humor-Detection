My grandparents have came here and my father since they were young. I remember  coming here when I was a kid. I have always loved there pork fried rice. The portions are outrageous. Just make sure to eat in to get more. They serve you on large dishes and bowls. When you order take out they come in the typical small white chinese boxes. The place isn't easy on the eyes but the food is well worth it. Hot and fresh!
