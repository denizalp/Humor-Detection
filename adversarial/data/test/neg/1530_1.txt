We were looking for a chapel to host our 10 year vow renewal, but wanted to stay clear of anything cheesy. Oh - and do it on the 4th of July, a holiday. We spent hours on the web looking at chapels and finally found Mon Bel Ami. From the moment we emailed them Carrie was helpful in guiding me through exactly what we wanted. I was a bit skeptical - we've all seen some movies about Vegas chapels. I am also very picky about photography, so we figured we do the minimum and call it good. At the last minute, Carrie emailed us with a photo package special and we took a chance. We are so glad we did! Everything exceeded our expectations. Our limo bus for 16 never showed at the hotel, so already we're running late. We called, and the ladies said we were ok. We got there, and the staff was incredibly sweet making sure I was ok, spent some time calming my husband and got everyone settled as they arrived in separate taxis. The flowers were more beautiful than I imagined. The chapel was absolutely perfect. Tony, the officiant, spent time with me and my husband asking us how we'd like the ceremony to go. It was quick, but very lovely. Just what we wanted And the photos after were more than we expected. The photographer was so kind and worked with us and our family to get shots of people that we requested, then took us outside for a few of just us. They turned out fabulous and we are so glad we purchased the extra photo package. They are very much invested in making your experience the best it can be. Give them a call. You'll be glad you did!
