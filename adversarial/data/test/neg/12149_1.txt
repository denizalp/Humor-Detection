Just so-so in my opinion.  We went for lunch, and their special is a great price.  Don't know where else I can get a sit down meal with soup, an egg roll, salad, and my main course for $8.\n\nService was also so-so, they didn't ignore us, but didn't come back to see how things were or if we needed anything.  Though the server was around if we really would have needed her.\n\nFood was slightly bland, and not much seasoning.  Egg roll was burned.\n\nWent at 11:30 and we were the only people in the place, and by the time we left ~12:15 there was only one more person.
