Good Chinese food geared to people who like actual Chinese food. This is not Pei Wei or Panda Express, people. They have really delicious dumplings, served a variety of ways. I also like the more much vinegary dishes as well as the clay pots and various veggie dishes. I adore the pork pan fried dumplings with the frilly fried juicy stuff that forms a crisp little float like thing around them. They are 'delish and now I want a whole bunch more just thinking about them!
