AVOID\n\nI had a rental at 10 PM.  My flight landed late, and I arrived at the desk at 12:10 AM.  They said that my reservation was cancelled because I got in late and I arrived on the next calendar day - which is an insane policy.  Wouldn't this happen to a lot of bookings every night?\n\nThey then offered to rent me the same car but wanted to charge me $25 more per day because my flight was delayed and they think that's justification for cancelling a booking.\n\nNever, ever, ever rent from these people.  SHAME!
