We loved it. The negative reviews are a bummer because it was so good. Our faves:\nGyoza: little dumplings with ponzu sauce and red chili sauce. Yum!\nSingapore noodles (with chicken): super-flavorful \nMalaysian yellow curry: perfect balance of sweet and spice...veggies cooked perfectly\nPanang curry (my fave!!): the sweetness cuts into the spice. Green beans have never tasted so good.\nFair warning, it is SPI-CAAAY! They let you pick 1-10, we went for five and it was really spicy. I can't fathom what ten would taste like.
