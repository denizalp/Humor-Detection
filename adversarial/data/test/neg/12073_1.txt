Came here on a Saturday night and it was pouring outside. The tables were all filled except for one, but when we entered, 0 out of the 7+ waiters in the restaurant acknowledged us. We stood there waiting for about 10 minutes (still nobody looking at us) before I flagged down a waiter walking by and asked if we could be seated. He looked around and told us no tables were available. I asked if the empty table in the back could seat us and he said it was reserved and walked away. We then waited another 10 minutes, watching the 7 waiters in this 15-20 seat restaurant mill about with nothing in their hands, before someone noticed us and told us a table was leaving and they'd clear it up for us in 5 minutes. At this point, my party of 4 were clearly unhappy with the lack of service. We watched the table leave and it was another 5 minutes before someone cleared their table (even though there were 7+ waiters walking about!) \n\nHonestly, the food was unremarkable. Nothing was actually spicy. We ordered the Hot and Sour Soup which was no different from a regular buffet like Mandarin, chili chicken (average, really), manchurian fish (frozen fillets), garlic shrimp (for some reason, bright red but not even spicy), general tao beef (my friend thought it was chicken, completely covered in batter and did not resemble beef). The highlight was honestly the fried banana and icecream that came with our set dinner. \n\nWaiters coming around to take our order were kurt and borderline impolite. The staff that brought the food over slid the plate across the table and mumbled something and left. We really had no idea what they brought over until we ate the first bite (hence mistaking their general tao beef for chicken). Seriously. For a restaurant with 7+ waiters, we expected much better service. Why hire all these people if they're not here to serve?
