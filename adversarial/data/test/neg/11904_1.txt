Just tried this place out for the first time at lunch and it was really good!  I had their Asian salad, which is a kinda strange thing to do at a place called \"Crafty Burg'r\" but I was looking for a lighter lunch and this hit the spot.  The health conscious lunch went right out the window, however, when I saw they served FRIED OREOS as a dessert.  OMG - you have to get these!  ha!  They are delicious.  \n\nI'll definitely be back to try other things on the menu.  This is a great little \"unknown\" spot that is serving really good food at a reasonable price.
