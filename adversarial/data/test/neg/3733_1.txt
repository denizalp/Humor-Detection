For starters, Bloody Mary's at happy hour were $3.50 for a real sized glass, not the tumbler\/half drink situation. Very happy about that. It was a seat yourself  situation which is what I prefer. Not stacked on top of someone else. Short order menu. Food was very good, place was clean, drinks priced right as were the entree's. Will be back for sure
