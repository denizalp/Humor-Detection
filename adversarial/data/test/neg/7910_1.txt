First time in today for a early dinner, been meaning to give this place a try and so glad we did. \n\nService was amazing, my drinks were always full, they answered all my questions about the menu, and my daughter loved our servers as well! Brought her a share plate and lollipop, giving her special attention, which was cute.\n\nThe atmosphere was cozy, and plus a lot of booths.\n\nThe food was great, and for a great price. Dinner specials included soup, egg roll, 2 crab puffs, a side of fried rice, and your choice of listed entrée. ( but for a $1 more you can do any entrée) it was soo much food. My daughter and I shared, and had food to bring home. The eggrolls were enormous. We had beef and broccoli and the kept the sauce on the side for us. My only critic is no peas and carrots in the fried rice ( but this is a personal preference because I love extra peas in my rice, weird I know). In all I had a great experience, would recommend it to friends, and can't wait to come back.
