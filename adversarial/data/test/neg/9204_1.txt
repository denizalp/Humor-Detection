A friend raved  about the Miami location and I didn't get a chance to check it out a few months ago.  \n\nSo I made sure to add it to my list while in Vegas. I came here for dinner on New Year's day with my boyfriend.  And what an incredible dinner it was! \n\nThe restaurant definitely is romantic and upscale, the service was excellent, and the food was some of the best Italian I've ever had.  Our waiter rattled off all these different options for almost 5 minutes, that by the time he handed us menus we were utterly confused about what to order, and were trying to remember some of the off-menu options he mentioned.  We ended up both loving what ordered and though the meal was pricey, it was WELL worth it!\n\nA great first meal to kick of 2016.  I will be back!
