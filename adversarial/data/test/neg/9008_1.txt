Had the most wonderful date with my mom for Mother's Day weekend here at Paint Nite! I purchased a Groupon for a really good deal so I definitely suggest looking at Groupon and websites\/apps alike for your future dates! Reserving a day was a breeze and the instructions were very clear on the form. I also appreciated getting an email on what to wear, the location and what to expect during Paint Nite. \n\nMy mom and I got to the location early and we were able to get awesome seats close to the teacher. We liked the fact that we painted outside. Despite the bad weather (harsh winds and thick clouds), the night was enjoyable because the teacher and his assistant were funny and very helpful. I absolutely have no experience in painting and if I must say, our paintings turned out great because the teachers were great! It was evident that everyone had such a great time when we were leaving the venue based on everyone's smiles!\n\nDefinitely recommend Paint Nite for anybody who wants to do something fun! You get a souvenir of your wonderful painting home and a memory you'll never forget.
