Drove from Toronto to try this place out based on price and review, and was 100% satisfied. The portions were huge, prices were good, service was great and food was fresh. \n\nI went around 7 during the week so it was very quiet because they do most of their business at night; but that only means our food was the freshest :-) \n\nLocation is close to the highway, so relatively easy to get to. Not the most approachable aesthetically, but believe me it's worth it.  \n\nWill recommend.
