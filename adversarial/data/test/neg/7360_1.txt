I didn't go to this show with that many expectations of incredible choreography and stunts so I wasn't disappointed by my hot Australian male-revenue experience. The choreography wasn't great..it was cheezy as expected, but fun to go with a group of girls......don't bring your husbands and boyfriends (they will NOT enjoy it at all)  The only other negative that I can say is that there truly isn't enough nudity for this male-nude revenue....no frontal and minimal bootay. I guess I would expect more of that....however the men try very hard and are EXTREMELY nice.
