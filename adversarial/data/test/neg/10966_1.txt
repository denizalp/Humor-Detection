Don't enjoy chains much, but was with a group. Pleasantly surprised with this Chili's in Charlotte and it's new menu. Tasty fried cauliflower!! Also enjoyed the appetizer plate with pick 3. Sliders were juicy and flavorful, boneless wings, too much breading.  Still noisy atmosphere, but we were in private room with poor acoustics.
