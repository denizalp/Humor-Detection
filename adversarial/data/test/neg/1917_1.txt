Breakfast rating of Four Stars.  Good service for setting.  Food prepared fast.  Coffee is good.  Overall, a good breakfast place.  Just not the first restaurant that comes to mind in the morning.  Usually if I need something at Home Depot.  \n\nMuch better than, Sunset Grill that specializes in breakfast.
