They misspelled \"INFRARED\" as \"INFARED\". I have a problem with glaring mistakes such as this. It is one of the main tabs in one of the rooms. Might have been in Hulk room. This kind of brought down the whole experience for me. I'm a huge Marvel fan and I felt like someone should have caught this. Yes it's a very well put together exhibit so please check your spelling
