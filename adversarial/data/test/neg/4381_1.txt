Soto Ayam was the best I've had.  The broth, which is typically very mild in most Sotos, was flavorful and aromatic, with a strong kick of citrus ginger from the galangal.  \n\nBeef Rendang was equally flavorful and rich, with a pleasantly spicy dollop of chili sambal on the side (could have eaten a whole bowl of it).
