Wow, that's chicken. Skip the small stuff, don't bother with the other entrees, just get the chicken. \n\nThe Shrimp n' Grits have tender shrimp and a flavorful ham and jus. Enjoyable, but not particularly memorable. \nThey do a good side of fries with ranch if you're interested, but avoid the slaw like the plague. Dry, flavorless shredded cabbage - they really didn't add enough of anything, though the crispy chicken skin on top is awesome.\nThe Chicken n' Watermelon n' Waffles are the best. BEST EVER. The chicken is so tender. The cleanest meat you've ever seen, juicy and full of flavor. The waffle is a crisp cloud, and the watermelon is cold and ripe. The sugar goes so well with the chile. WOW, just wow. \n\nI initially scoffed at the idea of all-organic fried chicken. Like seriously, why does organic chicken need to be fried? But it's good. It's not cheap, but you get what you pay for, and you need to pay for it, at least once.
