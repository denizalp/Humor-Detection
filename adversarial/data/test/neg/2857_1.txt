I would like to preface my review with the fact that the food was excellent at Hibiscus.  However, the service was far from that at tonight's visit.  We aren't sure if they were training new staff or if it was so close to opening that they were off their game.  But the waitstaff seemed rushed and uninformed about items from the bar.  Over all we are giving Hibiscus 3 stars and we'll attempt another visit, but will be less kind on the next review if things aren't improved.
