The last three times I have eaten a sandwich from this location, I have gotten a bad stomach ache.   I think something is off with the condiments, because both a chicken sandwich and a JBC made me sick.  I drank bottled water each visit and did not have any fries or other sides, but my sandwiches all included lettuce, tomato and mayo.  I can't eat here any more if it is going to make me sick.
