We got lucky and got seated right away when we went to visit for the first time. Would recommend trying to get there right when they first open (we were there at 11am on a Sunday morning) to get a seat. I have heard\/read that wait times can be up to a few hours during peak times.\n\nOverall, our experience was very good. We were seated in a cozy booth for two by the window which was nice (always love good lighting for food pics!) and our server was so sweet. If you have been to an outpost of The Cheesecake Factory in the States, you will notice the interior is almost exactly the same.\n\nWe ended up ordering off of their weekend brunch menu. Food did take a long time (longer than it probably should have) but we were enjoying our coffees and not in a rush, so wasn't a huge deal for us. Our server did come over and check in with us to apologize for the wait.\n\nFor my main, I opted for the huevos rancheros and bae got the breakfast burrito (not sure if that is the exact name for it lol). Both brunch meals were tasty and put together nicely. My eggs were cooked perfectly and the pico de gallo salsa was really delicious. I also enjoyed the slight kick from the ranchero sauce on top of the dish. Bae said he liked his main and couldn't finish the last couple of bites - it was huge!!\n\nWe obviously HAD to try a slice of cheesecake on our first visit but had a really hard time deciding on which piece - many of them sounded so tasty. Our server recommended the hazelnut crunch to us and we were very happy with our selection. If you are a fan of Ferrero Rocher candies, this would be the cheesecake for you.\n\nAs others have pointed out, unless you want to stuff yourself, consider sharing a piece of the cheesecake. Our slice was huge plus super decadent but really really tasty. The top layer of the cake was nutella, with hazelnut cheesecake batter underneath which was laced with crispy crunchy chunks of hazelnut cookie (?). Oh so good!! Even with the two of us sharing, we couldn't finish the whole thing so took the rest to go.\n\nSadly, about 15 minutes after we left we realized in a panic that we left our leftover cheesecake behind. OH NOOOOO!!! We ran back to see if it was still there on our table by some miracle but of course it was gone. We found our server and she surprised us by coming back with a brand new slice for us to take home. Such a lovely gesture, it was so appreciated!\n\nLooking forward to coming back someday soon, hopefully the lines will have died down a bit by then ;)
