We have always enjoyed dinner here; however, our visit on 12\/16\/16 was not good.  We made reservations for 7:00 p.m. and arrived 10 minutes early.  There were tables available; however, the hostess said they were not ready to seat us.  We had a beverage in the bar and she told us when we were ready we would be seated.  We gathered our coats and went to the hostess desk.  The hostess then asked if we would like to eat in the bar - no, we do not.  That's why we made the reservation.  She then made us wait while she located a table for us; and, again there were at least 7 open tables(?).  Our waitress, came and went.  She showed up once or twice to take the plates from the table, but she was not attentive at all.  The food was nothing special either.  We won't be going there for a very long time, if at all.
