I went here for lunch today (Sunday) with my mom. We had a reservation for 12:15 and showed up at 12:05, and we were seated right away. Mom ordered scrambled eggs + veggies, I ordered the kale toast w\/o the egg. Our server told us it'd be a while as the kitchen was backed up.. fast forward 50+ minutes: no food. Our server had stopped by ONCE to fill our waters--meanwhile she was chatting with another table across the restaurant for 15 minutes. I went to the host stand to let them know we had been waiting almost an hour for toast and eggs--she said \"that sounds about right.\" Then, the manager came to our table, apologized, comped our coffee\/tea, and TEN MORE MINUTES later our food comes out. My kale toast was missing half the ingredients listed on the menu (no radishes, garlic, or red pepper\/chile flakes), and my moms eggs were totally unseasoned and her toast was cold. I understand having to wait during busy times, but this was outrageous--our server neglected our table, a minimal food order took over an hour, and when the food did arrive it was very poor quality. Please beware when going here! They cannot seem to handle a busy weekend lunch at all.  \n\n*Update 11\/25\/17: after my reviewed visit above, the manager contacted me via Yelp and sincerely apologized, which I really appreciated. I went back to Everly tonight with my friend and had a really great experience. We met at 6:30 and were sat right away. I ordered a London Fog with almond milk which was delicious. My friend and I shared everything: Brussels sprouts, charred broccoli, the squash curry with forbidden rice, and the Nor Cal Sandwich. Everything was so flavorful and cooked perfectly, the curry is delicious and the spice level is just right. Service was friendly and attentive and we barely had to wait for anything. This place can really do a great job and their food is wonderful, I love how they focus on veggies! Really glad I went back.
