Worst Chinese food in the area. Five years ago, I had Wongs at home, and it was pretty delicious. Last night, I decided to return with my fiancee. He ordered the sweet and sour pork and I had the Happy Family. The sweet and sour pork was basically flavorless balls of pork with very little sweet and sour sauce. It was okay. My Happy Family meal was good, but the sauce was heavy on the salt. Also, the chicken tasted awful. The three shrimp in the meal were delicious. The tea tasted like straw found in a barn. We will not be back. Also, upon leaving, the owner said \"Bye Mrs and Mr Skinny\" as the people laughed. It may be funny to some, but if you are trying to keep people coming back, you should not make fun of them as they leave. We will continue going to AJK cuisine on Dysart and McDowell, which delivers the highest customer service I have ever seen at a Chinese restaurant and  also has the best Chinese food in the west valley.
