If I could give this place negative stars, I would. I have never seen this place not busy, both inside and in both drive thru lanes. I often come here on a lunch break or before I start work. It. Is. Always. Busy. As in, lines out the door.\n\nWhen I do have the time to place an order, they often get it wrong, and I have to make the hassle of cutting the line to demand they fix it. If it wasn't the only McDonald's in the area, I wouldn't stop here.
