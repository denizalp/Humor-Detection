I'll keep this simple, like the menu: Best. Poutine. Ever. \n\nGot a large of the smoked meat, and it was literally the best poutine I've eaten--and I've had a few. The gravy, curds, and meat were all balanced in perfect proportions so that you got a little of each down to the last bite.\n\nI ALSO had the best corndogs (or pogos as they call them here) I've ever eaten, with a house-made batter that's simply to die for and a seasoned mayo or ketchup for dipping (both are good).\n\nA little pricey, but worth going out of the way for. Be sure to check for FB or Yelp check-in promotions for a free drink or such before you order.
