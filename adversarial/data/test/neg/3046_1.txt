I don't know why this place is so busy.  The food is overpriced and the portions you get don't satisfy you.  I used to come here on my lunch once in awhile for their grilled paninis.  After awhile I wasn't really craving it for the service, cost and snotty employees and customers.  I don't really see the point in spending money at a place that's seems like a fancy cafeteria set-up.
