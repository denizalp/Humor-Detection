Stopped in before Indians game on Saturday and couldn't have been happier.   Great service from the staff, everything was quick and delicious.   Drinks were all made well and as expected.    The Steak Sliders were the best thing and one my favorite dishes in Cleveland now, definitely something I would recommend to anyone trying for a first time.   Don't forget to call ahead or you will be waiting for a seat or crammed between people at a communal table.
