They are SCAMMERS! Advanced Home Service's technician wanted to replace our AC when there simply was a leak of refrigerant. They wanted $3,500 for a brand new AC unit that has since been repaired by an honest company and is now running perfectly. I get that people need to make money but, they (AHS) was trying to take advantage of the fact that my family and I are not as knowledgeable about matters regarding air conditioners. The technician also claimed to know what our warranty did and did not cover and said we would have to pay him the $3,500 directly. Representatives at our home warranty's office couldn't even tell us what was not covered\/covered so how does the technician know this information?
