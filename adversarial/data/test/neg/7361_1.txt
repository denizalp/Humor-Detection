I've had just the opposite experience at AZ Veterinary Specialists and with Dr. Bailey. Several other vets in the Valley were dismissive of my dog's symptoms and horrific laboratory results and just chalking them up to her age. She's only 10. In disgust, I took her to Dr. Bailey who identified the root cause of my dog's condition and aggressively and correctly treated her. She spent an hour explaining the situation, illustrating on a chalk board the location of the kidney damage and discussed short and long term effects. She gets it. She gets that we need to know and we need to have options. \n\nWe elected to have a feeding tube inserted and Dr. Bailey and Sam, our vet tech, took at least 30 minutes to teach me and review potential problems I might encounter. Any time I've suspected a signficant problem, I've been instructed to just come down right away and we're seen immediately. We too have spent thousands of dollars and it is money well spent. Our dog is healthier and on the mend.\n\nThe front desk staff and vet techs are the most pleasant I've had the pleasure to meet in years. They are caring and responsive. I'm looking for another routine vet for our other pets simply because most of our vet's staff is so rude, uncaring and unpleasant.\n\nI highly, highly, recommend Dr. Bailey and AZ Veterinary Specialists.
