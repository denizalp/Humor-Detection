07\/15\/16...Phoenix...Traveling today with my sister, we pull up to the most infectious smile and friendly morning greeting,  Told to pull ahead and park in \"Nancy\",  We find a spot, park and wait for our shuttle.  After a few minutes, here comes our shuttle and out comes that infectious smile. :)  \"Yvette\" was the name on the nameplate on the wall,  Arriving to the airport, we realized we left a bag in the car.  Without hesitation, \"Yvette\" said stay here, get checked in, give me the keys and I will be back by 6:05 (our flight was 6:50).  At 6:06, here  comes shuttle #2 and running with our bag is this beautiful lady, caring, loving, helpful still with this smile from ear to ear.  This is what the world needs more of...no matter what race, color, gender...people willing to help without hesitation and have a smile on their face,  We had no idea who this lady was, but we trusted her...she trusted us,  Thank you \"Yvette\" from the bottom of our hearts.  Parking Spot 2, you did good by hiring this lady.   I hope she touches others like she touched us today.
