Terrible service. They offer you great deals. Warning read the small print. Hire a lawyer when the deal runs out you will be paying dearly for the deal you got. Like the saying is. You Make a deal with the devil. Avoid at all cost. Promotions deals forget it. I was paying $80.00 for 10 gigs of data. got an email saying 12 gigs for the same price $80.00. If was the same price why did my phone bill go up 115.00 more a month????? Stay away from Verizon!!!!
