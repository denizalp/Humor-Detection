I love the Fox Sports Grill in Scottsdale.  It is one of my favorite places to do Happy Hour and watch the game when I am up North.  But of all the crappy restaurants at Westgate, this is possibly the worst.  \n\nWe went a week or so after they opened and it was moderately busy.  Nothing crazy, but busy enough.  Went inside and told the hostess that we'd like to sit outside.  We were seated on the patio and saw a couple waiters roaming around the patio area so we figured that we were good to go.  10 minutes later, I went back inside and told the hostess that we hadn't received any service.  She apologized and told me she would let them know.  5 minutes later, after watching another waiter walk by us, I went back inside and grabbed him and told him we had been waiting.  He told us that we weren't his table and walked off.  We left after that.\n\nWe tried it again a few months after that.  We sat inside and figured we would have better luck.  While our waiter did actually show up this time, the food took forever and he brought out appetizers and meals at almost the same time.  The food is decent so it gets an extra star for that but with service this bad when the place is slow, I can't imagine what it is like when a football or hockey game is going on.
