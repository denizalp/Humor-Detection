Two different types of vacuum nozzles and a small blower to remove the extra water around your door handles, mirrors and bumpers. The carwash is really cool. The way you drive up onto the rollers, it's way easier to line up your car because there are no tracks like the old-style. It seems likeIt went really really fast and there was a little extra soap still left on parts of my car around the mirrors and bumpers. Only recommendation I would have is for them to slow down the actual carwash a little bit.
