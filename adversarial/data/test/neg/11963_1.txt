We started our happy hour with several Nina Frescas and Classic Mojitos.  Fresh strawberry pur√©e, vodka, orange liquor, and guava.  Spectacular and they were only $6 each. Next we sampled spicy tuna roll, salt and pepper squid, wagyu goya, shrimp tempura roll, chicken anticuchos, and yellow tiradito sashimi. Everything was amazingly prepared and all of our choices were perfectly flavored. We sat at the bar and Brian explained the menu in detail, recommended drinks, and made sure our service was on point.  Everyone at the restaurant was friendly and focused on customer service.  The music and atmosphere was hip and entertaining.  We will be back on our next Vegas trip. You can also ask for Jason; he will make sure that all of your detailed requests are handled.
