I'm a local, and live not far from SLS. The pizza and salad I enjoyed was really very good in quality. The experience was just taken down several notches by the disorganized staff and simply lengthy process getting the food. \n\nIt's not all that obvious what you should do when you walk in. There's a couple of people making pizzas that logically looks like you might need to order there. The first register is apparently where you're supposed to order but you'd never know that until you're told. There was no staff member at the second register for a good 5 minutes and the beer I wanted was out.\n\nUpdate Aug '16: I've been back. They've fixed most of the service issues. The pizza is still good.
