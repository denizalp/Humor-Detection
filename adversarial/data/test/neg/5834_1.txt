My home warranty company AHS,  picked a loser of a contractor for my coverage and to do a  simple job. Second time they have hired LOW performers. \nJGG Electric and Appliances company is incompetent. Their personnel lie and they do not follow through on their commitments. They never came to my home and ordered parts on my description of the issue. Two (2) weeks of waiting for parts, and now they say they will not schedule the work to fix my washer. Four (4) weeks of attempting to resolve my problem and they decide they can not schedule the work. \nPlease do not use this inferior contractor.
