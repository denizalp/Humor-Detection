Horrible security! absolutely worst experience at a nightclub and i've been to TJ clubs before.\n\nSecurity there think they're the cream of the crop (Ha!) they get these little power trips that are so annoying cause you cannot do or say anything without being kicked out. Same with Omnia. Never again, thanks!
