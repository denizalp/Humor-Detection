Don't do it!  There are plenty of brand new apartments going up all over the valley.  Don't waste your money on this one!  It's no longer managed by Greystar and no longer worth it. \nMy experience with Cactus started off really great, however, after the change in management it started to go downhill. \nPrior to Olympus taking over, Greystar was always responsive to my calls and e-mails.  Management would walk the property several times per day to make sure things were in order. Maintenance was great, personable, friendly and responsive. The grounds were kept up and the pool was spotless. Maintenance was out daily cleaning the lounges, sweeping the pool and hosing off the pool deck. They really set a high bar and unfortunately Olympus is falling short. \nThe change in management was sudden and without warning, other than some rumblings from residents. The new management took over, planted new signs but made little effort to introduce themselves to residents. Communication has continued to be poor, emails are not returned at all.  I had sent several requests for maintenance because I wasn't able to get into the  resident portal and each went unanswered. When I went down to the office and told them that I had emailed about something she said, \"oh are you Courtney\"?  So they got my requests but chose not to reply. Any requests made to staff are met with interrogations and almost a questioning air as if they don't believe what you're telling them. \nFilthy pool, filthy stairs and hallways are what you'll encounter here. The lounge chairs are gross, every one of them. The pool waterfalls have so much calcium\/chlorine buildup on them that it's about an inch thick at this point. There are always cigarette butts in the cracks and we even found a dirty diaper stuck in a seat. \n\nThe stairs and hallways are dirty and their solution is to use a blower. EVERY DAY you'll be awoken by the noise of the lawn blower around 8\/9am. What are they blowing?  The lawn people come each week so there's really no need for the noise pollution.  A good high pressure water sprayer once in a while would work miracles. \n\nDon't leave packages out, they'll be stolen by other residents and you'll find the packaging in recycling.\n\nI'm sure I've forgotten some things, but these are probably the most important. \n\nUpdate: upon move out, looks like they've hired another maintenance person who was washing the hallways. Still wouldn't go back..
