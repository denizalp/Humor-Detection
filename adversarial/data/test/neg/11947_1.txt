Omaw is a southern style tapas restaurant with inventive dishes and a very nice and intimate ambiance. Would recommend ordering 4-5 dishes for 2 people.  \n\nHighlights:\n\nMussels on Toast ($13):  this was soooo good and my fav dish of the evening. The baguette toast was crispy and loaded with mussels. The chow chow ( relish) on top kind of tasted like caramelized onions and complemented the mussels really well. There was so much flavour with each bite. \n\nSnake River Farms Wagyu ($16): This dish was really creative- similar to a beef carpaccio but also served with mini flapjack pancakes that you put the wagyu on. Although the dish was really tasty, there was so much garnish on the wagyu that it really overpowered the beef and I could barely taste the meat. Still worth a try. \n\nLowlights:\n\nFried Chicken Skins ($7): this dish was ok, but I would only recommend ordering for a group of 3-4+ as I got sick of it after a few bites. The taste and texture was similar to deep fried calamari but without the octopus. \n\nShort Ribs ($14): I was expecting traditional bone in short-ribs and was disappointed by this dish. The meat was served on a skewer and tasted bland. Definitely not worth $14. \n\nFried Chicken ($16): This was a highlight that turned into a lowlight. The chicken was seasoned perfectly, very crispy on the outside and the meat was really juicy and moist. Unfortunately, it was not cooked all the way through and the middle was raw. We told the server and he immediately took it back and advised that they would make it again for us. Although this was a major no no, the staff handled the situation really well and even offered to comp our entire meal ( yes, you read that correctly). This shows me that they really stand behind their quality and service. The chicken the 2nd time around was executed perfectly. \n\nOverall, this restaurant is good to try once or as a late night snack with friends ( drinks are really yummy!). The pricing is a bit steep for what you get and there are many other good restaurants that I would rather go to in that price bracket.
