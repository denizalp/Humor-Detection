I hesitated writing a positive review because I would love to keep this place as my own secret- but the staff here is so on the call I'm convinced they could handle any number of patients and still give us a five star level of care- Jessica checked us in and she was so helpful and courteous- she turned on cartoons so my daughter would be distracted while I answered a few questions- everyone was wonderful and kind to my toddler and I can say I've never had such a positive experience visiting a doctor on a Sunday! Thanks so much to everyone at this location-
