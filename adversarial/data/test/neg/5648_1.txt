We tried the click through seating and that seemed to work very well.  Our server was awesome and patient with our party of 7 and the need for two checks.  She was attentive and very efficient.  The food came out in a timely manner and all orders were correct.  Yahoo!  Great experience tonight, which I appreciated since we were celebrating a birthday.
