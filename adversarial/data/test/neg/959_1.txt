I have been here a couple of times. You might think this can't be a weekly spot because it's \"French\" but they do weekly specials and you can sign up to get their weekly emails letting you know what those specials are. Typically dinner and a glass of wine for $30 or $40. Well worth it!  The service has been spot on with the elevated dining experience expectation. The food has been phenomenal. It is definitely worth going to and I think I might make these an every couple of weeks dining option. There aren't too many legit French restaurants I think QC.
