Why did I give this place 4 stars? Well their selection of fruits and dessert alone deserves just that... but the endless crab legs. Yummie.. I just went again for the 20th time probably last week and still don't seem to get sick of it.  We've learned a way of eating for cheaper.. So don't pay the $30 fee for dinner. Go stand in line around 3:00pm, pay $15-20 for lunch then stay while they change to dinner.  Not only do you get the freshest batch the comes out.. you get dinner for the price of lunch.. I love to eat and this is definitely best bang for your bucks.. Koodles to them for taking out the smoking room.. woooo hoooo
