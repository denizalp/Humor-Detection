We enjoyed another fantastic dining experience here last night and just had to write it up again.  Had the $6 mista salad, the $12 appetizer sampler and the $22 sole entree.  Absolutely awesome meal and what an excellent value!  The sole will just melt in your mouth.  And I highly recommend the sampler platter - everything was super fresh and delicious.  Service was again top notch.  I would give this place another star if I could.
