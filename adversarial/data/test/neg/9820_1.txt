I go here often for their burger. It's between here for a local chain burger that's a little further from home every time I crave a burger - often it's Starr that wins. I love their toppings, buns are delicious and the meat is simple but good. I find these are the best onion rings in town, a little bit of honey and it's the best. Onion rings alone deserve a 5 star review.
