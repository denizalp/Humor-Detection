A small place, tucked away in part of a sprawling shopping plaza, this place is easy to miss. There are only a couple of small signs to show where it is. One on the facade of the building, and a handing one, in case you are walking down the side of the plaza. In any case, the signs are just an indication of how forgettable this place is.\n\nOnce you find it and enter, you will find a dark place with three rows of tables going down the depths of it. It's quite deep, and the restrooms are all the way in the back. When we came there for lunch, there were only two other occupied tables and no one from the staff. After about a minute, someone came in from the back and she motioned us to a table that was right besides a small TV\/VCR setup along the back wall. The TV was loud and set to CNN, although that did not really matter. The waitress, brought up some takeout menus for us. There was no explanation of any specials (do they even have any?) or even a real menu. Each lunch special comes with soup and rice, or an egg roll. The overall menu was the absolutely standard menu you find at almost every Chinese restaurant in the country - along with the traditional spelling mistakes!\n\nWe ordered the Prawns with Shrimp and the Cashew Chicken as two traditional items that we've had in many places and could therefore compare to their offerings. We requested Hot and Sour Soup, but had to repeat the request three times before the waitress stopped saying \"Won ton soup?\" It came back from the kitchen very quickly and was lukewarm. Very beefy, but definitely not spicy or sour. We asked for hot chili sauce and this also took several attempts before it was brought. Maybe it's a sign of how rarely they use the condiment, but this stuff was very tame. Even the one of us who does not like spicy food used several heaping tablespoons before it affected the flavor of the dish. The soup did look gorgeous though, and the chopped scallions on top were great.\n\nThe same thing happened with our two dishes. They looked beautiful - but were almost completely lacking in and kind of flavor. Much to my surprise, the Cashew Chicken chicken pieces were coated and fried. The predominant vegetable was celery and the sauce can best be described as brown and salty. The prawns and chicken at least had more colorful vegetables, but there were only two small chunks of chicken breast and the sauce can only be described as brown and salty. In other words, the flavor was simply not there.\n\nThe rice options we were given included steamed or fried. When asked about Brown rice, we got an emphatic shake of the head: \"No\".\n\nThe meal was inexpensive, but that's the best thing I can say about it.
