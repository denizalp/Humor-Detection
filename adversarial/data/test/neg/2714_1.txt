Shop manager Kevin Mc Lemore was a professional and correct in the diagnosis of my break pads and rotors.  Kevin displayed in depth knowledge of the task at hand, and didn't try to over sell or use any pressure sales tactics during the explanation of the inspection.  Staff was courteous and friendly.  Good job Kevin and staff.
