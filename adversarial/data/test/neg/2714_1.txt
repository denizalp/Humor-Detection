I called to get carpet cleaning to remove pet odor and the response time was quick. The appointment was booked for 8:30, I got a call before arrival (awesome) so I could leave work to meet the technician. It is now 9:14, the job is done the carpet is awesome, the smell is gone and I can go back to work.  This is how a company should operate. Next time I need carpet cleaning, I know who gets the call!
