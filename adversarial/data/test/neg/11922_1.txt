Beautiful water show, not to be missed while in Vegas. Not only it is breathtaking, but it is also free. I wish it would last a little longer; it seemed to me that it didn't last as long as I remember. The magical water show is beautiful at all times, but I recommend visiting the fountain at night! Stunning!
