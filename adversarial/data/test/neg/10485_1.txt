I HATE the dentist. I have always had bad experiences since I was a kid. I came here when I was 16, 7 years ago to get my teeth whitened. I never really took good care of them growing up, so they really cleaned them up for me. After an incident with an aggressive, poorly trained dentist in the Total Dental Care in Mattituck & 3 years of fearing going to a dentist anymore, I switched dentists to Bella Smiles. They are incredibly helpful & caring. EXACTLY how a doctor should be, especially with patients with fear and bad experiences [as well as children!]. I stopped going to the dentist for 3 years after TDC and now I will go nowhere else but Bella Smiles. I recommend them to all my friends who have had bad experiences at other dentists as well. They really go the extra mile to ensure you feel comfortable during your procedures and that if you feel any pang of pain at all, they stop and give you a 5 minute break until you are ready again. I cannot say enough good things about the people, their work, and this company overall. They really know how to treat a patient and they are really knowledgeable on what they are doing. I HIGHLY suggest Bella Smiles! Not just for teeth whitening, but of course for dental care as well!
