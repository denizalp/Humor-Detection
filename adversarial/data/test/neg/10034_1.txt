Whenever anyone asks me to recommend a great Happy Hour spot in Old Town Scottsdale, Cien Agaves is always on the list! It is right in the heart of Old Town and walking distance from so many fun things to do! Their margaritas & guac are to die for!! It is EVERY DAY, yes, even Saturday & Sunday! ...from 3 PM - 7 PM {I love that it runs until 7 PM, in case your work day runs extra long!} Honestly, what more could you ask for? \n\nHH Specials: \n1\/2 Price Appetizers \n1\/2 off Cien Agaves Margaritas \n$2 Tinga Tacos \n$3 Dos Equis Lager & Amber
