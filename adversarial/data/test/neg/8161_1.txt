I have been a customer of Arizona Business Systems for over 5 years.  We just received our second machine from them.  Their customer service is excellent.  The few service calls that we had with our first machine they responded quickly and took care of the problem.  I would highly recommend them. \n\nIf you are looking for a company you can trust for your next copy machine I would suggest you give Arizona Business Systems a call.  They are very easy to do business.  They respond quickly when we call and we get our toner the next day.  Our machine runs great and does everything.\n\nOur copy machine is very important to our business.  We do a lot of scanning and the Samsung copier that we have does a great job.  Arizona Business Systems takes very good care of us.  Their staff is friendly and courteous.  They even send toner before we know we need it.  I would definitely recommend them.
