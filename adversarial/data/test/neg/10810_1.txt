Been here a couple of times now, and it's a decent neighborhood dive bar. It certainly isn't anything fancy, but there is enough of a selection of drinks and some fun diversions that make for a chill evening out. There are some pool tables, a golf game machine, darts, jukebox, and occasionally karaoke, which I have yet to see. Also free popcorn! (but no food other than a snack machine). \n\nPeople are friendly enough and won't pester you if you want to sit off by your lonesome. I haven't seen it on the weekends, however.
