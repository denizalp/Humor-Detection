Giving one star is actually too much for an establishment that caters primarily to women but horrifically denied a woman her legal right to breastfeed her child this past weekend.  Not only was she denied, the employee, a female as well, was extremely rude to the new mom anxiously looking for a place to nurse her child.  The request was not unreasonable and glow denied this woman her legal right to nurse her child.  This behavior should and will NOT be tolerated and the rude employee and all customer facing employees should be required to attend sensitivity training and become knowledgeable of the local laws and ordinances.  This was an absolute travesty and will never be forgotten and for that, we will NEVER utilize this establishments services and will recommend similar actions to anyone we know that plans to visit not only the Tropicana Hotel, but Las Vegas in general.  Remember, Breastfeeding Lives Matters!
