Overstretched service...not enough servers... and the place wasn't full...it was on wednesday night at about 7pm. The food came out very slow ( we ate several apps) . If you don't know how to make risotto it should not be on the menu ...didn't even use the right rice, watery, undercooked, unseasoned...lamb sliders were ok. Pork belly under seasoned and luke warm. Ambience is nice but this is just the reworked wild meat restaurant that used to be there. We tried this on our 20th wedding anniversary and informed them as such. Apps took almost 40 minutes. I don't know what people see in this place but unimpressed...for the limited menu every item should be amazing and it's not. We ordered a certain bottle of wine but our wine came in a house bottle...not the bottle that it was vinted in with a label...hmmm just putting house wine in those bottles?? Not creating confidence in paying bottle premiums when I don't know that I'm getting what I ordered. Will not recommend, will not spend any more money there. Two stars for our friendly but overwhelmed server. Bottom line? They need to work on some stuff.
