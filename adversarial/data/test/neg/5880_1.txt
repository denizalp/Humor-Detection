I made an appt to have someone come over to give me an estimate . We agreed on a 1pm appt time. On the day of the appt. Martin called at 11:40 am and asked if he could come over at 12 pm. I explained that my husband wasn't home but would be home at 1:00 . So he agreed to leave the appt for 1pm. Martin didn't show up But called at 1:35 to say that he was on his way and would be there in 20 minutes. At 3pm Martin called again with some story about his cell phone not working and said sorry I can't make it today after all. Since it was only3 pm I felt he should have still kept his commitment. I was annoyed and told him if you can't come today then don't come at all. His response ? Fine I won't come at all. This company has terrible customer service . They should respect the customers' time. I work nights and woke up early to be available for this company's representative. If this company treats prospective customers like this I'm sure they also treat their contracted customers poorly.
