At first I was disappointed. No dark rye (pumpernickel ) bread. But that was the end of my disappointment.  The lite rye with seeds was soft and good.  The pastrami was flavorful and in a generous portion. \n\nTo me the sign of a good restaurant is good coleslaw. Theirs was very good. Fresh crunchy, sweet & tart.  \n\nThis place is actually a full service restaurant with more than your traditional deli fare. There is also a large tempting desert display, that I resisted. \n\nLocated off I90 it actually is an easy on and off the interstate. As I had my dog in the car I got take out to eat in the parking lot. Worth making a stop.
