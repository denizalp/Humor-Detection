All they do is collecting co pays and deductibles while having rude and careless managers on the phone that talk to you like they are your boss ! Ridiculous, i paid 65 $ just to hear that \"no mam, this is not something that we fix\" despite the fact that i gave all the possible details over the phone and they dint say that its not covered instead they had me pay 65 bucks for the one minute the technician spent in my house.
