Wow I had a great experience with Amanda at RTR!\n\nI made an appointment online and took the time to write in all of the style questions they asked. When I showed up at Rent the Runway, Amanda had already pulled perfect dresses for me! They give you a large fitting room with shoes and a 3-way mirror just outside. She wrote down the styles I liked after my appointment. This showroom is extremely helpful and I just booked my first rental.\n\nOverall very impressive!
