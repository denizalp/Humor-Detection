Solstice has become our regular local restaurant. The service has always been very attentive as we've had different servers over the past three or four visits. Sometimes the restaurant is not busy and the service at first might seem slow, but I think it's really the relaxed dining pace. That is, they are certainly not trying to turn tables as is the case with some other restaurants in the area. There are entree mainstays that have been on the menu, it seems for years, but we've never been disappointed with the quality or presentation of the food. It's worth checking out the Taste of Clarkson too, as the kitchen staff show their creativity. The wine list is not exorbitantly priced as there are really decent wines under $50.
