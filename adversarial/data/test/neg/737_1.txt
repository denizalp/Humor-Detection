Fun little spot and the inside is like a fiftys sky lounge. Everyone is a local here even though I only stumbled in because I'm dropping off my rental car next door. \n\nThe cheese curds are lightly battered and fried cheddar. They have a good selection of beer that's local for sure. The full bar is pretty, service was fast and just a great spot after a 4 hour drive from Minneapolis.
