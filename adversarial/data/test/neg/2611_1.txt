Just saw that there's reviews of this place on Yelp. I was recommended by an acquaintance to buy suits here. I came into the store when it there was only 1 other customer being attended to and a couple of sales clerks lurking about. I was neither greeted or acknowledged. Safe to say, I won't be returning.
