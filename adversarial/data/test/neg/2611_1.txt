My 17 yr old son purchased a voucher for me for my Birthday and one for his girlfriend.They where being sold by a 3rd party marketing company hired by Blush Salon.\nMy son is a employee of Safeway. They came in and did  their sales pitch. He paid cash for them.\nI called in to make a appt since my Birthday is next week and was told the voucher is no longer good after Friday. My vouchers says good until September. I was told they don't have stylist that perform some of the services sold on the voucher. I was not offered to set up a appt.\nI then asked if I could just get reimbusement for what my son had purchased. I was told no and the young lady said she was new and was getting alot of these kinds of calls. I asked then to speak with a manager she replied there was not one available but she would take my name and number down and have the owner call me. I asked if I should contact the marketing company that sold and collected the funds for this voucher? She had a stylist get on the phone and she stated they must have made a error and wrote in the wrong expiration date. Then said maybe it just looked like a 9 but was a 7. I do believe it is still July until Saturday. I stated that this sounds like some kind of scam. It has been 2 days and I still have not received a call from a manager or the owner. I tried calling the marketing  company and have heard nothing back.\nIt was paid for in cash so not much he or I can do about it other than make others aware.\nMy son feels so bad, he was so excited when he bought this.\" first job and first pay check\". He wanted to give his mom what he was sold as a\" Day of pampering\"\nVery disappointed.
