The customer service at this place was terrible. I walked in and there were three people behind the counter and no one said hi or even acknowledged me. Two were not helping with customers at all. Finally one of the girls took my order. I was in there for about 15 minutes just to get two bowls of ice cream. The ice cream had chunks of ice in it. For 5\/bowl I will not be returning.
