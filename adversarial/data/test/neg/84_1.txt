Fast and friendly service. I went around noon on a Wednesday and the line went by faster than the Chipotle nearby. I got the Yakitori bowl and it was delicious! Chicken, mixed veggies, ramen noodles, and Yakitori sauce. Price wasn't too bad---about $8 or $9 for a meal. A great place to have a fast and yummy lunch.
