Not sure where to start. Poor service, food and drinks.\n\nMy wife and I went there today for lunch. Our waiter made our cocktails because \"the bartender sucks.\" Well, the waiter sucked at making ours too. At a slow time (like 3pm), tables were messy and service was slow. \n\nTheir salsa is like spicy, smoky ketchup. I had the spinach enchiladas and they were bland. My wife had the fish tacos and I think the fish was kids' fish sticks. \n\nBlue Agave is that bad. Don't waste your time.
