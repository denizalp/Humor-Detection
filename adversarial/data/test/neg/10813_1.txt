Very happy with my first lunch there. I got a veggie wrap, and it was like a salad disguised as comfort food. It felt light and healthy but satisfied my craving for grilled cheese too! \n\nAt $4.50 for the wrap, I would say it's awesome value and I will definitely order it again. \n\nI used the Ritual app so I skipped the line, which I would suggest.
