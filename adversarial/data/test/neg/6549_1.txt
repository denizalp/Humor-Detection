My friend gave me a gift card to try this place out.  It's ok nothing overwhelmingly special about it.  I ordered the jalapeño margarita that wasn't very spicy.  The bartender remade it for me and it still wasn't very spicy (ate one of the jalapeño raw and it wasn't hot so not bartenders fault).  We got a couple of the tacos on the happy hour, guacamole, yucca fries and they were all ok.  Nothing I would go crazy to go back for and nothing terrible just ok.  Service was cool again nothing bad nothing great.  I would suggest trying it and make your own judgement.
