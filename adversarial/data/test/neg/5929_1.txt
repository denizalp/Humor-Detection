We were on a hunt for the best pizza in town. My father-in-law lives here with his wife, & we are all foodies. The pizza here was delish, but I actually think the pasta is where it's at. I had the best lasagna of my life here - it was so good, it inspired me to make homemade lasagna at home - all from scratch, even the cheese. I found the pizza to be tasty, & definitely satisfying, but the dough wasn't as flavorful as others, and the sauce didn't give me that warm sweet feeling. But it was definitely good. But my advice, if you go here, get the entrees, pastas, and appetizers. Plus, they have a legit italian cherry soda. Oh, and their chocolate cake, and creme brulee was outstanding!
