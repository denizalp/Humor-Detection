Great customer service but disappointed in product.\n\nBought a Ryobi cordless hedge trimmer, but it had no power and won't cut, changed out battery still with no success.  Had to return to my black and decker corded trimmer to finish the job.  Really bad news is that I can't get my money back and not reading the exchange policy soon enough, I missed the 7 day deadline.  Now I have a very expensive paper weight.  VERY DISAPPOINTED.
