This is a pretty good Asian fusion place. I typically go for lunch but I have also been for happy hour. Their Evil Jungle Princess is really good especially over the fried rice. Their salads are a good size and I love the miso soup. Service can be slow at lunch (and this why Ling's gets 4 instead of 5 stars) but this is still my top choice for a lunch spot.
