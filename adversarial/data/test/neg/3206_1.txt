I have been looking for a new affordable haircut ever since House of Lords closed in October.  After a few attempts I have found my new spot.  I called the night before and made an appointment for 3:30 the next day.  Terry was able to get me in on time and gave me exactly what I was looking for.  I showed him a few photos and he nailed it. Fast, affordable and a good cut.
