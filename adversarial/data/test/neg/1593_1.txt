If you're a savvy shopper, you normally think of local and independent businesses as often charging higher prices than a more commercial chain. Not true in this case. Zia Records is one of my favorite businesses in Arizona because the prices are competitive and many times cheaper to that of BestBuy, FYE, Target, etc. Not only are they going to have what you want, but they will have things that you never DREAMED of finding in a music store. It's not unusual to overhear another shopper of yelping for joy after finding something unexpected; I am guilty of this MANY times. Not only is their selection almost unmatchable, but they offer a great used selection as well for the budget shopper. The staff has always been extremely helpful to me. Whether it's placing in a special order, researching for information, or making recommendations based on your taste, the Zia staff has always delivered.
