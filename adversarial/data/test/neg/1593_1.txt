I used them for delivery and quite frankly I'm very disappointed. I'm huge fan of thai cuisine and I'm always willing to pay more than average for good thai food. My order costed me $25, which I was ok with since I had read very good reviews posted here. My pad thai was very cold, missing salt and seasoning, really. Not to mention that it only came with 2 units of shrimps (??). The bubble tea was AMAZING though.
