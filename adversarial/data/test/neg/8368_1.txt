oh man do i have a huuuuge obsession\/fixation with the mob and the mafia-like it's so not okay...so when I heard about this attraction at the Tropicana, I knew that I had to experience it on my next trip to Vegas.  It's interactive and pretty educational.  You walk through the attraction and essentially run with the mob.  At the end, it's your response that determines your fate.  The actors were really good and held character very well, even with my friend and I cracking up the whole time trying to be serious with them.  Try to go with a local (they get discounts) or find a deal if you don't want to pay the full entrance fee.  The very end of the attraction has rooms upon rooms of information and history about all of the key mobsters, hotels, and endeavors that led to Vegas being what it is today.
