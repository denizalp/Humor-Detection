Out of the three big guys they do have the best burgers. They're always fresh. Made or at least topped to order. The first not to use frozen meat, which they should push more. But they really could use a few more friendly servers. And usually there is a wait. Not because of the number of waters but because of the staff. Slow and not trained very well it seems.
