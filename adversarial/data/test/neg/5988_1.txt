I really love the goat and rice dish!!!  There's an assortment of veg, pomegranate seeds, raisins, and a slice of lime for that extra pop of brightness.  A very good portion for $12.\nIf you like your food spicy, get the hot sauce. \n\nThe samosas are totally different from Indian samosas.  Give 'em a try too!  $2 each.  \n\nThe wife in the standalone food court building is so friendly.  The husband takes care of the food truck roamin' the streets of Toronto!
