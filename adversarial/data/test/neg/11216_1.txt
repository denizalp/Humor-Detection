Rented a rental car through rentalcars.com and got a compact car for $20.00 a day. Got to to the counter and had no problem with my reservation and received a 2014 Kia Soul. \n\nThe girl at the desk was very nice, helpful, didn't try to up sale me anything. \n\nI had no issues with my car once I got to it, no issues returning it either.\n\nWould rent from them again in the future.
