I found this spot on yelp while waiting for another shop to open. The ladies that work there are super sweet. The ambiance is nice, they play an eclectic mix of music and have screens playing the news. The colour selection is amazing and displayed in sequence which is not only aesthetically pleasing but also functional. This place would also be suitable for group events, both for its space and location which is right off the subway line and plenty of parking on and around Danforth.\n\nI got a pedi, I'm about ready for my next one and the colour is still going strong! They don't have the traditional massage chairs, they do offer a shoulder massage while your nails dry. They also offer toe waxing if you need it. \n\nMy one concern is the seating for the pedicures, it's fine for me but I could see it making for an awkward pedi if you are a larger person.\n\nIf it's you have never been, I would say give it a shot!
