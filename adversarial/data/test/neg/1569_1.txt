After being away for 2 years Rebecca has taken over the ownership of monfort's again she has done Renovations into the restaurant and the quality of food is back to the highest quality before she left.\n\nI met a friend there and was so happy to see Rebecca back at the restaurant I had Montfort chicken shawarma sandwich and baba ganoush it was excellent.\n\nI would highly recommend this restaurant
