I haven't eaten at Jun's in forever! I just ate here last week for lunch. I got the soondubujigae (soft tofu stew.) It was very tasty and spicy. It had a lot of the soft tofu, with some beef  and veggies. Not sure if it was a good idea to eat that on a day that 110 degrees, but it was worth it. \n\nThe banchans we received were shoyu potato, cucumber and cabbage kimchee, and bean sprouts. The wonbok kimchee was very delicious and fresh.\n\nI've eaten their meat jun and bbq chicken in the past when they had a booth at an event. Ah, those are mediocre. Nothing spectacular. \n\nThey have a little section in the front where you can choose your banchans. You can also get them to-go if you want. Not sure if they are sold by the pound or what.
