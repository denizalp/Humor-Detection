Aside from The Hotel at Mandalay Bay, this is my second favorite place to stay of all the places I've stayed in Vegas. The suite with sunken living room and the huge bathrooms with a full bath AND shower definitely give you more breathing room. Again, you're in Vegas so you shouldn't spend that much time hanging out in you room. But if you have work to do the living room comes equipped with a desk and fax machine so the extras here really do make a difference. \nThe Casino itself is decked out like most other high-end casinos so you can only out-lavish one another so much before everything looks the same. That being said, it is laid out so that I could actually learn the layout and not get lost, even when I was drunk so that's saying something. Definitely a good place to stay in Vegas
