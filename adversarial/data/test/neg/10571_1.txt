This place is awesome! We were driving through Vegas on our way home from vacation and we were having battery problems. The staff was extrememly friendly and took our car right away. I kid you not, within 20-25 minutes, we had a new battery and we were back on the road. AND they gave us a great deal!! We are very thankful for their kindness and generosity!! Wish they were in San Diego!
