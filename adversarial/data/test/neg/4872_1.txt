I when to Licence IV yesterday evening to try it out with a bunch of friends and we really enjoy it. I definitely recommend this restaurant for its delicious dishes, great cocktails, warm and magic decor and cool staff. First time i've seen a server in Montreal get on his knees to deliver a cocktail to a customer because he was late - priceless. A gem in Griffintown. Try the Beef or Salmon Tartare & the Homemade Gnocchi
