You're not getting the deal you think so just save yourself the feeling of being screwed and book with a reputable firm. First car was filthy. Second car had bugs encrusted in the grill, but at least the windows were clear. When I got to the hotel, I noticed they added charges to my bill without telling me - roadside assistance and an extra driver - that almost doubled the bill. Car was supposed to be $81 with taxes and fees. It was $152. I was so jetlagged and running late for an event after American misplaced my luggage (a whole other story) that I didn't notice when the clerk was rushing me to sign the insurance declinations as a line of people waited behind me, looks like he slipped in signatures for these other charges I was never told about. So, that's fraud. What a horrible way to treat people. Why not just be upfront and say what things are going to cost, rather cheat people? I called to complain when I got to the hotel, but of course no one answered and I was bounced to voicemail. Never again.
