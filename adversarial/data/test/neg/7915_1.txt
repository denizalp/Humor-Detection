Penguin air and plumbing came to my rescue yesterday. I heard a loud sound at 4am coming from the garage and found a leak that was coming from the AC unit. Penguin has 24 hour phone service, so it was great to call at that early hour and speak with someone. As a penguin member, I received a guaranteed same day service call. Technician, Joel, found the issue and was able to fix it quickly for a great price. We are happy to get some more life out of our aging AC units!
