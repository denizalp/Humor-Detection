TERRIBLE!!\n\nThese guys screw gamers over. Im very disappointed in them! I bought a controller an hour ago, ended up getting home, finding my other one and didn't need the one I bought, so i went back to return the controller, keep in mind i still have the receipt, they said that they couldn't take it!\n\nWHAT A JOKE OF A COMPANY!!
