Met a friend for lunch here today (3\/13\/15) and had a very nice lunch.  I had the Albacore Tuna Salad and it was really very good.  She had the fish and chips and it looked very good also.  The server was very accommodating and although I have been there several times, I will always go back.  Food has always been good.  Not necessarily inexpensive but that is usually the case at good seafood restaurants here in AZ.  It always seems fresh!!
