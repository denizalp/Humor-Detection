5 stars in Pittsburgh, 4 anywhere else.\n\nThis is possibly the best Chinese food you'll get in Pittsburgh (in terms of not Sichuan-style).\n\nCafe 33 gives you all the great non-spicy options in Chinese food there is, but where they really hit the mark is with their basil, garlic, pepper combination. It's a trademark taste that is just so savory and will seep and tingle your tongue with joy. I've tried several of their dishes with this flavor, and I've got to say the fish and chicken are two of my favorite. \n\nFor other menu favorites, I love their black pepper short rib...it's another one of their dishes with exciting flavors. And in addition, they fry their short rib a bit, which gives a bit of crunchy enjoyment.\n\nOverall, the restaurant has lots of savory Chinese options, and consistently delivers quality items to your plate.
