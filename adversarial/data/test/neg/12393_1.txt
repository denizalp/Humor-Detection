This place is surprisingly better then it's outside appearance but mind you I ventured here after hearing about it from a deal I had purchased. \n\nWe ordered:\nMussels Marinara\nLinguini en Passant \nVeal Caf√© en Passant\n\nThe service was excellent and were very polite, also informative if we had any questions or concerns regarding the menu. My friend ordered a drink and did not like it, instead she was able to exchange it for another drink. Very courteous and did not make a fuss about it. The food was pretty good, plenty of flavour and good presentation, price wasn't impressive but it is nice to go to once in awhile. \n\nI would recommend it to my friends and fellow reviewers\/followers =)
