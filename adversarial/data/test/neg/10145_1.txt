I was very unimpressed with their customer service. I called the salon about a Groupon they had up and whoever answered the phone was rude and had no clue about anything. I looked up the shops email and received an email back saying they no longer accept their shops Groupon but they still have it active on the Groupon site which means they'll still take peoples money but they won't honor the services. Very shady and they will never get my business.
