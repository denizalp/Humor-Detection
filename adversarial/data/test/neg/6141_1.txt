I would give this hotel 5 stars if it wasn't for the line to check in.  After flying in and getting baggage, car, etc...you want a no hassle check in.  Unless you were a VIP guest you were waiting over an hour to check in, which to me is unacceptable.  Our room was beautiful. Service everywhere in the hotel was excellent.  We spent a lot of time at the pool and rented a cabana a couple of days and the waiter was awesome, we were very well taken care of. Room service was great, restaurants at the hotel were great.  We went to Tao Night club and really loved it. It was completely packed but we still loved  it.  We found out later if you eat at a certain restaurant you don't have to wait in line for Tao and get in free...we'll definitely do that next time we stay there.  We are constantly getting emails with great rates now from Venetian. We are looking forward to our next visit.  We also loved the sports book at the Venetian and there was a place at the Sports book where you can get pizza and chinese food that was good.  \nBTW - we stayed in a suite that had a sunken living room and king bed. Room was perfect.
