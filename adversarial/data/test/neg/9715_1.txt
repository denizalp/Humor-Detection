My boyfriend and family dined at the Bellagio Buffet last night and my boyfriend became incredibly I'll after eating the seafood there. We spent the entire day in our room with him throwing up and almost passing out. I called the Bellagio and told them what was going on to which they said they can only report it and do nothing else. In fact, tue manager worst seemed skeptical and said they cant do anything without tye receipt number. After I spent 20 minutes finding the receipt number they then asked me to give me entire credit card information through the phone. I felt like I was doing something wrong by reporting the incident.  They didn't even once ask how my boyfriend was feeling and was completely unsympathetic. They didn't offer any help or comfort. I am really disappointed in their service and execution of help during an illness and emergency.
