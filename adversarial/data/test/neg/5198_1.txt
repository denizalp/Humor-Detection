The food was ok.    It was difficult to eat with the fruit fly's buzzing around and the cockroaches crawling across the floor.    I will never eat here again.    This place was highly recommended by the other people I was with  and even they wouldn't go back after this experience.  \n\nThe restaurant itself is clean but it's showing its age. \n\nTo sum it up, the bugs made the meal a complete turnoff.   Would not eat there again
