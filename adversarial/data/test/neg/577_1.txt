RIPPED OFF. Our lunch here today was the worst dining experience we've had in Calgary. Our $15 chicken donburi bowl was literally white rice and three slices of chicken. Additionally the Bento Box we ordered had dry fish on the sushi and the edamame was soggy and brown (not crisp, green or fresh). The salmon teriyaki consisted of three quarter-sized pieces of fish. For a $30 meal it looked like $5 worth of ingredients. We raised our concerns about the value and were told by staff that \"we understand the portions are not fair, but we can't do anything about it.\" What kind of customer service is that?? There was no attempt to offer us a discount or side item. Overall we felt extremely ripped off. Also, the quality was questionable - which is something you shouldn't be thinking about when eating raw fish! With so many other restaurant options in Calgary, we highly recommend going elsewhere. We will NEVER be returning.
