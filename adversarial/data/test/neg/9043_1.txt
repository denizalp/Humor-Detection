I have been coming to this dental for four years and wouldn't trust anyone else with me or my son. He is very gentle and persistent  with getting the work done. The front staff is always pleasant. I highly recommend  Dr bui and his hygienist who is also gentle  to anyone who is afraid of the dentist  you will have a great experience!
