Being unfamiliar with this area of town, I decided to try this bakery after reading the great reviews. There were so many delicious looking treats to choose from that we had a hard time deciding. However, I am giving this business only two stars because the employees seemed annoyed to have us there (not just one, but all three of them were not friendly at all). I wouldn't say they were rude exactly, but I would describe their demeanor as very unfriendly. It was very odd because I'm used to bakery employees being very happy and upbeat. I felt very unwelcome. Even though the cookies, donut, and cheesecake we bought were delicious, I probably won't try this bakery again due to the poor service. There are plenty of other bakeries in town with equally delicious treats that offer far superior service.
