I've been to Arrogant Butcher a few times with large groups. The service is amazing and the restaurant is very accommodating. The drinks are decently priced and test pretty good. The entrees are a over priced for the taste and quality of the dish. While you definitely get a full plate, the taste doesn't stand out enough to justify what you are paying for it.
