20:45 hostess was very polite and informative about delays but people leaving and tables to be cleared. \n\nBeen here for about 10 minutes waiting for a table in the patio. Currently we are 4th in line. There have been 10 tables waiting to be cleared for the past 15 minutes and no service in site. Lots of serving and hostess staff milling around but no one bussing tables.\n\n20:53 count is down to 9.\n\n20:04 we are in and still the same 6 tables not cleaned\n\nMen's room had not been tended to.  Garbages full, sinks a mess and no towels to dry hands. \n\n20:10 got a table and the hostess brought water.  Shortly we placed a drink order with our server. \n\n20:19 still no drink or waitress to take food order. 2 clean tables, 6 still waiting and customers still waiting for sitting. \n\n20:23 Left disappointed with the lack of service and went down the street for food and drink\n\nI'm sure the food would have been fine but for an establishment that is moving to a fixed tip added to the bill they would really work on the basics of restaurant service.
