Good atmosphere, young server was cheerful and efficient. A bit pricey and either the proprietor changed his specs or his vendor is lying to him. Supposed \"prime grade\" ribeye was quite poor\/disappointing.  I have been in the meat industry forever and this was not a prime cut. Ribeye is fatty anyway and there was no marbling at all.  Probably will not recommend or go back.
