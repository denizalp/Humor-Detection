We took our kids here on our recent trip to Vegas. As soon as we walked in, their eyes lit up and both said \"we have never seen this much pinball machines before and they look old!\":-).  They were so excited to play the games, we were there for hours they didn't want to leave. We had so much fun. And the best part is most of them only cost 25 cents to play. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone, especially if you have kids, they will enjoy it and it's cheap.
