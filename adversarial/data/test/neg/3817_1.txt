This was my first visit to the Packhouse and I'll definitely be back. My friends and I had a variety of food--a meat-based casserole, a veggie plate, a salad with a grilled filet of fish...all very good, fresh, well-seasoned, lovingly presented. And affordable. The staff was friendly, smart and accommodating; we didn't like the first table they  offered us, and they were very kind about re-seating us at a great table. Looking forward to my next visit.
