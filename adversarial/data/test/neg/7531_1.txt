We had a party of 10 on Saturday night. We started off by sitting in the back room with the doors opened on a beautiful evening. The table next to is asked to close the doors but we wanted them open so they moved the other two customers to the other room which was very nice. We appreciated that very much. With that being said our server may have been overwhelmed with   The amount of big tables in the back but we would order our drinks and he would be back from 20-30 minutes and bring other things and we would repeatedly ask where are drinks were and he would say \" don't worry we are working on it.\" Luckily our friends were are pretty relaxed and having a great time or they would have noticed more. I only noticed because I am pregnant and can't drink :-) \nWe ordered two appetizers : the chicken lettuce wraps and short rib pot stickers. Both were great. Everyone ordered salads and loved them. \nFor dinner most of the table had sushi but I ordered the Loup De Mer without the rice and sub asparagus. It was fantastic. Other dishes ordered were the pork chops, udon noodles and the perch. Everyone enjoyed there meal !!!!! \nThe server at the end of the night had no problem taking all five credit cards and splitting it up evenly ! \nLoved The food and hope the next time to come when I deliver this baby and have the drink the Cleveland mule !
