Okay, I really wanted to like this place because I'm a big fan of Sunset Grill generally, but we just didn't like it. You really shouldn't be able to do much wrong with breakfast but if you can't cook something, just don't. We're here on a Sunday morning so maybe the weekday crowd is different but, wow. Everything looked pale and unappetizing but was \"just okay\" to eat except my eggs Bennie, which were hard cooked and dry with very little hollandaise. The waitress replaced it quickly but the potatoes were still pasty and the eggs now erred on the undercooked side. Just kind of sad. We were finally waved up to the cash (from across the restaurant) without being given our check to review. It was a very disappointing experience. Our biggest test is always whether we'll go back. Other people seemed content but we aren't likely to return.
