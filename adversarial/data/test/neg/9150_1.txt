This is the best experience I've EVERY had at a buffet.  The food and service as well as ambiance was great.\n\nCame here with my family a couple days before new years (review is a bit late).  The price was $50 for everyone over age 4.  It was quite expensive for a couple of kids under 10, especially since they don't eat very much.  However, everything, I mean everything was great.  I can't think of anything negative during our visit.\n\nThere was hardly any wait paying for our meal.  We sat down right away.  The server took our drink orders and we went on our way to get food.  The special holiday food they had, I mean all of the food, had great presentation.  During the evening, as I was looking around I even saw them take out some bins and just throw the food in the trash.  Wow.  I guess they want the food to be perfect for its customers.  \n\nAll of the food I has was great.  There wasn't anything that I had that was average or bad.  I had beef Wellington for the first time and it was nice and juicy.  The king crab legs were also great!  \n\nThe service was also the best I've ever had at a buffet.  Whenever we went up to get food, our plates were always taken away.  I never noticed that they took the plates or filled the drinks.  The guy that serviced our table was practically invisible, stealth-like.\n\nThis was the best meal I've had in years!!  I wouldn't mind paying $200 for my family of 4 to eat here again if our experience is like this again.
