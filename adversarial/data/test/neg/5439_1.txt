Met up with some friends on a Saturday afternoon after adulting real hard and running errands all day.\n\nLets say I got there between 3:00-4:00 ... they were not packed by any means. We were there for drinks and socialization and for some reason, we were told we could not have a server and had to order our drinks at the bar...??  Alright, Party of 8, without a server at one of the tables along the sidewalk. Awesome.\n\nAfter a few hours we decided we wanted some food...requested a server for that component...after 20 minutes of waiting, we decided it was time to close out our tabs and go elsewhere since asking one of the many young ladies chatting around the bar to take our orders was a bit too much work...As you can imagine closing 6 tabs (some of our party were couples) took another 20 minutes and finally when the last tab was being closed a server came over to the table...\n\nIf you are looking for country music and average drinks to sit on a given afternoon? Sure give it a whirl, the seats are comfy, the girls are nice to look at and the beer is cold.
