Came here with my mom and sister and they did a great job on our nails.  The prices were so much less expensive than what I am used to paying (even with the few dollars extra for callus removal) and Lily was very friendly.  She gave a very good foot massage, which is always my favorite part! I would definitely recommend this place. Bonus: coffee shop right next door.
