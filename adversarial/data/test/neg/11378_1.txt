I got a gift certificate thinking I would go visit the salt cave....until I did some research and realized this salt cave fad is all hype and has no real therapeutic value other than 'clearing your head' maybe. I opted for a massage when I went. The guy hurt me! I was winching on the bed in pain. I think I may have had the same person as another reviewer who complained also. I've had a few massages at other places and this one was nothing like the others I've had. I left feeling like I still needed a massage and my shoulders were sore for a week where the guy rammed his fingers into my shoulder blades. I also thought I opted for a full body massage and didn't get one. Instead he focused the whole time on my problem areas. The room was quiet, but you could hear every move outside the door.
