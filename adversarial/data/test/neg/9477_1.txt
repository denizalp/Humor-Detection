I went to buy a used Honda from this dealership and ended up buying a car from them.  After 4 hours of haggling I thought I was getting what I wanted.  What I got was the run around, fast talking, double talking and a very rude sales manager.  When I asked for them to explain why the number didn't match our deal and why they charged for products I didn't want there was a lot of finger pointing.  The finance manager blamed the salesman and the sales manager blamed me.  All in all they were rude, demeaning, and typical.
