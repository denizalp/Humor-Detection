Cactus Forty-2 is an amazing place to live.  The location does not get any better.  The staffing is great, especially the Front Office.  The pool is always perfect temperature and is open 24\/7 as well as the brand new fitness center.  They have reliable security overnight that patrols the parking lots and buildings which makes you and your car feel safe.  The Front Office is kind enough to hold personal parties and fun events every few months to get the residents engaged with one another.  I am very pleased living at Cactus Forty-2 and would recommend living here for anyone whether you're going to school, work nearby, retired, raising a family, or just want to live in a cool atmosphere.
