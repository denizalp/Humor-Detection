(service was in 2013) Where to start... 100's of dollars and 4 months of agonizing trips to and from two local auto shops could not remedy my mother's hard starting Civic.   2 days at Village Auto Electric did the trick.   The shops owner, we'll call her \"Winnie\" cause well... That is her name, was filling in at the front desk.   She was most pleasant.   The price for the repair was more than reasonable.    This shop was recommend by Red Mountain Tire and Auto as a go to place for when they are stumped.    Just do your self a favor and go to Village Auto Electric first.
