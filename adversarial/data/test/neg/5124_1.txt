This is a great place for drinks, late night dinner and dessert. I am giving the four stars for my service, the view, and dessert. My daughter and I really were excited to come go here. \n\nThe food menu was not as amazing as we thought it would be. My daughter and I thought it was up charged diner food with obviously a sweet twist. \n\nAppetizers we got were overcooked bacon, crispy broccolini and fried macaroni and cheese. Our main entrees were chicken & waffles and cheese burger on a white chocolate bun. :( the chicken and waffles were chicken strips on top of eggo waffles. We were expecting exquisite chicken pieces with bone fried in a delicate crispy crust on top of amazing sweet savory waffles. The cheese burger was fair - I liked the white chocolate bun - my daughter not so much. Side portions were big portions. \n\nThe desserts were amazing - should be with a name like the 'sugar factory' \n\n\nDrinks- we didn't order any. We wanted to get one of the fancy cocktails without alcohol (daughter is 18 ) no price change. So we didn't get any, wish they a had a non alcoholic version with the cup.
