It's expensive but a great treat every once in a while. \n\nFirst of all, the coffee bar itself is really nice. Very trendy, clean, and \"aesthetic appearance\". \n\nI always enjoy the cakes - I have tried the raspberry-pistachio, chocolate-orange, and black sesame. \n\nMy go to drink is the kyoto matcha latte which is delicious!
