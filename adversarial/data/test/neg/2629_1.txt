I frequent the Venetian, Las Vegas quite a bit and wanted to give Yardbird a try. The setting and decor is quite nice: a nice lounge for people who want to enjoy a drink and several tables that have clear view of the open kitchen. The wife ordered the pulled pork burger with fries and a side of Mac and cheese. I ordered their famous fried chicken (1\/2 a chicken) n watermelon n waffles. Also got the homemade biscuits to start. The biscuits were good and I loved the jam and butter that came with it. The burger unfortunately was way too greasy and the bottom of the bun was soggy and inedible. The chicken was cooked perfectly and tasted great. My only issue was the bourbon syrup. We are not drinkers, so the heavy alcoholic taste of the syrup ruined the waffles. By itself it tasted great but kinda poured the syrup on before we tasted it, so make sure you guys taste the syrup before you pour it on because the couple next to us also had the same issue. Service was great as our waiter was always following up with us. Just the food was a bit of a miss. Would have loved to love it as we go to this resort 4-5 times a year.
