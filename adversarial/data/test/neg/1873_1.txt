Got my hair cut and colored by Eddie and I absolutely love it!  My hair not only looked great but it smelled great too!  I received the seal of approval from my husband and mom (who is a hard woman to please.)\n\nThe salon is quaint and the staff friendly, so happy I finally found a great hairdresser and salon.
