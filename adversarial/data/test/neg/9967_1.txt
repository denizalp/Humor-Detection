I'd like to give this place a 5 star review but, my gel mani just didn't stand up. \n\nThey have online scheduling which is a breeze to use, and the staff was friendly. My nail tech, Anthony stated the current gel I had on was too thick and it shouldn't be that way. I told him that I prefer it thicker, as I use hand sanitizer all day long at work and my nails are brittle. \n\nAfter my nails were done, I had a feeling they wouldn't last, because the gel was just too thin! Well, two days later, a nail cracked, chipped and by one week, I had several nails chipped. Hmmmph.  \n\nI also had the spa pedi. I did really enjoy the pedi, as they are very sanitary. They wrap their bowl in a plastic bag so your not swimming in everyone else's germs! They use fresh cut fruits to infuse the water and a lavender oil. They also rub your legs down with hot stones! \n\nFor both services, I only paid a whopping $55! That is a bonus. I just wish my nails lasted longer. \n\nWould I go back? Yes, but ONLY for their pedicures.
