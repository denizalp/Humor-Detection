This place is a must go to. Food is delicious and dessert is just amazing. We had peach cobbler and it is made to each order so expect to wait for dessert or order dessert at same time you order your food. The food was amazing and our waiter was very attentive and constantly checked up on us. I highly recommend to come try this place if you like southern food. The crispy fried chicken is delicious.
