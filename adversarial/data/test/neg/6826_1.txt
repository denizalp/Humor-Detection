I came here with my girlfriend on a Friday night. She got the raspberry sorbet mixed with coconut sorbet and it was great! I got the cappuccino biscotti gelato in a large waffle cone and it was very good. The staff are very friendly. Their seating area is small but it was nice and cozy. Definitely instagrammable (if your girlfriend is into that haha).
