Tiny little gem of a place, tucked in a strip mall, I never would have noticed had I not bought a Groupon, and used GPS to find it... The salsa (all three flavors) was off the charts! The carne asada was amazing! I agree with some of the other reviewers that the chips did not match the quality of the rest of the food. They weren't bad, I'd say they were 'almost' average. The service was very friendly, they really made me feel like I was a guest in their home. \n\nOur server (you order at the counter, so not sure you'd call her a 'server') suggested the lemonade, and I don't normally have lemonade, not sure why I said yes to the lemonade, but I'm sooo glad  I did! I have never enjoyed a glass of lemonade as much as I enjoyed theirs! It was the perfect blend of sweet and sour, it was so delicious, that I was able to learn their refill policy: 1st refill is free, second you've gotta pay... which btw, I totally did. I had to take some of that home with me. \n\nAfter our meal, we stepped outside for a cigarette... only then did I notice that they are located right next to one of those special massage parlors, you know the kind, they have an ATM inside and stay open really late... It was a little odd to be smoking right outside of a late night massage parlor, especially when a couple of the men customers came out. But I can't blame this lovely restaurant for their funny neighbors. \n\nThis would have been a five star if it weren't for the chips. With food and three flavors of salsa that absolutely amazing, they really need the better chips.
