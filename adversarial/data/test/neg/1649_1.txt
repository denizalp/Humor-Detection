These pupusas are so good. It's my go to restaurant whenever i'm craving them. The pupusas were thick and really satisfying. After two, I was stuffed. Their plantains with cream and beans were a perfect appetizer. It was busy when we got there so it took a little while for our food to come out, but it was worth it. For $2 a piece, I'll definitely be coming back!
