Such good pizza. Hailing from Chicagoland we have been limited to Pizza Hut since we moved to waunakee. We got the tomato pie (since my husband and kids are cheese pizza people) and I got the forza. The crust is perfect. I wish the forza had red sauce but that's just because I love red sauce (sure I could ask for some and I just stole some from the other pizza). The only thing I wish I knew is that you can make any specialty pizzas half and half. I would have def done 1\/2 fig and bacon. Or carbonara. Or forestiere. Next time Sals. Next time.
