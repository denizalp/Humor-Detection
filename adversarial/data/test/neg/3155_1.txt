Came here for the lunch buffet, didn't have to wait but tables were steadily filling and turning over. Servers seem like they need a little more time to practice, very timid and sometimes confused. \n\n While I prefer Indian Flame on the east side or Charkha in the Warehouse District, this place will do the trick for a quick lunch. The food itself tastes like a fast food version of what you can get from them. The squash curry was my favorite from the buffet.
