On the plus side, the inn got us a place to stay. Smelled stale, had bare bones fixtures. Nice TV. The main trouble was the road crew, including bobcat, starting outside our window at 0815.  No kidding. The noise was extreme. It would have helped somewhat if the person checking us in had given us a warning (life does have choices). *Note: we saw some dogs leaving rooms, so they may be pet friendly. Didn't stick around to confirm.
