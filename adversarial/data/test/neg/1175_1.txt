I cannot say I have ever eaten Peruvian food or maybe I just can't distinguish it from other Spanish influenced foods. I am not a fan of foods covered in thick sauces unless it is a curry, so I stuck to arroz con pollo, which leads me back to my first statement. I eat this dish when I go to Cuban restaurants, so I might not have gotten a true taste of Peru. Of course, I got a side of fried plantains, but for $4.50 I have received a more satisfying amount at other establishments. I can eat these sweet treats by the truckload, so I was rather disappointed. \n\nThe arroz con pollo was delicious. My favorite item on the plate were the onions, in a citrus dressing, instead of the chicken or rice. I ended up eating all of it to refresh my palate after every bite of the rice. The chicken was moist, but a little on the bland side. The rice was really flavorful, but a little greasy. I would have also liked it if it came with a side of black beans, but it didn't. I guess I have always come to expect a plate to come with rice, beans, plantains, chicken and onions. \n\nThe serving size was large. I packed half of it to take home. I would go back, but I will do my research so that I can claim to have an authentic experience next time.
