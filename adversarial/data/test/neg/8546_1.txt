Firstly, the food is okay. I've had better Mediterranean fare, but I've also had much worse. It's passable and normally I'd say it's worth a return visit. But it's just too expensive. Lunch for two adults and a kid ran us well over $30, and that's with the 15% discount for checking in on Yelp. The kid's meal was a TINY bowl of rice and chicken. The red pepper hummus isn't as good as Pita Jungle's. The falafel isn't as good as Greek Wraps. Store-bought babaghannouj is better. And they were out of Coke Zero. But the tzatziki was ok. Again, it's not horrible, but it's worth maybe half the prices they are charging.\n\nIn addition, they mopped the floors while diners were present. Thanks, but I can do without the pungent detergent stench while I'm eating lunch. Likely won't return, nothing here is better value than Pita Jungle quite frankly.
