Probably one of the most expensive car washes I have ever visited.  The basic wash is $12.00.   Although they do a nice job pre-washing the car, it is actually a touchless system which I am not a big fan as it doesn't seem to clean as well.    Perhaps it's a regional thing, but I am used to a $5.00 car wash with includes a full wash and towel dry.
