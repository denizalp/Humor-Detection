This was my first fine dining experience. My friend and I are spoiled when it comes to good food (quality family cooks and cooks ourselves). Let me just say the atmosphere is gorgeous. The service incredible, the best I've ever experienced. I was surprised with the menu, in a disappointing way. Basically, meat in almost all courses. Really no palate cleansing anywhere. All the flavors were just a little overwhelming after the third course. Strangely, I don't know if it was just what I chose, but everything tasted sweet. The cauliflower soup was the absolute most delicious soup I've ever ordered. The only Earthy, salty flavor I had. It was a lot of fun, but we craved salt and spice afterwards. We do not regret going at all.
