This place has horrible customer service and scheduling.  I was told by the physician   \nthat I needed an MRI of my Neck.  \"Okay\", I said.  \"please go ahead and schedule me as soon as possible.  They told me that they first had to get pre-approval from my insurance company and that typically can take five days.  I say \"okay\" and even provide them with the place that I would like to use for the MRI.   Six days goes by and no  response from Western Reserve and Pain institute.  So I call them ask if they have gotten approval.  They say that they have not even started the approval process.\nThey say that they needed to know where I wanted to have it done which I already told them.  They denied that I told them where I wanted to go.  Basically called me a liar.  Said they a left voice mail on my cell and office phone.  My office phone is a land line and I assure you that if they would have left a message it would have been there.  So they called me a liar again saying that I got the voice mail.  I don't know much about customer service but I don't think calling the customer a liar is not good practice.  I finally get the MRI and I am diagnosed with herniated cervical disks.  They recommend that I get an Epidural Steroid injection in the cervical area C5, C6, C7.  Okay, I make the appointment for the procedure.  They give me a time and date for the appointment which I record on paper and even confirm back by repeating it.  They send out a letter which I did not receive until the day before the procedure.  The letter has multiple pages with instructions and buried within they had changed the procedure time.  I did not see the procedure time change until the day of the procedure.My wife had scheduled off time from her job so that she could drive me to and from the procedure which is required.  Now with the appointment time change she was going to have a problem with her job.  We went into the office 20 minutes prior to the original appointment as required for the procedure.   we Asked them was there anything that could be done to accommodate us.  They told me that I was not told the appointment time that I recorded on paper and called me a liar again.  At this point I was still early for the new appointment time which was later than the original time.  After being getting called a liar repeatedly and telling me that the time was the time and I would have to deal with it,  the office lady told me because I was confrontational with her that she had called the doctor and they had now cancelled my procedure.  So I took off work and drove to this facility to be called a liar and then because I didn't get on my knees and beg for forgiveness my procedure was cancelled.  The office lady there actually has the power to cancel your procedure if she doesn't like how you talk to her.  AMAZING.  I will never do business with this facility again.  I also found out that they are not affiliated with University Hospitals or Cleveland Clinic.  I am beginning to think they are a small shoddy operation.  If you value your time and health I would steer clear of this place.
