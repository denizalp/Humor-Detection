We have lived here for over 6+ years. And the new management has come in and made this place better. All three girls in the office are professional and give 500% at what they do. The actual manager is so good and helpful that she is always there for you when you need her. And the best part of being here is that you always feel like it's home. They have the best layouts in apartment living I have ever seen. We would recommend these apartments to all our family and friends that where moving. Service from The assistant and the leasing agent is top notch. You never have a team that works together like they do. All of them will be glad to help you and make you feel comfortable at all times. This also comes down to having a great manager. \n\nThe maintenance is top notch also. The team is on top of all request and orders. We have never has a problem with any of them as long as I have. They can fix or replace anything that is wrong and do it in a timely manner. The best thing about them is that they respond back with in that same day or next day with any issues. \n\nWe have never had any crime since we have lived here and not seen any crime also. We like the restaurants around the area they are great and fun to go to. You are close to The point resort and a great golf course. They also have the best restaurants there.\n\nIn all we love the community and always will. If we could move all of Phoenix in that would be the best. \n\nYour place is the best we have ever lived in our lives!!!!!!
