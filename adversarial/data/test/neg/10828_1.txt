Now that I've had the time to take my wheels off and look around at my suspension I can write this review. As you can see from the photos on my cars Instagram page. My suspension is cleaned and polished and painted.  Aftermarket lowering springs, aftermarket struts, aftermarket camber adjustable upper ball joints, and camber adjusters in the rear too. I first took the car over to my local PepBoys were the manager was a long time friend and the guy who does the alignment a friend  when I worked there. He knew my passion for my car. So I figured that they would do a good job. The alignment guy at Pep Boys said that he could not do it. It would be too much work and take too long. So with that I figured I better not screw around and go to a real alignment shop. A Arrow alignments video on yelp is what convinced me to give them a try. \n\nThe first thing they did when they got the keys to my car is they put covers on the seat so now my seat looks like a chair at grandmas house with the plastic cover on it. And they also put a cover on my steering wheel. Even though I have a floormat to protect my floormat they put a floor mat over that too.\n\nWhy I brought this car in is because I replaced the steering rack. Installed front and rear camber adjustment kits. To make the adjustment for the 2 inch lowering kit. On the rear the adjustment bolt had to be turned six times just to make a minor movement on the camber it was difficult for the mechanic to get to it with the car being lowered the tire is right in the way of that adjustment. But he took his time and got the rear adjusted perfectly. The front was more difficult because the upper A arm adjustable ball joint is right at the very top of the shock tower where you cannot access it with the car on the ground. Their equipment compensates for the car being jacked up so they can make adjustments to get it very close and then put it back down on the ground to make final adjustments to make it perfect. \n\nI'm glad I didn't try any other alignment shops because they probably would've whined and complained and it cost me an arm and a leg to get it done. \n\nOne other thing I recommend you do is to research a little bit about alignment, camber caster, tow in toe out, so you have some prior knowledge when you go there, For when they explain to you what was off on your vehicle and how they adjusted it to make it right. You'll be able to take all this that you've learned when you get back on the road and be able to better experience the changes to your vehicle.\n\nAs for my inspection of my vehicle afterwards everything. It is still neat and clean  and polished no dings or dents or chips. Has for all these pictures of these fancy cars at the shop that you see on Yelp. when I was there I saw the station wagon from SoCal speed shop. It came in for some work. There were also some regular cars but they were in and out in a very short period of time probably because they Don't all this fancy aftermarket suspension adjustment that needs to be done but simple get it straight and get it out the door factory suspension.
