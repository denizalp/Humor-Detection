I went in on Monday 2\/26\/18 and writing my review two days later . I normally don't leave bad review but I'm shocked how bad my nails are becoming . I went in for pedicure and manicure. My pedicure was amazing so if your looking for a good place for that this is the place . However my nails on the other hand not so great . Pretty color and was happy when I left on how they turned out . I've had sns done before on my natural nail and always had long last results . This time around not so much . this is barely two days later and my nails are cracking and chipping ... I'm so disappointed . I spend over $100 for my nails and toes and my nails couldn't last a full 24 hours .. I don't understand !
