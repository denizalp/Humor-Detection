I came to the restaurant because Guy Fieri is one of my favorite chefs.   The menu has changed this place no longer has tacos serves mostly burgers and appetizers that aren't very good.  I believe if Guy Fieri visited this restaurant himself he would agree it's just not a good representation of his cooking.   I got the triple-B burger which was burnt bacon was burnt the blue cheese was overpowering.\nthey did take it back and bought out another burger  and it was burnt as well.  Very expensive.  For a burger and a salad along with 2 alcoholic beverages is was $67.
