I have been to this cafe multiple times, and the customer service never fails to always displease me. The only reason I revisit this location is the fact that it is a decent place to study near my home.\n\nDuring past visits, I have had the same two cashiers\/servers, and they are consistently rude performing their duties. Today, an unfamiliar worker took, made, and delivered my order, and he was just as awful. Smiling is part of customer service, and all three have not done this with me during any of my visits.\n\nDuring my first time in this cafe, which was in September 2016, he interrupted with a rude, irritated tone to ask me which cup size for my drink. The primary concern in this particular situation is the tone of voice he used with me. To me, it was acceptable for him to interrupt in order to accurately record the purchase, but he could have been more polite in doing so.\n\nUpon completion of each transaction, they do not express any sign of gratitude, such as saying a simple \"Thank you.\" In addition to serving my orders, they again do not smile nor do they respond to my \"Thank you.\"\n\nTonight, I made a second purchase during my visit, and the cashier was distracted towards the end of the transaction. He was delayed in giving me my change because he was having a conversation with an off-duty employee.\n\nThe simplest aspects of customer service, such as smiling and giving absolute attention to customers, show guests that you appreciate their business. If bad customer service happens once, then ok. However, if it is consistent with every visit, then something is truly wrong. I only come back to the cafe because I can actually focus during my study sessions. Also, I continue to purchase items during my visit out of respect for providing me with a place to study. I just do not enjoy going into the cafe feeling reluctant and hesitant to order something.
