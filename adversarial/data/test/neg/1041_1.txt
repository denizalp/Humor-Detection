I travel to Toronto 3-4 times a year between work and the Maple Leafs, typically staying at the Delta downtown. For whatever reason this visit their prices were much higher than their already pricey (for an admittedly great room\/location) so I looked elsewhere.\n\nI've been into Over Easy, the attached restaurant, plenty of times so it was time to give Hotel Victoria a try. Booked through a large online engine that rhymes with schmotels lot rom as their rate was considerably cheaper than booking direct which was odd but oh well.\n\nTurns out I'm an idiot unable to tell a Monday from a Tuesday.\n\nArriving on Tuesday only to find out that I missed my stay from last nite there was no problem, new rooms were available (though I have to say they were well cheaper than what was shown online, had I seen that price to start I would never have schmotels lot rom'd it). Room was small but plenty for a single nite. Great recommendations for local drinks\/food. Its weird but one of the best showerheads I've had in any of my travels.\n\nI'll be fighting the battle of my own making with schmotels but I'll absolutely be back to Hotel Victoria in the future.
