I've been here probably about five times and each time is like being on a roller coaster.. up.. down.. up ... down.  So with Gordon Biersch, the food I get is good.. is bad.. is good.. is ba... you get it.\n\nI was here with some friends for my buddies birthday last night, and while the food wasnt the best that night, service was awesome and we got to sit outside in the perfect weather.\n\nOverall I do enjoy the majority of the food. Who cant get enough of those garlic fries?  Of course after dinner, be sure to grab a mint.  The place is split into two sides, dinning side and the bar side, which also has some dining areas.  It sits on the second floor right above some club and Starbucks.  Coffee and drinking.. oh what a combo.\n\nI love the whole Mill Ave. vibe going and this is a perfect place for this restaurant.  Is it my favorite place to eat in the world? Not even close.. however I will gladly eat here anytime. \n\nEnjoy!
