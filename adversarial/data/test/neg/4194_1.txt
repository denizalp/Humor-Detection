We came on a Saturday around 11am the wait was 20-25 minutes which did not bother us.  Almost all breakfast places have a wait.  Our waitress was Teresa and she was great a beautiful personality.  The food was really good next time we come to Arizona we will make sure to stop by.  \nI got scrambled eggs with mushroom, spinach\nMy husband got the chilaquiles\nOur friend got the juans tacos \nEveryone enjoyed their meal.
