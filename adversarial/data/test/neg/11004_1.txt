I've been blessed to have Flora Couture in my life for over 15 years now. Graduations, proms, weddings, holidays, everything! They have always been consistent when it comes to going above and beyond. Their arrangements are not only beautiful, but they last longer than any other in the business.\n\nThank you Michele and Debbie \nLove you allll
