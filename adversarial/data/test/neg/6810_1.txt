This was a really well priced bakery. Most things were close to $1, and the desserts tasted amazing. I especially liked the egg tart on the flaky pastry. The custard was smooth and delicate, and was probably the best egg tart I have ever had. The cakes on display were amazing, and they had a very impressive variety of baked goods. \n\nWhat I didn't like was that the taro tart was overly yeasty, and had a strange sour tang to it, which I have never encountered with any other taro tart. The only other complaint that I had was that the bakery was very stingy with the napkins. We had to ask twice, and only got two sheets of napkins in total. \n\nBe aware that there is limited seating in the bakery- only 4 small tables. We ended up eating standing up, since all the others chairs were taken.
