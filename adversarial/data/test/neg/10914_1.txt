I love the Banh Mi here and the nice location in the village often means there's handsome men with beards also eating here. The only drawback is the soup which isn't so nice and is often messy, and not quite the impression you want to make on the handsome bearded men. It's also made with hot water poured over cold ingredients which isn't the best (although I get that it befits the kind of kitchen they have). But oh those sandwiches. 5 stars for the sandwich and 2 stars for the ersatz soup.
