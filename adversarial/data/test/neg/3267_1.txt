I love their service. 1\/2 price wine night on Tuesdays is a great change to the usual Wednesday night that everyone else does. Their food is scrumptious!. Soup du jour is always a good blend of ingredients that can easily be paired with a wine from their hand-picked selections!  Great mixed crowd and atmosphere.
