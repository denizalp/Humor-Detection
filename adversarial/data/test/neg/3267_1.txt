Always great service with a smile & amazing fresh cooked food. Got my favorite, the Irish Skillet, delicious & filling with home made corned beef hash. I highly recommend! \n\n(Different day) We come here often because it's always great. Not super happy with the corned beef hash today, it was mushy & had too much garlic. I'll still be back
