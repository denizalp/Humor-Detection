Seems really disorganized. It was hard to get anyone's attention after walking in, and on top of that they lost my reservation despite the fact that I had received and responded to a calendar invitation respecting my reservation. They also didn't seem to care. The servers seem to wander around searching for the person who ordered a given drink. The food's not bad though. On balance, I'm not sure I'd come back.
