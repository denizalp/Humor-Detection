If you have long hair and want some layers, you'll be fine here. If you have short hair, don't risk it. My pixie cut had grown out too much over the summer, so I went in for a trim. It took an hour and a half. My phase 2 professional (who was very friendly and kind) had never cut short hair before, and had never used the tool the teacher wanted her to use. I don't blame her at all, because, after all, it is a school, and she's there to learn. I was impressed that she was considerate enough to admit that she wasn't comfortable and wanted to wait for extra help. Her teacher, however, was too busy hanging out with the students who weren't doing anything to provide the help and guidance my stylist needed. My stylist was careful to double check what I wanted, and made sure not to cut too much off, but when the teacher came around to check her work and add in the texture (with the razor my stylist had never used before), she didn't ask any questions at all, and just went to town, completely changing the style. My hair is now way shorter than I wanted, in a style I didn't ask for and don't like, and I have to use product (something I explicitly told them I NEVER LIKE TO DO) to keep from looking like a cockatoo. \n\nI have had very good experiences at other Paul Mitchell schools, in other states - when I had longer hair. \n\nIf you have short hair, don't make my mistake.
