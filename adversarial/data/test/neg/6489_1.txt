First time patient, my appt was for 8:00am I arrived at 7:50 to fill out necessary forms. I was told sign the clip board and to take a seat. Before I sat down I let them know I was a first time patient but before I was able to finish letting the reception know and she interrupted me mid sentence and told me I had 5 people ahead of me and to have a seat..Rude. I didn't get my paperwork until 8:20am and it was 6 pages long. I was asked if I had Xrays with me or do I need some taken I told the reception I don't need Xrays I'm here for a rash on my feet..she gave me my papers. Sat down for not even 5 mins and a man came and got to take me to the X-ray room. Can I say no communication..I told the man I'm not here for x-rays I'm here for a rash. So he sat me down back in the waiting room not even 5 mins later a woman came and got me and asked all these questions that should have been answered on the second on the 6 pages I still had to fill out which I wasn't even finished with first page by this time. After all of the questions about my history I was asked to once again did I take any Xrays...Grr! Really frustrated by this time. So after all the questions she sits me back in the waiting room not even 5 mins before I'm called back by a different person. 3 different people by this time!!! And the third and final person once again ask me about Xrays again. Can I say lost of communication again...Grrr! So I finally finish all 6 pages of paperwork while waiting for the doctor for 20mins. When he finally got in there he was obviously running late because he comes bursting in the room talking fast. I was asked finally what I'm there for, Now shouldn't he know by looking at the paperwork he received from the 3rd person who asked me what I was there for...So when I explained about my history regarding my feet and the problems I was having he starting to explain what he thought it could be but he wasn't sure so at this time he said he was going to look up what he thinks it could be and to see if they had pictures of the rash he looked at on my feet. He came back and told me to write down what he thinks it could be and to look it up and see if those are the symptoms that I'm having, at that time I gave him a blank stare O_O and he said Or I can write it down...Umm yeah you're suppose to do, not me...So when we were done I explained to him that his front desk has no communication and I was given the paperwork really late so I didn't get the chance to finish. And I was asked numerous times about x-ray and had to go back and forth 3 times and this up and down in the chair was very uncomfortable because I have back problems. And also I told them you have a lot of older people and they shouldn't being put thru this experience and it looks bad on him as a doctor. And he should bring it up in the next meeting or speak with the office manager. So with that being said we I left and had to check out I explain to them I will not be returning because of the experience I received. after that I called the pharmacy and cancelled my prescription and I was going somewhere....
