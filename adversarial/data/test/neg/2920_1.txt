Our a\/c broke down I guess from over working since we didn't got much of a winter this year in Vegas ( it's an old unit) so I called air tech ( got their number from a friend), they came the next day first thing in the morning before I left to work and the technician fixed it in no time .I couldn't be happier from the service, they coming early morning and actually be there on time , giving a fast service so I won't be late for work and a great price. Thank you guys!
