Upon entering and sitting down at a table near the bar area, it took awhile for anyone to come over to us.  When someone finally did, they brought chicken fingers....oops, they weren't ours, since we hadn't even seen a menu yet.  Finally, someone came over with menus....but we had just come for drinks, and didn't try any food.\n\nMore specifically, we had come for the Bumbleberry Ale, which was a 2010 Midwest winner.....and they were out of it.  I was sad, as it was what I came from out-of-town to try.....  the waitress was unable to tell me when they would have it again.  So, I settled for the Apricot Wheat, which I wasn't too impressed with.  It was a bit malty for my taste.  I sampled and then got a glass of the Summer Haze also, which I did like.  I was going to try another beer (German-like with banana and clove notes), but they were out of that as well.\n\nIf the waitstaff were more on the ball and their inventory were more in order, I would have rated this higher....but...maybe better luck next time.
