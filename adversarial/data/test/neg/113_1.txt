This place is ridiculously slow and unapologetic about it. It is Gastonia, but still. Tried the carside-to-go, even worse. Gave it another shot, thinking maybe they were just having a bad night, and found that at least they're consistent. 50 minutes to get my small order to go last time. Oh, it was longer the first time. The signs outside for to-go orders should say, \"park here to be ignored \", or something along those lines. It is amusing to watch and listen to the customers leaving, but I was hungry dang it. Food isn't good enough to justify the wait and baditude. Don't think I'll ever give this place another try. Zero stars.
