I've been a customer going on a little over a year now...Jon is AMAZING!!! My Highlander always looks as good as the day I bought it! He's always so professional and friendly. So easy to talk to and does the greatest job! I refuse to get my vehicle detailed by anyone or anywhere else...you won't be disappointed with his service!
