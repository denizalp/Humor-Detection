So I had some old gold sitting around the house and thought I would go see what it was worth. After reading other reviews and a client referral I thought I would check out Diamond Jim's. Jim was very nice and gave me a quote super fast for my gold free of charge. After testing the gold which he does in front of you, I left with over $800! I definitely felt like he was being honest and I never felt uncomfortable. All in all it was a good experience.
