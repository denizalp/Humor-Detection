I've gone here twice in two years, had 4 pairs of shoes fixed, and it's been amazing. One time I had 2 pairs of leather winter boots with broken zippers, in great general condition but unwearable because of the broken zippers. He fixed both zippers without problems, giving both pairs of boots a new life! \n\nLast week I took in two pairs of fall shoes with heels; the heels had worn down completely, not just the little piece at the bottom but also the heel itself. I was worried that the damage was beyond repair, and sad since these are two of my favourite shoes and the only thing wrong was the heel. I was very glad to see that he was able to replace both heel bottoms and fill in the damage on the heels themselves - good as new. Thank you!
