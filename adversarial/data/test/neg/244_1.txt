If you like classical music, this place is a must.  The orchestra is not only the best in the U.S., but its World Famous. They travel all of over the world. Its really is a treat to hear them play. Also, in the summers you can go to Blossom and hear them play on the 4th of July. Afterward, you can watch the fireworks. They also play a free concert in downtown Cleveland a week before Christmas. Its a great experience, but you will need to bundle up. I think they play for 2 hours.
