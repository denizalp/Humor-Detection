Yea...uhm Whoever has been to Hawaii, knows that this is not Hawaiian food. This is Hawaiian fusion. Uhm Where's my LocoMoco or my kahlua pig. Even better yet. a bowl of freakin rice.  Yea if I wasn't tricked to this place being hawaiian food I would have probably rated it higher. I just missed real Hawaiian food. Poke is good if it's done right. I miss Trader Vic's or even real home cookin like Bruddah's in LA! Yea baby. Well Aloha Kitchen is good home cookin hawaiian food. Maybe I'll go review that....Ok so 3 stars because I was TRICKED like a John looking for a 25 dolla fix.
