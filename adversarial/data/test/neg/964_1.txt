Ordered Burnt Ends, Saint Louis ribs (dry) with Mac and cheese and potato salad. The sides were good meats no. Burnt Ends should melt in your mouth, these were inedible shoe leather. I can't imagine a restaurant with any pride actually serving them. The ribs arrived wet not dry as ordered. Had zero flavor other than the unwanted sauce and more fat than meat. Definitely not a spot we will return to.
