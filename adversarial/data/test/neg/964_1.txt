Pretty disappointing. Bartender collected our money,  said 'thanks' and didn't bring back the change, of which there was more than a good tip. Fish boiI is gone; the best burger in the city (blue cheese with bacon jam on a pretzel roll) gone; most of the staff gone. We ordered a goat cheese cheesecake (very good) with coffee that came out 10 minutes before the dessert. Our food was just ok.\nI'm sure they are not aiming to keep the over 60 crowd that used to go there- we saw very few of  the old Friday night regulars. I like the interior, but many of the older east side crowd will be a bit uncomfortable with the retro- this- belongs- downtown vibe. They really should have re-named the place entirely so there would less expectation that anything remained the same.\nBut, I understand the sometimes need to change. Overall- meh
