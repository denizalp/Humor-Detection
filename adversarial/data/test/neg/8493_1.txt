I ordered the injeolmi shaved ice with a side of tapioca ($9.99 + $0.99). Compared to Cups and Soul Cafe, the mochi was not as soft and there wasn't much condensed milk layered in the dessert. Most of the condensed milk was at the bottom of the cup while at other shaved ice places they would layer the condensed milk or it will be at the sides of the cup. The shaved ice was not as fine compared to other places. However, this cafe offers a nice atmosphere with plenty of tables. Oh and the tapioca was cooked nicely :)
