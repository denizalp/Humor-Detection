I've been to Sushi Island quite a few times with large groups and have to admit that despite the quality not actually being all that good, that all-you-can-eat from a large selection of maki for $13.99 makes quite a good deal.\n\nWhat I like most about the menu though when I feel like going a la carte is the assortment of brown and mixed rice maki options. The avocado, inari, and mushroom Forever Young roll is a veggie favourite.\n\nThe service is never outstanding, but efficient nonetheless. On my latest visit, the server was even unapologetically coughing into her hand while gesturing to the nearest table. \n\nThe decor is interesting though, with cave like textures and large metal tiles juxtaposed with gaudy whiteboards advertising free lunch draws and fading crooked sushi posters.
