I tried this place on my lunch break, as I work nearby.  As other reviewers mentioned, the food is very cheap.  For $5  I had wonton filled with nice fresh tasting shrimp (nicely chopped, not mashed to paste), noodles, Chinese broccoli and broth.  It was too hot for tea so I did not use the water dispenser.  The food was quite good, especially the wonton.\n\nHowever, despite the fact that the place was immaculate, I almost walked out due to the ammoniacal  smell, which I took to be fish combined with cleaning fluid.  I have a feeling there might be a cultural difference between Asians and Westerners in reactions to odours like this.  After all, it was nothing dirty, just unpleasantly fishy to my nose though the other patrons seemed to be oblivious.\n\nDecor is nil.  Service by a mother (presumably) the owner and what appeared to be her son was very friendly, accommodating and helpful.
