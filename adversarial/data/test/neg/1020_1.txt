Simply delightful from start to finish, this little bistro in the heart of the Latin Quarter cannot be missed.  The ambiance, friendly staff (the brother-owners are amazing), the food, everything, La Demande Generale pays attention to reach detail with painstaking care to ensure every guest feels like they are welcomed family. Thank you for an amazing experience. Highly recommended to everyone living in or visiting Montreal.
