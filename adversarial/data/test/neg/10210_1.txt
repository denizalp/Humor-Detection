Not.impressed.\n\nI recently moved around the corner and this place has been on my hit list to try. I met some girlfriends around 6:30 for dinner and drinks. Happy hour goes until 7 so I was pleased about that. The place had a good crowd but wasn't overly busy, as expected for a Tuesday evening. I read the mixed reviews, so I didn't really know what to expect.\n\nUnfortunately, it wasn't a great experience for me. I arrived a little after my party and had to wait forever for our server to take my order. Since it was happy hour, I ordered a white sangria. Took forever to come out and it was disgusting. I had to send it back. When I sent it back, my girlfriend told me she had sent hers back right before I walked in and forgot to warn me about it. It tasted so unusual. Like, flat Sprite out of a mildewy dirty soda machine. Gag. And there was no fruit in it (?)\n\nI don't know what our server was doing (we saw her a total of 3 times in the 2 hours we were there) but the manager came over to check on us. When I sent the sangria back she was apologetic and recommended a white wine. It was a buttery chardonnay and very tasty. And she also comp'd the drink for me which I appreciated. When she came back with the glass she examined it and saw a spot and went back and brought me a clean one. I appreciated that as well. That took this review from 1 to 2 stars.\n\nOn to the food. I tasted the crabcakes, bbq shells and cheese and parmesan fries. Not a fan of the crabcakes (in all fairness, I'm from the east coast and ridiculously hard to please when it comes to crabcakes), but they were flat, too much filler and too little crab, and not seasoned well. They should just take the bbq shells and cheese off the menu. It's lazy and gross. The flavors just don't go together. The fries were good. Nothing I haven't had before though. \n\nService (by our server) and the food were seriously lacking. I'm willing to give it another shot since I'm so close and I've heard their breakfast is really good. But I left this evening really disappointed.
