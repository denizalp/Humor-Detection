I run a dog rescue and have brought many of our dogs here to be spayed or neutered. That staff is very attentive and polite, the vet is amazing. The incision that she makes compared to many vets that I have worked with, is about half the size, which makes recovery much faster. I always feel confident that there will be a great outcome when I walk out of the clinic, each morning after I drop off there! No worries.
