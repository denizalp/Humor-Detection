WORSE CUSTOMER SERVICE!  \nThey live up to their one star rating. First off, we had to pay for a taxi to get to the Rent-A-Car place because the shuttle never showed up. After waiting in line for 45 minutes to rent our SUV we originally booked, they told us that they did not have an SUV available but could give us and economy car and call us that same day once someone returned an SUV. Here it is five days later and returning their vehicle and we still never received a call. Never booking here again!
