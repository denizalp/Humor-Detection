This Mediterranean restaurant is one of the best I have been in a long long time. Their food is so authentic and the services is amazing. My husband and I sat at the bar to have dinner the other night and our bartender Jose was such a great help to guide us with our experience. We started by having a delicious lebanaeh dip with Laffa bread. Jose also recommended we try an old Hollywood cocktail and a Pinot noir glass of wine to go with our meal. We really enjoyed Cleo's happy hour. We also tried their lam shawarma, it was the best I've ever had. Their Brussels sprouts are to die for, Crispy like potatoes chips. I will definitely be coming back to dine here with my family next time we are in Vegas. Thanks to all the Cleo staff for the great service.
