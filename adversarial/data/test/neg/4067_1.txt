I really wanted to like Dailo. I've been hearing rave reviews about this place for years and finally got to try it. The atmosphere was great, the service was impeccable, and the decor was very cute. But the food was just not there, definitely not worth what they were charging. Almost felt like they were trying too hard to be unique\/interesting, but the taste was really blah, and the portion was very small. Prefer Lee or R&D for much better Asian fusion.
