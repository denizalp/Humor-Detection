Great customer service! Friendly staff and such an easy process. There was a time when I was renting a car from them every weekend during the $9.99 a day season. They always have cars available , they are time efficient with picking you up from your home or office or wherever you might be and same thing with dropping you off after you drop of the rental. I've rented cars from HERTZ and BUDGET and honestly Enterprise is the best. Both Hertz and Budget had hidden fees and I was charged up to $100 more than what my \"invoice\" said. I've not once had any problems with Enterprise , they are very friendly and get the job done. I will never rent a car from any other rental car place other than Enterprise.
