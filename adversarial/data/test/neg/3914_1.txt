This easy moderate trail has more  gradual inclines compared to the end of Telegraph trail on South Mountain, which I prefer.   Flat and wider paths makes Pima Wash dog friendly, which we saw many of yesterday.  From one of the peaks you can see west of downtown PHX to south of Chandler.  Nice photo ops all along the way!
