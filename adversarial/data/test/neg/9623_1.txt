Very good food.  Lots of fish dishes but a wide variety of everything. A lot of different tacos and dishes.\n\nThe tuna crudo is excellent and a very large portion.\n\nThe watercress salad is amazing. I love the peppery taste of watercress and you don't see it often.  The jicama  really added to this.  My only complaint is it had a bit too much dressing on it.\n\nThe shrimp tacos were spicy but not too much. The shrimp were cooked very well. I would have preferred a flour tortilla to the corn one but it was excellent.  The cilantro rice that came with it was amazing.  I don't eat beans so I didn't try those.\n\nThey start you with chips and three salsas. One is smoky another and the other too are equally good.  My chips were pretty much crumbs but others I saw were fine.\n\nOverall a good experience.
