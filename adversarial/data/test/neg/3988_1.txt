Confession of a landlocked seafood lover: I'm a fan of Sakana. I know, I know, it's not the Most Perfect Sushi Ever but all things considered, the prices, variety, specials and service are far above average. I'll take it! There's a great \"Customer Appreciation\" sushi menu offered Thurs.-Sun. and though there's often a wait, it's a quick one. Don't be afraid to order an Ichiban in the lobby. They'll happily deliver.
