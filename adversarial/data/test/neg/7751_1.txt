Horrible from the beginning. Had high expectations of this place based on a friends recommendation. Well it was not as described. First off they advertise specials daily. Such as today, Tuesday, was all you can eat ribs. I was told by our waitress that they didn't do that special during sporting events(the coyotes had a game that night). So I said ok and just ordered a burger. As I was eating my burger the table behind me ordered 3 orders of all you can eat ribs and they were not turned down. So I asked the manager what the deal was. He stated if people complained they were offering that special to them. I thought it was quite rude and a horrible way for a restaurant to handle a new customer. That said I probably won't be back. I just want everyone to know that if there is an event don't plan on getting the advertised specials.
