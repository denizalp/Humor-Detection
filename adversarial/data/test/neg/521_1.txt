3.5 stars.  Large pub so never any wait to get in. Food: good selection and average quality. Waitstaff always friendly.\n\nConsistent and reliable spot to grab a bite\/drink either before or after a show at RTH as it's right across the street.\n\n2 thumbs up for the VEGGIE BURGER: comes on a nice squishy bun with guiness bbq sauce and (gasp!) isn't over-cooked like a dry hockey puck.
