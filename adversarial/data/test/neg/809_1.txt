Wow....this place has changed a lot in the past 8 years.  No longer have the garlic mashed potatoes, use to get the Cobb salad and now it is half the size but more for the money, it seems the portions have gotten smaller and the prices of everything has gone up and the menu options have grown.  There is now pizza on the menu, it would take at least 20 mins to read the menu and that means you are going to be waiting another 20 more mins for an appetizer and then 20 mins for your meal. That is to long to wait for food and plus the time you had to wait for a table.
