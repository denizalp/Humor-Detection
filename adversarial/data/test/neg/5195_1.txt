An early Aug 2015 happy birthday with a steak & king crab dinner at Anthony's Steakhouse with an awesome 2010 cab from ZD wines followed by a surprise birthday dessert of grand marnier creme brulee & chocolate dipped strawberries. I ended my night overlooking the pool sipping on scotch and smoking a cigar with my handsome date. I'm excited to be going back again this year!
