Ate here on a Sunday and enjoyed it. Modern decor, very nice clean lines and an open view into the kitchen. Service was fast and attentive. \nThe menu online seems to be different than that in there, so don't look forward to the Carbonara di Mare. Madly as well the combination of low lighting and pale lettering makes the menu very very hard to read. Fine if you are familiar with a dish but for us non Italians it was nearly funny having to struggle with it. I'm all for atmosphere but not at the loss of practicality.\nWe had cured fish and Nodini, pasta with trout and the Brocolie E Salsicca pizza. All were nice but no stand outs, I'm not counting the Nodini as garlic knots would be hard not to be unreal.\nHighlight was definitely the deserts, the flourless chocolate cake and the Pizzelle, they pulled Buca from a wavering 3.5 up to a four. So good!
