For my first wine and canvas class Design and Dine made my experience great. I celebrated my birthday along with 2 other women and it was a lot of fun. The instructor was awesome and very easy to understand. I think everyone in my party were first timers and they all enjoyed themselves, many wanting to return for another session. The menu was very affordable with many options to choose from if you're a wine or beer drinker there's choices for you. They gave out \"Happy Birthday\" tiaras to us and had special dessert with a candle. Everyone sung Happy Birthday! I felt special and I'm sure so did the other ladies. Overall, it was an amazing experience and I would recommend this to anyone that wants to try it for their first time or doing a birthday event! I'm Picasso reincarnated;)
