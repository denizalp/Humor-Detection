What do you expect from a plant nursery? I know I want ample selection, good prices, quality products, and helpful staff--all of which I found at Pikes today. \n\nThe facility is organized very well. I really appreciate the direction you receive from something as simple as signage (i.e. sun perennials vs. shade perennials.) The selection is very good, and I really like that you can walk through every area of the store and know exactly what you are looking at such as roses, ground cover, shrubs and bushes, or herbs\/vegetables. \n\nThey have a limited selection of gardening tools such as shovels, rakes, etc. There are also some patio furniture selections through the store. What I loved was the succulent section. Beautifully done. They also carry a wide variety of seeds for starting your own plants. Their selection of fertilizer and soil was decent but not outstanding. \n\nI was really impressed by all of the fountains and garden accessories that you can find there such as bird baths and glass ornaments. It's the punches of color and ornate details that really help these items stand out. Great selection. \n\nOverall, the prices are a little bit higher than your big box store (especially considering they use Monrovia like others.) I would say this nursery is very nice, but I'm not sure that I would give up the convenience of my home improvement stores. \n\nI will be back here, though. I enjoyed the variety and ease of shopping so much!
