The best Packers bar in town! Every touchdown they have the toy train go around the whole restaurant! Such a fun place and great food. I've been going here since I was little around 11 years old. Any day during the week is a good idea to go. All the staff is friendly never met a moody server. Almost tried everything on the menu and love it all. Only thing that is not fantastic is the parking which they can't do anything about so Oh well I've managed every time.
