Pretty underwhelming experience. I'm picky about steak because I cook a killer steak on my $89 propane grill at home. I was impressed by the meat selection, but the cut I got just wasn't good. It was a thinly-cut Kansas City Strip (bone-in). I love bone-in steaks because the meat close to the bone is great and very flavorful. Ordered medium-rare. It came out barely medium, pretty much well at the edges and MAYBE medium by the bone. I asked the server what he thought and he started writing something down without answering me. He acted like he didn't wanna offer me a new one, and since I was with a group of people who had to get to a show, I chose to just eat it. Pretty much just your average char-grilled outback-style strip steak. Except it was almost $50. Not gonna give them any more money, that's for sure. That server should've looked at my steak and immediately said, yeah, it's not quite right, let's get you another one. The sauces\/complements were very good, and the New York boneless cut that my buddy ordered was fine. Nothing special here. Plenty of better options on the strip.
