Great service! Loved the bedding and pillows. Super comfy! Downtown near a lot of things to do! The only reason I give this hotel a 4 is due to the lighting. For the ladies who like to do their make up when getting ready the lighting is dreadful. It's the cheap orange bulb lighting, not the best for primping. My fianc√© agreed when he was shaving. Also our room faced a office building and I'm pretty sure if the curtains were open they could see right in the room. So privacy was hard to get.
