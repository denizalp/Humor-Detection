it's a busy clinic but the receptionist runs things like she's working the pass at the newest restaurant hotspot on a Saturday night.    She took the time to chat with the younger kids to help put them at ease and at one point was struggling with communicating with an elderly woman with very limited English.  Not once did she show the slightest bit of frustration.   Once I was in to see the doctor everything was just as smooth.  She was warm, kind and matter of fact,  \n\nHopefully I won't have need to anytime soon but I would make the trek to this clinic in a heartbeat.   Hours are great and it seemed to me that they had specialty clinics in the same building but I'm not certain of that.
