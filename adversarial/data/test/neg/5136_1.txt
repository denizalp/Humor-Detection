Holy shit this place is amazing.\n\nI went here with a few of my cousins and one of their girlfriends and man, we ordered a ton of food. We must've ordered at least 10 different dishes and between the 4 of us, we tore it up.\n\nThis is a pretty classy modern spot so make sure you have enough money in the bank before you head on down here to grab an intimate dinner with your significant other or to get late night drinks.\n\nI don't know where to start. The food, drinks, atmosphere, service, everything was awesome. I can't rave enough about this place. I'd go to Montr√©al just to eat here again.\n\nThe food come out in smaller portions so don't go expecting to order one dish be be satisfied. They come out artfully crafted and it's plated with much care and consideration. I felt like a food judge at a fancy restaurant.\n\nFrom what I understand per my cousin who took us here, it gets really booked up so make sure you have reservations. And the night we went it was a random weekday night and it was already super crowded and it didn't let up even past closing time.\n\nService was great. The waiters and waitresses were super attentive and helpful with the menu and if they're not busy and if you're willing, they'll chat you up good.\n\nOnly thing is the location. It's in a strip mall so you wouldn't think of a place like this would be in this type of location, but it's there.\n\nBtw, please don't be that couple of girlfriends that just order wine and appetizer then sit there for hours on end bitching about men, work, etc. because the tables are close and we could hear everything.\n\nParking: Big lot\nPrice: 20+ per person\nWait: Make reservations
