This is my guilty pleasure! My first facial was a gift to $pa Mom. I've gone back every month to 6 weeks.The most relaxing and invigorating experience I've had. Andrea is knowledgeable and has taught me so much about how to care for my skin. Great facial and she sells great organic products to take care of my skin between visits. You won't be sorry!
