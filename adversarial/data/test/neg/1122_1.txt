Went here with a group of girls  while visiting. The bartender told me my card had been declined, which I thought was super weird. I ended up paying cash and when I made it back home I noticed that my bank account showed it had actually gone through. Pretty shady for the bartender to do that. Good thing I'd only bought one beer instead of a round. Not cool for them to try and make extra cash that way
