After hearing rave reviews about Zeera, I came here for lunch the other day with a friend to see what all the hype was about. The restaurant is at the back of the plaza on the right side and faces Liverpool Road.\n\nWe were a day early for the AYCE lunch buffet which, we learned, is available Thursdays and Fridays inclusively. Nevertheless, we mulled over the menu for a few moments and with some guidance from Baldeep, picked a few tasty sounding dishes.\n\nOur selection was:\n\nButter Chicken - $10.95\nMadras Chicken - $10.95\nPulau Rice - $3.95\n\nThe dishes at Zeera are prepared mild and you can have the heat modified to your liking, however, since my friend is not a great fan of overly spicy food, we left the dishes as they were.\n\nEverything was amazing. The rice was the best I've ever had in an Indian restaurant... or anywhere for that matter, and even after we'd devoured the chicken, I found myself pouring the lovely sauces onto my plate and sopping them up with my Naan! Absolutely delicious! Next time though, I'll go with my husband and we'll get a little more heat added! ;)\n\nThe customer service we received from Baldeep, who I believe is the owner - or co-owner, was fantastic. There's no doubt they take pride in the food they prepare and they certainly strive to ensure their customers have a wonderful dining experience.\n\nI'm definitely a fan of Zeera By The Bay and look forward to coming back soon to try more dishes!
