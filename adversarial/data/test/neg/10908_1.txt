I was craving some Church's and they didn't have a drive thru, so I went in and ordered some chicken. They handed me a plate full of hot sauce and ketchup. Whaaaaat????Where's the honey and butter for my corn and biscuit? You missed the mark...Chicken was awful and who puts hot sauce on their biscuit?
