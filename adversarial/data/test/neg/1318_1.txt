Kenzo is a 2-3.5 star depending on which location, the day, and really, just your luck. It's kind of inconsistent in my experience. My recent experience to this location, I got the Tonkatsu ramen (pork). The meat was super overcooked, very dry, and broth was overly salty. The portion size was standard and good and noodles were good as well but the dry meat and the salty broth really ruined the meal. I was in a rush to go back to work so I just ate it anyways. Had better experience at the one downtown.
