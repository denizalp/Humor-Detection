I went to The Shameful Tiki bar in Toronto a few weeks ago for my sister's birthday, and after our experience, we will not be returning. \n\nI have a terrible nut allergy and the menu has many items that contain almonds, but this is not indicated on the menu at all. When I mentioned to the server that I have an allergy and Bombay Sapphire Gin has almonds in it, she argued with me, and did not believe me until she looked it up for herself at the table! Throughout our time there, I was made to feel like a burden on the server, who also became impatient as I tried to find a drink that would be safe for me. \n\nWe also had a reservation at 8pm, which is the last slot of the night. It does indicate when you book, that the reservations last for 2 hours. This made sense as it was a small place, and then they would be able to pencil in another party afterwards. However, as we had the last reservation of the night, I did not think this would be a hard rule, as there were no reservations afterwards. We were notified at 10pm that our time was up and we needed to leave the table (of note, we only managed to get one drink in each, because of timing). When I asked why, as there were no other reservations, the server became very rude about it, saying, \"The fact is, it has been two hours.\" \n\nI agree that the atmosphere is interesting, but it is not worth the disrespect that comes from visiting this bar.
