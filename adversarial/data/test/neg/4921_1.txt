A step back in time to the days of Elvis and the Rat Pack in Vegas. Authentic family style Italian dining. Reasonably priced favorites, with all you can eat bread and wine! You can't go wrong. I have never had a bad meal here, never had bad service and never failed to have a great time! We stop a few times a year when in town. Make reservations early as they are extremely popular!
