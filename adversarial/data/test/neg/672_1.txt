Jewels Bakery - I was in awe the first time I went there. I kept asking, are those donuts gluten-free? Are these cookies gluten-free?  EVERYTHING IS!! :)  to a girl who needs to avoid gluten due to a thyroid condition - Jewel's is a dream!\n\nTheir cookies are great, they have a few to choose from. I've had their cupcakes (no one would ever know the difference!), brownies I've tried both the regular and salted caramel- yum! I've tried their donuts and while the texture isn't exactly like a gluten-filled donut, I'll take it!! It has great chocolate glaze on it. Their waffles are very golden and crispy and the syrup\/butter sauce that comes with them is what makes the dish. I get potatoes and eggs almost every time I go.y favorite things to get at Jewel's are the flax bread (have them slice a loaf and freeze it to keep - if it'll last that long!!) and the MAGIC BARS! Just get there early because the magic bars will sell out! They also sell GF cookie and bread mixes, as well as frozen items for a little cheaper. Cute little outside patio for nice days and my boyfriend loves the coffee and some breakfast items (he's not GF but still loves it here).\n\nBottom line is, if you are a human who enjoys good food from a cute, hip bakery, go to Jewel's! Service is fabulous, patient and always cheery & helpful!!
