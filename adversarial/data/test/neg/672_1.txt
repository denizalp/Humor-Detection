This place isn't as good as the spring mountain location, but it's a great lunch spot for me n my coworkers. The service is not too bad and it's fairly clean. The pho broth is tasty and better than anything else in the SE. Lemongrass n pho little Saigon across the street aren't as good. I think this place is more of a 3.5 stars, but I give them the benefit of the doubt.
