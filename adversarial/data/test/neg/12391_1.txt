For the most part this hotel is fine, I love the pool and the workout facility, my friend and I spent 7 hours just at the pool, however the one thing that we both have a huge problem with is the \"Starbucks\" here. For one, you can not use the Starbucks app here, and 2, they do a terrible job at making the drinks and food. This Starbucks is never busy, everytime I've been here, (multiple times a day) we were the only people. It's half Starbucks half gift shop. We got pizzas twice, both times they were clearly not made well. Our drinks were another thing, the first time we got two caramel fraps and they were not blended well, there were still chunks of ice, the second time they were over blended and there was way too much coffee. It was the consistency of juice and the whipped cream was EXPIRED. The staff at the Starbucks are not friendly at all, which is unheard of in my experience with actual Starbucks's. I've been to some where there are long lines of people and everyone is rushed, they're still friendly and they make your drinks perfectly, this however, is not one of those places.
