Went to get a wash and cut based on a friend's recommendation and this is going to be my new go to place from now on! My friend recommended me to get a cut from Yoki and she is amazing! I had really damaged hair going in and really needed some tlc. I am always very hesitant to cut my hair because I feel like none of the hair stylist really understand what I'm looking for. I usually just ask for trim and long layers and it always ends up being too thin and shorter than what I expected. \n\nYoki really understood what kind of haircut and look I was going for. She took time to make sure all my dead ends were trimmed and styled it so that I can easily curl my hair. She also has amazing customer service and helped me gather my belongings before I left which was unexpected from the stylist. She charges about $50 with tax for a cut and to me it's worth every penny!
