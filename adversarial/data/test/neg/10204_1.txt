Came in because my daytime running light wasn't turning on. No one was at the desk to help when we walked in. When we finally did talk to someone, he tried selling us the wrong bulb! We needed a a small, spherical bulb for a Jetta... the bulb he gave us was a medium sized rectangular one? When my boyfriend called him out he said that it was \"the light that came up in the system\" or some bs. We unscrewed the one in my car that wasn't turning on and showed him and he said it wasn't blown out. When we asked if we could get someone to come look at the problem he said, \"uhh that'll cost $50-$100 and no one will be able to see you today.\" The store doesn't close for a few hours and it's also deserted? but it's okay we're going to go to the local shop that's open tomorrow and doesn't charge people just to LOOK at the problem, just charges people to SOLVE the problem... as it should be smh
