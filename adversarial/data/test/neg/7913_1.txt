Cute bright clean place with tons of things for little ones to do. Slide, jump on trampolines, hang glide, hop, ride on cars, play with toys, etc. Can easily spend several hours here. They have nice employees walking around checking on kids. Parents can relax and zone out on the massage chairs while their kids get lost in the playground. Lol. There's a beverage station and some snacks for sale (no real food stand). This place can get crazy crowded on the weekends and during the summer. $10 for our little guy to play all day if he wants. Can't beat that. \n\nWe made a YouTube video: \nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/QNVNx86FwuU\n\nHave fun! Cheers!
