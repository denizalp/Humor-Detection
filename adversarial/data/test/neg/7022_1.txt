Food is good like always.\nBut the staff needs training in customer service.\nOrdered food. Ribs were a 20 min wait. So we said just bring out the food and bring us the ribs when they are done....... instead we ended up waiting the entire 20 mins. With a 3year old and a prego wife I wasn't to happy. \n6:45 rolls around and they are closing.... started turning customers away. Several customers...... money lost because all the staff wanted to leave at 7pm..... smh. Saw some pissed off faces walk out... Educate your staff on food service.
