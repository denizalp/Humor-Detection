My husband and I live in Henderson and come to BC at least twice a month. We ate at the Little City Grille and were very pleased with our meals. I had The \"LA\" wrap with macaroni and cheese. I consider myself a Mac n Cheese connoisseur and have tasted several at high dollar places on the strip and preferred the Mac I had here! The curly fries were homemade, were seasoned perfectly and had the right texture. My husband had the Bacon Cheeseburger; meat was moist, bacon was fresh and crisp...bun was complimentary. Try it out, you will not be disappointed!
