Me and my wife have always been a fan of Saje. When you enter the store you get so much of positive vibe. Last year in Edmonton we had bought one Nebulizer to gift one of our family friends on their wedding anniversary. They really loved it. So even we wanted to buy one, but we were planning to move to Ontario, so we waited.\nGuess what we did first when we relocated to Brampton, yes we bought aromaOm Ultrasonic Nebulizer for our bedroom. We just love it, it is not just an aroma oil diffuser, it also reduces dust and other common allergens while creating a pleasing atmosphere. Best part is it comes with life time warranty. \nI am very impressed with this Brand!
