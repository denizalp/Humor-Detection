I've been a professional trumpet player for almost 20 years.  I'm so glad to have Mike in Las Vegas and will surely be using him for all of my repair and maintenance needs.  Even though the name says \"trumpets\" I know he's also top notch at woodwinds and pretty much everything else.  He is committed to his work and his beard.  You won't be disappointed!
