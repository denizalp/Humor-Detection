I recently filed bankruptcy and received a letter that they could finance me!. In fact I think they was the first out of like 75 I received. I called them and they said come out. What a joke. The first day I went we rode a golf cart to the back where all the dirty cars are and they kinda teased me showed me a really nice about a 2003 Camry with leather. I asked to drive it and I could only drive it down what looked like a residential neighborhood because he said the shop hadn't checked it out. They said they would work on the deal and they next day well they couldn't do it. They showed me a 2006 Civic that would be perfect, keep in mind 99k mile car, and the air condition was working but they would fix it, what a joke. Like $375 a month for 60 months and you can trade it in a year, yea right. Thank God I didn't buy here, Please shop around when you receive these letters. Try Camel back Ford they was the best and I wasn't treated like I have bad credit. The sales man was pretty cute in the Fast Loans Department but other than that what  a joke.
