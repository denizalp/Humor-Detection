Was greeted by the server right when we came in. Though it wasn't a busy restaurant, the vibe was real nice. Lots of little knick knacks to look at. Thier food was good, big enough of a portion for me to get full. Everytime a customer would walk in the waitress would always be there to say good morning and make her customers feel right at home. Though I forgot to take pictures of my food (the fried mushrooms was real good), I would come back again.
