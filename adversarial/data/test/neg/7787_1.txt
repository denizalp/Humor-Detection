Why all the hate in reviews?  There were 8 people ahead of me when I arrived and yet I was still out in 15 minutes.  I found the postal employees to be polite and efficient - and certainly more so than at other locations.  Plus, this post office is tidy, up to date, and offers a substantial selection of mailing supplies.  \n\nTo all of the disgruntled customers out there, pease consider the following approach.\n\nBe realistic.  Email is faster than ground mail, right?  Well, so too are their delivery systems.  The Post Office is not the Internet!  The Internet is instantaneous, personally customized, and responsive to millions simultaneously.  Real people, however, function at a human pace and deal with people one at a time - including you.  \n\nBe sensible.  Would you charge a bathroom stall at the same time as someone else?  Plan to avoid peak times, such as the days leading up to x-mas, valentine's, or tax day. \n\nBe patient.  The PO serves all people, ranging in age, education, and financial means.  All are equally entitled to receiving accurate information and a purchase which they understand.  \n\nAttitude. You get what you bring.  Rudeness?  Consider your stride. \n\nGood luck!
