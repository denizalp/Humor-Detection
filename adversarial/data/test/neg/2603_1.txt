Sierra our server was wonderful always smiling really outgoing friendly always walking by asking if we are good even though it's super busy. We came to our friends birthday to celebrate.  The server Cindy in their section was really rude and terrible customer service.  We been here before and always had outgoing fun servers and bartenders but this other server treated the group really rude.  I'm giving a 3 star because our server was wonderful but lost the others because of the ones terrible attitude.  Place was fun with great music as always, and is clean.
