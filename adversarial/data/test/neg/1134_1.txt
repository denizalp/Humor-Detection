The Rio nickels and dimes you for everything. Bottled water 4.00, seafood buffer 50.00, 24 hour WiFi 14.00, domestic beer 6.00, etc. I would recommend staying elsewhere. There are other nice casino hotels that do not do this to their customers. The Palms for example has 15 buffet. One last note....Caesars properties only have Pepsi products!
