Horrible experience. I was craving something and it just ruined my night when I did not get it. \n\nOrdered rolls with the rest of our dinner. Our food arrived, but no rolls. Waited for 20 mins to ask about them and was told \"Sorry, I forgot to order them\"... fine... mistakes happen. Was told they would be right out. 15 mins later, we asked again if they were ready. Was then told \"Sorry, they were not ordered\". The waitress then offered to order them now and get them to go for us. What kind of solution is that? I don't know about you, but I like to eat all of my dinner at once. \n\nWill never be going back.
