This place is beautiful, and great for groups. I love the patio outside, especially for happy hour. Their happy hour isn't that extensive IMO, but the selection suffices when you're meeting up with friends. \n\nI also love that they have live music here. The atmosphere is nice for couples, friends or groups. The only thing is that I have only been here for happy hour - I'm dying to try an actual meal!
