I have only been here once, but this is the start of a long and happy relationship. I had the chicken pot pie, I wanted to start with the staple. It was awesome. I only wish it were bigger so I could eat more of it. \n\nAlso had the mac and cheese and it had that consistency of being made with REAL cheese. Not that cheese product nonsense you get everywhere else. If was delicious.\n\nMom also gave me a free sample of caramelized croissant, which was also delectable. OH, and the lemonade! I am picky about my lemonade, people always make it too sweet, but this fresh squeezed refreshment was a refreshing twist on that expectation. I can't wait to see what the peach tea is all about! And the shepherd's pie and some of the other sides... trying not to break my eat out once a week rule!
