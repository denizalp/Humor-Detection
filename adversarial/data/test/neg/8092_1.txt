While visiting some family in Mesa we had to come by and try liquid nitrogen frozen ice cream. I am fascinated with molecular gastronomy and I knew I had to try SubZero.\n\nThe steps were a little hard to understand. I was confused and overwhelmed by the choices and didn't know where to start. I ended up choosing Tropical Taste off of the menu board. \n\nThe ice cream starts out as a liquid base. Add flavor shots, add in fruit and other stuff. Then the liquid nitrogen.  Tropical Taste, coconut ice cream with the premium base, strawberries, pineapple and coconut, was great! The flavors were bold and had a perfect creamy texture.\n\nGreat first experience with molecular gastronomy. Can't wait to get more for my next experience.
