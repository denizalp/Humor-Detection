I've been to Vegas so many times and this trip we decided to see the hidden gems of the city that never sleeps and found this jewel! Being on a trip with kids you search for places like this which they van enjoy along side adults. \n\nMy kids, 7 and 14 LOVE this place! Pinball and a few arcade games from the past expose the new generations to these past treasures. Games like Spy Hunter and Donkey Kong live side by side here in this game capsule. Obviously they specialize in pinball games from the early part of our century to the newest ones and everything in between. It's something special to see your children enjoying and playing the same arcade games you once enjoyed at their age. The cool thing is the younger generation enjoys it. So much so we visited this place twice! Games range from 25 cents to 1.00, the majority however are 50 cents making $20 last longer than any Dave & Busters out there. \n\nSome of these games are vintage so being respectful to the machines is something they take very seriously. Respect the history and have fun!
