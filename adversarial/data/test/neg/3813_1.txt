Came here for beer. The actual building and patios are great, the beer selection is great, but there is one thing that really annoys me and cost them 2 stars from a would be perfect experience. More than half the drafts come in 11 oz glasses instead of pint glasses. I really despise sifter glasses unless I'm ordering a 7%+ beer or a special edition\/rare beer. Could've been 5 stars, but that one hangup really bothered me. Pint central? More like 11oz central.
