Solid gym....but the parking situation is an absolute nightmare.  The morons that run the garage block the entrance even when they are multiple spots open.  It's beyond frustrating when I go to the gym and can't workout because the garage is \"full.\"  If they could improve this - and also allow longtime members the ability to reduce their cost (why am I paying $40 and I constantly see offers for $20?) then I'd probably stay a member
