Yum yum in my tum tum at the April 2011 TUM! Fantastic initiative and beautiful venue (Evergreen Brickworks)! We summarized the 3 types of people who frequent TUM:\n1. Asians\n2. \"Hip\"\/hipster young folks\n3. Older, white \"artsy\" folks\n\nMy friend and I arrived at Broadview station just past 6pm to catch the every-30-minute-shuttle to Brickworks. We must have JUST missed it because we pretty much waited 29 minutes. Warning: this is a tiny shuttle bus, and we were the last two to be let on actually and were standing (rebelzzz). The bus ride itself was less than 5 minutes. ADVICE #1: Split a cab from Broadview station!\n\nTUM 101: $10 cover charge. $5 drinks (wine, beer, tequila). Vendor dishes at about $5 each. Lines EVERYWHERE - shuttle bus line, entrance line (we waited at least 20 minutes to get in), and vendor lines (35 minute wait for grilled cheese). Which brings me to... ADVICE #2: Grab a little bit to eat before you show up! Because you will be waiting in line after line and it'll take at least four different dishes to really fill up an empty stomach. That could literally take you all night.\n\nFood items:\n- Samosas: good deal for $5, you get 3 samosas, we tried one each of chicken, beef, and vegan. They look a little different from your average samosas - not as bulgy, but crunchier skin. They had no line and took care of your hunger momentarily.\n- Bacon\/Chorizo Sloppy Joe: $5. Not impressive. Flavour didn't scream out BACON or CHORIZO and was shadowed by the hot sauce.\n- Ontario Water Buffalo Empanada & Jalapeno Cornbread Grilled Cheese: $4 and $5, respectively. Worth the 35 minute wait. The buffalo was so tender and accompanied by a fantastic green (pasley?) dip. Cornbread grilled cheese was a fun blend of sweet and savoury. The soft familiar texture of the cornbread with warm cheese was definitely comforting.\n- Pork satay: three tiny skewers for $5 but infinitely delicious!\n- Lobster Rolls: $5 for two rolls. They were the busiest vendor all night, hands down. Luckily I had friends in this line because I would not have waited in this 1hr + lineup if left on my own. They get points the cute little buns soaked in butter, but the lobster mix was not impressive. Faint flavour, gets overpowered by the butter buns. Not worth the wait IMO.\n\nI needed to take stars off this review because it just doesn't seem right that a pre-ticketed event still has ridiculous line ups left-right-centre. How do asian night markets run so much more efficiently without a ticketing system and with less volunteers? Let's learn from the original food-stand peeps, please. The shuttle could also run a little more frequently  (let's learn from IKEA here). When I left the place at around 9:30pm, the poor folks were standing\/sitting in the chilling darkness waiting for a shuttle that was nowhere in sight. We split a cab to Broadview station which was about $10 - a considerably smarter option. \n\nInteresting experience, but considering input vs. return, I would not revisit for a while.
