Stopped by for some Indian style tea ($3.50) in the early evening hours. The place was completely empty and they were just getting setup for the evening service yet it took more than 30 minutes to prepare three cups of tea to go. Taste wise it was a major let down. To begin with it was made without sugar and we were expected to add it separately much like English tea. I've never seen this anywhere else as Indian tea is always sweet and you specifically have to ask for no sugar if you want is separately. Apart from that there was no ginger or cardamom so it had a very flat taste. A complete waste of time that I will not repeat.
