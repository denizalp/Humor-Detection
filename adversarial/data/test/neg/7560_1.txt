This certainly wasn't our first time at the Town Crier. It was a hot spot for us in the summer months for drinks on the patio with friends. Today though, we wanted lunch and a few great beers, so we swung by. 50+ beers on tap, all priced at around $6.95 works for us! Also, they do a good job accommodating 6-8 of us and our bartender\/server friends when we pop in between shifts.\n\nThe Crier is 2 levels, with bars on both. The atmosphere could not be cozier and warmer (it was absolutely freezing outside so this was our refuge). We headed upstairs as we normally do and ordered 2 pints. Bronwyn got a Palm, and I tried one of the newer Belgium beers (the name of which escapes me, it was an 8% unfiltered wheat beer).\n\nTo start, Bronwyn ordered the Belgian onion soup. It was possibly the best onion soup ever. Cheese sealed the bowl in copious amounts (warm and gooey) and the broth itself was fantastic, loaded with onion flavour and a salty finish. The soup also had the traditional onions and bread within it.\n\nFor entr√©es, I went with a 10 oz. rib eye steak (I was feeling blindly carnivorous, not adventurous) cooked to blue. The steak came served with seasonal vegetables and frites (which were quite delicious, very thin and tasty). While the steak was seasoned simply (salt and pepper only it seemed) and quite tasty, it was cooked much closer to rare as opposed to blue. However, I'm never surprised when this happens, and the steak was still good.\n\nBronwyn ordered the spatzele gratin, which is basically a German comfort food similar to mac & cheese. This too was excellent, sparing nothing when it came to the amount of onion and garlic within the dish. It was in the appetizer section, but the serving size was generous and she was completely stuffed with a few bites left.\n\nAll in all, a very successful lunch. Service was good as always, and (my favourite part) the bill was also modest as per usual. 62 dollars and change for our meal and 3 beers. \n\nThe Town Crier never fails to impress, we'll be back soon.
