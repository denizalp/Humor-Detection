If I could give these people a flat out ZERO, I would!  From the front office to behind the scenes in the back office, they are the WORST EVER! My Dr gave me a prescription for compression stockings & I waited 2 hrs just to give them my insurance info & to drop off my prescription.  They said that I had to be measured, so ok.  After finally getting in, I told the nurse that did the measurements that I would like 3 pairs, ONLY if it was approved by my insurance, because they were $80.00 per pair and if it was not covered under insurance, to only order 1 pair.  She assured me that they would get the approval before ordering anything. More than a month passed & I called several times & left messages for status.  You might as well send smoke signals, because their customer service is non-existent & they never get back to you. So I had to go into the office & wait an hour before anyone could answer a question on the status of my script.  What a waste of time! To make a long story short, after several attempts to get the ball rolling, they said that the insurance approved my order & when I went to pick up the order, they had the wrong stockings. When I finally picked up the correct stockings, there was no charge as anticipated. Again they confirmed that it was covered by insurance 100%.  Several months later in early Dec, I received my first bill for $278.64 & I called & left a voice mail (they never answer the phone) to find out what was going on. Today I received a bill from a collection agency & I am seeing furious red. I called twice today & left voice mails & decided to go into the office instead to lodge a complaint. Not only are they closed for News Years holiday, which is understandable but they are closed for inventory & will not re-open until 01\/05\/17.  Ya think that they would state that information in their voice mail message? They truly DO NOT care about their patients & I am surprised that they are still in business. I will make sure that I tell my cardiologist that I will never do business with them again!  I have no idea if this will ever be resolved, but dealing with these people is a total nightmare.  TAKE MY ADVISE, GO SOMEPLACE ELSE!
