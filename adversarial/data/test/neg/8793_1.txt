Me and my gf spent two nights in Montreal and we'd heard great things about Tapeo. It seemed fully booked, but with a back-up up our sleeves (Dinette Triple Crown diner if you must know), we went to Tapeo. They managed to squeeze us in! Good for us! Great tapas (My favorite was the salmon tartar), nice service and an all-around cool place worth your time and money.
