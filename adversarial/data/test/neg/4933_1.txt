I've been to many different Greek restaurants before, it's my favourite type of food, I was shocked at the price and quality of Mr.Greek in Pickering. The meal came to $32 and all we got was a Greek salad with one small piece of souvlaki, and 2 souvlaki pitas. The pitas had nothing to them, 2 pieces of tomatoes and a few onions, the souvlaki was so small a child would be hungry after eating it. My salad was dripping in dressing, to the point that I could not consume the bottom as every piece of lettuce was dripping with dressing. The souvlaki reminded me of Marc Angelos package meat, not authentic at all and I guarantee everything was pre cooked. The restaurant was bare no one was in there and I went at 1pm. It won't be long till this restaurant closes. I will stick to Jimmy the Greek, and Milos Greek in Pickering. So many regrets I have not going to one of those places today for lunch, I'm currently eating chips and dip as I left starving. Total rip off!!
