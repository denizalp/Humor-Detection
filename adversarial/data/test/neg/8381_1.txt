Wow, this is a big Antique store.  I don't know what took us so long to drive out to Chandler to check it out, but we were happy that we did.  We spent over 3 hrs in this place looking at all of the booths and items.  It's a well organized store with plenty of room to see all of the booths and great lighting so you can see what you're looking at.\n\nThere's a section where the small collectibles and jewelry are located.  The Better Half found a Silver bracelet and ring.  I spent most of the time looking at all of the collectible stuff.\n\nIf you're hungry, there's a Hot Dog restaurant inside the store, so you can have a quick bite.  Next time, I will give it a try.\n\nFor those of you who have to wait around for a spouse to do some shopping...there's plenty of comfortable chairs and sofas where you can wait.\n\nThey also have large, flat-bed carts for taking big items out to your car...very convenient.\n\nOverall, we were very impressed with this store.  We'll be back soon.\n\nReturn Factor - 98%
