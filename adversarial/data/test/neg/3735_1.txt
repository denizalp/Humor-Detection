Got a full car wash for 3499 and there was a white haze left on the outside of the car in certain parts I had to wipe down again and again to find the came out so I guess the wax dad to go to the machine doesn't really set right also vacuuming inside the car which is part of the service was done horribly they were still crumbs and everything that I wanted to avoid but they did not clean or vacuum correctly inside and there was still a some bit of dust on the console which they did not do right also my experience at fabulous Freddy's before was perfectly perfectly fine now I will never be going to fabs Freddys in Summerlin again so much money for such poor service!
