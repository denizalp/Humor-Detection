The Camp Transformation is beyond amazing and I'm so happy to have been able to come across this company. It's more of a family environment and this is my second time taking the 20lb challenge. AFF is great with pushing you harder, helping you reach your goals and for accountability. It's been years since I've been in a consistent workout plan with eating healthy and before the last 3 months I couldn't have got this start without my AFF! I love the workouts, the positivity, and staff. They make this everything
