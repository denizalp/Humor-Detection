Oh my god!  We finally were dragged here by good friends as part of a rotating\/touring breakfast club.  We always go someplace different for breakfast on the weekends.  Well this is their favorite place and we finally agreed to go.  I would be more than happy to only ever eat here for our breakfast club again!  The food was amazing and the atmosphere was great as well.\nWe walked in to a small restaurant with a great vibe, lots of laughter and great smells.  \nI looked at the menu and was torn between the Modern Scot, Rock the Casbah and the special.  I eventually decided on the special of the day.  It was a huevos candindita scrambler I beleive.  It was fantastic.  It was so light and fresh with scrambled eggs, cilantro, tomatoes and more.  My partner got the rock the casbah and he loved it.  He should have asked for more of the seasonings (which a friend got and suggested).  It smelled great. Our other friend got her standard Modern Scot.  I had a bite and it was fantastic.  It is the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had.  The bread is this soft fluffy yet toasted ciabatta type bread with amazing warm melted cheese and egg.  All meals came with their hash browns which are also amazing.  They are light, fluffy and not greasy at all.  I also had a bloody mary with no chaser and it was very good.  I'm very picky with my bloody marys and it was very good, not the best I've had (Titletown Brewery in Green Bay, WI by the way with Jacs in Madison as a runner up).  It had great spice with horseradish.  \nWe also got a side of gyro meat for the table to share.  I could have had a plate of this as my meal.  The seasonings were AMAZING and was so juicy and tender.\nMy partner and I actually aren't the biggest fans of breakfast, which I know.....is weird that we do this breakfast club.  But we would eat breakfast here everyday!
