This place is great!  My hair grows quick, so I need to go every other week or so.  I'm bad at making appointments, but they are always helpful when I call and are usually able to get me in for an appointment same day.  Morgan cuts my hair and does a fantastic job.  Everyone here is friendly and treat the customers right, from the owner to the person sweeping up hair, all very professional.  I have also had facials and massages here and would highly recommend both.  The only negative would be that there is sometimes a lack of parking, usually during lunch\/dinner hours, mostly due to douchebags flocking to The Bottleshop for shitty food.  More on that in another review.  Go to Elliven spa and enjoy yourself!
