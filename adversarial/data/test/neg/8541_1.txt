The wait staff was too busy. We didn't get the attention we needed. She was stopped we 3 times before she could get back to our table to get our dessert order.  We drove all the way up from Columbia for my daughter's birthday dinner and was slightly disappointed. The portions were smaller than I remember. The bathrooms were filthy and the display case for the cheesecakes was nasty. I was disappointed. It has been a year since our last visit and the trip was a total waste of drive time and money.
