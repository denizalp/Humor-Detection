Visiting from out of town, I came here for lunch today on the recommendation of the local Toronto happenings and entertainment paper (I can't remember its name, but if you live here, you will know what I mean). It's clear that this restaurant is just starting out. It was pretty empty for a Friday lunch, and the cook, who was a vegetarian, had never cooked a steak before. \n\nThat said, it was a really good meal. I had the escargot v-v as an appetizer: superb. I had the steak frites as my mains.  The vegetarian-cooked steak was extraordinary: perfectly cooked and delicious. The frites were not my style: I like a cripsy frite, and the Toronto style (not just here, but other places, too) appears to be more home-style: kinda limp, kinda greasy.  I had the macerated berries with chantilly cream for dessert: again, excellent, the berries were perfectly ripe and juicy and delicious.  \n\nI would definitely come here again: really good food.
