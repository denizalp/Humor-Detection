This is a cool little place to grab something quick and delicious.  You basically just build your own burrito.  The people are extra friendly, especially Tan (sp?) the manager.  \n\nThey have option #7 Vegan Panko Tofu which is so damn good!  Those Hawaiian BBQ chips went well with the burrito too! The veggies are pickled without an overwhelming taste of vinegar.  They may even have alcohol in the near future if you need to get your drink on!
