We came on a Saturday night for a birthday dinner and sat in a room. The ambience in the restaurant is nice and service was EXCELLENT. All the staff and waiters that served us were very friendly. They even gave the birthday boy a free rubber duck piggy bank! \n\nThe food is indeed on the more expensive side, however we felt that all the dishes tasted great. All the food items came out really fresh and hot. We were recommended to order this fried chicken stuffed with sticky rice ($35\/half) that was a chefs special for the night\/week, and it was amazing! Flavour was great and skin was so crispy. We ordered the regular Peking duck dish. We enjoyed it, but it's expensive ($88), and like most reviewers said, we too can not taste that wow factor. And if you need extra sauce\/condiment they charge you extra. \n\nOverall we enjoyed our dinner and will definitely come back to try other dishes.
