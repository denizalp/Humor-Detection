Here's my story:\nI purchased a car in Arizona from my parents, but I live in California. The car needed to be serviced and diagnosed. I called around and no one really seemed to fit my standards. Then I found Greg. He was more than helpful. There were so many stops in the road.. I couldn't find a guy to tow it for a reasonable price, and tow it without me present. Greg found me some one he knew to tow it without me there AND for a KILLER deal. \nI thought for sure I was going to have to drive out there, but Greg made it so i didn't have to! WHAT A LIFE SAVER. \n\nSo, he diagnosed the vehicle, a 2006 PT Cruiser, and it turned out that the transmission was toast. I didn't have the money to ship it to California, so I asked if he knew anyone who was looking to scrap one. He offered to buy it! I sold it to him, MAILED him the title and he went the extra mile and dropped off all of the belongings from the PT to my parents' house! \n\n\nIf you're looking for half-ass service don't go here. \n\nIf you're looking for a shop to use for a lifetime? Here's you place. Greg goes above and beyond expectations to really assist not only your car, but you as! \n\nI just met the guy, and I'd happily call him a friend.\nHe really bailed me out.\nI couldn't ask for a better person, let alone a mechanic!
