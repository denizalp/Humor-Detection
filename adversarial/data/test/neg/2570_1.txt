I'm a local here in Vegas and came down to the strip to entertain some friends and family . We decided to dine at Tom Urbans inside the  NYNY and we're immediately  greeted by a manager name Joe  and were seated at the bar . Our bartender Jeff greeted us with a big smile eventhough he was busy he took the time to go over some of their specialty cocktails my favorite was their version of the Moscow mule and my girlfriend had a peach cosmo . After few a few drinks we all got hungry and decided to dine at the patio . The patio is outdoor overlooking the strip with beautiful views  . Our waitress Miranda was hands down the sweetest and nicest waitress I've been served by she was attentive and always had our water filled and the food was amazing and came out quickly . The favorite dishes of the night were the truffle pizza , carnitas  nachos and the Cuban sandwich :) . Overall it was an amazing experience , highly recommend to anyone on the strip looking for great spot yo watch games over great food, drinks and service .
