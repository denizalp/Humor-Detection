I like this place a lot... It's not fancy, but it's delicious.  If you like a \"hole in the wall\" style restaurant that has unique flavors... this place is for you.  A bit of Mexico, a bit of China...  a LOT of flavor.  Also, their cookies are out of this world.\nTip: ask for a sample of anything you want to try.  They will happily accommodate you!
