I really liked *almost* everything about my most recent visit to Fancisco's!\n\nThe service was prompt, the food was prepared well, it was served up in record time, drinks were tasty... The one tiny complaint I have is that it was HOT inside the restaurant. Open up the front door and let some fresh air in, please! \n\nWe ordered the queso dip to go with our chips and salsa. I was surprised at the size of the dish it was served in - much smaller than I expected. But it was plenty for us and we didn't need more at all. It had a really great flavor.\n\nThe main dish... Oh it was so yummy! I ordered the Fajitas Francisco's. Chicken, steak and chorizo along with fajita veggies. They were served sizzling and steaming and looked amazing. The flavor was incredible! I was impressed with the quality and quantity of this dish, and I was able to take a large amount home with me for a second meal.
