I go here often as I love salads and soups.  But they often run out of key elements such as bread for the sandwich, or quinoa for a quinoa salad.  This happens so often I have lost track of the amount of times.  The staff is unapologetic about this.  \n\nToday they were out of ice tea and quinoa. I feel like once they changed from paradise bakery they lost their shine.
