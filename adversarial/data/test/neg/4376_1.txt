Tried this place out this afternoon and truly enjoyed it! I can't believe Belmont has something this modern, and it reminds me of Polished nail bar in Charlotte! Super clean areas, comfy massage chairs and free wine. Very happy with my mani\/pedi and gel polish. Walked right in and was seated within minutes. Staff is friendly, doesn't force you into awkward conversation, and makes you feel relaxed!
