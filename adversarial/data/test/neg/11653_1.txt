First off I ran into their sales person Mike in Prescott Valley where I live. He proclaimed that he could give me a good deal on some steaks, crab legs, and crab cakes with real crab. My wife was convinced so we pulled the trigger. Now first off I read the ingredients list on all of the boxes when I got home and surprise the crab cakes primary ingredient is Imitation crab, Strike 1, the steaks I bought have a ingredient list that was so long I got a headache from reading, strike 2, thirdly Mike claimed to give me the steaks for $4.00 each but when I opened the $30.00 box there were only 4 steaks which is $7.50 each. I do not like being lied to and will be hard pressed not to show up at their address next time I am in Phoenix and take $132.00 out of someone's rear end. I am a disabled vet on a fixed income and after reading the reviews here I know that my money is gone...
