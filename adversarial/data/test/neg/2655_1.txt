This will be one of two reviews.   I have a home warranty through AHS, late last night my husband noticed that our hot water heater was leaking.  At approximately 2 am I submitted a claim online.  Immediately I was assigned Advanced home services.   I looked on yelp.   After seeing the reviews I yelped.  Lol. In the morning I opened a chat window with my warranty company asking exactly what my coverage was for a hot water heater, the hot water heater and the install,  no code items.  I thought that was fair. My home and my hot water heater are 14 years old.  So some changes to code were going to happen.   At 7:30 am a CSR from Advanced called me and asked if they could send someone out at 12-3.  Yes!    Before the technician, Joe, arrived at my house he called to let me know he would be 15 min late. This was fine by me. Communication is everything.   He called when he arrived at my house.   Joe assessed the HWH and told me he would need to call his office and would have an answer for me in 20 min.   He did.  There were items I would need to pay for to bring my HWH upto code. He explained them to me. And honestly they are all listed on the Clark county website. Pics and all. If you are concerned at what work they are suggesting.   Some of the items I felt were inflated so we negotiated a bit. Also know that you can pull your own permit to save some money and Joe suggested this. You do have to be the owner of the property.  I'm happy with the price we agreed upon and Joe was very pleasant to deal with.   The HWH will be installed in less than 48 hours. Not a bad deal.  I would have had to pay probably 2\/3 more if I didn't have the warranty.   Also AHS\/warranty company called me after Joe left to go over the costs and why\/what wasn't covered.   AHS\/warranty company sent me texts updating me all day with the status of my claim.   Over all it was a decent experience.  Would I have liked to have just paid my deductible?  Yea but with a HWH 14 years old I can't complain.  I will post another review when the work is complete.
