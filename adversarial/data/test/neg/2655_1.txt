Currently have been waiting 17 minutes for my order. It's not too busy but they don't seem to care about customers inside the restaurant. They only care about drive thru and pick up orders. About 5-6 cars have came and went through the drive thru and it is currently empty. Every time a car pulls up they order and get their food ASAP. This service is a joke.
