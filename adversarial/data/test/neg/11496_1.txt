Hubby and I joined not too long ago, and we love this place. I have to agree it is by far the cleanest gym I've seen in town, and nothing against Champaign PF(bigger), but the Urbana staff are amazingly friendly and helpful...and sincerely so. If you haven't tried a PF, or are a total gym noob, this is the place for you. Seriously. No judgement and nothing but support and friendliness, even from fellow clients of ALL fitness levels...it's not like any other gym I've been to. I even ran into my favorite cook who used to make me zillion-calorie breakfasts at a local place, and HE's working out here, too....we had a good laugh...it's a sign! Take my money, please :-)
