Called on a Friday morning and he told me he was booked but could do it Monday morning. Showed up promptly. I was not at home but was able to speak with him as the repair went on. He communicated in a clear and precise fashion and was accurate on all of his estimates. He was very informative and more importantly my problem has been fixed perfectly.
