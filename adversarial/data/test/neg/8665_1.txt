This is one of my favourite grocery stores, although I'm generally there in the evening hours. It's almost never crowded and offer a really good selection of produce. They also sell some of the limited edition products made by companies including seasonal items (e.g. Birthday cake froot loops, pumpkin spice shredders and the like).\n\nThis is a snacker's paradise. They offer a variety of ready to eat items, sell 'buck a cup' coffee and $0.89 bags of freshly popped pop corn. They sell snack size portions of butter tarts, donuts, two-bite brownies, and cinnamon buns. Hard to resist!\n\nThey do occasionally run out of items and the staff can be very hard to find or the cashiers just look bored. But usually it's easy to get what you need and get out quickly.
