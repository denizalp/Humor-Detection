I come in every few weeks to get my hair colored here. Erin is so friendly and sociable and I've been going to her for a year now. It's easy to schedule an appointment with her and I can usually get in if I call a couple days before my appointment. If you're in desperate need to get in and don't care who does your hair they can usually get you in within half an hour. My hair always turns out so vibrant and beautiful every time I get it done here. My hair has never held the color on my roots too well but after a few weeks and about 10 washes later the bottom of my hair has still held the color so well and it's still bright. This place is a little more expensive but it's well worth your money. You won't regret it!
