Very disappointed in this Olive Garden.  Maybe the sit down part of the restaurant is better, but the to go section was not.  I got the lasagna, and it was very good, if kind of a tiny portion.  The baked bread was good.  But the salad, boy that sucked.  It must have been pre-packaged days before.  Wilted lettuce, ugly tomatoes,  and generally disappointing.  I asked for blue cheese salad dressing and all I got was a tiny thing of Italian dressing.  If you get the to go, choose the soup!
