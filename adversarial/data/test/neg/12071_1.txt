Tried UPS Store to ship some items. I needed items boxed up and shipped.  Items needed to be delivered to Florida and held at the UPS store there for pick up by a certain date.  I was told that I would have to call the other store and make sure it was ok to do that. I was also told that the packages would not arrive until 2 days later that I needed them to be there. Clerk did not give any options like 2 day shipping or overnight.  I felt like it was a great inconvenience to the clerk.  Another shipping store in town helped me with out question.  Not going to UPS again.
