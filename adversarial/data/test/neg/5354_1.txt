In the times I've eaten at The Cheesecake Factory, the food has been excellent, the portions huge and the atmosphere beautiful.  The service was always very good as well, but the prices are a little high.\n\nWhen you see your food being ushered to your table by a team of servers, there is this feeling of anticipation.  I've always had excellent service and the servers are always very presentable.  I've had salads that stand 8\" off my plate!  The potpie is enough for three people!\n\nOh, I guess I should mention the cheesecake!  It's the best cheesecake I've ever had.  My favorite cheesecake is the Godiva Chocolate - if you're a chocolate lover, this is a super rich, delicious finish to a great meal.  Oh, and one slice of cheesecake is enough for two people, just ask for another fork or spoon.\n\nFavorite menu items: Tex Mex Egg Rolls, mixed drinks & Godiva cheesecake.\n\nOnly drawback is the price, but the location is nice because you can conveniently shop before or after your meal.  I love Crate & Barrel next door!\n\nThey offer a full bar at the three locations I've eaten at, including Westlake, OH, Lyndhurst, OH, Easton, OH.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.thecheesecakefactory.com\/
