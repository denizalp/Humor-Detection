Absolutely awful. I submitted a diminishment of value claim to progressive, since their client was at fault and damaged my car. The resale value will be reduced as a result of the accident. \n\nThey said the information I sent to them for my claim was insufficient, but refuse to tell me the information that they need. They said it is \"up to me,\" but whatever I send to them is deemed insufficient. So clearly it's not up to me, and they know what they would need, but they are intentionally obscuring the process to make it hard to get compensated for what I am owed. Very shady and unethical. I would never get insurance with them!
