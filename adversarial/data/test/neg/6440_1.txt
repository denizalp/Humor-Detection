I called in and spoke with Richard Bertanza. I informed him that I was looking to buy a car that same day. I had everything set. Just wanted to work out the numbers. At first he was very easy to talk to but then things turned sour. I asked him about the numbers and knew what I was talking about . Given I have a background with auto finance and the dealerships. Rich began to cut me off and told me that I did not know anything about his store and that I would be greeted with kindness but possibly a higher price. Yeah, well rich did not live up to \"kindness\" I felt a negative vibe from him and tried to inform him about my background because I felt he was belittling me. When I was trying to inform him he just said \"all you have to do is say thank you and go about your day\". What would I thank you for! For being rude? Cutting me off when I was talking? Giving me a price I was not satisfied with? No. I ended up taking my business elsewhere and bought TWO cars not ONE but TWO that same day. And I am planning for my third in October. Maybe if Rich had treated me with respect and didn't demand a thank you from me then we could've had deal that day. Always treat your customers with respect . You never know who they are.
