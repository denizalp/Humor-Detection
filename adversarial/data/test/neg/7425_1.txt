Always have enjoyed eating at Chili's but this location was not up to par. Ordered pick up for the margarita grilled chicken and when I returned to my office to eat it was surprised to find only 1\/2 the regular portion in the box. -3 stars for value in my book. Will not be ordering pick up from here again.
