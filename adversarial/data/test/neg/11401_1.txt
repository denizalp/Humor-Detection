First of all, to save you some time reading this whole review let me lay it out up front:  I don't think I would ever eat here again.  The reason?  The food is just plain bad.  \n\nMy friends and I came here to eat on a Friday night and we were excited to eat here as it seemed like it would be a nice place and I had read the lone other review here on yelp which raves about this place (edit: which is now strangely missing) .  The first tell tale sign that something was amiss is that there were only two other tables occupied (on a Friday night at 7pm!).  The service was passable but the food was terrible.  We could not believe the price of this place for how bad the food was. Unless they do something serious to improve, I can't imagine this place will be around for much longer because I can't imagine anyone coming back to eat here and I have to guess that that's why it was so dead.
