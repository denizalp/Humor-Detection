This tiny treasure in the heart of Beechview has some of the best tacos and burritos I have ever tasted. Luckily, the night my roommates and I ventured out here, curried goat was the special. And boy was it special! If you are ever in the area, even if you're not, you should definitely go out of your way to check this place out. Food was VERY fresh and the service was super friendly. A must have, for sure.
