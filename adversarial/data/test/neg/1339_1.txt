Took the opportunity on this past perfect May weekend to use my Fox gift certificate and find a table outside. Bring on the O&I. \n\nWith a nod to the other yelpers, I was cautiously optimistic about the Scottsdale vibe [you know, are your boobs\/car\/jewelry big enough] enough to go with the Lovely. It was early and we had a reservation in which I had requested the patio. We drove up and although a bit put off by the $6 valet - um, really? used it nonetheless. \n\nSeated right as we walked in, on the patio. Lovely night, perfect setting. Except for the choice of music - it seemed weird. I'm sorry, 'Play that Funky Music'?? With your filet and tempranillo? Not so much. Service was spot on, and actually a bit too 'on' I don't think its great to clear my plate when my dinner mate is still eating...just sayin'. \n\nAs others have noted, pesto and bread to die for. i tried the prosciutto and fig bruschetta which was yummy [not as good as Postino...] and Jeff had the margherita flatbread. Really fresh and light. He had the tenderloin, I had the tuna. Both scrumptious, lightly sauced and cooked to perfection. Dessert was a shared nutella pudding. Lovely unctuous pudding and whipped cream topped with roasted hazelnuts. Music to my tastebuds. Lovely texture and flavor. Wonderful coffee as well. \n\nNice wine list, very good cocktails and an atmosphere at least outdoors that was fab. Did i sound whiney? Dont mind me. Go, it'll be well worth it.
