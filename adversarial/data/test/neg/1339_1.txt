It's really busy - but they move fast, in fact sometime too fast that they forget people are here and should be served.  They're moving people in and out like an assembly line, forgetting that they're here because of the people. A few friendly staff and a few not so friendly, it could be they're just too busy and focused on clearing out and ready for the next.
