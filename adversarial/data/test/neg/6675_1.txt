I stuffed myself like a pig, it was delectable. The staff were great for buffet staff. \n\nThere was the cutest little old Italian lady who was singing merrily as she swept the floor. She told me all about her childhood growing up in \"old country\" and it made my meal that much more enjoyable. \n\nThe buffet's quality is on point.\nThe staff attentive. \nPricier than most buffets though I'd say worth it.
