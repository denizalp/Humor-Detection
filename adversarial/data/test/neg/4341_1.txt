Another Taiwanese eatery has arrived in Squirrel Hill, and just a short walk away from the original Rose Tea. AFAIK they are not associated together, but either the owner or one of the operators at Cafe 33 was previously at Rose Tea. So in that sense, it's pretty legit. Being new, the space is nicer and more spacious, but smaller like the size of Everyday Noodles. The menu has a lot of variety and is similar to Rose Tea's (as with pricing), but from what I could gather there is less emphasis on bubble teas and more on traditional Taiwanese appetizers. Didn't try any of the apps this time but the lady did recommend them for next time.\n\nThe beef noodle soup and pork belly over rice are two quintessential Taiwanese dishes. They were both solid in terms of presentation and quantity. The rice contained a tasty marinated egg, both diced pork and pork chunks, and pickled bamboo and cucumber. This was good, although I've had better--the pork could have been softer and less dry. Probably comparable to Rose Tea here. The beef noodle soup was another story. Everything from the savory broth to the soft and tender beef to the spongy noodles was perfect. Complementing all that was a smattering of chopped up and pickled vegetables. It was definitely authentic and probably one of the best around, being much more complex than that of Everyday Noodles but also better done than at Rose Tea. \n\nWill update this review after a few more chances to try other things here!
