This place has a variety of exotic drinks and chocolates but it is kinda pricey. I could have gotten better chocolates at that price elsewhere because theirs taste like Hershey's. The drinks are worth trying but it is not great. I love that they have a nice view from the second storey especially but they DO NOT offer free wi-fi. So, I can't study or do research while in there.
