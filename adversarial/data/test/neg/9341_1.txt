This is the best bridal shop you will find any where! My cousins and I flew from San Fransisco, Philadelphia and Reno Nv all to come to the grand opening of this bridal shop. We met with Helen who greeted us with a smile and was so friendly and professional she covered every question concern and even answered questions we hadn't thought of yet. She spoiled my cousin with doing her hair and also adding accessories to the dresses to give us better ideas of things we could do. She took all the measurements so we could order the dress when we were ready. No pressure just helpfulness! I loved it. Her assistant offered us coffee or water while we watched the bride-to-be show off the stunning dresses! I can't say enough about Helen and this bridal shop! If you want to have the perfect dress, you must go!!
