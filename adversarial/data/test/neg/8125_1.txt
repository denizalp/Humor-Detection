The wines here are fantastic!!! We ordered the flight or sampler and the servers were so helpful and informational when pouring. \n\nWe ordered dinner because we had a groupon and my fianc√© had the fish and chips which he said that it rivals the fish and chips he had in Ireland. My dish was okay, a little heavy on the dressing but we both would recommend this place. \n\nIt's a hidden gem!
