This is review for the mattress I bought 5 years ago over the phone after reading the website. Still love it 8 hours+  a day!  \n\nI bought a king bed with three layers on each side so we can mix and match both sides.  I have a Med, Firm, firm.  My S.O. has Med, Med, Firm.  You can easily assemble your mattress in about 5 mins.  put the pieces in the right order and then zip the mattress cover. voila!\n\nAs maintenance, once in a year, we unzip and flip the top layer over.  \n\nSince we were worried about the fire retardant mandated for mattresses, we were able to go with a chemical free path. The sleep ez mattress cover itself has wool woven into the middle and acts as the fire retardant.  \n\nShawn was a great help with choosing the original bed.  He even helped us buy the bed for the guest room last fall.    If you are on the border between two firmness levels, I recommend going with the firmer level.    One thing to watch out for.  Some bed frames have slats that are spaced more than 1\" apart. So you may l need a box spring, bunky boards, or plywood sheets cut to the right size under you mattress so it doesnt sag in between the slats.
