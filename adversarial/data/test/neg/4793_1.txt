We were planning for a weekend breakfast but found out that they are not open till 11 am for Lunch. The food was on the greasy side. The dosa's specially were too greasy. The Masala (bhaaji) for Dosa was almost mashed potatoes ! The upma was on the greasy side as well. Would have liked other south Indian specialties rather than biryani and chana masala for lunch. Idlis were good. Medu wadas were OK. The south Indian coffee was too weak and not worth the extra price. Sambhar was OK.
