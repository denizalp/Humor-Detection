Please note that all the negative reviews are for the previous business owner of \"Queens Nails\" and are not related to Mais Nails and Lash.\n\nI have been a client of Mai's for 3 years now and discovered her when she was working for the famous Longmi Lashes Beverly Hills franchise.  From the moment I met her, Mai exuded professionalism and a passion for what she loves doing: lashes.  I'm extremely particular when it comes to my lashes, and Mai is the only lash expert that nails it every time.  She listens to you and won't stop until  she gets it right.  There are so many eyelash extension technicians nowadays, and seems like most of them give you the same fake eyelash look. If that's the look you want, more power to you.  But for the rest of us who don't want to walk around with mega glam eye lashes, Mai knows exactly how to tailor your eyelashes to make you look fantastic without feeling overly done.  If you want the dramatic look, of course Mai does  that beautifully too.  Get your lashes done by Mai and you will be hooked.
