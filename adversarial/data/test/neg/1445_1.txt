As a previous reviewer wrote  \"Stuffed Bacon Wrapped Dates - 'nuff said!\"  \n\nThe food is great \nThe prices are right \nThe service is great\n\nWe had about 8 different dishes from the dates, chicken skewers, stuffed mushrooms, filet, empanadas and a couple others for $65.00 + tip.  \n\nEverything tasted and great and everything was little different with a unique taste.  Well, worth the $14 cab ride. \n\nWe will definitely return when in the neighborhood.
