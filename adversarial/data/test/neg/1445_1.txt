I tried this place out at first because of convenience - - It's located very near where I live. It definitely is my go to place for coffee. The workers are extremely helpful and sweet (they even remember my name :)). They have many options, including almond and soy milk for vegans\/people who are lactose intolerant. You can customize drinks and they have different ways of filtering coffee as well. There is plenty of space to sit, free WiFi and pretty outdoor seating. I definitely recommend it!
