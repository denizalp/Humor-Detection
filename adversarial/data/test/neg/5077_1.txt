First off..I want to say how impressed I am with Raul.\nHe's not only a great hair stylist, but a honest, kind, an loving person. I've been going to him since I moved to vegas in 2011. His knowledge and passion for hair is impressive and comforting. Finding a great hair stylist is hard, especially being blonde. Raul \"Dr. Blonde\", has earned that name. Every time I get my hair done I get so many compliments, my hair is healthy, vibrant and always the perfect color for my complexion. If your looking for the perfect color, cut, or hair treatment, Raul is the guy for you!
