My wife and I just dined here with good friends and I can say without reservation I would recommend Fat Ox to the many guests I come in contact with as a concierge. Jennifer and Isabel waited on us and we could not ask for more attentive service. The menu can be a little daunting and thankfully, Jennifer recommended courses that hit the mark in every instance. We began with a prosuitto and mushroom appetizer, followed up with rigatoni lamb verde, and finished with scallops accompanied by mushrooms and pancetta. As difficult as it was choosing from the many great looking course selections, choosing dessert was equally difficult. We settled on 3, the Tiramisu, Meyer Lemon Tart, and a special chocolate fudge concoction. Great look and feel to the dining area with an inviting patio. Will definitely return.
