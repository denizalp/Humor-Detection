Best place to get Laos food! In the back of their store you can sit down or do take out. My favorite dishes there is their Kao Piak (chicken noodle soup)-Kao Poun (chicken coconut curry soup)-beef Larb and Laos Style Papaya salad! Everyone there is friendly. So if your wanting good home cooked Laos food check this place out!!
