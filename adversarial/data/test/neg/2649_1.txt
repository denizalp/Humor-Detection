We have purchased many vehicles over the years; Mercedes, BMW's, Acuras, Toyotas and Hondas.  I have never had such a positive, pleasant and even dare I say, FUN, experience buying a car!!  Everyone we came in contact with during the course of the purchase was professional and it really seemed our satisfaction was their greatest concern.  My Beetle was delayed at the port so delivery took longer than they originally thought....BUT they gave me another vehicle to drive in the interim so it was no inconvenience to me.  My salesperson, Darnell, was such a breath of fresh air--no typical \"car salesman\" attitude, no hard sell and just a nice guy.  Brandon in the Finance Dept. was a total professional and worked with us to put together the final deal.  Seth, the sales manager, kept me apprised of the delivery status at all times.  I just can't say enough positive things about the whole experience.   This is not my first dealing with Keffer; I had 2 other VW's serviced there a few years ago and was always very happy with the Service Dept as well.\n\nThe icing on the cake is that I LOVE LOVE LOVE my new Beetle!!!  I am so happy  with the whole experience I could just pop!!  Thanks to all of you at Keffer VW!!!
