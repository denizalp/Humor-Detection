Great little record shop!!! I had gone to the one in Tempe twenty plus years ago and was sad when I  moved from Tempe and stinkweeds wasn't a short walk away anymore. Then I found out a few years ago they had moved to Phoenix and I was happy again! Just wish the store was a little bigger. They have a great staff and owner!!!! I never leave stinkweeds empty handed or disappointed.
