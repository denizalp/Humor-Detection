Josh is absolutely amazing at his job! My husband and I are new to the area and walked into a dozen mattress places. Josh made this location stand out through his excellent interpersonal skills and customer service. He made us feel welcome and we were given he's undivided attention as he helped us narrow down the perfect bed for our new home!! Thank you so much Josh!!
