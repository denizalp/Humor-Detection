I'm giving Chili's one star solely on the friendliness and attentiveness of my waitress, Jordan. When I first walked in I should have known it was gonna be awful. I wasn't seated and the hostess stood there the entire time. She pointed at tables and said pick one. We didn't get menus or one of those tablet things until about 20 minutes into sitting there and there was no line or wait. After paying for my replacement burger, that was equally as awful, Management didn't give us any discount for my second burger. My first burger came out raw, our Texas cheese fries were stale, you could tell they had been prepared and had been sitting under a lamp. They forgot the Mac and cheese for my wife. Which isn't a big deal, what makes it god awful was my replacement burger was extremely greasy where it made my bun soggy and it dripped like a broken faucet onto my plate. I couldn't eat all of it. I paid for a awful burger. Was comped for the first one at least, right? \nAwful. Disgusting. I don't even want to think about how this kitchen runs, and I've been in the food industry as a Chef for over 3 years. What a nightmare.
