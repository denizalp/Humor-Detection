Love love love this place! The atmosphere is extremely peaceful and authentic. The food is wonderful and the service is adequate. I've visited twice now and enjoyed it immensely both times. I'm so excited that I love this place as I'm pretty picky about food in general and I'm very pleased with everything I've eaten here so far. Definitely check it out!
