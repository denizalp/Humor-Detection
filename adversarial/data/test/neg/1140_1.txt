I absolutely love planet fitness but I can say I have been very disappointed since I have started going to planet fitness again the staff does not enforce the rules there are always people showing up in just a bra and pants or tank tops that are wide open, men groaning. The alarm never goes off even though it should. Worse part is people don't even have enough respect to wipe down the equipment. I have been very disappointed because I didn't feel this way about the Avondale location I hope things change because it really makes me want to sign up for another gym because at least it's expected. Planet fitness is suppose to make people feel comfort no matter what size or shape you are but it has made both my husband and I uncomfortable since staff don't enforce the rules.
