This restaurant came highly recommended, and did provide a competently prepared meal. I enjoyed the chicken parmigiana although the accompanying pasta proved only satisfactory.  I read promising reviews of the lasagna, but they were not serving it that night, which appears to occur regularly. The service was adequate, not exemplary, and I noted they abandoned my group when they were ready for us to leave.  The thirst was memorable. Overall an adequate restaurant, but not living up to the reputation I had heard. Fortunately the company was better, more pleasant, and more memorable than the meal.
