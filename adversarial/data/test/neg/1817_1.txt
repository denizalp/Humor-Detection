We had our wedding and reception at The University Club. The staff was exceptional in servicing our guests. The food was exquisite and all the guests were pleased with the quality and quantity. It is a beautiful urban venue in an historic home with beautiful manicured grounds. We highly recommend The University Club for your next event.
