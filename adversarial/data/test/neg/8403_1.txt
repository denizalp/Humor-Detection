Best sushi I have ever had in Toronto. Great service great food alongside with great people. \n\nExpect the meal to take two hours to complete as they prepare all the food in front of you. The place is really small I would say it fit less than 20 people each time. Make sure you book a month in advance.\n\nIt's a bit on the pricier side but it's definitely worth it!! The whole experience was amazing. ;) \n\nWill definitely visit again.
