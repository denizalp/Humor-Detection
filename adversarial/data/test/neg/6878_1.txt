Smaller than the other Best Western hotel I stayed at in Montreal. The kitchen\/restaurant is currently down so the breakfast I get everyday are apples, juice, and muffins in a baggie ... Compared to the other one, I had a real breakfast with eggs, ham, toast, etc. \nThe rooms are also a little tight and gym is soooo much smaller than Montreal's but the pool is bigger with a hot tub. \nService and front desk are friendly with a nice lobby & complimentary tea and coffee.
