One of my favorite places to eat in all of las vegas! The burgers and fries here are out of this world. Ask for a side of ranch, it's homemade and to die for! I'd drink it with a straw if I could....it's that good. My favorite burger on the menu would have to be the bacon Mac n cheese. I'd recommend it to anyone! \n\nFor dessert I'd recommend the Monte Cristo. Funnel cake \"bread\" filled with whipped cream, chocolate and marshmallow fluff. Topped off with powdered sugar and a side of raspberry sauce for dipping. It makes an already great meal even better.
