Quick recap: might be my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. Nothing short of amazing. Phenomenal steak, incredible sides, genuine and knowledgable  service. \n\nThe pork belly was amazing. Full of flavor and well cooked. The lamb appetizer was also incredible. The filet minion was perfectly cooked and full of flavor. It melted in my mouth. Absolutely the best steak I've had anywhere. \n\nWild mushrooms were full of favor and was enough to share. The same with the mashed potatoes. The fries were good but if I had to recommend a side, stuck with the mushrooms or mashed potatoes. \n\nGot an old fashioned and it was perfectly prepared. If I had any sort of complaint, it would be that this place is too small. I wish they could seat more people bc this place is popular and it's popular for a reason. Impeccable.
