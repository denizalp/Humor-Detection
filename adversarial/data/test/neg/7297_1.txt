We love it here! Great quiet neighborhood. We love the dog friendly backyards and the fact that the homes don't share a wall.  The office is quick to respond and always fixes anything we need usually by the next day.  We've had a good experience with management and feel they really take the extra step! If you want a nice new community to live in, this is the place.
