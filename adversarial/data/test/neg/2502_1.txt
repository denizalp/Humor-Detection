I love Cantina.  This is not straight-up mexican food, so if you are lloking for grease than dont go to this restaurant.  That said, the food her is great and the portions are huge.  If you go for lunch the prices are cheaper but the portions are just as large, so I recommend lunch.   Many of their dishes come in a small or large size, so you can pick how much food you want.  Lunch can be under $10, but with drinks dinner will cost $15.  I highly recommend the chicken tostada salad and the barbicoa pork.  Half price margs on Tuesdays!!
