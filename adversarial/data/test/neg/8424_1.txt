I feel completely taken advantage of in booking with FlightNetwork.  I thought I was booking through another source, come to find they charged me $57+ and I didn't even know I was booking with them.  I've been on hold for 30 mintues and no one picks up the phone.  I will never use this avenue, didn't try to this time. No service and feel as though they are very sneaky.  BUYER BEWARE!
