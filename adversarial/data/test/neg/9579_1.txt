Came in with my girl friend Janice on a Thursday. GREAT SERVICE. Served by Dominic, Daniel, and Libby! Been to many lounges; this one is top notch. From a hookah lounge you want a friendly environment with fast service and efficiency- this place is all about it. Super friendly staff from the moment we walked in (thanks to REYNA). This lounge because of the staff and overall vibe is the one to be at! LOVE IT!!! Recommend 15\/10 for locals and out of towners. EXCELLENT experience.
