Overall: chicken and waffles are overpriced, great southern food, a little dark inside\n\nI had seen some reviews and photos of this place so we decided to give it a shot. I saw chicken and waffles on the menu so we had to go for it! \n\nAmbiance: \nThe restaurant is VERY dark, which threw us off, especially for lunch. I understand that's the atmosphere at some places but this was a little too dark for our liking. \n\nPricing:\nThey specialize in southern cuisine, so we tried the biscuit plate as well as the chicken and waffles and watermelon (all one dish). The pricing here was a little off. There is a dish that is 2 pieces of fried chicken with a biscuit side for $15, and the chicken and waffles were $36 for only 2 tiny wings more of chicken. Unless you MUST have the waffles, I say go for the other dish because the chicken and waffles were just a little pricey for how much food it was. \n\nFlavors: \n The chicken was perfectly cooked. Crispy outside, moist on the inside, and lots of flavor. The biscuits were very flaky and moist, and it came with a soft honey butter (I LOVE soft butter). We did have to ask for more butter though because the size of butter they gave us was just not enough for 4 decent sized biscuits. The watermelon was nice as well but I'm not sure it was really needed, I would have a bite of chicken with a waffle but never with the watermelon. Plus the seasoning on the chicken kind of spread to the watermelon which wasn't my favorite thing either. The food was great overall though. I would recommend this place, just don't get the overpriced chicken and waffles!
