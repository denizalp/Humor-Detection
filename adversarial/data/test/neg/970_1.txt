I was in town to visit relatives last Saturday, and we wanted to find a great Mexican restaurant within a 4 mile radius. It is fun to do Yelp exploration in new cities. Sonora Mesquite Grill is the one that came up with the highest ratings. \n\nNow to the food.... incredible!!! I had the carne asada taco, and my relatives had the carne asada burro and a quesadilla. The 3 hot sauces were very diverse and flavorful - not cliche hot for the sake of hot. The mother of the owners, and the person who prepares and cooks all of the food, came over to talk to us. We were so glad she did. She is a health-conscious artisan meistro of the Sonoran kitchen.\n\nShe is originally from Nogales, and is true to the authentic Sonoran recipes. Incredibly, she hand makes all of the salsas, tortillas, chips, carne asada, etc... EVERY MORNING with only natural, non-preservative ingredients. Everything is fresh - daily, which is an incredible amount of work. And you can taste it in the quality of the food. You don't walk away feeling bloated. The quality of the ingredients is apparent in every bite. She is very proud of the quality and authenticity of her food. \n\nI was born and raised in Phoenix, so I should know a bit about Mexican food. My parents are going to be bringing their friends back to this jewel of a restaurant in a city filled with unsatisfying imitations.
