Went in for 30 cent wings. Everyone was friendly and sauce was good. However, server was not knowledgeable nor did he bother to explain the specials. I only found out that I had to order in certain increments (after I ordered a different number) when I heard the other waitress telling the table behind us. Once I got my food, more than I ordered, but hey it was a couple bucks, I was told that I couldn't have a box for what I couldn't eat!  Interesting concept when not at an all you can eat establishment. I will not be going back due to the disorganization and poor service of my waiter:(
