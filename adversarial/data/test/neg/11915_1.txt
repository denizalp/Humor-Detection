Enjoyed a nice Easter weekend brunch type lunch. Enjoyed their crepes and cup of cappuccino. Cappuccino was mediocre. Serving staff were good though not overly attentive. It looks like they were short staffed when we first came but they were better manned by the time we left around 1 o'clock. The restaurant was comfortably crowded!! Will be back.
