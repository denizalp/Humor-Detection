This is an interesting and unique place to eat. The employees tend to be polite. The music is always too loud.\n\nThe food is good. The pancakes are among the best I have ever had. However, customers eat with plastic knives and forks. The pancake syrup served is cheap-quality store-bought syrup. In a restaurant this expensive, it should include real silverware, and real maple.\n\nThere is a good variety of barbeque sauces available, but they are served room temperature. I would rather have fewer choices, but have them available in crock-pots kept warm. I have found the meats and sandwiches are typically good, but the side dishes are rather bland.
