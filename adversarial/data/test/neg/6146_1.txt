I've been here a countless amount of times. I had been wanting Pei Wei for about two weeks. Finally decided\nTo go and get lettuce wraps and one spring roll. Quick as always but wraps just didn't taste right. They had an \"aftertaste\" not a good one either. Spring roll was okay. Could taste the go ginger and the seaweed was too chewy. Very disappointed and am in no hurry to run back.
