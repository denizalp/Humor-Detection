I've always had a pleasant experience whenever I've visited The Bar. I live within walking distance so it's pretty convenient and the pricing is more than reasonable. My most recent experience with Hillary is what hospitality is all about. I've worked in the industry for 10 years and it really doesn't take much to create a pleasant environment for customers. Hillary is pleasant, conversational, positive, and does not overstay her welcome with her guests. Not to mention, she's on top of it and anticipates needs. My friend and I had a great experience overall, but Hillary is the cherry on top.
