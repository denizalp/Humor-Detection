I like the atmosphere here. Its as if you are on a small island\/ town and you are dining at a very warm Canadian restaurant. Kind of give you that family style feeling. Its nice and bright inside. So when you look out, you have a nice view of lots of green and you might even see the Bow river. You must make a reservation to dine here. They do get quite busy. \n\nSo came and ordered the smoked halibut eggs benedict for $19. My sister ordered the same thing. She loved it. For me, I loved it too. But I did find the halibut a bit too salty. The potatoes were really good. Best part was their in house ketchup which looked like tomatoe paste. Their ketchup was really good. \n\nOne thing here is that they charge for water. $1 per person for water and its really just normal water (nothing special).\n\nFood is definitely on the pricier side. Overall, it was good. The poached egg was cooked perfectly (which is the hardest part). \n\nOverall, I did like the food. If the halibut wasn't that salty it would be perfect for me. \nDefinitely a place that tourist should visit.
