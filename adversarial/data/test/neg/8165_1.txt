This place is incredible. Like seriously the best restaurant ever. The servers are amazing, down to earth, and not pretentious at all which I always worry about at higher end places. The food is divine and the restaurant decor is fun with the spices on the counter and the books on the shelves. There are also fun private rooms with curtains for bigger groups. It's tapas style so its fun to order a few things and share.  When we went they were doing a $29 dollar three item special so we did that for one person and then added a few things on. The prices for the portions and quality was fantastic. Here is what we got and I recommend ALL of it and more:-) We were stuffed so you could probably order a little less for two people. \n1. The salt and vinegar Brussel sprouts-These were amazing, they literally tasted like salt and vinegar chips and they were Brussel sprouts which is crazy. There are almonds as well. We got it without the chili pepper. The texture and taste was ridiculous, we have never had anything like it. These ain't your mother's Brussel sprouts. \n2. Greek salad-the best one I have ever had. Fresh big chunks of feta with herbs, slices of cucumbers, fresh tomato, great Kalamata olives, and a wonderful dressing. Tasted so fresh and clean, even better than the one I had on the beaches of Greece. I got it without onions.\n3. Lamb-The lamb was fantastic. I don't even eat or like lamb, I always think of the baby lambs in the manger scene and can't do it but this was worth it. It came with a wonderful couscous as well that complimented the flavor.\n4. Cucumber and dill dip-I LOVE dips like this and this was amazing. It was a greek yogurt base with fresh dill and cucumbers in it with fresh falafel bread served from the wood burning oven. I would order it without the pepper corns next time.\n5.  Chicken Skewer-The flavor and texture were wonderful. \n6. Fig Panna Cotta-this dessert was fabulous. Light but rich at the same time with wonderful fresh figs and almond clusters. \n7. Excellent french press coffee. They also have a green coffee.\n8. The Lotus flower cocktail is to die for. \n\nAll and All this is the best restaurant I have eaten at in a long time and maybe ever. Run Run Run to Cleo and get your walk like an Egyptian on.
