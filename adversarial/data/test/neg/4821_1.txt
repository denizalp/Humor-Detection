I love this place!  It's a diamond in the rough.    Everything I've ever ordered is good!  The prices and the wine are reasonable.  I come here at least 2 times a week with friends and always suggest it to everyone!\n\nMy favs to eat are\n\nBeef jerky \nRaw oysters\nDrunken noodle\nPad se eww\nThe glass noodles with seafood...forget what it's called\n\nAnd good red wine ...turley\n\nSometimes service is a little slow but the food is always delicious!
