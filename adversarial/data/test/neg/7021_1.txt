I have been to VIP nails 5-6 times, felt a little rushed, but they have done a good job. Went this past Saturday & had gel manicure which was sloppy & large gaps left unpolished at cuticle and sides. Tried to get tech to fix it, but he didn't & I felt intimidated. Went back today to ask them to fix nails since it was bothering me. I didn't want same guy to fix it. It got real weird. Another lady started fixing my nails when the previous man came out & attempted to approach the table. The lady yelled at him in their language and told him to leave. When asked if she was a manager, she replied \"no, he's my boyfriend\" Awkward!! Angry girlfriend fix it job ensued with a \"your done\" at the end to which I walked out quickly. Needless to say, I won't be returning
