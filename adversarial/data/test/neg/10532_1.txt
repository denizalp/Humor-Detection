Update: We just bought a XC90 for our son here. Kim the sales guy was great as always. While we were there we learned that the previous service person and the department manager had left the company. So we gave them another shot with fixing a loose headliner in our 2013 C70. The new service manager was very professional and took great care of the car. It's amazing what a difference good people make. We'll be taking our two Volvo's to Volvo of Tempe for service.
