I came here with a meetup group.  Most of us had never been, and our reviews were mixed.  I had the Mediterranean salad with shrimp (cold boiled shrimp which was fine with me).  Two friends had the fish of the day which they enjoyed.  Two ladies had the turkey hoagie with french fries.  One said her fries were cold.\n\nService was great.  I feel like it must be difficult to serve a table of ten ladies who all want separate checks.  Our waiter did so with no problem.  He was pleasant and courteous.\n\nI would like to return and maybe sit outside and enjoy a different meal with a smaller group.
