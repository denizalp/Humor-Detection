I've always wanted to do this and on the way to Tournament of Kings we decided to stop and pick out an oyster. I knew I wanted earrings and the first oyster I picked had a beautiful pinkish pearl inside. It's my favorite color of pearl and I was so excited. I picked again and got a greenish pearl. Jayne said I could choose one more time and hopefully I would get another pink one. I gave the tongs to my one year old and he kept tapping the same oyster over and over so we picked it. It was a gorgeous silver\/blue pearl, the most amazing pearl I'd ever seen! I gave up the green one for the silver\/blue and put it on a charm for my pandora bracelet. She then matched my pink pearl with a pearl they already had and made me a beautiful pair of earrings. My total was about $160 and worth every penny. I'll definitely be back and probably soon, as my birthday is this month. The experience of choosing your own oyster and the friendliness of the staff is worth it alone but they have beautiful settings and I have a ring in mind for my next purchase :)
