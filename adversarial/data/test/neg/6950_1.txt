Perfect for students hanging out or studying at the cafe with large group tables and smaller singular ones. We were placed in a corner table facing two walls with very minimal leg and table room which was disappointing. Also, the wifi was not working for us although we mentioned it to the staff 3x and all they told us was to restart our computers (although the wifi didn't even work on our phones either).\n\nWe ordered the affogatto which was mediocre and green tea bubble tea. Oddly they didn't have just regular iced tea (no milk) options. \n\nAs long as you don't mind the noise, I would come back for the study space as long as they fix their wifi, and possibly try their food options (although based of previous reviews, are not that appetizing).
