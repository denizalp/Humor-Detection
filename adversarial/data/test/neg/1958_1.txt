Really cute atmosphere and setting.  The place is small but nice.  Loved their brunch.  The lemon ricotta pancakes is to die for.  I also loved their cauliflower and shoe string fries.\n\nMy group was disappointed with the service as it was bit slow, but nice wait staff though.  I would still go back.  If the service was on time would have given it 5 stars.
