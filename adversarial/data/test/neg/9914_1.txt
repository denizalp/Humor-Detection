During the summer when I get home from a business trip the Southside Cheesecake Factory is one of the first places I think about going to. They are open until 12:30am Friday and Saturday and their dress code is casual, which is perfect after a day of flying. Their appetizers are well done and they have done a better job at improving their entrees. Their menu is filled with a plethora of options so it may take a couple of visits to find an entree you like, but as I said their appetizers, small plates and flat breads are really good.\n\nThis time I visited the restaurant on Saturday July 17 at 10:00pm. As I was driving past there was considerable foot traffic in area near the fountain so I thought there would be a wait. I parked the car and walked to the store. When i entered I was surprised to find no wait, my wife and I were seated promptly. \n\nWe ordered a cheese pizza (to share), fresh kale salads and the loaded baked potato bites. When ordering an appetizer here they are good about timing it so you have enough time to enjoy it before your entree arrives. For this trip because we ordered snack type items everything came at once. Everything was steaming hot, except the salads which has fresh kale, when it came to the table. \n\nWe enjoyed our meal and decided to order a hot fudge sundae for dessert. This however was not as tasty as our meal. The first problem was a 2:1 ratio of whipped cream to ice cream, more than half the bowl was whipped cream. The second problem was the small amount of ice cream in the bowl was almost like eating an iceberg. The ice cream must have been left out and started to melt before it was put away. After it was put away it refroze slowly causing the ice crystals (glaciers) to form. \n\nThe second problem with this visit was the waitress. Out of respect I only mention a waitor\/waitress name when they have provided top level service. Our waitress this evening was below average. In a visit that spanned 90 minutes she came to the table 4 times (1 to clean up a spill of the sugar caddy she knocked over, 2 to take our order, 3 take our dessert order and 4 to bring our check.) I guess you could say 5 times she came to the table because she brought my credit card and receipt back. She did not even validate the parking garage ticket, I had to have the hostess do it. This waitress was the worst I have had at the Southside Cheesecake Factory, the North Hills location is another story for another day.
