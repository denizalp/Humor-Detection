I went to Cinema as a new customer for the first time a few weeks ago. My perm was falling out, I hadn't had a cut in awhile and I described myself as the \"before\" girl in shampoo commercials. I just let Nicole do her thing, whatever she thought would make me look better. She gave me a fantastic cut that brought out my curls, taught me how to style my hair, and recommended a few awesome products. It has made ALL the difference! I look and feel like a rockstar again and as for my curls - I have people asking me all the time if I got it repermed!  Hehehe. She will definitely be my new go to girl. \n\nThe shop itself is fabulous - it smells great, the staff is friendly, and it has a calm, relaxing environment.  And the prices are very reasonable for the level of service you get. I would recommend Cinema to anyone.
