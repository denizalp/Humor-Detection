I've been very pleased with the quality of some of the sushi here and finally I can relax about the number I'll see on the bill when going out to eat. This has been a very fun omega 3 plan you can't get at home. \n\nThe service can vary though ...after a while of regular visits they were treating us well until recently when some of those employees left. Last visit we were left dealing with the turnover and owner who clearly possess little recall for a good  customer.  If the owner is managing the tables, plan on an unbelievably long wait for your bill and not even a friendly nod for a 50% tip.  Try to have cash in the exact amount as it took 15 minutes to get our change while the owner hung around the cash register doing what, I'd could never guess.
