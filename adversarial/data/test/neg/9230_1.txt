This place feels like home. The people are friendly, the food comes out fast and filling!\nThis is our 2nd visit - to a second location lol. Can't wait for their 3rd location to open - it's down the street from our house and we're super excited.\nMetro Diner has become our new favorite. The only downside - we wish they were open later. But we'll be ok - just keep serving delicious food!
