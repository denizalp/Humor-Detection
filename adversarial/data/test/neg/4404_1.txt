I recently had a 2004 Tundra completely repainted. Tom and his team gave me an estimate and needed me to leave it for a month to do it right. They took all the fenders, bumpers, mirrors, door handles, etc.. off. They gave me the option to save money by refurbishing some of the plastic parts myself. Their prep work was superb, fixing all of the minor dings. They used the best paint, PPG, and added 3 coats of the PPG clear coat. They sanded after the clear coats and the truck came out beautiful. They completed it in 3 weeks, for the original estimate, and I couldn't be happier with the result. I waited to write the review until I put the 1st wax coat on it personally. I knew I would be able to see any imperfections. There weren't any. It looks better than when I bought it new in 2003. Thanks Tom and your staff!! Highly recommend these guys!! Dan
