The cashiers give horrible service and are not fair with whoever gets to checkout lines first. I was waiting in line behind a customer that was paying and I was told by cashier (bald male) to get in the middle row... by the way there's no sign whatsoever pointing to correct line to wait. There were already two customers in that middle line, and instead of me getting in front of them I just said ok well I got here first, just so they would acknowledge I was in the wrong lane, ok big deal and to help me checkout first. Next thing you know I'm ignored. I just walked out. I'll be going to Town Square to have a better shopping experience.
