Great business!\nI couldn't have been more pleased with the guys at residential glass. ((724)771-3052\nI called  from my home in Atlanta and they went go my moms home in Pittsburgh, found a hidden key to home, gave me a great estimate and then returned 3 days later to replace the smoky  glass sliding doors. They were courteous, efficient and resonable. I only wish we had replaced the glass with Residential glass earlier. All for $400! Awesome. Lynn Lanier
