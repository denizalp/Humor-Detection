This has remained my favorite at the Strip because of its decor, activities , and convenience. The rooms are all suites.  There has not been a restaurant on the premise which has not met my expectation. The check-in process was the only drawback for this hotel since there were usually very long lines. This place is magical in the winter when the ice skating rink is in operation. The pool area is amazing with several options- we did not discover this until the last visit in June of this year even though we had stayed at this hotel on at least  5 occasions in the past.
