I don't know about you but when I go to a restaurant I expect my food to be prepared for me. Not the case here. My salad came out and it was FULL leaves of romaine. I had to cut them myself. What kind of crap is that?? Not to mention the salad had no flavor whatsoever. Also the pulled pork is undercooked. The waiter even told me that the food wasn't good! They also must not be happy with the absolutely disgusting attire they are forced to wear. Seriously come on. Wanted to leave for so long before they could bring the check. What a let down and waste of way too much money. I would've had a better experience at McDonald's. Mayor of flavortown my butt!!
