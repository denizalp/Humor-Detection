I've loved this place since first discovering almost 2 years ago. It is easily the most unique coffee shop I've seen in AZ. The outside patio is beautiful and the bathroom is so cool also. We moved over here right across the street from it and I'm so glad I'm able to stop there instead of Sbux every morning!
