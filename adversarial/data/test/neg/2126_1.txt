One of the most fun night we have had here in vegas! Went for a friends birthday and ended up only costing us $28 fr me and hubby to drink and get in (Thank you Facebook) Hubby had gottten the all you can drink ... and let me tell you he sure did! $20 all you can drink well drinks he was a happy camper! We had great seats and the comedian was hilarious. I love how he interacted with the audience !! I will definitley go back and maybe get a room this time so i dont have to be dd! :D
