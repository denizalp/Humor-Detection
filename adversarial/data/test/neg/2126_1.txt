This is our new FroYo spot! The flavors and yogurt are definitely much tastier and seem better quality than Uswirl.\nPlus outside on the patio they actually have music and your not stuck on Eastern inhaling smog! \nThe inside and patio are extremely clean also which is awesome considering how dirty a lot of the furniture and patio is at Uswirl.\nThey have he same rewards program also.
