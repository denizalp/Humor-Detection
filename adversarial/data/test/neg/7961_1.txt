In my Vegas experiences, Surrender has been the place where you expect to have a chill good time. Don't get me wrong, you spend as much here on drinks like you would any other club in Vegas. This place is huge but knowing there is XS right next door, it doesn't satisfy the young's craving for a wild night out in the 702. You can have fun at Surrender but I feel like I would rather spend the night at the neighboring Encore club XS. \n\nDrinks are the same price at XS. Your bottle service looks better at XS. Just go to the club next door, Surrender is Encore Beach Club during the day and it's your best bet to shell your skrills during the day. Skip the night party at Surrender.
