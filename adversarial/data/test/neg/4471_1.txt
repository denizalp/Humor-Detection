Its was blah. A basic typical mexican spot with basic cliche decorations. Waiter was horrible. Her vibe seemed faked and forced. Host was cute and nice. Food was decent. Not the best and not the worst. I came on sunday and the only reason i gave it three stars is because they had $1 mimosas. Say what lmaooo you know im tipsy writing this review lol
