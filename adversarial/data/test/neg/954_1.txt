Revisit today. Arrived at 11:40 on a Tuesday and two guys were dining. More came later. \n\nI ordered a Bento Box with Chicken Katsu, Kailua Pork and Pineapple Chicken. I added a can of soda for $9.47 plus tip. The Bento comes with rice and a side, so I chose macaroni salad this time. \n\nMy lunch arrived in about 6 mins. The Kailua Pork was hot to the point of steamy. The Chickens were good, each with its own dipping sauce. \n\nThere was plenty of food to fill up this big guy and I still couldn't finish it.  The chicken was virtually the same for both dishes, just different sauces. The pineapple sauce was so cold and sweet, it went ignored. \n\nStill the best Katsu around!
