I had been avoiding Winter\/Summerlicious for years as I find the restaurant's food and service to be absolutely terrible, and not an accurate reflection of actual capabilities when not operating in overdrive.  That being said, a friend suggested that we go, and I suggested Lamesa as I'd walked past a number of times and was curious to see how the food was!\n\nI will preface this by saying that I'd only ever had Filipino food a handful of times in my life - once it was a hearty stew, another time it was at a terrible restaurant in London, and then - Lamesa.  I have to say, I was really impressed!  The food was beautifully presented, the service was on point, and the food I ordered - the \"fish and chips\", the chicharrons, and the ube dessert, were all super amazing!  I would definitely return not for a Season-licious.
