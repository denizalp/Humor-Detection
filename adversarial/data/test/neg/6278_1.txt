I've wanted to come here for a long time after reading some reviews, and was very impressed! The place is really cute, and the drinks were delicious and affordable. Only downside is the hours - it's only open a few days a week and closes at 10pm. It would be the perfect mid-week place, but it's not open. I'm definitely coming back!
