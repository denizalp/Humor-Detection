Absolutely wonderful meal. The front is a little nondescript but once I found the place, I was given the option of a table or a kitchen counter seat. I definitely recommend sitting at the kitchen counter and enjoy the show. Watching the chefs delicately and simply prepare every dish adds another dimension to your meal.\nThere were so many options but I opted for the tasting menu which turned out to be more then enough food for 1.\nI sit here with an engorged belly remembering the tasty shrimp, slight spice to the carrots, the enormity of the paella, and the soft layers of potato and egg.\nEverything was fantastic and I washed it all down with spicy tequila and a white sangria.\nI will definitely be coming back.
