I've been through the motions of car buying a few times before. let's just say.. It's not what I would call typically a very pleasurable experience. My experience with David at BMW however, was stress and pressure free. He accommodated even after I drove off the lot in my beautiful new Mercedes-Benz. He followed up through email and phone calls to ensure my satisfaction with my purchase. I highly recommend this dealership if your looking for an easy and stress free car buying experience.
