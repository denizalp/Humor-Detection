This place had super friendly staff, delicious food, the best vegan brownie I have ever had, and sitting out on the patio with the misters on a summer night just made the experience a fun night to remember. I definitely recommend both dishes my husband and I had, the cauliflower tacos and the beet burger. The only downside, I don't live in AZ so now I will be craving this when I return to Vegas.
