Awesome. \nDifferent atmosphere from Hollywood one and better portion in each dish which is a huge plus. Gotta try their desert too! I had some sort of toffee pudding and it was divine. Wine selection is not impressive but we got decent Chardonnays. \nEnough lighting and noise to enjoy conversation and dinner at the same time. \nIf you are seeking tapas in Vegas, try here!
