Decent food, a bit loud unless you are drinking at the bar, then you're the loud one....  A bit over priced.  The spaghetti portion was pretty big, but less and cheaper would have been better.\n\nI went for a burger and it was average - I had heard the place was owned by the same folks that own The Dive-In...  So obviously I had high expectations for the burger.  Everything is great at the dive in... But it is a greasy diner burger and the maxwell's burger is a tavern burger- so I know hard to compare, but the maxwell's burger tasted like any other run of the mill tavern burger.\n\nI should point out my family loves maxwell's...  I guess I just have higher standards :)
