Stopped in after seeing two reviews for a barbershop in Fairlawn where one references \"the price is low for such a good haircut\" and the other mentioning $15 that I have paid my barber in NC for the past 4+ years.  With Yelp referencing this shop's price point was a single $-sign, I was expecting $15 or at least a reasonable price point. To my surprise, Jeffrey said AFTER my haircut, the cost is $40 ! ! !   Very disappointing.\nPlease be sure to confirm the price before you sit down in the chair.
