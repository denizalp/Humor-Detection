I had a cajun chicken wrap and it was pretty good, probably the best wrap I've had in a while.. well seasoned, lots of chicken. Everything else was bad. The fries were a bit disappointing, too thin and too browned. \nI was given the menu and had to wait a considerable amount of time until someone noticed I was waiting and told another waitress to come serve me. She apologized and took my order. She didn't come back to see how I was doing.\nIn the table next to me there was this girl who apparently was a frequent costumer and all of the servers checked up on her at least every 5 min. Apparently you have to know people to get good service.\nThe place is boring and has no personality. The wrap was good but not worth coming back.
