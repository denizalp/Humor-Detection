Ok, this was an amazing find. And the find came as a flyer in the mail. Whom ever thought of that idea, should get a raise. I will go through our order and service \n\nService was great!! Attentive and fast! The manager even stopped by and talked to use about the food. \n\nFish and Chips - I am a fish and chips guy. Must be my English roots. This was some of the best I've had. It's fresh caught halibut and taste amazing. The house fries are delicious and cooked Pearce. Coleslaw was perfect. Portions were very filling. \n\nTurkey Club - my daughter ordered this one. The portion was more than she could handle. Her words; best club she's ever had. \n\nCubano - was amazing. The dejon has a bit of a kick, but with the sweet glaze, it's the perfect balance. The meat was tender and it was very easy to over eat. Get the root chips. They are addicting. \n\nBaja Shrimp Tacos - Like everything else, amazing. Three, loaded tacos with perfect cilantro crema sauce. They were amazing and the smile from my youngest was priceless. \n\nChildren's chicken tenders - \"best chicken tenders ever\" says the 7 year old. Large portions that he wasn't able to finish. \n\nThis coupled with a extensive local beer list is definitely is a must stop eatery. They pride them selves on local brewery's and local foods. We will be going back. This new restaurant is a true gem.
