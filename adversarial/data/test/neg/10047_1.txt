Hiram Inn, you have served us well. This review is more of a thank you letter. My only child lives right across the street from you at the college. Every time, with the exception of one night you were filled to capacity, I have stayed in one of your beautifully, historic suites. The rooms were always tucked, tidy, and had the feeling of grandma's house. I never had to worry about bugs or high noise levels. It has been just peaceful and restful with every visit. \n\nYou have accommodated my sometimes unsettling hours of arrival. As tiring as that long Chicago drive has been, I could always count on you, Hiram Inn, to leave the lights on and have a nice hot breakfast available for me in the mornings. As a kind gesture, I often cleared our tables and washed a few dishes...because it felt like home. Your staff, of sometimes students, has been polite, kind, friendly, efficient, and just awesome. When I rented 2 suites to surprise my daughter with her Godmother and friends, you were there for us. Although there is no pool, I'm happy that your prices are fairly consistent with the B&B in the immediate neighborhood.\n\nWell, now that my child will be graduating this year, I will not see you nearly as often. I hope that this review brings you tons of new friends and people who can call upon you like family. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  \n\nP.S. Save me a room on May 17th!
