Oh, Festival In the Park - I love thee! As always, a Fall favorite in Charlotte brought the good stuff this year from local and national artisans. Whether you want to have some fried Snickers, buy a $2000 painting, a $20 painting, or get your face painted while listening to a jam band, it's all at FITP.\n\nGood things to note about it:\n1. Prepare to walk from your car to the park - it gets busy and you'll have to park on side streets OR you can use one of the uber convenient shuttles from Holy Trinity Middle School or St Ann's Church (both on Park Rd close by)\n2. If it's rained, don't wear your good shoes. Obviously this is all set up at the park so if it's rained hard, the ground tends to get a bit puddly so it's definitely a No-Suede zone.\n3. Bring the kids (in a stroller)! Bring the Dogs (on a leash)! But only if they're well behaved ;)\n4. Bring some cash - not all vendors accept CC, especially for the lower priced items\n\nIf you're around Charlotte at the end of September, it's worth going - I like it best at night when all the lights are on and reflecting in the lake. A great place for a stroll, anytime of year of course!
