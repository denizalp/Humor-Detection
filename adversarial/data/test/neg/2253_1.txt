My son has been attending this daycare for almost 18 months and I felt compelled to write this review after seeing one that I can only assume was written as a personal vendetta against the current director and is quite honestly a pack of lies! \nThis is an excellent school with great teachers in every classroom and an extremely professional management team headed by a great director with over 16 years of service with La Petite. I would not hesitate to recommend this daycare to any family looking for a quality daycare for their children.
