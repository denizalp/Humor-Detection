There are a lot of competitions of Dim Sum in Vegas, but this is the closest one to my house. It is not my go to spot for dim sum, but it is a convenient place to grab Dim Sum or Cantonese style dishes. The menu item is limited for a neighborhood joint, but it has the standard Dim Sum selections. If you want extensive authentic items, this is not it.
