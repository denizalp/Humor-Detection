The crepes here are definitely tasty and definitely huge. I've eaten my fair share of crepes at various restaurants, but this place has the biggest crepes I've ever seen\/eaten. They aren't shy on the toppings, that's for sure. Also the owners are very friendly and accommodating. I have a pretty big family so when we place a to-go order it takes them awhile to prepare it, but they handle large orders well and are still kind enough to take the time to label each box with the exact order. Tasty Crepes is my go-to for late night sweet cravings and they never disappoint.
