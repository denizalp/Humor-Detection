BDG was hired in the spring of 2017 and fired by October 2017.   In that short period of time they managed to KILL a beautiful full grown lemon tree, a fig tree, many shrubs and vines and a saguaro.  Once they were fired,  the owners found out that they had increased the time on the irrigation system from 20 minutes a day to 1 1\/2 hours\/day; and had the water pressure up so high on the irrigation system it was popping the caps off and water was just pouring into the street.  Costing the owners of the property over $1,500 in 2 months in additional water bills.  I met with the supervisor, Miguel, a few times at the property to discuss the water leaks that kept popping up and he said he would fix them.  Now, after finding out about what they did to the irrigation system, it makes sense...because the owners had to pay him to fix those water leaks...just saying.    This whole experience was extremely expensive to the owners of the property not just the monthly fees (they were double what they were paying before) but the constant up sell,  the damage to the properties beautiful landscaping and trees and the $1,500, 2 month increase in the water bill.
