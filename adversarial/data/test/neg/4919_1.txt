I made a Yelp account just to write this review. I ordered the potato bacon, it might as well should have been called the Starch and Flavorless. A little bit of salt and some basic 4th grade home-ec knowledge could have made this bland bread isoscelese semi-edible. A hybrid between eating an uncooked potatoe and stale week old cut of bacon, this pizza lacked anything that could be considered.... Well....pizza\n\nSuper pissed
