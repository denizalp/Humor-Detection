The atmosphere is OK, I guess - it's off of a casino, and caters to everyone dressed better than a tank top.\nThe wait staff was pleasent.\nThe Foie Gras 2 Ways was 50% insanely awesome, 50% meh.  The strawberry w\/ Spice Cake was a life changer, the other one was a waste of foie gras.\nI had scallops, all of my companions had ribeye.  I probably should have joined them.  The scallops were OK, certainly not Michelin Star quality.  They were cooked well, but nothing sucks more than a bunch of grit in your mouth when you bite into a scallop.
