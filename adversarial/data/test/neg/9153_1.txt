This company was called by a plumber I had at my house to look at a small leak in my kitchen. Water had leaked into 1 cabinet and a small area of flooring (less than 10 sq. feet was effected). Upon arriving they immediately sealed off the area saying it could be a health hazard and proceeded to bring in a dehumidifier and a fan. I told them at that time I was worried about costs and they told me not to worry about it, my insurance was going to pay for it all. They never provided me with an estimate and never talked prices with me at all. They sent out an employee 1 time to take a moisture reading by unsealing the area I was told could be a health hazard and never resealed it. They also took measurements and photos of my house for restoration work. Long story short insurance did not cover the leak and the company immediately came out and picked up there equipment.  I did not hear from them at all for 4 to 6 weeks. Then all of a sudden I get an email estimate of costs totaling $2,000 for services rendered (including asbestos testing) Then 48 hours later I get an email bill for the same amount. I immediately contacted the company and was told they would get back to me. Approximately a month later I receive a phone call from another employee trying to set up a payment plan. I explained to her I was not happy about their charging practices and I have emails to prove I was never quoted prices or given an estimate and in fact, was told not to worry about it. She said she would talk to the owner and see what they could do about it and they would get back to me. That was the last I had heard from them until a couple of days ago when I received mail with the same exact bill and late charges for several months applied. I have given them every chance to do the right thing and they have failed at every opportunity. They billed me $700 for an asbestos test (having never told me how much it would cost and after me telling them there was asbestos), and they billed me $1300 for a fan and dehumidifier that did nothing! To top it off, when I crawled under the sink the leak was caused by a small drain pipe that connects the sink to the drain. I used a pipe wrench to remove it, got a new one from the local home improvement store. Total cost of repair was under $20,00 !!! Of course the damage caused by the company when they tore up part of the cabinets, part of the floor and drilled holes everywhere for their tests will cost me thousands to repair! 6 months later, I still have not been able to fully repair my kitchen. After reading their reviews on this site, this seems to be the way they operate. Please do not use this company ever !!
