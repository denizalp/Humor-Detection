Defalco's is a little Italy in Scottsdale. Just came back from a vaca in Italy and this place made me feel that the trip has not yet ended. Margherita pizza is very authentic. Cheese Ravioli was a little on the dry side but tasted good. \nA waiter told us their sandwiches are the best. Will go back to try their grilled veggie sandwich..\nYou can find a wide range of balsamic vinegars, pastas, Italian seasonings and lot more. Looks like it will save me a trip to the other continent in future.
