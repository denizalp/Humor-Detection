What an amazing experience. To be honest I was going to go to Crabby Joes but saw this place and I'm glad we went in. Everything was delicious, freshly cooked, good quality and did I say friggin DELICIOUS!?!!!!! Great ambiance - industrial looking but lovely! Will definitely go back. If you LOVE Mediterranean, ''tis is your place.
