Came here on a Friday evening for a pedicure with my husband (his first!). Theresa and Maryann were both very professional and kind and gave us great pedicures that lasted a full hour. My husband was asking a ton of questions since it was his first time and they were very patient in explaining everything. The pedicure station is comfortable and quiet in the back. It was a good experience and I'm glad my husband had a good first impression of pedicures!
