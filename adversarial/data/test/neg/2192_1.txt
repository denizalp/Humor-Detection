Like another reviewer we live very close by so my wife and I thought we'd give them a shot. I came in on a Saturday with my wife during lunch hour. They had maybe 3 tables occupied. We were sat down slowly. It took 15 minutes before the waitress came by and took our order.\nThe appetizer, fried calamari took 30 minutes more to come out and when it came out there was barely any calamari. We both ordered katsu lunch bentos with additional rolls. The rolls came out maybe 15 minutes after the appetizer did. And the boxes came out about 5 minutes after that.\n\nThe katsu came out slightly burnt and was very salty. The rolls were the only thing we enjoyed but I would not go through that again. We were there for more than an hour for underwhelming food and slow service.\n\nMinus stars for slow service, price and subpar burnt food.\n\nBottom line: never going there again.
