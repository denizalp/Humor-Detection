Found tickets to the last performance of \"Les Miserable\" online before we left, and so we ordered them to celebrate our first full day this summer in Arizona, even though I had seen the show already once this summer and in fact 25 times before that one.  Interestingly enough, I did something that I have never done in my fifty years of attending theatre--showed up for the wrong performance!  We had ordered the matinee on Saturday--we like matinees-- but I had written it down wrong and had not checked the tickets, and we showed up for the evening performance.  No one even looked at our tickets at the door so we sat there on the aisle reading our program, and five minutes before the show was supposed to start, another party came down and said we were in their seats!  And we were!  I went back to the people at the door who had given me the program but not checked the ticket, and they said we could sit in the back section--really only a few rows behind where we thought we were.  The show was great as always--although it was probably a bad choice because the production we had seen last month in Valdosta was so superior, and we were sitting on the front row there instead of a few rows from the back of the house in this large auditorium.  I still loved it,  but we had been spoiled, not to mention the \"haboob\" which had accompanied us on our trip to the theatre (I didn't know the word either, but a local explained it was a strong dust storm, often with whirlwinds, which we were experiencing for the first time.)  The show was obviously community theatre  but well done--it is hard to mess up \"Les Mis.\"  Madame Thenardier was especially memorable!  The venue was new and very impressive, but the volunteers need a little training.
