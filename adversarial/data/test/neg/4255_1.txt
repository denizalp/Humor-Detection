AWESOME! AWESOME! AWESOME! Fazio's is the best! We drive over 45 minutes at least once a week to eat here! Strombolis bigger than your head and we are always treated like family! The owner is there all day every day and goes in early to make the sauce and crust from SCRATCH. He is the only one who makes it, so it is consistent. He doesn't skimp on the quality of his ingredients, either. We will forever recommend Fazio's to anyone in the Pittsburgh area!
