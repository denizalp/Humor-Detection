Don't whine about this bar...\r\n\r\nTHE UP-SIDE:\r\nGreat wine, knowledgeable staff, nice atmosphere, and good food.\r\n\r\nTHE DOWN-SIDE:\r\nSmall space.\r\n\r\nTHE SUM-IT-UP:\r\nGo here for great wine and great atmosphere.  Perfect stop on a first date.  I'd go here any day over La Cave Du Vin in Coventry.
