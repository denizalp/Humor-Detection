I LOVE YOU HUMBLE PIE!!! I order this to go about once per week. I call before I leave the office and it is ready to go in 10 minutes. It's tastier and faster than any delivery pizza you can get...unless you are hung over on a Sunday and cant bare to drive to pick it up. ;) \n\nI just tried the wings last week and will get the extra spicy next time but even once i brought them home they were still crispy and tender. noms! \n\nPepperoni pizza, I love you. Small gourmet little slices of meat love. My bf gets the clam pizza...never had a bite but he loves it! I just cant seem to get away from what a normal pizza should be. \n\nThe crust of the pizza is killer, chewy and fluffy. Amazing wood fired taste to it as well. \n\nThis place is always packed during dinner hours but dies down around 8pm or so. Looks like a really fun place to go for mingling in the busy hours. After 9-10 hours of work, I am done talking to people and prefer pizza time with cats and bf.
