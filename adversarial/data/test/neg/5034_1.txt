Great place.  Not the best sushi you have ever had in your life, but definitely better than 90% of sushi places in the city.  The staff is always really friendly, so much so that even when they make a mistake, they handle it so nicely that it doesn't matter.  The restaurant is also always noticeably clean.\n\nWhen it comes to a casual night of sushi, this is our go to.  Considering it is the one sushi spot in the area I find it quite lucky that it is a good one.
