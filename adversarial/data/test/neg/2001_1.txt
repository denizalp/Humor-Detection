I heard great things about Zupas from my coworkers but my expectations were not even close to being met. The atmosphere was quite poor; the line was long and between the 5 people on the assembly line they lost\/confused my order three times. Tomato soup was good but the  grilled cheese was flat and tasteless (it looks much better in the pictures online and on the menu). If I had to pick a soup and salad place I would pick Jason's Deli over Zupas any day. Wont be returning or recommending. :(
