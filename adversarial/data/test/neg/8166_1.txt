Amazing!! It's been a while since we have been to a restaurant that lived up to the hype. There was a glitch with our reservation but the hostess was quick to accommodate us. Our waiter was honest and friendly. The food was great. Would go back just for the watermelon with warm fresh cheese! Everything else was awesome too. My husband is always on the look out for a great filet and this was one of them. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. The chicken and waffles and chicken and biscuits were both as good as they sounded.
