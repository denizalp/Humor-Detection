First off I want to say Thanks Kevin!  He worked me in today because I had a sewer line back up.  He gave me  a quote with all of the hypothetical scenarios.  As he started the work he would check back with me to make sure I knew what the progress was and if we needed to add one of the scenario charges.  He was very professional and true to his quote.  If you need a plumber he is definitely your guy.
