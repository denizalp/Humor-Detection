I've eaten here several times but recently have been taking advantage of their evening menu on Thursday-Saturday from 4:30-8:00 pm.  Prices do seem a little high until you witness the mountain of food delivered to your table or into your takeout containers.  A previous reviewer said that you won't leave hungry, truer words never said.  I have liked everything I've had here, but really recommend the green chile option where available.  Huevos rancheros, biscuits and gravy, chicken fried steak,  pork chile verde on anything, burgers & sliders, good basic diner food, there's something for everyone on this menu.  Service has been good for me, and takeout orders have been ready promptly, but more important:  accurately,  so no complaints there.  Delivery is available for the evening menu, which can be nice if you're being especially lazy.  Good to have a nice little place like this in the neighborhood, so I'm doing my part to keep them in business.  Oh, I do wish they'd use Heinz or Hunt's ketchup; that restaurant supply house brand sucks.
