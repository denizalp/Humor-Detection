This place is awesome,\n\nGreat korean chinese food\n\nI always get the shrimp fried rice that comes with black bean sauce and spicy soup on the side.\n\nSpicy seafood noodle soup is really good\n\nSweet and sour beef is really good as well.\n\nPortions are huge and everything Ive had above tastes delicious.
