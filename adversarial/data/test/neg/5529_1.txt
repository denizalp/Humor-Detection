Went here last night and have to say although this place is new, and without an alcohol license, their food and the attitude are great. Fresh rice paper rolls, an engaged waiter who walked us through each part of the menu with recommendations for each part, two decently flavorful main dishes with plenty leftover for lunch the next day, and my first AVOCADO SMOOTHIE...all for $35.\n\nWhat more could you ask for? \n\nI haven't yet visited the established Vietnamese Grill up the street so I don't have much to compare to, but I'm sure this new restaurant is here to stay.\n\nCheck it out, and try that smoothie!
