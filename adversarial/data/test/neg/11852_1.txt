I love this place. It's not only one of the cutest places in old town but it's some of the best tacos I've had in Arizona. We had previously been to The Mission and felt that it didn't really live up to the hype, Diego Pops blows it out of the water and 1\/4 the cost. So many options and a creative menu. The ONLY reason I wouldn't give them 5 stars is because you have to pay for chips and salsa and that their guacamole sucks. \n\nRecommend all the tacos, but specifically the beef Machaca
