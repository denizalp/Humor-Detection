I almost didn't go because the outside is intimidating - carnival type atmosphere and decor. I'm glad I went though. The moist brisket sandwich was delicious. It may be too rich for some, but it was perfect for me. The pork ribs were also delicious, lightly glazed and not overcooked when finishing on the grill. The meat on the ribs came right off the bones clean! Impressive. My fiend had the pulled pork and said it was food. We both shared the curly fires, which were hot, salty, and delicious. When we went for lunch, they were spit roasting a pig over an open flame - the place smelled like heaven! Unfortunately for us, the pig was for a party coming in at dinner. The guy told us we could order one a week ahead of time and they would do the same for us. I MUST DO THIS. Anyway, I'm usually pretty loyal to Rudy's, but this place was even better (in my opinion...and the leftovers I brought my wife made her agree). I will be back, hopefully soon.
