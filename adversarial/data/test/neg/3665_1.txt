I am a bargain shopper. With a new home to furnish and decorate, I want it to look beautiful without breaking the bank. Thank goodness for all of these stores that sell home goods for reduced prices. \n\nRoss is my go to place when I need to find rugs. The selections differ from store to store and it is not always abundant. With that being said, when you do find that perfect one, you can be sure that it will not cost a couple hundred dollars. Most of the rugs range from $25-$100.\n\nI also like their array of accent pillows. Walking through the aisle will guarantee at least a few in my cart. $4-$18 is the normal range you could expect to pay.
