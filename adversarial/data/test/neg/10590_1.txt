Very cute restaurant, very nice presentation and very good service. The location is also very cute.\nNow about the food. I have huge respect for any vegan restaurant that doesn't make you eat flowers and grass . However  I feel that the food could taste better here. There is potential to make the food great. We had eggplant flatbread which I loved the bread part more than the eggplant. I ordered chimichanga which the inside filling tasted like sofritos from chipotle only much saltier. The shell was very crispy and tasty. Whoever does their baking is doing a good job. My husband had \"ramen\" bowl with plant noodles I think he enjoyed it, but was not excited to get not the actual noodles.\n Food needs improvement.
