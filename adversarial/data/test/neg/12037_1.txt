The only word to describe this place: incredible. Large portions of delicious southern food. Mandi was our server and she was entirely accommodating and informative. She's extremely friendly. You can tell the restaurant is prideful of their product. The manager visited the table and made sure we were having a good experience. \n\nOne thing - if you have two people dining order either two mains and one side, or one main and two sides. Large portions. We had a whole meal worth of leftovers when we finished. \n\nDefinitely worth visiting when in Vegas. I'll be coming back here on my next trip. I hope this one is here to stay!
