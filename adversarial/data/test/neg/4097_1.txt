Seriously such a cool place with an awesome atmosphere and delicious beverages! I was recommended to try the butterbeer latte and it was FREAKING delicious. They certainly know their stuff here at the Daily Press CLT and you will not regret stopping by! Ask for suggestions as they are more than willing to help you out. They know their coffee! Seriously! :)
