I'm not gonna lie, I used to super judge this place every time I drove by it. Well, my Sister suggested it so I decided to try it out tonight. Wow! I was skeptical, but now impressed. The enchiladas are, I mean, REALLY good. I had one of each kind of tortilla, beef, with red & green sauce and both kinds of cheese. I had them sprinkle some cotija on top with just a taste of the jalapeno ranch sauce. It was perfect! I got chips and salsa on the side as well as the Honey V slaw. The slaw is really good, wish they served it in a bigger dish. The salsas were also good. BUT, the chips were nasty. They tasted like they were cooked in rancid oil. Not sure if it's just the kind of oil they use or if they in fact used old oil to make them. So I dont recommend the chips. But don't be like me and judge it before you try it. It's definitely worth your time. Yum!
