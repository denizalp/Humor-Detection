Ever since they took out the self-check out stands this store has gone down hill with respect to service. There are never enough checkers and even with \"three's a crowd\" called no one shows up for over three minutes...and when they do they do not take the next person in line. Has happened several times. The store has gotten a lot more expensive too. Sprouts and Walmart are much less expensive and more choices. I used to be a regular customer since I live two blocks away.....now I only go there if I forgot something and grit my teeth. Always now a  painful experience. Too bad.
