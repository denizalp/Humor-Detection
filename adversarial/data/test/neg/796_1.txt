Last Sunday, I ordered Shrimp Fried Noddle and Fish Congee to go for 20$-that's a lot for just 2 dishes from a Chinese restaurant. I was totally disappointed when I opened the food. There were just a couple of shrimps in my noddle, and lots of sprout with clammy noddle. Otherwise, the Congee was OK, but the portion was little-just enough for 2 small bowls. Generally, I gonna give it between 2 and 3 stars.
