I came here for lunch the other day and I had a fantastic green dragon roll with seaweed salad. The friendly staff made my food quickly and although it was \"fast\" sushi the quality was noticeably better compared to some sit down sushi restaurants. I give it a 5 star rating when compared to other lunch express sushi joints. Great for a quick, healthy and tasty bite to eat on the go!
