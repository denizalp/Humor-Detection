I considered Tula Central studio as one that I might regularly attend. I have nothing too negative to say about the teachers. It's all the other stuff, change room is insanely tiny and cramped, overall grungy. Change room and showers are behind a curtain, past the bathroom stalls which are right off the hallway, with the entry door that often stays open - gross. I get that it's an old building and they tried to fit the facilities in but it's just a terrible set-up. I can deal with busy,  but this is chaos central, the worst ever.  Also, good luck getting in - will they answer the buzzer?, when you come on a Sunday or early morning. Big pass on this studio, no thanks. There are much better choices in our city!!
