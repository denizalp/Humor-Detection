Iv'e tried a number of buffets in Vegas including Paris, Caesar's, and the Wynn. For the price of $40, this is well overpriced. You are better off at Paris or the Wynn ($47.) One thing they do offer is the plentiful oysters which were not as sanitary looking as I'm normally accustomed to seeing even in a buffet.  Bottom line, go elsewhere if you can hop in a cab as if you're here, your not on the strip.
