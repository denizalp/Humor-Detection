I planned  a bachelorette party (group of 5) and came here for Saturday champagne brunch - what a fantastic experience!  It was really a highlight of the day, and we had a lot of fun stuff that day.\n\nDefinitely make a reservation (like everywhere in Vegas, it seems).  The wait was long, but since I'd booked on opentable, we were seated immediately.\n\nFirst, the service.  Our server (Carmie I believe) had a ton of tables, yet she checked on us frequently and never left us with empty champagne classes.  She was so sweet.  We did unlimited small plates, and she started us off with some of her favorite\/the most popular dishes and then let us order anything we wanted.  Even though she was obviously super busy, she had a huge happy smile all the time, and managed to chat with us for a moment each time she stopped by.  I don't know how people like her do it.\n\nSecond, the food. It was outrageously good. I can't believe I've never had breakfast small plates before - you don't have to choose! The shrimp and grits, short rib hash, and frittata were favorites with us.  We ate like kings for a super reasonable price, in a cute location.  We were STUFFED - brunch was at noon, and none of us was hungry for dinner at 7pm.\n\nBy VEGAS standards, this place is $$ I think; by yelp's listed standard, it's $$$.  Unlimited small plates cost I think $33 per person and unlimited mimosas on top of that was $8 or $9.\n\nHighly recommend this place.
