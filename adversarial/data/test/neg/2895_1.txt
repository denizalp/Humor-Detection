A very unique place, the best part is that they are open all the time.  They have some very interesting chandeliers and paintings.  Good variety of pastries as well as their cheese flavors that they have.  The coffee is kickass here, over all a very good place to hang out.  It has mixed crowds and perfect location in NODA.  I do plan to visit it more often on my trips to Charlotte.
