They keep the place clean and it's a cute restaurant with a fun feel. Not 1 server was friendly. They were all rude including the hostess... wait was long but not too bad. Waited about 30 mins. chips and salsa were mediocre.. food was ok. Margaritas we're ok.... kinda weak. My boyfriend liked his burrito .... my vegetable fajita tasted like chemicals and alcohol.......... kinda like nail polish remover . Kudos for the $5\/50 offer through yelp tho just won't be back
