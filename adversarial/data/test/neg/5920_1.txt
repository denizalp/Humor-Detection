Quickly seated at 7:30 on a Thursday night.  Interior is mellow and modern, table was clean. Smelled amazing. Menu was very enticing -- we found it hard to choose. Server gave recommendations, which we took, and we enjoyed our meals immensely: firecracker shrimp and salmon on carmelized onions.  Side salads were fresh and the vinaigrette fantastic.  The broth served with my husband's salmon had a floral essence -- lemongrass? Lavender?  Amazing flavor for a broth. Young wait staff was friendly but a bit eager to remove plates we weren't done with, get us our check before we were ready.  Why the rush?  Plenty of tables were open when we were eating at 8 and I hate to feel rushed.
