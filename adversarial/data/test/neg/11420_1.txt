Let's see where to begin....\nWe were greeted almost immediately and seated at the table of our choice.The table had not been cleaned yet to which the waiter quickly wisked away food and crumbs left behind. The table was sticky and is in much need of a re-sufacing as there was patches on the covering that were worn through. Wait time for dinks and our main course were ok, not the fastest we've had partly due to the fact there was only one person waiting tables, serving drinks, doing take-out oders and phone orders. We ordered the tortilla chips with guacamole appetizer, when it arrived that's all that was on the table, a basket of chips and a bowl of guacamole, no napkins no plates. I had to ask for napkins, not a good start from my point of view, you shouldn't have to ask for things that should already be on the table. My wife's order was wrong, she ordered the Huarache and she got chicken fajitas, not sure how that happened but suspect having only one person doing five different jobs may have had a little to do with it. The waiter was friendly and attentive and had her correct order out and at our table just 10 minutes later. Overall the food was good, fresh and hot but the sevice lagged a bit and the decor definately need to be refreshed or updated.
