Yolie's KILLED IT!  The Maitre d' was the best I'd ever had.   He was nice, funny, charismatic and very helpful.   He remembered my colleague's name from the year prior.  He had stories from all over the world and shifted between English to Spanish, French and German with ease.  \n\nThe black bean \"soup\" was phenomenal, in fact, that's what lead me here; I'm looking for a similar recipe.  \n\nIn the end, the sirloin was the tastiest, but there wasn't one meat that I didn't thoroughly enjoy.   The lamb, which I don't usually love, was even VERY tasty. \n\nNot sure how they earned One-star ratings from some people, but I loved it.  I was sad to hear how the traffic to their restaurant had dwindled since the other area Churrascarias started paying $5\/person to the local cabbies.   \n\n\nAnyway...GREAT place!
