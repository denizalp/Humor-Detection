The bartender is running customers away. He has a total pompous attitude, doesn't crack a smile, gives a smart ass comments, rude to customers and other employees. This is the third time we've come here and he's ruined our experience. We really wanted desert but we could stand to be in his presence so we left to get desert somewhere else.
