Very cool look to it inside,  rustic industrial style.  Staff was friendly & comped our app because they forgot to bring it out until we were almost done eating, very nice of them,  we didn't expect it & just wanted to try the food! Food was good,  a little on the oily side if youre health conscious. Overall I'd recommend it for some tasty eats!
