I am blown away about this place! I was very nervous coming from a renown salon where I pay $120, and then going to a random place in Scarborough where I only had to pay $35. I am sitting here at the salon waiting for my mother to finish her cut but I couldn't wait to post a review about this place because I loved it so much. To start off I have very thick long hair and was nervous about having it cut, but Andy exceeded my expectations. Not only did he give me an AMAZING hair wash (almost fell asleep) but he spent over an hour perfecting my hair cut and gave me an awesome blow out. Made me wonder why I ever spent so much money at previous salons in the first place!\nAndy is truly an artist who loves what he does, his cut was relative to my facial features and how it worked with my face structure. Considering it was towards the end of the day and he probably had several clients before me, he still took the time and paid great attention to detail, which I truly appreciated. Highly recommend this place!
