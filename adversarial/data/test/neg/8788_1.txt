The service was excellent and the food was great.  We had a potato soup which was OK, but also had a sweet corn appetizer that was fantastic and we had a pizza with a cauliflower crust - the crust was great and much more healthy (too bad there is an additional $2.50 charge for the crust).  The pizza was delicious.
