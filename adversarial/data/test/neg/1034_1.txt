Been coming to get some of my used textbooks here for my first and second semester here. Everytime when the UNLV Bookstore is out of stock of used books or if the textbooks is very expensive, I go here. They have all the books you need for a good price and looks new. The one thing I hate is waiting the long line just to get books.
