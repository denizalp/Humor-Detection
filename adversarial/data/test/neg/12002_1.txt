Accidentally stopped by this place for lunch and it wasn't bad.  The ambiance was really nice and resembled old English.  I liked the selection of music playing- it was mostly American (R&B, old school and pop genres).  The wait staff was bilingual and was able to communicate in both English and French. The restaurant also had an express lunch menu (about 4 items) if you need to receive your meal quickly - guaranteed in 45 minutes or less. Otherwise, there was a moderate selection of a la carte entrees, sides and desserts.  The food was very light and we were able to eat a 3 course meal without feeling miserable or stuffed. There was also a nice selection of international wines.  I had the local Canadian Chardonnay and it was very good. Overall, I had a positive experience here.
