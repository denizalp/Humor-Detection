Expect to wait for a seat at this spunky little fish joint.\nVery casual...don't expect to sit at the bar while you wait for your seat b\/c it only seats about 9-10 people tops! The regular fish tacos are not the way to go....they're at the bottom of my pile- do something different- sword fish, etc.....they make a pretty darn good mojito as well.\nI recommend checking it out when you're in the area; plenty of things to do next door as well if you have to wait for your seat.
