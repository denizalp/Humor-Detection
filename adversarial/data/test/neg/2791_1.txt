If you want a professional to fix or just replace your watch, this is the place to go. \n\nI use to go to the watch repair department at Sears where they last broke the face of my watch. Never again. \n\nMichael replaced my battery on a newly purchased watch and also changed the links to fit my wrist. He also applied a substance on the edges of the back of the watch to keep it waterproof. \nI highly recommend his work. Total cost $40. \nYou can find him inside Sacks Fifth Avenue in the corner of the watch department to the right.
