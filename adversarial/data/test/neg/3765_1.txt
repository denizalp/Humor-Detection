Excellent food, prompt friendly staff. This location is smaller than the Hurontario or Richmond Hill locations. The biryani is excellent (lamb), channa masala is good, and the fish masala is outstanding - a real surprise. The naan is plain, and desserts small. Each entree is enough to feed 4. veggie and meat thali are available for diners who want a lighter meal.
