I am becoming more and more disappointed with what was my favorite gf place to eat. :( \n\n-The baked goods above the case and in are always scarce. (We were there at 11... They still had 3-4 hrs of service still)\n-Menu items falling off...Ex: carrot cake cupcakes were so delicious... No longer for sale. When I asked about them the male cashier rudely replied \"yup looks that way!\" ... Um he should have tried \"I know, they were so delicious, but we are no longer selling those.\" ((tip? There's your tip buddy.))\n-The customer service is no longer friendly.  Cashiers are rude and act like they are in their 11th HR of a 12 HR shift! \n-However, the girls delivering the food to tables were friendly and nice! \n\nJewels bakery please step it up!
