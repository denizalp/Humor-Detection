We have frequented this restaurant for a few times, but today was the last!  As Kathy R. explains, the place is very dirty, food is less than mediocre and the staff is not professional.  There were no napkins or forks without asking, and the malt vinegar, which is a must for fish and chips, was split among several bottles, (all with a greasy feeling) and if totaled would not have equaled a tablespoon.  I would not invite ANYONE there for even a free meal!!!
