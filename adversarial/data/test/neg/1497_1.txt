I had Per Se during Nuit Blanche. The food trucks were parked near some of the events so I decided to check it out. It was actually delicious! I ordered the pork sausage sandwich and it was really big and filling. It came with chips on the bottom and those were great too. The workers inside were very nice and welcoming. I recommend this food truck! It's quite expensive (around $8-$12 for the items) but it isn't unreasonable compared to other food trucks.
