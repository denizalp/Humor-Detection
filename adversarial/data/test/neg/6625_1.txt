Great experience! \nI was AZ from out of town and needed to get some emergenct contacts found this place went in and they were very helpful and did a full work up for me. They were upfront about the pricing and explained everything to me. The doctor was very professional and friendly. I was in and out with what I needed no hassle at all. The office is clean and the staff was very nice. I would make this place my permanent eye doctor if I lived in town.
