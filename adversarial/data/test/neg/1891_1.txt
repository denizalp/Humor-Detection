I did not know that Yogi has another branch.  This is the first time I have visited this restaurant.  I expect it to be a Hong Kong style restaurant.  But what I find is that it is not only a HK style restaurant, it is also a Cantonese restaurant, congee place, breakfast area.  It is a Chinese restaurant with all kinds of menu.  Actually to go through all menus take some time. \n\nThe fried Chicken black pepper sauce with spaghetti is average.  The chicken is tender but the sauce is thick and seems like lots of corn starch. It is not expensive.  I cannot rate the service as it is late and all waiters together with the chef are having their dinner.  \n\nI like the d√©cor from the previous restaurant Le Chine.  Don't know why they torn down a lot and make it looks like a cafeteria.  May be they want to give customers a feeling for a economic place to dine out.  It starts from breakfast all the way to late dinner.\n\nI pay with my Visa
