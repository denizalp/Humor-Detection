One of the best deals in the City has to be their weekday prix fixe menu. You get a three course meal for 25 bucks. It includes a choice of soup or salad to start, any main and then a choice between usually two different types of dessert. Since I live in the 'hood I have been coming here since it opened and have enjoyed every visit.
