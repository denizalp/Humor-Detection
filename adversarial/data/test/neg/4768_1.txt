This restaurant is awesome especially to me because I am an ethnic Jew and grew up in delis like this one.  The bagels are to die for, the entrees are traditional, very well-done and very filling, and the matzo ball soup is amazing.  I also found out that the owners of this restaurant are involved in (probably own but I am not sure) the deli at South Point and Red Rock, both of which have ridiculously good bagels, soup, desserts, and everything in between.\n\nIf you are a fan of real boiled bagels with fresh cream cheese, big sandwiches with fresh pastrami and corned beef, and a huge selection of delicious desserts, you should absolutely check the Bagel Cafe out.  You will not be disappointed.
