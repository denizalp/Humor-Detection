Place is awesome! And remodeled rooms and it's perfect and we got the one king bedroom suit and pull out couch bed and it's a queen size and has a little kitchen Witt a dish washer and sink and refrigerator and a mini stove too so not bad we like it and 2 flat screen TVs and place is awesome! Staff is great and the manager she great! So don't mine coming back next time we in town
