I love how Kierland Commons is an outdoor mall...on a nice January day, it's so refreshing that when I want to go shopping, I can walk around outside and enjoy the beautiful weather instead of being trapped inside a mall.  Kierland has the stores I like to shop in, so it's easier to go there than have to deal with the Chandler Mall or Scottsdale Fashion Square.  On a Saturday morning, parking was extremely easy at Kierland and all of the stores were pretty empty.  I hate shopping where I feel as if I am tripping over people.\n\nThe Barnes and Noble is two stories and is quite large...the layout was kind of annoying to me though.  There are a few cute boutiques that are worth checking out, plus Banana Republic, Coach, Crate and Barrel, BCBG, J Crew, Victorias Secret, etc.  Even though Kierland is about a 20-25 minute drive for me, I will most definitely be shopping there when I want fresh air and the basic stores.
