I ate at the bar\/cantina side.  I love the fact that the bar area has tables instead of just barstools. \nI had a cup of albondigas soup and ceviche salad.  \nThe soup was good and hearty for one cup.  \nAs for the ceviche salad, it was a very generous portion. Unfortunately, I had my heart set on the \"ceviche de camaron\" not the \"shrimp ceviche salad\" but I guess I mispronounced it or something.  The good news is that the ceviche is same in both recipes and costs exactly the same but I left so much lettuce I felt wasteful.  \nAfter my early dinner, the busser\/co-waiter gave me complimentary churros! So yummy and fresh tasting.  The churros were warm, like right out of the fryer, not heated in a microwave.\nAs for service, the employees were very attentive, helpful and friendly. My dirty, empty dishes were only on the table for like, 2-3 minutes tops and I never run out of coke zero with the fast refills.\n\nSo I will definitely be back! :D
