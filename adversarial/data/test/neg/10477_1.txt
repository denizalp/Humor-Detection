Was driving to work and needed lunch on the go so I stopped in for a quick bite. Don't give me wrong the place looks great. Awesome bar, huge tv's, I was telling myself \"man I gotta hit this place up with the buds, it seems like the spot\"  However, I ordered their \"lantern burger\" and being a burger freak I was highly disappointed. First, I ordered it medium well and it came well done. And it just didn't taste good. The quality of the beef was just awful it seemed like. Fries weren't that great either. Only thing they had going was their jameson BBQ sauce. I most likely will hit up their happy hour just to taste other foods they got, but so far not a fan of this place. Also based on looking at the menu a lot seems overpriced. Night Life seems like it has potential but doubt anyone goes there since it's in a plaza.
