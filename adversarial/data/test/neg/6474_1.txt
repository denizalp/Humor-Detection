Centrally located, air-conditioned, seldom crowded.\n\nI was a member of Anytime Fitness for a little over a year. I joined because it was right around the corner from my apartment, and I was curious about the concept of a gym that's always open.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, I didn't really use the \"anytime\" feature all that often. I mostly went during standard business hours, but it was good for those crack-of-dawn workouts before early flights.\n\nThe great thing about this gym is that it's more of a fitness club. The manager greets you by name. It's clean. No one grunts unreasonably or drops their weights from the top of a rep.\n\nIt doesn't have locker rooms or lockers, which was a bit of an adjustment. You change in one of the two individual bathrooms, which are outfitted to make changing easy (they have benches e.g.), and then leave your belongings in a surveilled cubby space at the front.\n\nBut really Anytime Fitness's ace in the hole is the lack of overcrowding. To a certain extent, there are the 8 a.m\/ 5 p.m. bottlenecks of regular gyms, but it's nothing compared to \"mega-gyms\" where you go after work and it's stuffed to the gills with people.\n\nEven at peak hours, it's easy to get whatever machine\/ weight you want.
