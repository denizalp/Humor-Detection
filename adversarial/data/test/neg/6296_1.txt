Nothing but praise for this place! Reasonably priced,with lovely spacious suites that were thoroughly cleaned each day of our stay - they even put our dishes in the dishwasher (yes, there's a dishwasher)! The staff was unfailingly courteous, and we so much appreciated little touches like the citrus water in the lobby. We had several meals in the 5th-floor restaurant -  again, great service, and it was very nice not to have to leave the hotel to find good food.
