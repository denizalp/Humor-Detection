My favorite go to place. I travel all of the state for work and working my routing just to make sure I can hit up a Nekter for lunch. I always get the protein bowl and sub whey for pea protein. It is delicious and when it's hot in phx... which is always... nothing sounds better. I'm obsessed. Download the app too for extra rewards.
