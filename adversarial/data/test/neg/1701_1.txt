Long wait time for food 47 minutes to be exact. Order was wrong. I thought with the remodel this place would be better.   I had such high hope for IHOP it's the only one thatnear the house and I am sad to be disappointed and greeted with dirty tables, cold food and long lines. I left and won't go back
