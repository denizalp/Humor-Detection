Soooooo disappointed!  I think we were the only table there but we waited for a very long term me for our food.  I thought they are known for their steaks but the food totally disappointed us. We ordered the prime ribs and Cowboy bone-in 45 days dry.  For that price, I thought the meat would be a lot more tender. The onion soup was nothing extraordinary.  My aunt ordered the scallops and she finished the whole plate.  I didn't like the crab cakes.  The waitress was nice.  I wouldn't come back for sure.
