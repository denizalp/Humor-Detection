Dr. Ngo went above and beyond all expectation on my first visit with him. From the moment I walked in I was taken aback by the chic decor that made me feel like I was anywhere but the dentist. I typically loathe going to the dentist but my entire experience with the staff has completely changed my perspective. \n\nThis office was also the most technically advanced I had ever seen. From the X-ray machines to the photos he can show you from various angles! This was also an educational trip for me. I had a much better understanding of what was going on in my mouth leaving the office than when I walked in. \n\nNot to mention, I walked out of the office with pearly whites. My cleaning and whitening processes were virtually painless, and I can already see my self getting addicted to teeth whitening! \n\nThank you Dr. Ngo!!!!! I will be referring all my friends and family to the best in the game!
