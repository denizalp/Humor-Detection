Went here on a Tuesday night with coworkers- seated right away, easy enough.  I asked our server to help me decide between a flat bread pizza and something else.  He quickly recommended one of their cheese flatbreads so I ordered it.  It came out last and he gave it to me quickly and hurried away.  I noticed right away it was well done (burnt) and not too appealing.  I took a bite to be sure, but it was gross.  Our server never came back until the end of the meal when everyone I was with was finished.  I told him my food was inedible and kinda gross.  He looked at it, checked the burnt bottom, agreed that it was burnt and was basically like, \"Yeah, that looks pretty bad.\"  I then asked why he would bring out food that looked like that if he agreed with me?!? He kinda laughed and didn't really have an answer.  I asked if that was how it was supposed to look and he admitted no, it wasn't, and finally offered to make me a new one.  Not much help when everyone else at the table is ready for a check.   To add the icing to the cake, he charged me for it!  I held up my bill and asked why, and he just shrugged and said, \"I asked if you wanted a new one, didn't I?\"\nYeah....the rest of the group agreed that the food was mediocre and after that, none of us will be back.
