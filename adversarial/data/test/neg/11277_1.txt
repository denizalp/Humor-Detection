I've booked two European vacations thru Destination Travel. Both were amazing vacations.  The first was booked through a now retired agent, however, Wanda Pedersen booked the second and she was great.  She was quick to respond, on weekends and even when she was heading out of town herself.  I am very impressed with the service that Destination Travel offers.  \nThanks Wanda for the fantastic experience!\nAliesha Wright
