I had the fish. Perfect in every way and the asparagus, which was probably the best asparagus I've ever tasted. Not sure how this place has three stars I enjoyed everything about it. And they brought us champagne flutes because it was our anniversary! Excellent, attentive service and a delicious meal, I can't give them any less than 5*
