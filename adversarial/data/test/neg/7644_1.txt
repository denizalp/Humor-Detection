We had a very pleasant experience with Brandy today. We went in for our heartbeat check-up @ 6 weeks. I was a little bit nervous at first because of my past experiences with ultrasounds, but she made me feel at ease. She is very friendly and professional. The room is very clean and relaxing. Brandy found the baby right away. We were even able to hear the heartbeat for the first time. She too her time explaining to us what we were seeing, and she took pictures and recorded the heartbeat for us. We will definitely be going back there for the gender reveal!
