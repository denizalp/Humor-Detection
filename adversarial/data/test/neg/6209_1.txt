I was staying @ MGM and booked an offer then included $35 Dining Credit, asked where I could use it and WPB&G was 1 of them so we (mom and I) decided to go have lunch here after some great pool time...\n\nOrdered a Caesar Salad (shared) and 2 Calzone, they were absolutaly delicious, I highly recommend them! \n\nIt's not a fancy place its casual and the service is pretty good.
