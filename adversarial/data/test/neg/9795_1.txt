Zero customer service. After over a year as a customer, I am moving out of NV. I have no contract with CenturyLink, so it should be simple, right?\n\nFirst of all, it is all but impossible to reach an agent to set up a disconnect. Further, there is no automated option, so find an agent you must. That took me two days and another 35 minutes on hold. Finally a disconnect order was placed.\n\nConfirmation email was incomplete and did not reflect the effective date, two weeks hence.\n\nThis morning, six days after placing the order and one week and two days until the order is to become effective, my internet connection disappeared. Of course, nobody is available on Sunday to help me on the phone, so I go to technical support chat. Agent was unable to help me, saying only that the pending service order MAY have something to do with it. What... Nobody knows??? Then I was instructed to call a telephone number and, guess what?.... NO Sunday hours. So I have to go through the whole rigamarole again Monday morning and another interminable hold, I'm sure.\n\nAll this just to get my internet service back for one lousy week?? If they're going to terminate me now after 1 1\/2 years of being a solid customer, then I guess I can just use my hotspot like I'm having to do now. And they can just chase me for the balance. (Just don't cross my threshold!)\n\nAfter all, why should I make their lives easy?? They haven't exactly helped me out.\n\nAVOID this company like the plague. It's all take and no give.\n\n(This review is not about a specific storefront business, but reflects the company as a whole, so DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU!!)
