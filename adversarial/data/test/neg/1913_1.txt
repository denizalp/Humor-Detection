Olive and ivy has always been one of my go to spots. The bread they give you with pesto and olive oil is a great way to start your meal.\n\nIf you're feeling really good,  get the bacon- wrapped dates.\n\nI have yet to have a bad meal here whether lunch hour or dinner and they even have a nice market inside making it quick and easy to pick up something on the go.
