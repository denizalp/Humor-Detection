Outstanding house cleaning experience!  I feel SO relaxed!  Yesterday, Simply Housekeeping came over to help me with a \"big spring clean\".  I think these ladies may be wizards!  They managed to clean things that I had deemed impossible.  My house feels cleaner than it's ever been.  Rose, the owner, is a total pro--responsive & thorough!  She came by for a same-day estimate and on the day of the cleaning, stopped in to ensure satisfaction.  The experience was wonderful!
