Customer service is excellent here. They are very nice and kind. I like it when they welcome me in. \n\nEvery time I come in to get something, they either don't have anymore of the food dish or they're out. I end up having to wait for me and my family's food to come out. It usually takes me 20 minutes to wait for my food.
