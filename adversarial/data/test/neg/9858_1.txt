I brought my son in on a Thursday evening. He was greeted immediately and got right in with Ralph. \nNow I have been to barber shops across the land, so can tell you; New Image lives up to their name.\nThe shop is very clean, quaint, and has a real positive energy. The environment was very professional and it was evident that the barbers were all serious about not only craft, but customer service as well.\nRalph took time making sure his (shape up)\nwas perfectly tapered and lined to perfection. A+++\nWe will be back!
