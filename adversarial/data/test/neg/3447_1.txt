Brock got to my home at 9pm at night.  Refrigerant leaking and compressor kept shutting down from overheating.  He was in the attic for who knows how long.  So friendly.  Offered him water and granola bars to keep him hydrated.  This young man left my home at 2:41am in the morning and was so apologetic that this was happening to me.  He was worried I would be angry that my AC was not working.  I was so thankful that he was so kind and willing to stay and work and be away from his family to make sure my home was comfortable.  Thank you Penguin Air and thank you Brock.
