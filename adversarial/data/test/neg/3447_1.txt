Went here on a Friday at 1:00 for lunch. It was very crowded, but we (party of 2) were seated quickly. The ambiance was a lot louder than I would like, definitely not the place for a quiet lunch. We ordered food shortly after being seated - and 45 minutes later - our food arrived. The food was nothing above average, and not what I expected for the price. We did not complain about the wait, however the manager came over and removed the meals from our bill. Even with that nice gesture, I would not return.
