I stumbled upon this cafe on my drive and decided to stop in to pick up some buns - I ended up walking out with a lot more!\n\nThis decent sized space serves as an excellent bakery and a little cafe.  I did not order anything from the cafe so I cannot comment on that aspect of this business, but it was definitely packed and lively in there.  \n\nThe bakery is full of beautiful, colorful desserts which are all decent priced. A square piece of cake, brownie or cheesecake is about $2.50. Their cinnamon buns are HUGE and will run you about $2. Everything in there appeared very fresh and the place smelled heavenly. Buns were fresh and fairly priced!  \n\nThey have a good amount of staff working so you are not waiting very long to be assisted.\n\nAll in all,  it was a great experience and great food. I definitely will be back and will make it my regular bakery stop from now on!
