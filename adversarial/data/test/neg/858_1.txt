Went here with a class at the airport where we got to sample some food. Pinkberry was delicious. Far and away the best frozen yogurt I've had. The caramel yogurt was soft and creamy, and all of the toppings I had on it (caramel sauce, nuts, oreo, gummy bears) were exceptional. The staff are very pleasant, and hand you the bowl in a certain way with palms up since the creator of Pinkberry was Korean (Korean tradition). Nice touch. I'll definitely return next time at CLT.
