The cocktails were great but the food was just so so.  The tacos are prepared to look good when delivered by they're a pain in the ass to eat - just way too much filler like shredded cabbage.   It's also not a comfortable spot - I don't mind seating that is packed close, it can actually add to the atmosphere, but here the staff don't have any room to deliver food or move around.  I don't want a waiter hanging over my table so the other waiter can squeeze by to deliver food.  The \"original\" down the street has it right, this place is trying too hard to be cool.
