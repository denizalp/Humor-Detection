This place is a riot! The staff is hilarious to watch. Most of them have major attitude problems they've never been rude to me but it's really funny watching them with other customers. The food\/ drinks are good, the wait time isn't bad depending on what time of the year\/weekday it is. The prices aren't cheap but they have pretty good product. Overall I really enjoy this place. Keep in mind it is just kinda randomly in the mall. I'd only stop in here if I was already in the mall.
