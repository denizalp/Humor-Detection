This was such a fun bar to stumble upon and now it is one of our absolute favorites! Although they do not serve food there, they do have chips, popcorn, pretzels, and jerky from the West Side Market available to munch down on. The beer selection is excellent with of course a handful of Irish favorites - including Guinness. The atmosphere was such a blast and the bartenders were an absolute joy to talk to!
