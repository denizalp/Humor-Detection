The service was great and the food was even better. I visited the restaurant for lunch and was not disappointed.  I had the shrimp and grits and my mother had the chicken and waffles, both were delicious. I was not a fan of the passion fruit lemonade, but other than that...a wonderful experience. We were too full to try the desserts, but they looked and sounded fantastic.
