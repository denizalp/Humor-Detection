Meh.  Nothing to special, except for the sushi roll we had.  Topped with Mango, super fresh.   the hostesses are lacking, Never greeted us and we stood there with all of them walking past us for 10 minutes. Mind you, there was only 2 other diners there on  Saturday 530.  we tried the ramen, not good.  noodles were still hard.    the potato crusted corn dog was oily, and the sausage was subpar, as a house special I would have expected more.  Bacon wrapped shrimp was good.  the star was the sushi roll we had, it was light and fresh.
