As someone who hates reviews that lower star ratings because of service, I'm about to go in full hypocrite mode.  My problem with this place is not the food...the pizza is good...really good.  Probably some of the best pizza in Charlotte.  But we had a groupon for this place that we tried to use at 3:15 pm on a Saturday.  I mention the specific time because unbeknownst to us, this particular groupon had some fine print saying it was good only after 4 pm.  The Pure Pizza people told us to come back at 4.  After explaining that we had driven here, parked, were hungry now, etc. they refused to budge on the 4 pm thing.  Now, they are certainly within their rights to do so but I'm also within my rights to never eat there again...which is exactly what is happening.  Used to go once or twice a month.  Oh well.  It just really bothers me that someone wouldn't use some common sense.  It's not like they were slammed for business mid-afternoon.  So we'll just go elsewhere. \n\nOh and also, when you do a build your own pizza here they do not price out each topping.  They will put a bunch of them in a category called \"$2.00 +\" which means they could be any price north of $2 which many are.  We had a pizza that I expected to be around $20 total that came to $29 because of this.  It was delicious but was it a surprise extra $9 delicious?  Debatable.  2 Pure's out of 5.
