Wow ~ I have heard so much about this place and yet with this hype I leave upset with my Husband and Son spending a lot of money and still be hungry when we left!!\nWhen we arrived it was just me and my husband. We told the hostess our son would be coming, She sat us at a table with the menu's , No one ever came over to see if we wanted anything while we waited for our son to show up.\nMy husband wanted to order a drink while we waited and nothing.\nThen after our son showed up our server comes over and we said we were really hungry, Mind you my husband and son are over 6' tall and have big appetites. She says to order the family meal for 4. We figured that had to be enough for all 3 of us. Well my son was very hungry and he could have ate this all by himself. I didn't even get much to eat but I wanted him to enjoy himself because we were there for a early birthday dinner.\nNeedless to say we all wondered if we should order more food but we decided that after getting this and spending so much on it we told the server that this was definitely not worth the money for the amount of food we got. He had nothing to say except we have a lot of people get that.\nI am serious it was a joke. A chain restaurant with so much hype that it was not a place I would go for BBQ again! \nI have to say Ellis Island has the best BBQ don't waste your money here!  This location is pretty far for anyone not living here.\nWe would not go back here and do not recommend it ~ We have had MUCH better and much better BBQ sauce.
