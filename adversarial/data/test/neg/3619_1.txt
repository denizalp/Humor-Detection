Had dinner with friends here last night. I had the steak special, which was a bavette (flank steak) with mashed potatoes and asparagus in a red wine sauce. The steak was a little chewy, but all-in-all quite delicious. I highly recommend the fish cakes. The weather was perfect so we sat outside on their very cozy veranda. Service was exceptional!
