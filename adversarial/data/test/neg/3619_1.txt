Horrible service the employees were rude. When I was going to pay there was four employees at the counter and I asked them a question to see what else they had for baptism...one of them just answered rudley \"what ever you see that is all we have\"... I stood in line for more than 5min to pay I was literally the only customer in the store and I was not even acknowledge by any of the employees. I just had to just walk out and left my things there. It was my first and last time at that store.
