3 stars because of hype and price. Was it good yes but def not what I was expecting id put it 4th out of 4 of buffets I've tried here. If your close or staying here it's good but if your picking I'd try some others first. But you can't go wrong just don't get over excited and for the price it's a little underwhelming.
