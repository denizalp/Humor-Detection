Well I was interested in ordering a pizza and chicken for deliver from here but before I could get that far the girl answering the phones was not helpful at ALL! I am visiting this area and asked if they deliver to the hotel I'm staying at. Her reply in a very friendly voice is \"yes you're just across the street\" My response was great being I'm not sure what the address is here let me see if I can find it on anything. I feel short not finding a darn thing with this places address, the girl tells me \" you can call back and we even take online orders\" and dc the call. My chin dropped before I could even say anything more. With phone service like this...I'll pass on trying this pizza place...couldn't careless how good the reviews are. Great service is more important rather its take out, deliver, or dining in! \nWork on your phone skills!
