Jasson took on the daunting task of helping two, barely college graduated kids purchase their first home. Not only did Jasson walk my roommate and I through the process of buying a home, but he also made it as stress-free and relaxed as possible. Jasson set us up with a title company right away and we got prequalified for our loan. Without wasting anytime, Jasson had set up an afternoon of homes to look at within our price range and location preferences. Jasson took us through great variety of different homes until we ultimately found the right one. That day we found the home we wanted to put an offer on and before we knew it, the offer had been accepted and we were on the road to homeownership! Jasson was referred to my roommate and I by a colleague; we will DEFINITELY do the same for anyone we come across looking to find a home and in the future for ourselves. Thanks, Jasson! You're the best!
