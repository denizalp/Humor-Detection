First time visiting this lvac. It's not bad, but it's not the best lvac out there. Plenty of machine, plenty of space, but very watered down lifters. The staff comes and tells you to quiet down if you're making too much noise, kinda like planet fitness. Didn't appreciate that too much. Also, I don't know if it's just me, but the lights are really dim. It makes you sleepy rather than ready for a workout. The facility is brand new so it's clean and the restrooms and lockers are nice. The staff at the front counter is also really nice. 3 star for telling me, I'm grunting too loud tho. Hopefully management could talk to staff about it and let them workout and focus on their workout.
