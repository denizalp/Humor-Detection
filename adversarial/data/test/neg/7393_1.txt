Got in with 40 min wait! Mind you, it was NYD, mall was closed and only 2 ppl. I always liked CF and go whenever I cross the border. Cnd loc is every bit as consistent to U.S.. Fried mac n cheese is rich but tasty,  dynamite shrimp was light and crunchy. Tried pork chop and wasn't disappointed. Thick but juicy and well balanced, nice salty sweet combination with apple sauce. Portions are big, did not need all that mash potato. For dessert, we had salted caramel cheesecake, very decadent. Simpler the better, but not too simple, white chocolate raspberry is best so far. Honestly, I go for the main meal and not for the cheesecake. CF is not cheap but worth the try. Not worth 3 hr wait unless you have serious shopping to do.
