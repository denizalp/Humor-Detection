I've been to an 800 before. Chose this because the burger place at the SLS wasn't open. I was hungry after travel and didn't feel like walking anywhere.\n\nThe staff was super friendly. The chef was as well (they sort need to be since they're practically on top of the clientele). Super good pizza, cooked quickly and perfectly.\n\nGood beer and pizza price point, too. Which was a good surprise.
