We really loved the seafood paella. Tasted great, not too salty. Service was with a smile, and always checked in on us during the meal. Great ambience, very relaxing. It's easy to loose oneself and just stay and eat even more. \n\nWe have frequented this particular PB and it's probably our best in Toronto. Great for a night out and after wearing yourself out shopping at the Yorkdale mall.
