I love my gel manicure that Donna did so professionally.  My hands look great.  It was a bit on the expensive side at $25, but I don't mind paying a bit more if the quality is there.  I would have gotten a pedicure too, but the gel manicure kinda blew my budget for the day.  I know, right? What a cheapskate I am, but I have other things to think about.  My vanity comes in pretty low on the list, but it's nice to splurge every now and then.  I will be back.  I've gotten many compliments on my nails this week, that's nice too.  Everybody likes compliments.  Thanks Four Seasons! And thanks Donna! Great job.
