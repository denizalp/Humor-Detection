Make sure when you are booking a \"Lakeview room\" that you're not on a corner room.  I am paying about 30 bucks more a night for a half cityview and half lakeview and the lakeview (which is in the far corner of the bathroom) isn't even that great.  Not happy about it.  Other than that the hotel is nice.
