I have taken both my cars to SSC Auto Repair for the last year. I am very happy with the service I have received. Like other reviewers have said, Adam is easy to talk to and answers all questions I ask him. I have talked to some of the mechanics and they also answer my questions. \nAdam is also a great resource for referrals. I needed a tow and Adam knew someone; I needed a body shop after a terrible experience with Service King and Adam knew someone.\nThank you Adam and the mechanics for your friendly customer service and honesty.
