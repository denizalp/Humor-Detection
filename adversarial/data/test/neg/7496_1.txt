The store seems to be newly opened and is located beside Suzy Shier where Fruits & Passion used to be. Merchandize stock at the shop as well as price is the same as the other The Face Shop locations at Pacific Mall, Fairview Mall and Eaton Centre. I love that the store is pretty spacious like the Fairview location so I don't have to worry about being shoved around. After visiting this location as well as the others, I most likely will not be going back to the pacific mall one again. It's simply way too crowded.
