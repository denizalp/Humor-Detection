If I could rate this location a zero star, that would be an understatement. This place deserves a negative star rating. Like minus two or three stars. This is the kind of place that needs an episode of Bar Rescue. Went there for some wings and drinks with my girlfriend. When we got there, we were greeted by a couple of coke dealers asking if we wanted coke or crack. This should've been our cue to leave, but decided to give the place a try anyways. Got inside and was told by a server who was on her way outside to pick a place to sit and a server would be with us in a min. All the tables were moved to sides to make a dance floor that nobody was using. There was a DJ in the corner by the entrance playing music so loud it was impossible to have any kind of conversation. Not a single waitress acknowledged us for 10 minutes. They were too busy talking and drinking with customers at the bar. When the server FINALLY came to take our order, I placed our order and went to the bathroom only to be harassed by ANOTHER fucking drug dealer. Ordered some wings, a glass of Canadian, and a rum and coke no ice. The only thing they got right was the wings, but that's pretty hard to fuck up since it's a WINGS place. The server fucked up the rest of our order though. I got a glass of some other kind of beer in a nasty glass. Sent that back in exchange for a bottle. Kinda hard to fuck that up you'd think. Nope. Got a bottle of blue. The \"rum and coke\" no ice was a glass of coke with ice. Sent that back and ordered a bottle of coors. No dice again. Got a bottle of bud. Sent all the drinks back, finished the wings and left. I'll never return to this location ever again.
