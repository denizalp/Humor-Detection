This place is really good. My wife and I were here during Mr. Olympia weekend and stopped by, amazing. We highly recommend the beef and chicken kabobs they are served with rice and salad, power food!! And the owner is hilarious he likes people that are polite, he'll take really good care of you and go out of his way for you.
