The restaurant on Queen Street was closed due to exhaust fan issues so we hiked over here.  The service was pleasant for the most part from all other helpers except one insolent server who took our order.  As far as the food, the wonderfully marinated single orders of lamb and higher quality steaks were amazing and what earn every star.  The vegetables were indeed weak, deep fried garlic was a tough disappointment and for the rest you get some tiny rings of green peppers and like one cut of onion.  Not worth 3 x the required every party.  The rules were overbearing.  We all ordered plenty of food with 2 single orders of meats and veggies and drinks, but \"no sharing.\"  Seriously, I spent forty dollars, let me try a shrimp without fear of reproach.  Also, if one person orders all you can eat, all have to for they fear your tablemates would mooch off yours.  This may stop me bringing a group as I'd prefer better steak cuts and there's no way I would be able to upgrade this.
