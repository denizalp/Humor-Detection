I like this place a lot. I think they have the best kebab in town. The beef gyro is also really good. They are called philly steak express because they offer other kinds of food other than middle eastern. I haven't tried any of the other foods, but that is soon to come. I have had issues with calling them at times to order food as I would get a busy tone. They may have fixed this issue now.
