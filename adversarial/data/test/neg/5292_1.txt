Garlic naan: was good, nothing special. Thicker texture \n\nMalai kofta: I asked for spicy, it was bland. Very bland. The taste was good otherwise. \n\nChicken tikka masala: also bland, mostly just tasted like tomato and sweet. Tasted like tomato bisque.\n\nNot authentic Indian food. \n\nI would not return here for the food as the pricing was expensive for what we received. \n\nHowever, good service recovery as they gave us free mango lassi when we said the spice wasn't up to our level. The mango lassi was fantastic!
