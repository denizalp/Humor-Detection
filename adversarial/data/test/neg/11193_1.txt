Visited here again. Please make sure that you order food according to your needs. Dont rely on what the restaurant guys say :) If you order more it will be hard for you to take out of ure visiting. But in case you have to take out go across the restaurant and get a disposable cooler and ice and ure good.\nAlso the kabob and seekh combo comes with rice so think before ordering biryani.\nFood is yummy and in good quantity.
