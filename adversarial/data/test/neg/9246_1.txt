Yeah, I mean, there's good and bad...\n\nThe good is that it's a gigantic sports bar with many televisions and a ridiculous amount of outdoor seating.\n\nThe bad is basically everything else.\n\nI had a blast watching the last Grey Cup here (mostly because the riders won and because the half time show was ridiculous) but I stopped in recently when a sudden craving for beer and a burger hit while walking down Ste Catherine. (And look, I'm a lady of discerning tastes, but I also love me a good sports bar.)\n\nI have never seen this before... my burger was frozen solid in the middle, and when I told the waitress she replied: \"Oh, do you want it heated up?\" \n\nUmm...yah... \n\nNow, normal protocol in this situation is that you bring a whole new plate and apologize profusely. Instead, she grabbed the remaining half of the burger, set it on a small plate, assuring us that the capable kitchen staff would 'heat it back up,' and proceeded to carry it around the entire restaurant while checking on other customers.\n\nRight...'cause that's something I want to eat now...\n\nSo, basically, the food is microwaved. It's not a bad price. But for a few extra bucks, you could probably eat somewhere serving food that has been cooked.\n\nIf you want a Budweiser and fries while watching a game, I would say you can't go wrong. But if you want a microbrew and a good burger, it's a major pass.
