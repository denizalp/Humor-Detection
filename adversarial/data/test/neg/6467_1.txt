We love this rec center. The fitness center is great, clean and has great equipment.  The hours and prices are great too. The staff is always friendly and helpful. I also love that it isn't your typical over crowded gym which is not my thing. We've also used one of the rooms for a baby shower and that worked out well and again the staff was great and so helpful. Tot town is a great bonus as well.
