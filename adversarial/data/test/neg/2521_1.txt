I've been coming to AZ Metals for a couple of years, and they have earned my repeat business. Their inventory is great, and when they don't have something odd or specific, they get it quickly and at fair prices. \nThey are extremely helpful and go out of their way to satisfy the customer. This is how a business should be run!\n\nGarry S.
