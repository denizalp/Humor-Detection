Went there for full highlights and a cut last weekend (treat yo self) after purchasing a groupon. My stylist (I believe her name was Sarah?) was so friendly and welcoming. Hair salons can be very scary especially if you're emotionally attached to your hair like I am. She was very accommodating and informative. I had previously bleached my hair resulting in a lot of damage and dry ends. Despite all this, my hair turned out amazing and is silky smooth. I will definitely be making a follow up appointment in the future
