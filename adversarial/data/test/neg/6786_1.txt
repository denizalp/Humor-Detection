My recent visit to Dandelion was the 4th time that I have been there.  It was also the last time that I will go there.  I've had better experiences here.  But never good enough to offset poor food that I was served at this last visit.  \n\nThe Good:  Nice selection of beer.  Pretty chill atmosphere.  Decent service.  \n\nThe Bad.  The Food.  The Food.  The Food.  \n\nWe started with the calamari.  Meh.  Why I keep taking risks with calamari is beyond me.  It's rarely impressive and is often has blas√© as can be. But when it's good (like at Bentley's) I really do enjoy it.  And it's something that should be pretty hard to screw up.  But Dandelion's calamari was mediocre at best.  \n\nI thought the Portobello fries sounded interesting.  I was Oh So Wrong!  I love a big meaty Portobello on the grill.  I was hopeful that this dish would have a similarly robust flavor.  It was very disappointing.  \n\nMussels are another thing that I keep trying all over town and it appears that there are only a couple of places (like the Liberty) that consistently get them right.  Dandelion's rendition was subpar.   \n\nWe finished with a dish that just had to be good - The Crab and Avocado salad.  Crab + avocado + citrus is a combination that one just can't go wrong with, right?  WRONG!!!  I was shocked at how bland this dish was.  Nothing about it was good - not the presentation, or the texture, and certainly Not the flavor.  \n\nThen today as I was paying my credit card bill, Dandelion Market gave me on last swift kick to the groin.  It was bad enough that I wasted $72 on a very poor meal.  But Why did the server add on an additional $0.67 to her tip?  Okay, maybe it was a mistake and I really don't care about $0.67.  It's the principal of it.
