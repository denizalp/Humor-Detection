Stumbled into this place before going to see a show at the theatre next door. Wow, were we ever in for a treat! We shared 5 tapas dishes, which was lots of food for 2 people. Our taste buds were exploding! Every dish had the most amazing and powerful flavour. The salad was to die for, and so were the prawns and curry sweet potato poutine. The waitress was super helpful and nice, especially since it was our first time here and the menu takes a bit of explaining. Prices are very reasonable given the quality of food. \n\nI'm so glad we found this place. Can't wait to be back!
