I purchased my Acura TL through Motorcars Acura in October of 2010.  I was very pleased with the price of the vehicle, my trade in amount, and the overall experience of purchasing said TL.  My salesman was very thorough and after the purchase, went through the car giving me pointers on the features.\n\nI live closer to another Acura dealership who offers a lower price on maintenance, so I cannot comment on their service department as I've never brought it back.\n\nWhen I'm in the market for my next Acura (NSX in 2015?!?), I will certainly include this dealership in my search options.
