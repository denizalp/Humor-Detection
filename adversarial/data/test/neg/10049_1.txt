Being spoiled by eating dumplings in LA, I was initially hesitant towards a pittsburgh dumpling house. Annnnd that was a stupid human hipster biased thought. Being nudged by a friends recommendation....this place was without a doubt great, you could see the staff making the dumplings, and they were served proper with a smile. The bamboo steam pots were a nice touch as well.
