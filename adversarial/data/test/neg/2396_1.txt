What a super little place and now the kitchen is open all day Monday through Friday. They have redone the patio right in time for summer. Inside hasn't changed too much; there is still a 7-seat bar and then several 4 or 5-top tables. Weekends are brunch only, but until 3pm. Roots maybe my new brunch go to.\n\nThe lunch menu is mostly split between sandwiches and salads plus side items. Everything sounds great. I had the capresse salad; it was beautifully presented and tasty. Heirloom tomatoes make the difference. I guess the rest of the menu is equally good. The evening fare is small bites and I intend to try them all.\n\nCoffee looks like a big seller - for the breakfast menu plus you can buy a monthly coffee subscription. They have a good wine selection plus 6 beers on tap.\n\nThe little things like getting a pitcher of water when you sit down is nice and makes the difference. The staff are super friendly and helpful.
