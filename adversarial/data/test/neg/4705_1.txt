This is by far the best bagel in the area. And I would know cause I eat bagels everywhere all of the time. This is at least a weekly stop for me. What makes these bagels so delicious? I am guessing small batches. Once and a while, if your lucky, you can get one fresh out of the oven. No need to toast these! Their egg sandwiches are pretty good as well, but mainly because of their bagels. For any other bagel place to get 5 stars from me they will have to be as good at Big City.
