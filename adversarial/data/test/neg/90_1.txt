When I went to In-N-Out Burger I was expecting an okay burger no better than McDonalds. Boy, was I WRONG! the burger was great and all the ingredients were covering the burger. The service was what really made my experience great, though. They got everything correct and read back my order to be sure it was right. The wait was no longer than two minutes and everting tasted awesome. I'll definitely be back!
