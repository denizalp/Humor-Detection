So, here's the thing...I believe that things on the dinner menu are probably more tasty than items on the lunch special. We ordered 2 lunch specials(orange chicken and eggplant) and salt & pepper deep fried shrimp. The lunch specials came with a soup, we got the hot and sour soup. It was pretty good! The flavor was perfect and the broth was just thick enough. The lunch entrees were just mediocre, BUT the shrimp dish was amazing! We loved it. The jalape√±os, onions and chives were a great touch. Make sure you dig inside those heads lol I think IF we came back, we would try more dishes on the dinner menu - it seems like that's where it's at.
