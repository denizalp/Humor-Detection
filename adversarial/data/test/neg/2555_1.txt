While visiting Pittsburgh over a weekend we stopped in for a bite at this middle eastern restaurant.  The place is small with few tables but the food tastes great and is very fresh.  My wife enjoyed the lentil chicken soup while I had a great falafel wrap.\n\nWe were slightly disappointed that they don't serve hot tea, but other than that you should stop in and try the food.
