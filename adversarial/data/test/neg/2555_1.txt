I've been bringing both my dogs to this hospital for about a year and a half.  Every time I go in, it is such a great experience. The staff and Veterinarians are always very helpful and patient with my babies. My boy Duke isn't always friendly with other dogs and for this reason the staff is very attentive towards us. I especially want to thank the receptionist Britany, she always makes us feel at ease and I see her with other customers as well treating them with the same courtesy she does us. I am sure all other customers feel the same I do...thank you Boca Animal Hospital!!
