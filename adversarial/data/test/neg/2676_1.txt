Paradise Bakery was a new restaurant concept for us when we moved to the Valley a few years ago.  \n\nI have looked into the chain and was surprised by how the corporation has changed hands a few time.  Well, you would never know from the food preparation that they were a castoff.  \n\nThe service is great!  \n\nThe food is great!  \n\nAnd, they seem to have several convenent locations.  \n\nWOW!~
