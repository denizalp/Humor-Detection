Although it's not my main grocery store, I pop in to TJ's at least once a week as it's within a stone's throw of my workplace. It's always a nice little respite, with everyone always being extremely friendly and helpful and of course I don't mind the ever-present sampling area. I've sometimes picked up a package of the offering of the day, and have tried new products that way. But usually I grab a bag of beet chips and\/or dark chocolate peanut butter cups for a delicious, not too unhealthy pick-me-up treat that doesn't break the bank. They may not be organic, but the ingredients are basic and healthy-ish without chemical additives and artificial colors, etc. At Christmas time, they are one stop shopping for amazingly low priced seasonal greenery -- wreaths and poinsettias and anything else you need or want to make a festive holiday home. The prices on everything are amazingly low here considering the high quality. Cheese, beer, wine, all kinds of grab and go or frozen, easy to make or ready to eat items. The only reason I don't give Trader Joe's five stars is that they don't typically offer organic fruits and vegetables per piece, as they do with their conventional produce. I would like to enjoy an even healthier snack like an orange or banana, but I'm not down with chemical agriculture. The organics are only sold in bulk bags or bunches. Bummer. But four stars for everything else!
