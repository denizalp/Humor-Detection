Loved the fusion take on hot dogs. I've heard of this place many times and finally got around to it! My family was visiting and we ordered a Banh Mi dog, Bulgogi dog and a large order of Euro special fries. I called ahead and the takeout order was ready to go in 15 minutes. Bulgogi dog had the right amount of seasoning and was absolutely delicious! Banh Mi dog had a nice crunch from the slaw which fit well with the saltiness of the wiener. Finally the euro special fries were as good as expected with enough sauce and cheese to satisfy every bite! The fries were also crispy instead of becoming soggy. I'll be looking forward to trying out the other hot dog selections in the near future!
