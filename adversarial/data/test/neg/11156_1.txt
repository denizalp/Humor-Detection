I am surprised at some of these reviews as well.\n\nJust returned to the states from my first visit to the lovely city of Toronto, and this was the only brewpub I was able to visit. While I had hoped to visit a more \"beery\" place, I was with my wife and mother-in-law so this place seemed to be a good compromise for the three of us. Visited on a crowded Friday Night.\n\nMy wife ordered the Thai salad, my mother in law opted for the chicken and ribs, and I went for the braised pork shank, replete with baked potato and sauerkraut. We all gave the food high marks. Not the best we've ever had, but damn good. Not a complain amongst us. \n\nMy wife and I ordered the beer sampler, and both agreed that all styles were up to snuff. After deciding that I favored the amber, I ordered a full litter mug - which for being in a big city in the heart of downtown was a great deal at $9.50. (or close to it) With a full litter mug of excellent beer and the meal I had to drink it with, I was in heaven. The three of us agreed we had made the right choice, and got a great value for our tourist dollar. I will go back here the next time I'm able to travel to Toronto.\n\nWhen I think back to my three days in Toronto, that litter mug of Three Brasseurs Amber and the Hockey Hall of Fame are what I'll remember most.
