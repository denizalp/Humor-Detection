Easily one of the better Hawaiian BBQ restaurants in the whole valley. On most days the establishment is quiet with music playing the background with low volume. Perfect for those days when you're out and enjoying the day with your own thoughts. I recommend the spam masubi and BBQ mix. Can't go wrong with either of those.
