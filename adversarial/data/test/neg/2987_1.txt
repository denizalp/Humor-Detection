I loved my experience of Lamesa's take on Filipino food! It's my first go at the cuisine, and the creative fusion angle has resulted in some pretty delicious dishes coming out of their kitchen. Super-crispy pork, tender and delicious garlic rice, and a really inventive take on shrimp and grits were all outstanding. The cauliflower-three-ways side was also very good, and the flan dessert was delightful, with a sprinkling of rice krispies that played the role of contrast to the flan's creamy custard. Overall the food hit it out of the park. I think it's an especially good example of fusion execution, because I didn't really feel like I was eating a different cuisine, but obviously didn't feel like western fare either: it sat--tastily--in between.\n\nThe service was also good and very aware of the average Canadian's general lack of familiarity with Filipino food. Everything came out in a timely way and was explained well. Price was pleasantly reasonable: dinner for two sharing a salad, side, two entrees and dessert (plus three drinks) came under $100, which is far less expensive than many other places producing similar quality.\n\nIf it's your first time trying Filipino food (or a variation thereof) I definitely recommend Lamesa! It's also just a really good restaurant with a creative menu. I will be returning to try their tasting menu, which seems to be getting a lot of good press.
