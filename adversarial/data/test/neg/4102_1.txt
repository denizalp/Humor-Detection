Typically, I love the food at Pei Wei!  However, this past week I ordered my old stand by, Kung Pao chicken and ordered without scallions or any onions.  When I received my order in the dining room, I noticed that they put scallions in it. I walked up to the pass to notify the expediters and they couldn't have cared less.  I asked them to please remake it and he said he's be right over.  It was 10 minutes before he came to my table and asked what the problem was.  By then, my kids were already done with their meal.  It was almost 20 minutes before he brought me back my food, with no apologies, no customer service at all. When I asked for a to go box since my entire family was done, he acted bothered and irritated as if I should have just ordered it that way in the first place. After all of that, when I got home it was gross. They not only held the scallions (as originally ordered!) but they also held the flavor.  None whatsoever on this expectedly spicy dish. My baby could have eaten it. I won't be returning to this location, for SURE!
