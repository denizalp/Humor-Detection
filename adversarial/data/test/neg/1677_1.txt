WOW FROM THE START!!! Great house margarita and the chips with the side of onions and pepper slices and bean dip were awesome. The service was smoking fast and it was a busy night. We got the Steak and Shrimp Fajitas for 2....... REALLY nice sized shrimp and grilled great along with the steak..... they came served on a cast iron dutch oven lid with a 2' high flame...........GREAT flavor....... voted #1 by LVRJ people........BEST OF LV. Guess what........ these are the best fajitas I've had in Vegas.... CAN'T WAIT TO GET BACK!
