The problem with Audio Express is they have sales people that are trying to make a living and the high pressure sales causes certain sales people to not be exactly forthright.  My 1at experience was with a schmoozer.  My 2nd was not.  So make sure you ask the right questions and do research for yourself.  Your OWN knowledge will help you through the sales pitches.  Over all you get what you pay for.  They have great quality audio gear.
