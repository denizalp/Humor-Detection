I'm not going to lie. I first called Boa Steakhouse on the strip to make a reservation to find out that they are closed down. The wife and I agreed upon trying out this new joint. We ate here on the 2nd day this place opened up! We made a reservation just to play it safe for 9pm. It's Vegas, no one eats dinner at dinner time now come on. \n\nWe had to call at around 8:45pm and ask if we could move it to 9:30pm as we were running behind schedule drinking and gambling too much. Brittany the hostess was very pleasant and easy to work with on the phone.\n\nOur service was perfect. We started off with margaritas and flat water. We ate like pigs starting with a salad and then the bacon appetizer. After that we had some of the warm bread with butter! At this moment, I think my wife and I were both already getting full but we pushed on with a NY strip steak and a Filet Mignon. Also, we ordered mac-n-cheese for the side Both steaks were excellent and the mac-n-cheese was cooked just right.\n\nThe margaritas were just perfect, but they better we at $16\/pop for a patron margarita.  We will be back.
