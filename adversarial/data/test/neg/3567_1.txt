As a recent resident of 2 years to leave this community, I noticed changes as time went on during my stay. Cops were more rampant in the area, loud kids outside all the time. It just became an annoyance for me to come home to my apartment. Tenants would move out and threw their belongings in the bushes outside my building. The walkways were always filthy. There was even obscene language spray painted on the asphalt outside my building so I got a message of \"fuck you\" for 2 days straight before anyone decided to do anything about. Maintenance was always the worst. I don't even think they did anything besides ride around on their golf carts. I even had to go to the office for problems with one of their employees telling me to pick up my own dog's feces as if I was just a careless owner to leave it there. Apparently the employee was talked to by the former assistant property manager \"Frankie\" about his attitude towards residents. I had another encounter with the same gentleman some months later when I needed my door put back on and was once again talked down to but I let it go because I knew I was leaving anyway. But as of today and the reason I'm writing this review is because this community robs you blind. I noticed on more than one occasion where my pet rent was adjusted without my knowledge and I was paying more than I needed to. Gee, one of the leasing consultants was able to fix this for me and get it straight never had problems again regarding that but did I get my excess money back?! No. Today, I received my final statement and not much to my excitement because I knew they would try something again, I'm being billed $1200. Apparently, the property is doing renovations but unbeknownst to me, the residents leaving must be paying for the renovations. I was charged $890 for the carpet to be replaced. Now, I may be crazy but $890 to carpet an apartment? I would think that would be more along the lines of a home. I also was charged $150 for pet treatment. My question is what are you treating for pets when the carpet gets replaced after every lease? So many questions and not enough answers with this community. I highly warn you to shy away from living here. I was robbed while I lived there from the very people I paid to live there and I'm still being robbed after I've left the property. Heed my words and don't think twice about renting here.
