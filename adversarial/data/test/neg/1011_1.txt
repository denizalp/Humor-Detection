I have been to Pomegranate several times over the years, it has become the first excuse for a trip to T.O. In my humble opinion, this is probably the Persian restaurant that I know off.\n\nThe meat falls of the lamb shank with a touch of a fork, and in case you are somewhat tired of the usual suspects, they have a special that is almost always interetsing. One last thing, service has been great every single time.
