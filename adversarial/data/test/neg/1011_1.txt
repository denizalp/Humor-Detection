Easy check in and easy return. Staff was super friendly! From check in point to the guys who takes your ticket to exit the garage, to the employee checking the car at returns. Felt like I was talking amongst friends. \n\nPros: I was in and out in a breeze. You get to pick the car you want from the row of cars. Any color and or make (in specific class you rent) and NO DEPOSITS! \n\n\nCons: none. =]
