So our night started off pretty unfortunate. We got quoted 2 hours to golf so we played corn hole and ordered drinks and food while we waited. Our golf bay was ready before our food so we asked to talk to management to see what the issue was. Gregory showed up and catered to our every need. We felt that he cared about us and did everything in his power to turn around our experience which we appreciated so gratefully. The only reason we stayed was because of him and we ended up having a phenomenal night because of him! Thanks Gregory!
