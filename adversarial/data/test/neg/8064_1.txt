The place is beautiful and the small plates quite well done, but how can the offer a lasagne Bolognese that is closer to chili with a few pieces do pasta arranged in a bowl? And since when is cannelloni a rectangular ravioli? And although the waitress was attentive, our water glasses were never refilled! Too bad because we had high hopes after we read most reviews.
