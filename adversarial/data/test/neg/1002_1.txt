Food is certainly delicious!  However, they are very very slow to refill the entrees in the buffet even before 1:00pm!  Plus I feel that a weekly price of $13.99 is too high.  Not sure if I want to go back to the restaurant because I felt that I could not return to the buffet to get more of the food I enjoyed.  I left feeling disappointed.  Sorry Godavari- great food but poor service.
