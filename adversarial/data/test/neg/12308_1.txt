Interesting place because the coffee shop really is there to support knitters! \n\nMy wife wanted to stop there to see why a couple of her friends raved about the place. Since I am knot into knitting (and probably might stab myself) I will not rate their raison d'etre. \n\nI had a mocha cappuccino. Very good & rich. Reasonably priced. My wife had an Italian soda. \n\nSupposedly they carry what is considered to be a very good brand of coffee. \n\nMy wife had an almond scone. I tasted it. Better than most I have tasted. \n\nI had a tuna on warm baguette. I thought it very good. It comes with some nice greens and a delicate dressing. Also very good. About $7.00 if I remember correctly. \n\nI number of women were there, knitting away, having fun. A warm and cozy shop. Friendly staff. \n\nAll this made for a relaxing lunch. \n\nAs you can tell from the name, porcine figurines and items are a focus.
