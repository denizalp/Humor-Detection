This review is for the Holiday Tea at Urban Sip.\n\nThe Holiday Tea at Urban Sip in The Ritz-Carlton has to be one of the nicest teas in Charlotte.  It's located on the 15th floor where you get amazing views of the city. \n\nThe Tea:\nOur server brought a tea box around and explained each of the available teas and letting us smell each one.  It was so hard to decide!  I ended up with a pot of the green tea. But there was 5 of us, so we ended up sampling each of teas.  They were all fragrant and delicious.\n\nThe Food:\nThe food is quite good. The Tea Sandwiches consisted of traditional egg salad, smoked salmon, Maine lobster (amazing!), marinated mozzarella and chicken salad. Each one perfectly made and beautiful. We also had warm white chocolate and orange scones with house-made raspberry preserves and Devonshire cream. And the desserts were mini-bites of a salted peanut caramel tart (my favorite), opera cake, a Linzer cookie, pumpkin bread and their signature Bar Cocoa.\n\nThe Service:\nThe service is top notch and what you expect from The Ritz-Carlton. Our server was very attentive even though it was a very busy Saturday. The service was also a little different from other afternoon teas I've experienced.  Images of beautiful tiered serving platters come to mind when I think of afternoon tea, but here, the service was set up as more of a multicourse dinner. The tiered serving platters was something I missed but it certainly didn't lessen the experience.\n\nI would definitely recommend the tea at Urban Sip\/Ritz-Carlton. I can't wait to do it again!
