DO NOT use this company! My experience with them was horrible, to say the least. Here is a summary:\n1. They didn't show up!\n2. They offered to clean my carpets free (I'd have to pay tax) for my inconvenience, which made them seem like a great business.\n3. They charged my card the entire amount ($126) without telling me.\n4. When I saw the charge on my bank account and called to inquire, the woman on the phone proceeded to YELL at me over the phone. \n\nSave yourself a headache and a lot of frustration!
