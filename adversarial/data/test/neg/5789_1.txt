The name says it all, fine cut meats and excellent craft beer. Went to Cleveland for the week, and made myself go to all different top restaurants but this is the only place I went to 3 times (between dinner and lunch). The lobster roll is awesome! If I ever come back to Cleveland, will make sure to stop again!
