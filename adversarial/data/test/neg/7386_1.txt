Great service but food is not for me. If you like fried pub like food, then come here. But if you are looking for something more sophisticated and pure high quality ingredients, then stick with something else.  Was a bit disappointed spending 17.99 on a meal (chicken - three pieces of dark meat, not grilled - and two sides). Don't come here if you are trying to eat healthy. It's greasy comfort food, which is fine if that's what you're feeling. We stumbled in here because it was the first place we saw when we decided we got hungry. Cute decor though!! Wouldn't go back just because I'm on a health kick and the meal was fatty. 3 stars for cool concept though.
