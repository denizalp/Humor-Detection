Daughter has admitted this is pizza with flair. I'm usually not a pizza person, but I decided if we were to order pizza, I would not go with the national chains. I called in my order before getting off work, so as soon as I left work I could pick up the food, and eat at home.\n \nSince this was a first try with Nobby's, I got the large half pepperoni, half extra cheese, and a 10 piece order of mild buffalo wings. The crust is nice, crispy, and has a taste like it's not just put into any old oven. The balance of sauce, and cheese was nice, I was almost thinking NYC style. Pepperoni wasn't paper thin, which I appreciated too.\n\nThe wings were fried to a good crisp, and the mild buffalo sauce was just a great balance of kick, and tasty, nothing to set on fire. If I do say, I think the wings might've been a little overdone, since the meatier pieces seemed to be a bit tough. And the wings were carefully wrapped which I appreciated, the drive home proved to be a bit chaotic, but the seats showed no evidence of my pizza\/wing Friday night feast. \nWill remember Nobby's the next time I hear someone thinking of pizza.
