This would have been a five star review because this lab is open nights and weekends and the woman that took my blood was so good, in her skills and also her customer service. But they must have entered my email address in their system incorrectly because I can't get my results! The app says to contact them by email, which I did, with all of the information they need to make a correction and they didn't correct it. So now I still have to go through my Dr office for results which defeats the purpose of the app....
