My first shawarma since I moved back to Calgary.\n\ni ordered a large chicken shawarma so my pita was further wrapped with a triangular piece of markouk bread. It was loaded with the usual stuff - chicken, hummus, garlic sauce, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles, beets, banana peppers, tabouli, tahini & hot sauce. Once wrapped, the whole works was toasted a bit, delivering a nice crispy exterior.\n\nI would have preferred my chicken to be carved to order from the cone and then heated in the frying pan so it was a little warmer. The frying pan didn't get the pre-cut chicken as hot as I would have liked it. \n\nOther than that minor issue I thought it was a really solid shawarma and definitely worth a return visit.
