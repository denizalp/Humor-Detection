My mom and I came on a whim and it was our first time. We felt somewhat unwelcome the entire time there. There was a sign up that said \"Please wait 2 be seat\" so we waited...and waited...and waited...the servers were tending to their tables but none of them even said hi or \"someone will be with you in a minute\" - they'd just make eye contact and immediately look away. A girl from behind the bar looked around a bit and then came and sat us. Our waitress never introduced herself (long reddish-brown hair? Had pretty iridescent eyeshadow on) and seemed in a hurry. She took our order, eventually brought out the food (which was absolutely delicious and pretty! - we ordered the smoked salmon and veggie benedicts), and then gave us the check. Not a single \"how's everything going\", \"how's the food\", \"would you like dessert\", \"would you like another drink\" - just dropped off the check as soon as we took our last bites and said, \"here you go. Thanks.\" It seems like a pretty chill place and it's absolutely ok to have a lax attitude to match that industrial, hipster environment but it still needs to be warm and inviting. I'd be willing to come back for the food if a friend invited me but I'm unsure if I'd choose this place again on my own.
