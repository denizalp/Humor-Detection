For someone who's NEVER been a fan of Indian food I've got to give kudos to this great spot! Food was absolutely fantastic and the service was excellent. My girlfriend and I sat at the bar and admittedly my expectations were low... To my surprise, the food was delicious [we ordered the garlic bread thing-a-mabobber, along with a lamb and a shrimp dish, which were both fantastic!]. Our bartender\/server, Abraham, was great and he suggested some excellent wines to pair with our meals. I'm now admittedly a fan of Indian food and will certainly be a repeat customer of this gem of a eatery!
