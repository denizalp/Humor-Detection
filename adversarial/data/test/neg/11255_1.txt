Before I moved to the U.S., and before Burrito Boyz (BB) expanded and then split, this (no longer) hole-in-the-wall joint had received 5 stars from me (but that was before the Yelp days). Now that I moved back, the burritos are still good, but things have changed!\n\nFirst and foremost, the prices have changed. no longer can you pay less than $5 for a burrito, which was one of the most attractive things about this place (I used to work by the distillery and my coworkers and i would trek all the way over to the west-end, line up in a dinky little place, now Burrito Bandidos, with nowhere to sit, then eat standing outside in the cold--that's a real five-star, no?)\n\nSecondly, my burrito experience has expanded--having eaten all types of burritos in  Boston, Bay area, London, and, Paris, I have learned that a burrito does not need all the condiments (lettuce, sour cream, cheese, guac, etc.,) to be good. A real good burrito can stand on its own with beans, rice, and meat, and optional toppings. I have realized that the steak offered in the steak burrito here is actually a quite sub-par. Sliced beef in your burrito does not give the right texture nor flavour. What they need to do is up their steak into flavouful steak tips\/cubes! \n\nNevertheless, the burritos here, drenched in their special BB sauce is still mouth-watering. If you get any of their burritos, they will put everything on there, and the burritos becomes something quite extraordinary.\n\nSo don't expect your average typical burrito, expect to have something different and let yourself have all that they offer--and you'll love this place, like everyone else.\n\nAnd be careful, their hot sauce is actually extremely spicy (woohoo!)
