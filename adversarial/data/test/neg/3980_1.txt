This is my go-to health foods store in the city and I will purposely go out of my way to shop there. They have the widest range of products and selection and 95% of the time they have the best prices too. For example, there is a type of dried seaweed that I like that Whole Foods sells for $9.99 and Herbs & Nutrition carries it for $6.99. There is no reason why Whole Foods should have a $3 markup! I will support local, independent stores, thank you very much. \n\nThey have a sale section at the front of the store (between the fridges on the left and the cashiers on the right) as well as at the end of the aisles. At the back of the store you will find some bulk bins as well as fresh produce and more refrigerated and frozen items. This store does not have a huge bulk section, but luckily Bulk Barn is not too far away if you are looking for those types of items. \n\nCome here for your teas, coffees, spices, organic goods, vegetarian \/ vegan items, supplements, herbal products, protein bars and more! My favourite thing - they accept American Express - bonus!
