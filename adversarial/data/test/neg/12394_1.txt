Reserved a Jeep online for 4 days in the 4th of July week. Pick up time 4 pm. I arrived 2 hours earlier and the Jeep wasn't  cleaned yet. Very friendly staff, very accommodating, was sitting in nice leather sofa for 30 minutes and got the Jeep ready to go and cleaned. I watched some people coming in already with a negative attitude and probably exhausted from a long flight, which might cause some negative reviews.\nAfter 3 days I wanted to extend the rental for another day and had no problems.I was very happy with service and will rent again from Ace when I get back to Vegas.
