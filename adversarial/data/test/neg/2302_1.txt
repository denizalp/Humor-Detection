Service is not bad from what I experienced.  AYCE weekday lunch buffet is $13.00.  The only negative aspect is the long wait for the sushi to come (almost 30 min).  But I guess that's sort of understandable since there is like 3 people making food for a whole restaurant.  Decent decor and spacing and cleanliness.  \n\nSushi is all very good.  I like this restaurant and would recommend to anyone.
