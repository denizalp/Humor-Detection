I've been in he north valley for about 2 months now. I've been an east valley resident for over 20 years. I met my buddy here for a few drinks today, he told me he use to love this place but stop coming due to his favorite bartender not working there anymore. Shawn was awesome and made my visit amazing. This guy knows what he is doing. This just became my favorite bar! Keep into Casey Jones you she something great here....
