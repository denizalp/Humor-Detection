This used to be a great spot to go when I was out running errands, haven't been in over a year. I was in the area and decided to pop in tonight. Complete disappointment. Ordered out appetizers and food, the male cashier was great..the female however stood around while he had a line past the door. Sat down - the table next to us was dirty upon arrival, the place was a mess, drinks spilled on the floor, & no silverware! We got our food extremely quick, the soup was cold everything else was decent. I had asked the man who served us for silverware..he never came back. I had to ask the cashier for plasticware and the table across from us ended up using chopsticks. My son had accidentally spilled his drink, it was all over the both of us not their problem I know. However, I had asked the lazy female at the front for a manager and a towel. Waited around for a manager, never ended up getting help to clean up our seats. The manager ended up being the guy who served us and never brought back silverware! He said he never brought it back because he had other food to serve that he couldn't let get cold?! So I am supposed to let me food get cold because the place has no silverware?! WTF! He offered a refund I ended up accepting because I was a little disgusted that even the manager himself was making excuses. This place has become an absolute mess, save your time and your money..go elsewhere!
