In Phoenix on business for a week and everyone said Little Miss BBQ was a must try. We arrived exactly at 11am (when they open) and the line was already 40 minutes long.  They did have someone outside handing out free bottled water while you wait which was a nice touch.\n\nThe brisket was out of this world - probably the best brisket I've ever eaten (and we've done a few BBQ towns this year...).  The sausage was very good as well but I wasn't as crazy about the pork ribs. One of my coworkers got the smoked turkey and said it was excellent as well.\n\nFor sides, they have cheddar jalape√±o grits (which were interesting and probably a must try at least once), BBQ beans, potato salad and cole slaw.
