The rude employees with bad service are ruining this brand\/location.  Second time I've tried this location and horrible experiences both times! :(\n\nFirst time, waited five minutes to have someone answer the drive through then was barked at to order.  Waited another 5 minutes, then got to the window and the person never greeted me just repeated an order (not mine).  The car in front of me drove off I guess and they were mad at me.  Asked my order and I said told them I could not remember.  Sadly, they didn't they have it? Told them never mind since it wasn't made yet after 15 minutes and I couldn't wait.  \n\nSecond time, they took my order within 3 minutes then the woman working just said \"come to the window\".  No total, no greeting - then they opened the window after about 5 minutes and said $8 something threw the smoothies at me.  I said hi, how are you just to prompt a greeting.  I said do you have straws and got an eye roll.  Even though I didn't receive straws yet.  What?!  I said \"thanks so much\".\n\nI had 3-4 smoothies a week with food in other states but, this singular location has turned me away from Tropical Smoothie forever!  Boo!
