At the end of the summer we had a swimming pool put in.  It turned out to be a gorgeous pool with low maintenance.  We upgraded our cleaning system and had a water feature put in after starting with a base model.  Joe Ayers helped us to keep our costs reasonable while helping us to add extras. Boy, did our pool turn out nice.  Even with a couple days of rain the project was finished on schedule and George kept everyone on track. Overall the experience was very good.  I'd highly recommend Dolphin for a quality swimming pool.
