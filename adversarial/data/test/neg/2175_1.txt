Ive been driving a 2011corolla S for three years and half now, after the guarantee was over, I was basically going around different stores to do maintenance and oil change and other tune ups. Last month I went to good year after I saw they had excellent reviews. Honestly, I don't think to look elsewhere for many reasons: \n\n1\/ Jim the manager is the nicest autocare technician I've known so far and like the other technicians he's extremely helpful and always recommends the best solutions for your car to fit your BUDGET. My first purchase was front tires and he gave me a great rate (lower than Firestone or big O tires, I checked), he did also a complete check up on my car in case something was needing replacement. I went last week for oil change and since I have a bent rim I told him to add a tire balance and guess what? He checked and said that my car didn't need it and that I should use that money for something else like changing the air filter that wallmart autocenter did not change two months earlier\n\nJim also gave a great deal for the  premium care package and I can feel the car's engine is more responsive and much more fuel efficient. \n\nPS: Andrew was also very kind and answered all my questions. \n\nThey hands down deserve a 5 star, best autocare center in my area.
