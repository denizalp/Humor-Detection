I've been going to this place for over a year now and it's always been ok.  However, last time I went, they have raised their prices significantly.  Then The waiter came to take our order and we told him to give us a few minutes to decide.  25 minutes later and he never came back, so I won't be back. Too much competition in the restaurant industry to put up with this!  Also the place could use a serious remodel.
