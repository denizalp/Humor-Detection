This place is very good especially considering there is no other bakery nearby except local grocery store fodder.  While this place is no Sprinkles, it has very good cupcakes and a nice selection.  Arrive early in the day for the best selection, though.  By 5pm they are pretty picked over.  My family LOVES GiGi's cupcakes.
