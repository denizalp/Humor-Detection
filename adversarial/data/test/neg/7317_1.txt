I enjoyed the overall experience, but the sushi was average. it seemed to fall apart easily, thus making it difficult to eat. The dining area itself is small, but they are quick to get you in and out. There are not too many larger booths, which makes it difficult to accommodate a larger crowd. \n\nIt is like an expedition to get to the restroom. You must pass through several doorways and hallways at which point you are pretty much lost somewhere in the back of the restaurant. \n\nOverall, i would go back im sure if a friend wanted to try it.
