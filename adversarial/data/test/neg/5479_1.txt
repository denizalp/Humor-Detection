This tour was one of the highlights of our trip. The cars are incredibly fun to drive and the canyon is beautiful. They take you to three different sites to stop and take pictures. Only one of the sites was really suited for exploring. I would have liked going to another site where we could walk around on rocks more, or just more time in general to hike. The day we went it was raining a little, so they didn't give us very much time at some of the stops, and I felt kind of rushed because of this. I understand they basically never get rain, but it was only a little drizzle, and we were on an adventurous tour. Otherwise, the tour guides are great. They provide you with gloves, blankets, and water.
