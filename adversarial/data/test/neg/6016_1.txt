Before I left Arizona, I was recommended by a friend to try this place out. The staff were very friendly, and kept checking back every now and then. Reason I gave this three stars was because the sushi dishes weren't fresh. I can understand considering they were sitting on the conveyer belt for at least an hour before we arrived. It was still good to eat, but I recommend coming when they open. Fresher the better. Other than that, their $3 Mochi was delicious. They give you two and cut them into fourths.
