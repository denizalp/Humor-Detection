Free entrance and open bar?!!?!?!? You gotta be kidding me, we hit the jackpot! Some promoters on the strip convinced us to go so we hit it up. We were just walking around trying to find clubs to go to so we had nothing to lose. It's located in the back alley behind Fatburger, kinda sketchy location. We went in and they were playing house, I was like Ooo yeah, it's on!! They DJ played great music, however there wasn't many people there. My friends and I just formed a circle and housed\/breaked most of the time, some other people would come up in our circle and session with us too. If there were more people, it'd be a lot better. I believe it's open from 2:00am until 8:00am. We came on a Thursday night, however when we came on a Saturday night, it wasn't free. I think it was about 5:00am, sun almost out, and they were charging a cover. The open bar was cool on Thursday night, however the drinks were pretty watered down. It has potential to be good, but I dunno how many people party that late. I was getting tired by 5:00am-6:00am.
