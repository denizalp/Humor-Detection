So NOT impressed. I used to love this bar, but it has gone so far downhill in service, they should be embarrassed. Maybe I just don't have the right anatomical parts, because the female bartender only paid attention to the men at the bar who were gambling. She ignored us to where we still had NO plates nor utensils for when our food finally came....and there were Maybe 15 people at the bar.  We even had to wave down a server as she was going by and she was nice enough to bring us set ups and plates. Food may be good, but they are now off my fave list. I hate poor customer service almost more than anything!
