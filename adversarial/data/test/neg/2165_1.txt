Visited on Father's Day 2016.  Assigned waiter provided poor service.  He was perfunctory, and he was non responsive to requests, even simple ones such as asking for additional half and half for our table of 8.  Long delay in food delivery, and two people received their plates 15 minutes after the rest of us.  Complaint to management went unanswered.  Food quality was average.  We are l30 year locals, unlikely to return.  The dining room was not busy.
