Food here is exceptional. Maybe a few extra cooked vegtables somewhere though. Still 5 out of 5. Was in vegas for 6 days and ate here everyday either for brunch or dinner. The only downfall was the food servers at ice cream omelette meat carvery. It's great to have polite waiters\/hosts but if the person serving your plate is slapping it on the plate with death stares and no smile, then all the great service before has come undone.
