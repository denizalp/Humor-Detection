This place is usually packed but definitely worth the wait. The food is delicious from the appetizers all the way to the dessert. Great for people with a sweet tooth. Save some money for the candy store because the candy is amazing. They also have people on standby to let you try samples of most of the candy. The special lollipops are a little overpriced though.
