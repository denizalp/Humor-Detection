This is the alley to go to if you're hard core or want to be surrounded by hard core bowlers.  It's open 24 hours.  It's next to a Hot Pot place and not far from Pacific Mall, so if you need a break you can definitely get your grub on.\n\nLike I said, there's some hard core folks.  And by that, I mean, expect to see the robo-arms come out.  You know what I'm talking about.  The parking lot here is also kinda a mess when it gets busy.  Just avoid the covered parking area and park as far as possible.  \n\nFinally, cosmic bowling may seem fun, but if you want to keep score don't even try - the strobes and neon disco lights throw off the sensors!
