For some reason, Nolen is a place that doesn't often pop into my head, but every time I've gone, it's been great!  Most recently i went with a couple girlfriends for lunch.  We were seated promptly and then the place started filling up quite quick. I love the long cushioned bench which serves as half the booth (with chairs across), but when it gets crowded, you feel like you're eating with the people on the right and left tables too.\n\nI had been eying the Coca Cola Glazed Pork Tacos since the last time i was in, and went for it. The waiter actually tried to deter me, but I probed him as to why not and it was just because he doesn't care for sweet stuff. Well, these were absolutely outstanding!  I even said as I was eating, I've gotta yelp about these :) They were sweet and savory, but not too sweet like I thought they might be and have a really yummy sour creamy drizzle & avocado on top. They are on the appetizer section and that would be the only downside - there wasn't enough to really fill me up.   Try them!!
