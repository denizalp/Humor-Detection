$52 for the dorado (entrees are a la carte) plus $10 to add a potato...I expected a more satisfying experience at that price point and left disappointed.  Food did not wow me ... server was pleasant but the staff supporting him was disorganized and inattentive. RM Seafood needs to step up their game, IMHO.
