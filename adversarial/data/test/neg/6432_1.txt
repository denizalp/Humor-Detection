We decided to give this a try because it's location and time (it was early morning)  The service sucked and the food did as well. The burger was dry and the fries were soggy. We ordered 3 burgers, a side of fries, chili fries and 2 drinks that totaled to be about $43. I wish I could have just saved my money and went to McDonald's.
