Tried a bit of everything here at Nonna! The appetizers (eggplant, tomato & burrata was my favorite) were delicious!! The main courses definitely did not disappoint (try the pastas they are all incredible) & finally the dessert of tiramisu was to die for! This place was modern & different ! the owners are wonderful! Definitely recommend!
