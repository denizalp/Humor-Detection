Initially I did not want to post a review as I did not want the word to get about about this hidden gem within the Lost nation sports park. However, I have to give credit where credit is due.\n\nFirst off- Great happy hour drink specials. Also great daily food special as well. Make it a point to go on a Monday which is their wing night. Amazing wings!!!!! Crispy and very good size certainly no small wings like you get at other places. The wing sauces are all very good. If you cannot decide try the hot garlic parmesan and\/or mild ranch. You will not be disappointed.  My wife and I have also tried the pizza and were very pleased.\n\nLastly- the service is great. They always make us feel welcome and they go above and beyond. Just the other day there was a mix up with my wife's chicken wrap order. The waitress was super nice apologized a ton and quickly brought out the correct order (Some other places make you feel so awkward and bad if something is not correct) THEN she took the chicken wrap off of our bill which we were not expecting. We were just happy to get the correct order so fast but that was really going above and beyond.\n\nAll around great place!
