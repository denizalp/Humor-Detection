I love the wraps here! They recently completed a large reno and changed the menu, and everything looks great. \n\nIf you've never been to a Freshii, they give you little clipboards so you can come up with your own wrap or salad. On the new menu, the wrap I usually make is actually cheaper! It's only 80 cents or so, but a giant wrap with chicken and tons of veggies for $9 isn't all that bad.\n\nAll in all this is generally a pretty healthy place to go for lunch, and the service is very good.\n\nMy only complaint is just how crowded it gets at lunch, meaning you can end up waiting a while for your food. This location is also very small, so don't expect to be able to find a table.
