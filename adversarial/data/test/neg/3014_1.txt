My husband and i have been enjoying our visit to Lou's diner. The food is delicious,so homemade. And the service is outstanding! Every time we visit its packed. We love listening to all the happy people..great atmosphere! The decor just made feel like i was a child again at mamas house. Brian and his crew are awesome folks. Keep it up guys,Vegas loves you.
