I have been coming to Khourys for the past 8 yrs And Issa and his staff have never steered me wrong. It is great to have a place that gets Toni ow you and also know wine and beer and does a great job matching beverage to occasion. If you need a beverage to take along to a party just give the staff your price pint and they will find you a great beer or wine everyone will love.  And with the additional bar area it is great to stoop n and have a great glass of beer or wine and catch up.
