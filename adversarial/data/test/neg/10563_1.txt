Seen these guys on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. Being a huge Philly cheesecake fan I definitely had to try them out. The chicken Philly is the best Philly I've ever had!! Make sure you have them add onions, and mushrooms. Worth the couple extra dollars. Staff is very friendly. My reasons for a 4 out of 5 stars was the seating and no restrooms. They only have two tables. There is outdoor seating by the lake for all surrounding businesses. Great on a nice day. I definitely recommend this restaurant!
