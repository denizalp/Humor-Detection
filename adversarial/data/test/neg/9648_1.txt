Really impressed! Came here for brunch when it first opened and wasn't blown away. Came back for dinner tonight and had wonderful service from Cesar. Such a nice guy! Had the hush puppies, steak flatbread and burger. Hush puppies were a little oily, flatbread was a little bland, but the burger was INCREDIBLE. Everything went together perfectly. Just delicious. Would recommend! Ask for Cesar :)
