I fractured my wrist in a bicycle mishap in Chicago late fall. \nAfter the cast and splint phases I was in need of physical therapy to regain a range of motion and muscle strength.\nSince my bone specialist was in Chicago and I was going to spend the winter in Tempe he wasn't much help on a referral.\nI looked at several companies in the area and took a stab at what I thought was the best approach. \n\nWith sheer luck I decided on DHT, mainly because of the focus on hand therapy. It was the best choice I've made this year. I've done PT for both leg and knee issues, but was surprised by the different approach used by this company.\n\nChris Reynolds initial consultation on my needs was more thorough than the information I had received by either my GP or bone specialist. \n\nWith subsequent visits I found the staff to be highly professional, pleasant, and interesting people to work with.  \n\nIf you have to do hand physical therapy this is the absolutely the best place to go.
