Best hot wings in the burgh! I've been eating there since 1996 and ignore all the nay sayers, it's just as good as it has ever been. If your aren't getting wings and fries then your ordering the wrong thing. Period. Other menu items are good but any valid review will at least contain those two items. The family that owns the joint has been through a lot. I give them tremendous credit for offering the same quality crispy wings that they have always offered, along with fries that just can't be beat.\nAnd stop complaint about the price, wings are at least $1 a piece anywhere, even the crappy ones that most joints serve. For slightly more money, you are truly getting a world-class wing.
