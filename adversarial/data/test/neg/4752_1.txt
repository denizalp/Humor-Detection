Love this place! No waiting in line because you have assigned seating that you get to choose, reclining seats, a meal and most of all grown ups only (21 over suites\/alcohol available). No one kicking your seat, talking through the movie or phone screens lighting up from texting.  Is the ticket pricey...Yes, but worth every penny!!!
