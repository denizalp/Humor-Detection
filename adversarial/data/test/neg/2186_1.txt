I am really happy with the staff over at Findlay Fiat.  I have referred several friends and family to the store to purchase vehicles.  They call their showroom a \"studio\" and it's decorated like a cool, swanky design center.  They give customers a warm welcome when they enter and ensure the customers are comfortable with their purchase.  They always have a good amount of preowned options (Not just Fiat).  Give them a try for your purchase.  The dealership is smaller than most so it has more of a family feel.
