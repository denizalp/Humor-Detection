Their animals come from puppy mills not \"reputable breeders\" as they will pretend to tell you. If you saw the condition these puppies go through before getting to their store you would never buy from there. They do not properly care for the animals. It smells. We saw a pig with painful eye infections and two puppies with upper respitory infections. \n\nIf you want a sick dog go here. If you want a dog that will have permanent behavior problems go there.
