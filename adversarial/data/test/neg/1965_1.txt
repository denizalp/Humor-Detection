Love this place! Walked in, unsure of what to expect and was so pleasantly surprised at the warm  \nand welcoming service, delicious meal and cozy ambiance. We had the crab cakes- probably the best ones I ve ever had, as well as the creole seafood pasta and the special of the day, which was monk fish- so flavourful and delicious, it was absolutely made with love. Our waiter was one of the owners, absolutely the sweetest, kindest man who was so passionate about the place, it really made us so happy to be there! Definitely will be coming back!
