The Phoenix Police Department's community relations officers are first rate.   They are everything you would want from officers assigned to build positive community relationships.\n\nI met with a team of three officers headed by Sgt. Spross and I can not tell you how impressed I was.  Officers Gary Nelson and Henry Smith are top notch assets to Sgt. Spross' team.\n\nIf you have neighborhood security concerns or you believe there is something not quite right with the way Phoenix PD is relating to your neighborhood... Do not sit home and feel let down... Call Phoenix PD, ask for their community relations officers and let them set things right...\n\nIn my case, I simply had to take advice they had previously given to the property manager before me... We have to do our part too!
