Kevin from Shake It Up! is probably my new favorite person! He tended my wedding this past Friday and my guests were talking about him as much as the wedding as a whole! He did an AMAZING job handling the long lines and heavy drinkers! He was so much fun and just easy to talk to and communicate with even before the event itself. Please, please, PLEASE consider Kevin and Shake It Up for any Bartending needs!!
