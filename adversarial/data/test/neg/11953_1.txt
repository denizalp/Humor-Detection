Close to work, so i end up here quite often.  The service is quick and friendly which helps when i am in a bit of a rush for lunch.   I usually have the Chicken Caesar - cant take a big set of ribs for lunch now, can i?  crazy place to go before any major event at the Bell Center, they usually line up from all the way out side.
