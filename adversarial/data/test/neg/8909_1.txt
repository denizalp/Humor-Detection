My wife and visited this cheesecake location earlier today for lunch....what a fiasco! Waited almost 50 minutes for food.... because waitress forgot to turn in our order......when my chicken salad finally arrived....wait for it... wait for it....it had NO chicken. For this I got two \" sorry about that\" from the waitress and no apology\/acknowledgement whatsoever the the manager??
