I've eaten here for lunch twice in less than two weeks. What a great menu for lunch. Today many of us in our party of 9 had the Steak Au Poivre which was excellent. The brandy cream sauce was very light and the steak was cooked to perfection. The Caesar salad was delicious with the light traditional dressing. One of the lunch specials last week was Caesar salad with blackened shrimp that was mouth watering delicious! My only complaint is that the wait time for the food may be a little longer than average, but overall this is a great restaurant re-do. I was also a fan of Central Bistro. Tom was our waiter both times and he's very good at his job and keeping his customers happy and satisfied. Great selection in the background music; totally fits in with the ambiance. Looking forward to trying happy hour soon.
