I have been to other locations and I believe location is the only reason I can't give this five stars. I am working a conference here and had no idea it was in the Rio so I am pleasantly surprised and it makes my stay more enjoyable! The food is just as good, and just as impressive as other locations. The BLT bloody Mary is a must have but watch out, it is pretty spicy!
