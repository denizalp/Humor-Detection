Let's begin with the wait time, we waited in line for approximately 10 minutes. Which is actually not bad at all. They were quick in getting us our food so we were happy because we were also quite hungry. Our waitress was kind of rough around the edges. Not friendly and difficult to understand because she not only had an accent (nothing wrong with that, I have one too) but she also talked very fast. Nonetheless, she was prompt and checked on us several times. Now let's get to the food, I ordered the Tractor something lol I don't remember the exact name. It came with two eggs and then you had several options of what to finish the plate with. I got potatoes and french today. My fiance ordered the sage chicken and waffles. Both had a lot of food! Neither of us finished our food. The French toast was really good, it was topped with a banana cut in half, walnuts and syrup. The potatoes were good too, maybe a tad more salt. The eggs were very bland, definately in need of salt. My fiance liked the waffles and find out he wasn't a fan of sage. He did say if he liked sage, the food would have been great.
