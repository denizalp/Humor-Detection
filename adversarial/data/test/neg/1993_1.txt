My friends and I were excited to visit this botanical garden. We researched so many things before going to Montreal and this place was always recommended. So we gave it a shot. Once we got there we realized that their grass is not taken care of whatsoever. There's a lot of weeds. That was the first thing we saw that was bothering. Botanical garden can't even take care of their grass?! Come on bro! Second, practically all the exhibitions were closed that day. We didn't even get a warning at the ticket booth\/entrance. A lot of exhibitions were under renovation or just closed. Third, there was confusion getting back inside the greenhouse. The security didn't let us back in through, so we had to go through another main entrance. Overall, this botanical garden sucked.
