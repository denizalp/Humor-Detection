Very patient, I'm very picky with my cuticles and have a specific way of cleaning my nails. Peter accommodated to my needs and the hot stone massage was on point. First time coming here I waited the full 2 weeks to write a review to see if the nails lasted and they did. I'm glad I found this place.
