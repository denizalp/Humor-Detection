I walked in here because I had lunch near by and wanted something for dessert after dinner that night. It's more of a commercial bakery than a walk in one. The front of the store is very small and the back was huge and very busy. They had all kinds of pastries the only one I recognized was the baklava. I ended up ordering what the man behind the counter suggested after he got off the phone. When we tried the cake it was interesting. It tasted like rose water, very strong rose water. I could finish the whole slice and the half I ate was delicious. My partner devoured the whole thing. It was called baklava cake and it was good, might be better if the flavour of rose water wasn't so strong.
