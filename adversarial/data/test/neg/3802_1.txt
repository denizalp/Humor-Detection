Today is the perfect weather for a cold treat and it also happened to coincide with the soft opening of Dear & Fro so I decided to drop by to check it out.\n\nI ordered the Blueberry Bingsu ($10.55) which consisted of a mix of strawberries and blueberries on a mountain of shaved ice, sprinkled with a little injeolmi (soybean powder) and topped with a scoop of strawberry ice cream and a small chocolate marker. The bingsu was just ok. The ice cream was your ordinary supermarket variety. The fruit was fresh but I found the shaved ice to not be as fluffy as the one from The Cups and after the initial top layer of injeolmi was eaten, the shaved ice was fairly flavourless. Sizewise there is only one choice and the size here seems to be almost the same as (if not smaller than) the small cup size at The Cups but the price is much higher.\n\nThe space, though is nice and it would be a good place to hang out with friends. However, given that The Cups is opening another location in Markham soon, I probably will not be returning here.
