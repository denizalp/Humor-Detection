Probably my favorite korean restaurant in vegas! Whatever you order here is great..kalbi, bbq chicken, chicken katsu, tofu soup, etc. My favorite is the bi bim bap in the stone bowl. I like it better in the stone bowl bc of the savoriness it adds and i like that it makes the rice a little crispy. And it comes with traditional korean banchan....Andddd all for ten bucks! Need i say more...
