I was soooo excited to come here, because I'm a huge, I mean HUGE food network\/Guy Fieri fan. For starters  I was very disappointed with  the service I mean it really sucked :(  . Only because we had to ask twice for our ice tea, and the server Christopher  seemed to forget about  us, we felt totally ignored . After waiting for what seemed an enternity, are server decided to bring our food, which took forever. The flavoring and seasoning of the food was okay, not much to my liking and didn't even bring a smile to my face once! I don't know if my expectations were too high, but only because I love Guy I think he deserves a second chance.!
