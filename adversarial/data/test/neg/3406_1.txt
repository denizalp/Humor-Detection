Food:  4\nEastern's Taco Y Taco is the exact opposite of Tropicana'sTaco Y Taco and not in a very good way.  Although they serve the exact same food and the same price, Eastern's serving\/portion sizes are substantially less than Tropicana's.  The staff here are less friendlier too.  Snotty is a more appropriate characterization.  Customer service sucks worse than an inoperable vacuum cleaner.  I've been here twice and my second visit was worse than the first time.  Although Eastern is way closer to me than Tropicana's, I'd rather drive to Tropicana's to really enjoy all that is best from Taco Y Taco.  Suffice to say, the 2 star is for the staff and the customer service.  This Taco y Taco spot took over what was once Republiq that took over another establishment whose name I don't remember.  All the previous occupants were short termers and didnt last, and  Eastern Taco Y Taco is deemed\/doomed to follow the same fate!
