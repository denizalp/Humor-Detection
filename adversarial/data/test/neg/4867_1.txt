My first encounter with Hot Taco was at a Yelp event in South End, I was immediately hooked! After the event I've dined at Hot Taco several times, the atmosphere is great!  I love Tacos, specifically Chicken Taco's they have good flavor and nice crunch (I must say the taco's have never been as good as the first time). The super nachos, guac and corn are really tasty. \n\nI would recommend Hot Taco for a visit, the food is good, the atmosphere is great and the drinks hit the spot.
