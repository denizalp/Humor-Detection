I've been to La Casa Rasta twice. Both times I've had the jerk chicken burrito. It is one of my favorite choices in the mex\/Caribbean genre. What distinguishes la casa Rasta from its peers is the freshness and unique flavor to the food. I also recommend the queso dip, guacamole, and plantains. The service has also always been exceptional.
