I haven't visited A Comedy Club in YEARS!!! This was my second time visiting The Comedy Zone, of course I had a wonderful time. Tonight Deon Cole from Blackish was performing!!! His stand-up brought the entire room to trears!! HILARIOUS-Loved It. I went with a Meetup Group so there were about 90 members there. Overall my experience was great,
