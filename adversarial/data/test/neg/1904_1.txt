The only jeweler I've gone to for more than 20 years. When I became engaged, my fianc√© and I wanted something Celtic as he is of Irish descent and I'm of Scottish descent. The rings Rod came up with were gorgeous. He took the basic Celtic knot but presented it in such a way as subtle little hearts went all around the rings. You won't find a better jeweler.
