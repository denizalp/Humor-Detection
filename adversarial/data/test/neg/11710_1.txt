I don't even know where to start with this review about Little Miss BBQ. There are many many 5 star reviews of this place so mine will be another drop in the bucket, but I do want to point out some of the things that people are upset about and see complaining about on the negative reviews.\n\nI want to start by saying that we had an extremely positive experience here. We had arrived at 1015 AM and there was roughly 15 people in line already. We got our ticket and walked around the outside, took some pictures and took in the whole experience. Around 1045 I believe they had people start lining up in order of the tickets they had. We got in line and waited.\n\nI get it. The wait isn't for everyone. Not everyone wants to wait an hour plus for food, so we got good information from the owners. They are planning to open a second location, which should have drastically shorter wait times. To us though, the wait was absolutely 110% worth it. I'll tell you why.\n\nWhen we had arrived at 1015, the parking attendant was very kind and talked to us and was very helpful in helping us know how everything goes down, where we need to be, and what we need to do when the time goes. The smell of the BBQ is invigorating. My mouth was salivating and I couldn't wait to get my mouth on some meat!\n\nMaybe some of the people who left negative reviews already started out with a negative view because of the wait but if you take everything in stride, at least for us, it was more enjoyable. At the same time, we had some great company with an older couple in line who did BBQ competitively and knew the owners from the competitions. Talking to them helped make our time go by quick! When one of the guys came out and started to get on the megaphone, to me felt more like a fun and playful thing to do to make the waiting less tiresome. The line of people responded well and one lady won free pie! \n\nAfter the megaphone deal, there was a countdown to open the doors and we had a good time with that. Again, not everyone will have the same experience, some people just want to go somewhere eat, be left alone, and leave. If you are that type of person just don't come here. Go to Texas Roadhouse, sit at the bar, eat and then leave. \n\nOnce the doors opened, the misters turned on and immediately we cooled down. It was very nice that they had ice cold water for us too while we waited in line. We didn't experience the water running out, and while yes it would be nice if someone kept an eye on the levels, which I am not sure if they do or not because every time we went to get water, there was water in there, I get why some people are upset about it. At the same token, are people that afraid of mentioning the water is out? Just ask. I'm sure they would just refill it.\n\nDo you see where this review is going? I haven't even spoke about the food yet but want to give you a clear picture of what to expect from this place. When we got closer to the door, there was a neat rock stacking challenge which we were able to win because we stacked 13 rocks high. The prize you ask? A free smoked pecan pie. Free or not you should get it. It was terrific. I couldn't quite cut it with a plastic knife and fork so I just lifted it out of the aluminum and started to bite into it. The smokiness is just perfect. Not too much to where it distracts from the true flavor, but just enough that it kisses the pie every so slightly. The buttery, creamy, savory filling contrasted by the light, flaky, airy dough, along with the nice bite of the pecans on top made for an awesome mouth feel and flavor explosion. \n\nWell now onto the part where we got inside. The guy who was cutting the brisket in front gave us a piece of fatty brisket to try before we ordered and that in itself for me would have been worth the wait. They don't overachieve here. They let the art and skill of smoking come through before any seasoning or sauce can interrupt. Little Miss BBQ has perfected this recipe. The meat is tender, smoky and seasoned perfectly. Any illusion of time was erased the minute that meat touched my mouth.\n\nNow I would've been happy with just the food, but everyone and I mean everyone on that staff made the experience just that much more special. We were greeted with smiles along the way of the flavor journey and nothing felt fake. Everyone seemed to love working there and unlike some people we didn't feel like they were begging for tips. It felt genuine, like they really cared about the product, the people, and the sense of community. \n\nAs we sat, the owner came by to check on how everything was, chatted it up for a bit, and the owner's wife came a bit later asking as well. It may be a rarity now days to speak to the owner of the establishment, but it gave me a sense of community. No hierarchy. No one is better than anyone else, everyone is treated like family. \n\nWith such a great sense of community and beyond excellent food, there isn't any reason to not go here.
