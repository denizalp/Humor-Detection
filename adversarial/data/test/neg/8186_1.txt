Needed my exhaust pipe in my Jeep Wrangler re routed away from my transmission. Surprise Muffler did a great job. After getting my jeep back I checked my exhaust and it looked good. There was one area where I needed just a little bit more clearance and I took it back in and they got it done and did not charge me extra. The price to get this done was very reasonable compared to other shops. I would recommend them.
