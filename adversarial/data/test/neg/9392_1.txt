Soooo . . . As my child gets bigger and he goes from the size of a football to a boy who needs to jump into my arm for me to be able to lift and hold him, it crossed my mind perhaps he was now too old for the AZ Science Center. \n\nGlad to share that this is sooooo not the case!  My son is 7 now and just this week, I've taken him twice to partake in Snow Week where for the past week, they've special activities planned for each day. \n\nThe two days I was there, there were tons of special activities on the daily schedule and these special activities were so well planned, my son and his friend enjoyed participating in them so much that both days, we spent minimal time on their permanent exhibits!!!!\n\nWhoever was in charge (maybe it was a team?) of Snow Week did an absolutely thumbs up (both thumbs up in fact) fanta-excellent job!  Both my son and his friend enjoyed the science experiments on the first floor theater, the making of mini bobsleds out of giant spuds (Idaho potatoes) then racing the, down mini sled tracks, mini ice hockey (ice frozen on cookie sheet then min ice hickey sticks made from Popsicle sticks and pucks made from penny covered with electrical tape)- genius. My son and his friend played for almost an hour with this simple contraption!\n\nScented balloons were a big hit, as was making the gingerbread house. \n\nAside from the special activities, my favorite section (see, and I'm a grown up- I think) LOL. Big kid at heart, that's me- is on the 2nd level where the kids can hands on learn about mechanical properties. All of us (including me) can spend hours there going from one hands on exhibit to the next. \n\nThe permanent exhibits are an added bonus. Why do I say that?  Because they usually have a special exhibit or special activities planned that you can spend your whole day doing those!\n\nI'm really looking forward to see what's next after Snow Week and now that I know how much fun Snow Week is from going this year, next year I will be taking my son for sure and plan on being there from open to close!!!!
