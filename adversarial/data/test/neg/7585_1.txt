My husband and I come here constantly for the amazing food! Hands down the best Italian \n\nMy issue is with our HORRIBLE server Anthony.. we asked him what he he special was and he lied and they said they were out.. that was a lie.. I called him out on it after hearing another server telling his table about it and how good it was.. after that he completely ignored us, never checked if we needed anything.. you would think out table didn't exist .. WORST SERVER IN LAS VEGAS!  Our busser was amazing and attentive and we tipped him our sever was an A$$hole
