Dilallo is a great burger joint for your quick fix. Unlike Belpro's, you can expect a tasty burger that isn't too greasy. The service is quick & simple just like the food. Though it didn't blow me away, the food was a good value and portion. I left satisfied. Additionally, I can't ignore the staff being very friendly & hospitable.\n\nBottom line: I won't go out of my way to get myself or others to a Dilallo, but I mark it down as a \"safe bet\" if ever the option comes up again.
