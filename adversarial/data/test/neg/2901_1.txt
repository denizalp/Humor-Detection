Up until a few months ago, I didn't realize that there were tours out there for adventure travel enthusiasts. I've only been on leisurely-style travels, so I am long overdue for an adventure vacation.  \n\nSo imagine my surprise when I stumble across the Adventure Travel Company, on King Street West. This store is right beside MEC and across from Europe Bound, so in a pretty good location to attract potential customers. They are quite a few travel specialists, when I walked in with my friend, we were approached within three minutes asking if we needed help.   The place wasn't overly busy, but there were a few people in there.  \n\nThough we were quick to be helped, the lady wasn't overly friendly. Once I told her we were just looking, she probed into where. I mentioned that I had already booked an adventure vacation with GAP tours, and almost immediately after she left.  No more questions!\n\nWe picked up a ton of brochures, I didn't realize how many companies there are out there for adventure travel. It's actually quite amazing and exciting to think about.. I flipped through the brochures and there's just so many exciting tours. From Europe, Africa, Asia and South America, the sky is the limit! \n\nThis is a great place to pick up information and get the wheels rolling as to where you want go\/what you want to do.
