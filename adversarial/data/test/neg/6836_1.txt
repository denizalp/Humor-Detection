This place has been here forever (perhaps I exaggerate), why have I never walked in?! Because the second you walk in, you will smell the greatness that is freshly baked bagels. And while I have a tendency to stick to those oh-so-delicious Montreal bagels, this place has to be an exception. You can literally SEE the bagels rolling out of the ovens and straight into the baskets you get them from. Although I was hoping for a BLT, this wasn't an option, so I got the tuna salad with cucumbers instead. I honestly don't think it would have mattered WHAT I got, because the bagel was the star of the show. I will definitely be returning again!
