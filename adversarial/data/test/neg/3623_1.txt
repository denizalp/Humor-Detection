This place was super good for the price and all the crustaceans they had to offer. I must have only stayed at the crustaceans section. I did not even venture off to see what else they had. The sushi was pretty fresh and tasted awesome. It is a must if you are into seafood. The price of 40 bux was not bad per person. You basically get what you money is worth.
