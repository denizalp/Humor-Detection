I found her to be very responsible in the adoption process.  I completed an application, and she interviewed me prior to approving me for adoption to ensure that the dog would be a good match with my lifestyle.  She was very candid about the dog I was interested in. She also gave me the contact information of the person fostering the dog so that I could ask more questions. She also has adoption events where you can drop by so that you can have an opportunity to meet with several dogs which I found helpful.
