Don't worry, my mom and I went to Vegas and ate at the same restaurant twice. I know what you thinking...\n\n1) How cool is it that you went to Vegas with your mom?!!? (took her for the first time ever for her b-day)\n\n2) There are so many fabulous places in Vegas- why eat at one twice!??!\n\nThe answer is that it's cute, fun, has lots of yummy menu items, lots of yummy desserts, good service, fancy decor and most importantly: was able to seat us on a busy weekend!\n\nTIP: Order the turkey burger sliders- they are hands down the best turkey burgers that have EVER had, ever. \n\nGood view of the Bellagio water show from the seats in the front.
