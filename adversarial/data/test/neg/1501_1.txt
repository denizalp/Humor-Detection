My wife and I went to this store to purchase a new cell phone.  We had a person start to help us but when an employee came up to buy something for themselves, he left us saying we would get somebody to come over and finish up.  After waiting and waiting a new customer came up and was immediately waited on.  No one ever came to help us finish up, so we left.  I did tell the Manager about this and he offered to help but at this point we were and are completely finished with Best Buy.  I can now understand why they are in financial trouble.  We went to Costco and got a better deal and much better customer service.
