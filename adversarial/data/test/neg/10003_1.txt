Visited here for breakfast during a short trip to Toronto - it was near my hotel.  Really lovely, diverse menu - I had a hard time deciding what to eat.  The food was great and ingredients seemed fresh.  Had an amazingly attentive and sweet waitress. Coffee quite good. \n\nOnly downside: decor.  The exposed ceiling looked gross and asbestos-y.
