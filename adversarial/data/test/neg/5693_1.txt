I usually frequent Superior Pho, another Pho place around the corner, but I wanted something unusual and ventured into the restaurant. The atmosphere was nicely decorated, and the restaurant owner was personable. We got a vermicelli bowl and a pho soup, and the service for both was really fast. The pho was not nearly as good as that of Superior Pho, but the vermicelli bowl was really nice. There was just enough tang in the sauce that lifted the flavor of the entire dish, but kept the freshness of the vegetables and the fried spring roll. It was a slow Tuesday afternoon for the restaurant and I was in a bad mood, but the restaurant owner was respectful, but did not over-compensate. The decor was a bit old and dusty, but nice.
