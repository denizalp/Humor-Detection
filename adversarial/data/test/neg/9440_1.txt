Looking for some good BBQ  or other awesome yumminess! Go to The Dixie Pig  in Rock Hill or Tega Cay! The one is RH is small, but the food is amazing. Tega Cay location is large with a full size bar. Help local business thrive!! After ordering many times from RH, went to TC location last night and the servers are great and the manager came out of the kitchen to check on every table! Service with a smile! The 1\/4 chicken white with Alabama White sauce and the BBQ hash are amazing! I've never had anything that was fabulous! Mac and Cheese is just like from grandma's kitchen.
