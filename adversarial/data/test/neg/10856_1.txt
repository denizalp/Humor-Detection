Authentic Chinese Food,\n\nLocated in China Town, very spacious inside, tables are round and family friendly place. Kids are welcomed and little kids get a booster seat. \n\nFood was delish! We ordered too many things and i don't remember all the names but muscles were soo good, the lobster is the BEST Lobster i ever had in my entire life. You choose the live lobster and they cook it fresh. \n\nAaaahhhh what a good life!\nIts GREAT to be alive!
