Another great experience with dodge electric this time we had the opportunity to work with Jim! He responded very quickly to our inquiry and came out promptly to address the issue. He took the time to explain the issue and how to avoid it in future which was very helpful! We will continue to work with dodge electric as they have only ever been amazing no matter the issue or questions we've had with our older home.
