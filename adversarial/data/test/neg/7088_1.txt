It's a post office. It is probably the hardest post office ON EARTH to find. Well, to be fair, I have been to many post offices here in the U.S. but not world-wide, so it's the hardest post office in the country to find. \n\nIt is too small and covering too much geographical area, aside from the fact that it is NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND, so it has many challenges it must face serving so large of a customer base. I buy my own labels, discounted of course, online and package at home (or in the car in a pinch) and therefore don't deal with the line or the TINY counter for people to use to pack their parcels. There is no bin (too small for a bin to be out) for already-paid packages so you just leave it on the counter in the far right after walking through the third set of doors.   \n\nWould it kill them to have some signage so you can see from Decatur or Oakey that a USPS office is here? Apparently it would. I must have driven around (and behind) and around some more this post office for over half an hour looking for it the first time I came here. It is pretty ridiculous. It actually cannot be put into words so I will take a few pictures to let you decide. - E
