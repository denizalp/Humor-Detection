I only made this account to say how horrible\nThese places are.  Almost everytime\nI go I get doctors who know nothing. Literally a preschool student could do their jobs. My Doctor didn't know what I have and presumed to\nPrescribe me meds.  He said I guess if this doesn't work to come back to him. Never I'll go to the mayo clinic.  Not to mention the medical assistant was a bitch.  She needs to re evaluate her attitude.
