This little place is really just delicious. We arrived around 10:30 (opens at 11) and we waited well over an hour. Best bbq around here for sure. Worth the wait. The staff is super friendly and helpful. We ordered: 1lb of brisket, 2 sausages, 1 pecan pie, a chopped brisket sandwich, 1 two meat plate with pastrami, fatty brisket. Let me tell you, every single thing was delicious. Make sure to give yourself plenty of time to wait for your food. The line is mostly in the shade and they have cold water for you while you wait. Highly recommend.
