Love this independent old school diner right downtown on St Catherine's street! It's been lovingly maintained, the staff is wonderful: last week I had this classic, quick, kind professional waitress, the kind that makes you feel like they've been taking good care of people for a long time and you're in good hands. \n\nThe burger is pretty rare even if you ask for medium, that's just how it goes here, so if you're worried about that then ask for well. But you can trust that the meat is fresh, as is the bun and veggies. And the curly fries are tasty. And you can grab a cold beer and an amazing meal and watch the city pour by.
