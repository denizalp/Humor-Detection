Came here for Halloweekend and, I would say it's an \"OK\" club. Definitely not your Omnia or Jewel Night Club but still Located in an Upscale hotel (Encore). \n\nMy group on the first day arrived around 11:30 PM at night, past our guestlist time and on the second night at 12 Midnight, way late for our comped table. Both nights, we got in without any issues.\n\nThe wait to get in wasn't long. The most probably took about 15-20 minutes which is extremely short on a Holiday Weekend. Check in isn't too crazy. Quick and easy, especially for the girls, security never seems to give us a hard time.\n\nThe way they set up Surrender, is actually where Encore beach club is located. They entirely cover the pool and put a white tent, so almost everything is covered.  There are two bars in the entire club. One basically on the dance floor on the right hand side right when you enter and one in the very back of the club. Guest list gave all the girls two drink tickets, which is always enough for me because I can't drink to save my poor soul lol. The drinks I have in vegas are always good. \n\nThe dance floor is always jam packed. No matter where or what club you go to, the dance floor is steaming hot and hard to get through. But in the very back, there was so much room to dance, you didn't have to be in the exhausting crowd. \n\nThe girls bathroom is super small, but it rarely ever got busy. The lines weren't out the door. The Hispanic Woman working in the bathroom, was beyond rude. I tipped her a dollar to use her lotion and she quickly assumed I stole a dollar. She went through all her tip jars and made sure she put all her earning away and gave me a disgusting look. I was beyond annoyed at the situation but I just went on my merry way. Definitely not worth my time. \n\nMy favorite part of Surrender was the theme. Alice in wonderland was the theme and they had the entire place decked out with mushrooms and clocks and the entire staff was dressed up as some Character from the movie. \n\nMy experience there was a success and I had so much fun! I would probably go back depending on the DJ and if I had guest list again.
