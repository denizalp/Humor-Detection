My realtor suggested I contact Robert from Wallick & Volk for a home loan. I was very disappointed with the way I was treated by this broker. He was very nice in the beginning, returning my call on a weekend, but after that initial conversation, I only heard back from him twice via a phone and always when he was on his way to somewhere else. He was very hard to reach and most of our contact happened via email or through his secretary.\n\nI feel that I was given erroneous information about my ability to qualify for a loan in the first place and the pre-qualifying process took much, much longer to complete than it should have. Even though I got all of the necessary paperwork in, despite having a death in the family, I was told the process was delayed because I did not submit everything required. That was simply not true. The broker did not even understand some of the submitted paperwork, because he kept saying we did not have a sufficient down payment, which we certainly did. My husband even double checked our available funds. In addition, he was very rude to me during our final communication. If you are looking for a knowledgeable, helpful, and trustworthy broker, go elsewhere.
