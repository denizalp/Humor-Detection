The 2 star rating is for the service I received not the food. 2 of us went on St Patrick's day to check out PDQ because they were offering $1 Mint Oreo shakes. We walked right up to the counter and ordered a 3 piece chicken strips, a grilled turkey sandwich and 1 chocolate peanut butter shake and i mint oreo shake. Well before I even put my change away my food order was up, but not the shakes.  We waited 7 minutes for our shakes, by that time our food was no longer hot. We got 1 napkin on our tray. The chocolate PB shake was not blended well and had a huge blob of chocolate at the bottom. The grilled turkey sandwich was very good. If I did go back I would skip the shakes, not worth the wait.
