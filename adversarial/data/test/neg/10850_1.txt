Had a fantastic lunch here today.  A bottle of Cakebread chardonnay, wedge salad with incredible blue cheese dressing, creamy clam chowder and an amazing Vermont Cheddar Burger on a soft bun that was out of this world.   It brought back a lot of fond memories from when I lived in Chicago right next door to the PJ Clarke's on North State Parkway.  Thanks for a memorable lunch.  I'll be back because I can't wait to try your oyster selections.   :)
