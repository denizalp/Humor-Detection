The worst customer service ever!! I had a coat getting altered and they messed it up and tried to blow me off for several days. The lady just tried to give me my coat back and say go somewhere else and the manager has no managerial skills at all. It took me to tell them I'm going to call the news and take u to court to get my money back..which the manager tried to give me store credit first.and as I was leaving another customer had same problem with management  ducking and dodging to take care of the customer.very very poor if I could give negative stars I would.
