I must update my review.  I decided to receive a sew-in because I wanted to give my hair a rest and well 8 weeks wouldn't be so painful.  Jasmine did an excellent job.  She exceeded my expectations.  I've decided to keep my weave until at least May or June 2017 that is how natural it looks. Of course I receive regular maintenance, every two weeks and my take downs every 8.  It is worth it.  This hair looks like it's growing out of my head and my own hair remains extremely healthy.  So by the Summer I can flaunt my own natural heathy hair on a hot summer day.  I've seen these young women at LA Extension master their techniques over the pass 11 months.  I am thoroughly impressed.
