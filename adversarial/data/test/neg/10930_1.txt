I really hate to leave 3 stars, because the food and drinks at this place have always been phenomenal. However, the place is usually a strange atmosphere because of how empty it tends to be. Furthermore, I paid $40 cash on a $23 bill. Our waiter, who was very polite, did not bring my change. He didn't even ask and I never said that it was all set. He felt entitled to give himself a $17 tip on a $23 bill.
