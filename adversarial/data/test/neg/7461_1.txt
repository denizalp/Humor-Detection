The lady employee was at the door on 9\/12\/18 around 10:30pm,  saying store is closed because system is down. She could've make it as manual transaction until their system is back to normal. I used to work at retail store and that's what they're supposed to do.  All I need is a light bulb for my headlight. So, bad customer service, didn't even try to help.
