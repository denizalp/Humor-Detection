I have cycled a lot of places over the years including Lifetime, 24 hour, Mtnside, Studio 360, Madison Improvement, Core Balance to name a few. Below is my review of Forza. \n\nPros:\nBikes are nice, and likely really preferred by cyclist who road ride. \nThe owner is a kind lovely woman\nStudio is clean and well kept\n\nCons:\nThey leave florescent office lighting on the entire class (not traditional to cycle classes)\nThe music was not loud like traditional cycle studios, nor was it current music\nThe energy of the teacher was rather low, not very motivational\n\nFinal thoughts: \nThe bikes are not typical spin studio bikes, so if you are used to normal spin studio bikes these might take some getting used to. If you are a road ride enthusiast this is the studio for you, if you prefer the inside traditional cycling \"spinning\" type class, this is not for you.
