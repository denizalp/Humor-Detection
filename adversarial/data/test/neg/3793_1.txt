Today was my first time here and it was pretty freakin bad. I got cold brew and a crepe with Nutella and strawberries. The cold brew was so bitter and horrible that I couldn't even drink it. I got my crepe and it came cold, with a disgusting amount of Nutella on it. The strawberries were covered in basil, which I really dislike and they didn't inform me of it. I will never come here again and I think it's really, really over hyped.
