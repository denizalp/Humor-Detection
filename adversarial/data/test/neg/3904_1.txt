Hooray for Cheskie's! We came here one evening after getting kicked out of Ana's, and the service and the pastry were just what our shell shocked little souls (and tummies) were needing. The woman behind the counter made us feel immediately better when she told us that both she and her father have also been thrown out of Ana's. We let her recommend and choose an assortment for us, and everything was really great. My favorite was the giant poppyseed triangle-shaped cookie thing. The cheese babka were really great, too. Thank you, Cheskie's!
