On Friday, April 14th I needed a letter from Sun Income Tax.  You can only imagine how BUSY they were with the tax deadline being on Tuesday.  Although Robyn was EXTREMELY busy, she wrote up a letter for me in between clients and sent it to me right away so that I could get some business done.  I want to give her a shout out because she went above and beyond that day to help a client.  Thank you Robyn!
