After having heard many stories of how much fun my friends have had at Topgolf, I was really excited to finally get a chance to play. We had gone on a Saturday afternoon so there was a little bit of a crowd, however the wait time to get a bay was much shorter then I expected. The cost at the time we went was $35\/hour; since we were splitting it 8 ways, it was very affordable.\n\nOur bay was on the second floor towards the end so we got an area with a table and couches. My only qualm with this was that it was a little bit uncomfortable because we all had ordered food, and we felt that it would've been easier if we would've had a high top table and chairs (I wonder if you can request a bay that has that?). The great part was that our waitress was on point in getting us food & drink refills quickly & made some good suggestions. The price of the food was about what I expected & everything we got was tasty. I recommend the smores!!\n\nIt's a good thing that we were just playing for fun because the scoring system is a little awkward. Sometimes someone would hit a really good shot and it would not go into one of the scoring zones so they're get 0 points & the next person would hit not as good of a shot but the ball would keep rolling and land in a high scoring zone. I'm not good at golf so I didn't have high expectations for myself. I thought lowest points normally wins in golf anyways, right?\n\nAll and all, it was a really good time so we'll be back!
