This is the 3rd time we've been here, and just like the others I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt also. I swear, we pay the same price for the 2 entree from this location or the one on Silverado and Maryland. So I don't understand why this place is so stingy with the food. My fianc√©'s plate of teriyaki chicken and orange chicken looked like they gave a half ass scoop. This is why I don't like the drive-thru. It's convenient, yes but if they're gonna continue to put a half a scoop of chicken then there won't be a next time. I'll just make the extra drive to the other location. Why give them my business.
