Worst experience in food other than at Fran's restaurant where a cockroach crawled across the table top. Ho Jan's chicken dishes were doughy, the pineapple tasted like it was soaked in alcohol and General Tao's chicken tasted like General Tao's death. The only good food items was the steamed rice and spring rolls. Your local mall's food court has better tasting Chinese food than this garbage. I wouldn't feed it to the raccoons.
