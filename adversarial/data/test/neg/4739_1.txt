Great food, as good as the Lakewood location. Nestled in a busy collection of stores, restaurants and a movie theater, the place is comfortable and clean. \n\nThe shish tawook wrap with a side of hot sauce is one of my favorite meals anywhere. Baba ganoosh and tabouli are favorites too. Any salad that I've tried has been fresh and delicious. I'm not much for desserts, but friends like their offerings. \n\nI've always had service that is just right - checking the right amount of times. A great place to eat or take out.
