I had the chicken with poutine. It was my first time trying poutine, and I'm so happy I listened to the yelpers. It was delicious, portion was pretty big too. The restaurant was busy but the line moved quick. We got the pasteis de nata to go. They were also very good. Wasn't an issue for us, but we almost didn't get a table. I would definitely return to this spot!
