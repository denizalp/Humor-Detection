Update as of 8\/18\/2017. Quality of food has gone down the tubes except for their great soups and clean salad bar .. I can understand thr increase in prices . I'm ok with that . But the service really sucks on some days . Pot luck I guess . Smaller portions ? On some orders .. But the prime rib is not as good or as thick as it used to be . Sadly, I cannot recommend Jokers Wild restaraunt any longer . Gambling is still fun there .
