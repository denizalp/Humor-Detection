Great food and service here. We found this place only because we were looking for pet-friendly restauramt and hopefully with choices of vegan and\/or vegetarian food. So here we are at this nice restaurant that serves some vegan food and a nice patio for my four-legger kid. He definitely likes this place because he was served with a fresh bowl of water as soon as we got here. We are definitely coming back again for breakfast or lunch. :)
