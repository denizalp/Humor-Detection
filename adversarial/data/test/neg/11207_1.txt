Imnot a donut connoisseur by any means, but I really loved this place. I stopped in to pick up  donuts as a thank you to a business that went above and beyond for me. (Shout out to Endurance Truck Accessories) When I stopped in, saying I was a bit overwhelmed would be an understatement. There were so many fun choices. I let the staff pick and went on my way without getting anything for myself, but those fun donuts were on my mind all day so I returned the same afternoon and picked up a half dozen to take home; this time I chose wisely. I also couldn't resist the maple bacon bar. This salty sweet concoction has converted me into a donut fan. I have since stopped in numerous times just to grab a maple bacon bar after my weekend hikes. It hits the spot! \nThere are so many choices that I do recommend a few visits to find your favorite.
