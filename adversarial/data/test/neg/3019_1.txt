O.M.G.\n\nLet me start out by saying your search for the perfect salon is over. Ohh, Flict, I love you. Infact, let me count the ways:\n\n1. Your staff (everyone from the receptionist to the hair gurus in the back are personable, down to earth, friendly, and adorable. They treat you like a human being with a dream hair cut instead of a number. \n\n2. Your motiff is beautiful and a breath of fresh air. You are not a typical salon, you are much more than that. The atmosphere is relaxed and close knit.\n\n3. Your products smell amazing. \n\n4. Your stylist Tanya, is a doll. Best scalp massage Ive ever had! She paid VERY close attention to what I was looking for and delivered wonderfully!\n\n5. You are a small business, and I respect you whole heartedly.\n\nMy appointment was on time, my stylist was so friendly. Everyone there loves eachother and its adorable.\n\nDo not go to any other salon, ESPECIALLY NOT Toni and Guy.\n\nFlict, you have earned a client for life. I will.be driving from Glendale to have my brown tresses trimmed by you and only you.
