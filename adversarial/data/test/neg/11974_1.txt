I just popped in this weekend to get highlights while on vacation with my mother and I had THE BEST experience. George was amazing! He listened to exactly what I wanted, meticulously applied the color, gave me a fresh cut and was incredibly knowledgeable about the dangers (or lack three of) of getting highlights while nursing. I left feeling like a new person! Did I mention he entertained my one year old son and we laughed nearly the entire time!? Well we did. It was so much fun. I couldn't recommend visiting the salon or George more highly!
