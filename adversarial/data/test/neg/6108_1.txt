It was great to see Jaye. Their place is amazing! We love local IPA craft beer and theirs is up with the best in the valley. We had a flight(6) plus an extra (they were already sold out of 3 since opening day on tue!) the three that were memorable to us were Frontside which is their west coast IPA and it was a smooth citrus hop. Midnight run which was not as sweet as your typical coffee stout but still had a hit of chocolate. The Mijo was amazing it's a triple IPA (10.4 abv) and you could really taste the peach and mango flavors. I wish them all the best this place is great!
