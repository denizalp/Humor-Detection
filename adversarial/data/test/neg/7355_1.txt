We were hesitant in trying DC Steakhouse because of the recent negative reviews, but our experience here was fantastic. We didn't make reservations, thinking it wouldn't be that busy on a Tuesday evening, but to our surprise it was packed when we arrived. The ambience is nice and upscale. Like another reviewer mentioned, it's a bit dark and a little loud, but that didn't bother us at all. \n\nWe ended up sitting at the bar for about a half hour and enjoyed a few drinks while we waited for an open table. The bartender was sweet and made a few recommendations from the menu, so by the time we got to our table, we were ready to order (and starving!) Our server, Spencer, was attentive from start to finish. Our glasses were never empty and our plates cleared promptly. As for the most important part, the food: both my husband's steak and my blackened salmon were cooked to perfection and mouth-wateringly delicious. My husband said it was the best steak he's had in years. Our side dishes were excellent as well. I had every intention of enjoying a dessert here, but there was no room for that this time.\n\nIt was an enjoyable meal and we will definitely be back. My advice: don't let the negative reviews scare you away!! Also, there's a Groupon special going on right now. Just purchased mine :)
