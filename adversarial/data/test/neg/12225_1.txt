If you're a fan of hot dogs and you haven't been to JJ's, what are you waiting on?\n\nThe service is friendly and helpful, and the place is clean and inviting. You order at the counter when you walk in and then they'll bring the food to your table. \n\nThey do have beer options available, including draft beer--and they have drink specials throughout the week. \n\nFood is delicious, there are so many options and unique flavor profiles on their menu. The sides are just as tasty as the dogs! There is also a weekly special and they offer daily specials--including $2 dogs on Tuesday!
