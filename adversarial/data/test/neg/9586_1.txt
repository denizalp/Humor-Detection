I adore La Piccola Cucina.  I love it on so many levels.  The food is fantastic, the location is great, the owners are awesome people, and they have some great imported items.\n\nWhen we first came here I was a little weirded out by the way everything was displayed, already cooked.  The owner kindly explained everything to us in his big booming voice.  Once I got the idea, I promptly ordered myself meatloaf along with the potatoes and orzo.  YUMM!  The meatloaf was incredible.  Hands down, it is the best meatloaf I have ever tasted.  Even the husband like it, and he doesn't like meatloaf.  The potatoes were well seasoned and quite tasty.  I'm not really sure what orzo is supposed to taste like, but it sure was good.  I got a pomegranate soda to go along with my meal and it was delicious imported stuff.\n\nAfter a bit of eating the owner came by and sat down to chat with us.  Usually I hate when managers\/owners come by and bug me for extended periods of time.  In this case, I loved it.  The guy feels like family, like my great uncle or something.  He's so incredibly passionate about food that it amazes me.  One time we were there he was talking about this amazing vinegar that he had imported and he was so excited about it that he cracked open a new bottle just to have us smell it.  I love that guy.  Hopefully you will be lucky enough to happen upon him singing opera sometime.\n\nI'm so glad to have La Piccola close by.  It truly is a wonderful place and a wonderful experience.  I feel bad for the girls who came here and didn't have such a good time, I really hope that it was just an off day for them.
