Decided to stop here for lunch. First off, good luck parking. It was very busy and no tables were available, so snce I was by myself I just sat at the bar. \nI ordered the tavern philly with fries. It's a simple order, true, but it was very good. And simple as it seems,  some times it's difficult to find a good philly. I will be back next time I'm in the area to try some other tavern treats. Maybe next time I will be able to get a beer. They only have about 8 on tap,  but there are a few I have never had.
