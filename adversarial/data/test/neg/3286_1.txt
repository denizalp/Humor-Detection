We found this little gem when we asked Siri to tell us about local restaurants while we were visiting Arizona. As we first walked in we were greeted by Tony Casanova!  incredibly friendly owner of the place whi shook all of our hands and asked for our first names. When we told them we were first timers we were greeted like family and served like royalty. This place is top notch and if we lived here we may be here every week highly recommend it! Had the best time and felt truly blessed to have had the experience.
