What a great dealership! Stopped by out of the blue because I was caught in a pickle between the RAM 1500 and Toyota Tundra...Grifan Fair, the sales guy who helped me out, was phenomenal and made my experience worthwhile...I think I am going to go with the Tundra because of that 10.5k towing capacity (compared to RAM 1500 8.5k). I would never have known that and other stats it if weren't for Grifan's exceptional knowledge. Great guy great dealership!
