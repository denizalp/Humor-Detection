Stopped in here so a bite to eat and the veggie subs that they have are great so did not have to wait at all. The sandwiches artist was very attentive to us and reconfirmed the order as he made it. We had to indulge on the chocolate chip cookies too. And then after we ate we had to go back for macadamia nut chocolate chip cookies for the road. Great clean store too
