Never again. Review just fro the breakfast buffet. The variety of  food they offer is so few that I wouldn't bother calling it a buffet. Their omelette station was nice but that was it. Everything else felt like it was left overs and if you are not a fan of pork or beef- there is not much to choose from. It was so pathetic that a guy sitting next to our table had 3 cups of oatmeal and 3 plates of fruits, because nothing else was edible.
