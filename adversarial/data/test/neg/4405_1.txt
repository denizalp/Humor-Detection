I have been with State Farm for nearly 20 yrs.  Although the company as a whole is good, my local agent, Cie Taylor is very unsatisfactory.  So much so that I switched agents recently.  I was usually unable to speak to her when I called, having my questions redirected to a subordinate who usually could not answer my questions.  On the rare occasions when Cie did return my call, I found her aloof, dismissive and arrogant.  There are too many other State Farm agents in the area to tolerate this kind of treatment.  Choose another.
