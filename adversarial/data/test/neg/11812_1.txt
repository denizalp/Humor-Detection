Went with a group of ten. Service was flawless. My wife had the priscutto pizza and I had the pasta\/sausage dish. All were awesome. The pizza was very good and pretty large. Can definitely be shared. My pasta dish was pretty darn small for the money in my opinion, but delicious. Everybody said their food was good as well.
