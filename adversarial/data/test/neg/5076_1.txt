Intelligentsia coffee, good baristas, good tunes, nice atmosphere.  All around a good spot. Definitely has the feel of Intelligentsia cafes in Chicago, with a little more of a Midwestern rustic twist of some sort.  Drinks are always pretty spot on and tasty.  Can't vouch for the food, only had the coffee.
