I stopped by this hospital to do a drop in tour as a prospective employee, I didn't announce who I was when I signed in; I was given a tour by a house supervisor who was very friendly & honest about the history of staff, building and services offered. I was impressed by the interactions I witnessed with pt. care and staff. I have been in this industry for 8 years and have worked for multiple companies and I can say Promise Phoenix LTAC in Mesa AZ. is very bright, friendly and attentive to pt care.
