Love the concept and great atmosphere. Showed up last week at 5pm and already had a 2- hour wait. Great bar and tv's to pass the time. Only complaint was our waiter could not handle the bay's he was responsible for. Waited awhile for food and drinks. One time we just went to the bar directly to get drinks. \n\nCool concept though we will be back.
