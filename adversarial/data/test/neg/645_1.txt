First of all, the inside is super clean and organized. They have beautiful cakes on the walls where you can see their talent. The ladies working there were also very fun and bubbly and were a pleasure to talk to. I was just there to pick up my birthday cake and WOW was I impressed! It was absolutely gorgeous and EXACTLY what I wanted! I will definitely come back and order more goodies!
