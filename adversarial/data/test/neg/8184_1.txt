Worth the hype and worth a wait. Line wasn't too bad at 1pm, but they were cooking more sluts. Told it was about a 30 minute wait. So figured it was a good time to head to the chandelier bar for a drink. About 15 minutes later, Marlon came over to the bar to tell us our food was ready. It's great customer service that warms my heart. The egg slut was tasty, but the biscuit with honey butter was out of this world. Thanks eggslut, and thank you Marlon.
