This place can be compared to joyride. It is not the best place for tacos, though it was filling! The chicken tacos with guac and lemon are quite tasteful. Although, the customer service was far below expectations. The waitress looked at my party as if she hated her job. I had asked for water and was handed a cup with lipstick on it because \"they had to wait to get more glasses because they were all dirty\". One of my guests glasses also was stained with what it looks like milk in the glass of WATER they ordered. We also ordered seconds on our drinks and never received them. Also one of my guests had ordered fish tacos and had to wait until the check arrived in order to get his tacos. Even the check took way longer to be received after everyone was done eating their food. Over all it was not very sanitary nor customer friendly. Defiantly not going to celebrate my next birthday here.
