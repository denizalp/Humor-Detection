Drove to Surprise for lunch today and tried Saigon Kitchen. I had Firecracker Shrimp and Wife had Pho. We started with some eggrolls for an appetizer.\n\nThe Firecracker Shrimp was outstanding and I really liked the garlic noodles that they came with. I ordered a bowl of Scallion Broth and it was delicious. The salad that came with it was basic but the dressing was very good.\n\nThe eggrolls were not the best we've had and we actually didn't finish them. Not bad, just not the best I've had.\n\nMy wife said the Pho was just mediocre and the Pho places in Goodyear are better.\n\nWhile we won't drive here for Pho we will be back for the other items on the menu. The place is a bit spendy but the atmosphere is nice and the food I had was very good.
