My girlfriend and I always have our Sunday brunch. This time we decided to try this place. Catchy name, we immediately loved it. There's a sparkling trendy atmosphere as you walk in. I was afraid for the waiting time but nope, we got seated right away. Yeah! Mimosas are great, they serve them in a cute little cylinder-shaped glass, be aware you're gonna need another one soon. Ask for a straw. As the precipitate of the orange pulp sits on the bottom, shake it a bit to taste both the orange and the champagne. I didn't get our waitress's name but she greeted us as we sat down and took drink and food orders with a smile. That's the attitude I want to see. (Always) But let's get down to the food part: we both got French toast. My girlfriend the stuffed banana and Nutella and I got the chorizo maple one. Divine! I thought they would come with eggs but I guess you have to ask for a side. We'll be back to try the eggs and other amazing dishes!! ;)
