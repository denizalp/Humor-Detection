If you are like me and look at reviews prior to visiting a new establishment, know this.... These reviews are exactly what you need to determine this is one of the best places for Chinese in the Valley! I ordered multiple items off their menu and unlike other places, every single item I ordered exceeded my expectations substantially. I am sure anything ordered from here will leave you saving their phone number in your phone for future orders. They are very friendly and their courtesy seems genuine rather than scripted like major chains we all know. You can tell there is a sense of pride in their craft and it shows through the quality of both their food and service
