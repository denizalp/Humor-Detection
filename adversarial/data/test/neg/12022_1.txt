This is a small family owned business. Not sure that they have better prices than competitors but they are a lot more accessible. I was able to visit the store after work around 4:30pm weekday, they open until 5pm. I was able to see options for what I needed and the actual colors for cloth napkins and tablecloths. They are in Scottsdale, delivered to Fountain Hills Saturday morning and Picked Up on Monday. I rented round tables and white chairs with napkins and tablecloths. Great people and great service!
