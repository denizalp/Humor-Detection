Stayed here from 10-13 April 2015 to celebrate my wife's birthday.\nRoom was nice, but cigarette smoke came through the A\/C vent and caused wife's Asthma to act up badly.\nFound woman's shoe behind curtain when we first got to the room.\nConcierge service was excellent!\nOutdoor Gondola ride: Luca is the best Gondolier!\nIndoor Gondola ride was nice too. \nAte at Zefferino's and it was perfect!! 4-course meal felt like 20 course meal, the food was that filling! \nHated the fact that smoking is allowed in the Casino.\nYou must get up early and go see the Gondolier's going to work, it is really a fun and wonderful thing to see!\nMadame Tussaud's Wax Museum is great! Touristy, but worth the price of admission! If you have kids under the age of 14 then you must take them there!\nI asked housekeeping for a larger robe and she brought me the same size. I found out the next day that they only have the one size, I think she misunderstood me.\nThe pools and hot tubs are fantastic! No pool is deeper than 4ft for safety reasons, but you can still lap swim if you want to.\nAll-in-All a wonderful stay.
