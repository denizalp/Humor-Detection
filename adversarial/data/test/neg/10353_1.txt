Worst chicken and waffles. Chicken was like a big chicken strip that was way too crunchy and felt like it came out of the freezer. The strawberry waffle did not have fresh strawberries which was surprising for the price. Do not waste your money it is mediocre and over priced. Drive to Scottsdale and get Lo Lo's.
