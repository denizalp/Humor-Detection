My friend Rachel and I came for lunch on a random Tuesday and the place was pretty empty. I always feel like Old Town looks so tired during the day, like it's nursing a massive hangover from the night before. We wanted to make the most of the gorgeous weather lately and opted to sit on the patio. As we had already stopped by Sprinkles on the way there, this was definitely a lost diet day. We split an order of the nacho fries, which were sooo gluttonous. The fries were perfectly cooked, and smothered with cheese sauce, pico, and guac. The portion size was pretty small for $10, but that probably worked out in our favor because we could've demolished an entire platter. I went with the Dakota bowl for lunch, and I think it knocks Chopshop bowls out of the park! The base was brown rice and quinoa, and it came with super tender marinated skirt steak AND grilled chicken, grilled peppers, broccolini, avocado, and one of the best chimichurri sauces I've ever had! It was super fresh and tasty, and had a little bit of a kick. The serving size was definitely enough for two meals, and I love that our awesome server brought Sriracha without me even having to ask. Rach had the roasted turkey sandwich, which she thought was just okay. She wasn't crazy about the aioli that came on the sandwich. They also had a Groupon available, which was a huge plus. My only complaint was that their cocktails were priced at $15, which seems a little high given that most of their lunch items are less than that. Service was super quick and friendly; I'll definitely be back!
