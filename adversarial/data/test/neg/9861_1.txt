We've been here 3 times and the menu has changed. We were told the chef changed twice over the past 3 months. This time we were disappointed with everything. The chorizos was not comparable to the original dish that was served here. The green beans were as good as they were the first time. The service was good but the food not so good. Wouldn't come back.
