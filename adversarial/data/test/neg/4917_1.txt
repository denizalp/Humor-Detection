Not to long ago, I was referred to Dr. Santucci. My four front teeth had braces when I came here. My two canine teeth were sideways rather than coming down properly, their purpose was to create space so my canines would come in. My front teeth had been straight and closed together. Weeks later when we came in for an x-Ray to see if the canines were coming down they were, we were making progress and I was ecstatic. I really didn't want oral surgery! A few weeks after that we noticed my teeth separating from one another. We came in and got yet another x-Ray where we saw the teeth were headed straight up again. He told us he had never seen this before and didn't know what happened. He then left with no explanation of what will happen next. I am 12 and have had braces for more than two year, and I am only in \"phase 1\". I'm expecting at least 2 more years of braces or equipment in my mouth. Now, I am headed for oral surgery where I will have my canines removed. :(
