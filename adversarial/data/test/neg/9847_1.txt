Hands down the best vegan pizza I have ever had. As a vegan for over 10 years I cannot recommend Pizza Heaven Bistro enough. I tried the vegan agave BBQ pizza along with the vegan soysausage sub. Both were unreal out of this world amazing. The service was also incredible. I was immediately greeted by my server Sean. He assisted with drink recommendations as well as answered any questions I had about the pizza. He made sure to keep our water full as well as ensuring we had everything we needed. Seriously, go try this place now.
