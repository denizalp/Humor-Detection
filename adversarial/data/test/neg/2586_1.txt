Yes!! If you are in the area, this is the place to go for some amazing food! It looks small and the plaza looks really non engaging but I always say, never judge a gem by where it's buried! ;)\n\nThe staff here are the friendliest people ever. Happy people making happy food! The price is amazing and the portions are fantastic! They make it all to order so your food is always fresh off the flat grill and they have a variety of sauces too like the yum yum sauce! \n\nMy top recommending is the short ribs. You should see how much comes with an order!! Delicious to the last bite :) the rice is a Japanese style rice that tastes and feels very unique. Simple yet very flavorful. I really appreciate that everything is not full of sodium so you can actually taste the food for how it should taste.\n\nGive it a try! Sit in or grab some take out! Absolutely worth it. This is our go to spot for the weekends
