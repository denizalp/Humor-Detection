Lots of local produce, meats and cheeses. Definitely cheaper than Giant Eagle!\n\nAs a college student on a budget, I really appreciate Food Peddler. They always have specials and a friendly staff. Since they are new, they are still changing all the time. When I first started going, they didn't have a grocery section. However, that has since changed and they've got isles of tasty treats! My favorite section is in the back where they have soup and dip mixes and lots of packaged local snacks like dried fruits, pretzels, popcorn, trail mixes etc. Great to take with you when you're busy at work or school. They also have cameras throughout the store and in the parking lot, which, as a young woman, I do appreciate.\n\nGive this place a try. You definitely won't regret it, especially if you like local foods and fresh fruits and veggies.
