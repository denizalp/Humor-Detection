Owen's bagels is by far one of my favorite spots in Charlotte. It was the first place I came to when I moved and I still go there about once a week.  It's a favorite spot of my triathlon team and we go there after practices to refuel.  Love the South End Special.  If you like places that feel unique-- that you can't find in every city--then check out Owen's.  Definitely a staple of Charlotte!
