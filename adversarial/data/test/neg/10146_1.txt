This is a great place to unwind and sip on a well crafted cocktail. Mind you, the cocktails are about $20+ each, but in my opinion they are well worth it. Took my mom there to get away from walking for a bit. She ordered a Lemon Drop & I had the Midnight Stinger (which is on their menu). They were both so elegantly crafted. They were strong, but not strong enough to to not be able to enjoy. Very tasty!
