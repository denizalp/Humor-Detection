The view is beautiful.  On a sunny breezy day, sitting on the patio overlooking the golf course, is fabulous and relaxing.  But the food is really not special.  I ordered the bruschettas. I'm not a big fan of hard bread.  Never understood why people would enjoy the razor sharp edges of the bread.  This place served one of the hardest bread.  I dare say the atmosphere is much better than the food.
