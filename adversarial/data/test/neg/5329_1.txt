My husband and I frequent this place; we go once or twice a month on the average.  Gaetano's is great Italian food with an excellent wine list.  Best of all, Gaetano's is in our neighborhood!  The food has great flavor. Meats are always served to our desired doneness. Seafood and poultry items on the menu are juicy and tender. Pasta is cooked al dente while the sauces always make me want to lick my plate clean!  I love listening to their specials although you can't go wrong ordering from the menu. I recommend the burrata, the baked artichoke stuffed with Parmesan (an occasional special), the mushroom soup (also a special) and caprese for starters, the Mezzelune di Vitello con Porcini for pasta, and the Ossobuco alla Milanese for your entree, the tiramisu for dessert paired with THE cappuccino (not the regular one but the owner's own recipe).  Then again, like I said, you can't go wrong with any item from the menu.\n\nI most especially like the feeling that the restaurant exudes.  You can certainly feel the welcome from the family that runs the place. The service is very personal. Nick who is often our server, treats us very well.  I also enjoy small talks with his father who is usually the host for the evening when he comes around to the tables. The floor plan and lighting make you feel cozy. It is not too small as to constrict you nor is it too big that it loses the intimacy.  I can come in shorts and flip-flops or in a little black satin dress and I'd be fine.  They send you a gift certificate for a free dinner to celebrate your birthday which is redeemable within your birth month. They often email you discount coupons too.  Occasionally, the restaurant will have set dinner menu pairing events hosted by wineries which are well worth the price because they are often generous with their pours and with pour refills.\n\nFrom appetizers to desserts, Gaetano's is a hearty meal for its value. You pay not only for the quality and the decent sized portion of food, but also for the service, and the ambiance.
