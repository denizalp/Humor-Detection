I got the spam musubi to snack on. The sticky rice was nice and moist, and the spam was cooked to perfection , and the inside sauce it came with was uniquely tasty. I liked the little atmosphere in there. Small and cozy with Hawaiian music in the background and friendly service.  I'll be back for sure.
