Today was my first adjustment but I can already attest to the level of care + service at Omni! I've been to several chiropractors in the last 7 years, but none that provided the care that Omni does. I cannot tell you the last time I felt this good, even immediately after an adjustment, and I've been back at work sitting all day. I'm excited to finally be on a treatment plan that will help get my back and neck where they need to be and I'm so glad that my boyfriend is going too! Awesome front office staff, great doctors and incredible treatment. I couldn't ask for more!
