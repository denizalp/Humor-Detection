This was one of my favorite Indian restaurants in the valley for awhile, but since they stopped doing lunch buffet, I don't think I'll be returning. Only 2 waiters working during lunch rush made service very slow, took 2 hours for lunch when it should take no more than 45. Food quality is good, but during lunch people just want to get in and out quickly. During dinner this would be a good place for a sit-down meal. I feel prices are a bit higher than other comparable places.
