This Is Not A Fake Review.\n\nI am sorry for those that had an unpleasant experience with this company, here is ours.\n\nWe arrived for our nuptials in Vegas. We proceeded to our original rental company rhymes with (Tire Cry).  After 20mins of trying to rent a car, the rental did not go through. The guy behind the counter suggested this place.\n\nWe walked over, were seen promptly by an extremely pleasant and professional man named Manny. We were out in less than 15mins.  Manny explained everything we needed to know and didn't try to sell us anything we did not need.\n\nWe ran downstairs, grabbed our rental and hit the streets.\n\nWe returned our car on Sunday at 6:00 a.m. And I was charged as specified.\n\nWe will definitely use this Car Rental Agency again....
