I live 30+ miles away from Sun Valley Stereo but they are the only place I will take any of my vehicles for electronic upgrades. I have had a touch screen dvd player w\/ satellite radio, subs and an amp all installed by Ryan's staff. They are very knowledgable and will go out of their way to make sure you are satisfied with your install. Never do they try to upsell or get you to buy anything you don't need, plus they offer affordable prices. The box they built for my subs sound GREAT and when I had my amp installed in the trunk of my car, they built a box around it to make it look nice and flush with the trunk floor without me even asking! That's what kind of quality and care you can expect from these guys. It's nice to have honest people, who know what they're doing that you can trust to get your ride sounding good! I can't wait for my next installation! Thanks Ryan and Staff!
