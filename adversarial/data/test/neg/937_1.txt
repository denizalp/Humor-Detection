I enjoy this store. Town Square is a fun place to hang out and the Apple Store is always ready to fulfill your inner-geek needs.\n\nI recently went in for a broken IPhone screen and they replaced it for free. It took about 1.5 hours to fix so we strolled around Town Square while we waited. Once it was ready, the pick up process was quick and easy. We even had some time to try out the Apple Watch in a few different flavors. The store has quite a few demos that you can wear and get a feel for which one you like.\n\nThe staff is always helpful and super friendly. I haven't ever had a problem with service at this location.\n\nDuring the holidays this store gets packed so get your Genius Bar needs out of the way before then.\n\nI've had quite a few items repaired here, since I'm an IT guy and they've always taken care of me. I appreciate their willingness to help and work through any problems that arise with their hardware and software.
