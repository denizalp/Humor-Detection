When you are sick, you go to the doctor. My older car was dying and I had to go to Dr Auto for the correct not 2nd opinion, but 3rd. Every shop has to say something different. But the techs led by Nick found the real problem. Did it take time and money, yes, but you have to make the investment. These guys are great. Thanks Nick and Brian for a job Well done. And I can't forget Steve for shuttling me back and forth. I love the great service and expertise. Thanks Dr Auto!
