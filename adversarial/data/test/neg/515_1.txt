great service. good food. fun and causal atmosphere. prices are fair. portions are huge. lots of creative offerings. also! great location with easy and ample parking. not a busy shopping center or mall. no idea how Zipps or Uncle Bears stays in business the places like The Hub around. glad we stopped by. thanks Hub.
