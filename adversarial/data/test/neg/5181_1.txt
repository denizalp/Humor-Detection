Went here last night and I'm impressed that if you don't like something,  they take it back and replace it. Turned out nice because the potato soup was gritty and my original margarita was spicy (which I wasn't expecting). The pasta was really yummy and the kids devoured the pizza. The drinks left a little to be desired, but a few tweaks and they are good. I'm very disappointed they got rid of their tiramasu because that was the reason I selected to go to that restaurant. I waitress was ok, maybe new to the industry as she complimented every single one of our selections (which was kind of odd) and started handing us our bill before we were finished with our meal. It was ok, but I don't see myself rushing to go back.
