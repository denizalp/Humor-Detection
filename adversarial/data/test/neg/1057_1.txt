Please be aware: the serving sizes here are Ginormous! So share most items - - including the side salads unless that is all you're getting.  Hummus is super good (and I'm pretty picky on this front).  Though when getting a wrap (I got the chicken version at the Waterfront mall), I probably would get the sauce on the side (it was abundant) as well as the pickles.  Maybe it's just me, but I've never had pickles served on a Mediterranean wrap before?!  All in all, quick, good and on the healthy side :) \n\nPS, I hear there is a humus trio that's not on the menu that's damn good!\n\nCheers
