My third visit b\/c I love the views of Camelback at sunset.  I love the zucchini florets and the pasta tastes homemade.  I would have probably given four stars, but the service was blase'.  The prices are a bit on the high side.  We opted for Chelsea's Kitchen for dessert b\/c it has been disappointing in the past but it looks like their adding desserts from Julia Baker.  WIll have to try next visit.
