My opinion of this chain keep dropping-seems like every time I visit one the wait is just really long,whether it be the wait to place your order (this is usually the case) or the wait to get your food.\nThis location of some reason, smells like farts and really bad. Inside and out. I had to leave to regain my appetite. My daughter kept making fart jokes because of it, which was amusing.\nSeems like the prices keep going up too,at all of these.\nI guess the two redeeming qualities was the service and the quality are still good.
