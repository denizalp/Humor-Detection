These guys just left my house and I am so beyond pleased with their service!!\n1. They were on time\n2. They have a flat rate which they honor\n3. They were very professional \n4. They were thorough!!!! They even cleaned one of the rooms 2x to get rid of pet stains and smells! \n5. They were helpful!! He gave me good advice for what to use to clean my couches and carpets from pet stains in between visits. He also showed me a really cool vacuum that I can purchase to use on my stairs. He didn't receive any commission off of the vacuum he was just excited about it, and I'm definitely gonna follow his advice! \n6. They were friendly! I did not feel uncomfortable having these 2 in my home. \nI highly recommend these guys! They are awesome!
