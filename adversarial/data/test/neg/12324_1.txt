I must say that The Buffet at the Bellagio was comparable to the Carnival World Buffet at the Rio, but a bit better with the elegance of fine dining. I felt like the Carnival Buffet was more of a cafeteria style type of place, versus the Bellagio. I had high expectations coming here, as my friend recommended me to this place just hours before the epic fail Rock and Roll Las Vegas Marathon and 1\/2 marathon.\n\nI basically had my fill of protein worth of prime rib, which was pretty awesome. The dessert was tempting, so I had some cheese cake. The seafood fare was good, although it could have been a bit more improved.  Loved the ambiance of the fine dining aspect of it. I tried not to over induldge on the food, but how can you not?
