02\/12\/2016\n\nAfter travelling 5-6 hours from Toronto to visit Montreal for the first time with my boyfriend this was our first food stop. The last thing we ate that day was Tim Hortons at around 8AM, right around the time we boarded the Megabus from the bus terminal back in Toronto. \n\nAmbience: When we arrived in Montreal, the weather was freezing and it began to snow.  We just stopped into the first restaurant we saw, which happened to be a few blocks away from our AirBnB. It was warm inside and not too busy.\n\nService: We were instantly greeted with French greetings. We were able to seat ourselves and we looked through the menus. After 5 minutes of being near a closed windows we were still cold and asked if we could move seats and had no objections from our waitress.\n\nFood: I ordered a small classic poutine called La Vladimir with a small burger ($12.65), while my boyfriend ordered a vegetarian burger with a side of fries and the RÃ©moulade sauce ($11.85). The wait for food wasn't too long. The burger was pretty good! The gravy for the poutine was savoury and the cheese curds were squeaky and great. I had a bite of the veggie burger and it was really good and my boyfriend's fries were also good with the sauce he got it with.\n\nPrice: With tip, the meal came up to around $30.
