While I'm not the biggest fan of bubble tea, this place has enough ambiance and variety to make it worth your visit.  I'm not the biggest fan of chewing a mouthful of tapioca balls, so I got the strawberry smoothie.  While it wasn't to die for, it was pretty satisfying on a fairly warm day.  They also have an incredibly selection of drinks, so you're sure to find something that will appeal to you\n\nThe restaurant has a good amount of seating.  I was there with seven others and we there was more than enough room for us.  Service was also lightning fast, I got my drink within a minute of ordering it.\n\nThe location isn't the greatest, it's hidden in the corner of a crowded shopping plaza, and there was actually a panhandler sitting right outside.  Still, I'd recommend if you're in the area and are craving something cool.
