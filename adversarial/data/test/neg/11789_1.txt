My friends and I decided to go at 10 pm on a Friday night. They were offering the late night menu, which didn't have much to choose from. I ordered a plate of nachos & a cocktail, and wasn't all that impressed.\n\nOur waiter promptly greeted us & took our order. We had to hunt him down after finishing our dinner to get our check. It should be noted that even though it was a Friday night, the restaurant wasn't all that busy. \n\nI'm not sure I'll return to this restaurant again. I don't think 10pm should be considered \"late night\" in Vegas, and I'm sure there are other places that offer more to choose from that time of night.
