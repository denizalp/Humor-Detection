I brought a bike my wife gifted me into this store with the intention of buying a few parts to swap out and asking the associates' opinion on an idea I had.  One of the associates walks up and immediately begins disparaging my bike!  He said \"I hope you didn't pay anything for that piece!\" when I showed him a hair-line fracture in the bike frame (the reason my wife was able to afford it in the first place - it's a Barracuda frame that cost upwards of $400 when brand new).  He said he wouldn't be caught dead on such a bike and even when I pointed out that a little TIG weld would make short work of the crack he scoffed - literally - and said the bike's a death-trap and my wife wasted her money.  He flat-out told me I'd been had.  I was crushed!!!  and furious with this guy just for his attitude and the way he said what he said.  He could have very politely told me about the risks inherent in welding a frame instead of just buying a new one, but no he scoffed at me and his whole attitude was hostile, condescending and rude.  I'll NEVER buy anything from this store no matter how good the prices are and no matter how excellent the service!  How you speak to your customers matters!  You may be an expert - but you should have the decency to give your so-called expert opinion in a tactful, respectful manner.
